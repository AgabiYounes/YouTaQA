His career as a playwright produced four classics, and his best short stories are held in high esteem by writers and critics.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Greatest short story writer who ever lived.&quot; [[Raymond Carver]] (in [[Rosamund Bartlett]]'s introduction to ''About Love and Other Stories'', XX); &quot;Quite probably. the best short-story writer ever.&quot; [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/classics/story/0,6000,1261403,00.html ''A Chekhov Lexicon''], by [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 3 July 2004.

Chekhov renounced the theatre after the reception of ''[[The Seagull]]'' in 1896, but the play was revived to acclaim in 1898 by [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]'s [[Moscow Art Theatre]], which subsequently also produced Chekhov's ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' and premiered his last two plays, ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' and ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]''. These four works present a challenge to the acting ensemble&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Actors climb up Chekhov like a mountain, roped together, sharing the glory if they ever make it to the summit&quot;.

Chekhov had at first written stories to earn money, but as his artistic ambition grew, he made formal innovations which have influenced the evolution of the modern short story.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chekhov is said to be the father of the modern short story&quot;. {{harvnb|Malcolm|2004|p=87}}; &quot;He brought something new into literature.&quot; [[James Joyce]], in Arthur Power, ''Conversations with James Joyce'', Usborne Publishing Ltd, 1974, {{ISBN|978-0-86000-006-8}}, 57; &quot;Tchehov's breach with the classical tradition is the most significant event in modern literature&quot;, [[John Middleton Murry]], in ''Athenaeum'', 8 April 1922, cited in Bartlett's introduction to ''About Love''.&lt;/ref&gt; He made no apologies for the difficulties this posed to readers, insisting that the role of an artist was to ask questions, not to answer them.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;You are right in demanding that an artist should take an intelligent attitude to his work, but you confuse two things: solving a problem and stating a problem correctly. It is only the second that is obligatory for the artist.&quot; Letter to Suvorin, 27 October 1888. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Anton Chekhov was born on the feast day of St. [[Anthony the Great]] (17 January [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]) 29 January 1860 in [[Taganrog, Russia|Taganrog]], a port on the [[Sea of Azov]] in southern [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. He was the third of six surviving children. His father, Pavel Yegorovich Chekhov, the son of a former [[serfdom|serf]] and his Ukrainian wife,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rayfield|1997|pp=3–4}}: Egor Mikhailovich Chekhov and Efrosinia Emelianovna&lt;/ref&gt; was from the village [[Olkhovatka, Olkhovatsky District, Voronezh Oblast|Olhovatka]] ([[Voronezh Governorate]]) and ran a grocery store. A director of the parish choir, devout [[Orthodox Christian]], and physically abusive father, Pavel Chekhov has been seen by some historians as the model for his son's many portraits of hypocrisy.&lt;ref name = &quot;Wood 78&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|2000|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chekhov's mother, Yevgeniya (Morozova), was an excellent storyteller who entertained the children with tales of her travels with her cloth-merchant father all over Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, XVII.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Simmons|1970|p=18}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taganrogcity.com/chekhov_taganrog.html Chekhov and Taganrog], Taganrog city website.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Our talents we got from our father,&quot; Chekhov remembered, &quot;but our soul from our mother.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Bio&quot;&gt;From the biographical sketch, adapted from a memoir by Chekhov's brother Mihail, which prefaces [[Constance Garnett]]'s translation of Chekhov's letters, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;
In adulthood, Chekhov criticised his brother [[Alexander Chekhov|Alexander's]] treatment of his wife and children by reminding him of Pavel's tyranny: &quot;Let me ask you to recall that it was [[despotism]] and lying that ruined your mother's youth. Despotism and lying so mutilated our childhood that it's sickening and frightening to think about it. Remember the horror and disgust we felt in those times when Father threw a tantrum at dinner over too much salt in the soup and called Mother a fool.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter to brother Alexander, 2 January 1889, in {{harvnb|Malcolm|2004|p=102}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Suvoring 1894&quot;&gt;Another insight into Chekhov's childhood came in a letter to his publisher and friend Alexei Suvorin: &quot;From my childhood I have believed in progress, and I could not help believing in it since the difference between the time when I used to be thrashed and when they gave up thrashing me was tremendous.&quot; Letter to Suvorin, 27 March 1894. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chekhov attended the [[Greek Church and Greek School in Taganrog|Greek School in Taganrog]] and the Taganrog ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' (since renamed the [[Chekhov Gymnasium]]), where he was held back for a year at fifteen for failing an examination in Ancient Greek.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bartlett 4-5&quot;&gt;Bartlett, 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; He sang at the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] monastery in Taganrog and in his father's choirs. In a letter of 1892, he used the word &quot;suffering&quot; to describe his childhood and recalled:

{{quote|text=When my brothers and I used to stand in the middle of the church and sing the trio &quot;May my prayer be exalted&quot;, or &quot;The Archangel's Voice&quot;, everyone looked at us with emotion and envied our parents, but we at that moment felt like little convicts.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref1&quot;&gt;Letter to I.L. Shcheglov, 9 March 1892. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1876, Chekhov's father was declared bankrupt after overextending his finances building a new house, having been cheated by a contractor named Mironov.{{sfn|Rayfield|1997|p=31}} To avoid [[debtor's prison]] he fled to Moscow, where his two eldest sons, [[Alexander Chekhov|Alexander]] and [[Nikolai Chekhov|Nikolay]], were attending university. The family lived in poverty in Moscow. Chekhov's mother was physically and emotionally broken by the experience.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to cousin Mihail, 10 May 1877. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Chekhov was left behind to sell the family's possessions and finish his education.

Chekhov remained in Taganrog for three more years, boarding with a man by the name of Selivanov who, like Lopakhin in ''The Cherry Orchard'', had bailed out the family for the price of their house.{{sfn|Malcolm|2004|p=25}} Chekhov had to pay for his own education, which he managed by private tutoring, catching and selling [[European Goldfinch|goldfinches]], and selling short sketches to the newspapers, among other jobs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Payne XX&quot;&gt;Payne, XX.&lt;/ref&gt; He sent every [[ruble]] he could spare to his family in Moscow, along with humorous letters to cheer them up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Payne XX&quot; /&gt; During this time, he read widely and analytically, including the works of [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], [[Ivan Turgenev|Turgenev]], [[Ivan Goncharov|Goncharov]], and [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]],&lt;ref name = &quot;Mihail 1876&quot;&gt;Letter to brother Mihail, 1 July 1876. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Simmons|1970|p=26}} and wrote a full-length comic drama, ''Fatherless'', which his brother Alexander dismissed as &quot;an inexcusable though innocent fabrication.&quot;{{sfn|Simmons|1970|p=33}} Chekhov also experienced a series of love affairs, one with the wife of a teacher.&lt;ref name=&quot;Payne XX&quot; /&gt;

In 1879, Chekhov completed his schooling and joined his family in Moscow, having gained admission to the medical school at [[I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University]].{{sfn|Rayfield|1997|p=69}}

===Early writings===
Chekhov now assumed responsibility for the whole family.{{sfn|Wood|2000|p=79}} To support them and to pay his tuition fees, he wrote daily short, humorous sketches and vignettes of contemporary Russian life, many under pseudonyms such as &quot;Antosha Chekhonte&quot; (Антоша Чехонте) and &quot;Man without a Spleen&quot; (Человек без селезенки). His prodigious output gradually earned him a reputation as a [[satire|satirical]] chronicler of Russian street life, and by 1882 he was writing for ''Oskolki'' (''[[Fragments (magazine)|Fragments]]''), owned by [[Nikolai Leykin]], one of the leading publishers of the time.{{sfn|Rayfield|1997|p=91}} Chekhov's tone at this stage was harsher than that familiar from his mature fiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obs&quot;&gt;&quot;There is in these miniatures an arresting potion of cruelty&amp;nbsp;... The wonderfully compassionate Chekhov was yet to mature.&quot; [http://books.guardian.co.uk/critics/reviews/0,,489891,00.html &quot;Vodka Miniatures, Belching and Angry Cats&quot;], [[George Steiner]]'s review of ''The Undiscovered Chekhov'' in ''The Observer'', 13 May 2001. Retrieved 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SS1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last=Willis|first=Louis| title=Chekhov's Crime Stories| url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2013/01/chekhov-wrote-crime-stories_27.html| work=Literary and Genre| publisher=SleuthSayers |location=Knoxville| date=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884, Chekhov qualified as a physician, which he considered his principal profession though he made little money from it and treated the poor free of charge.{{sfn|Malcolm|2004|p=26}}

In 1884 and 1885, Chekhov found himself coughing blood, and in 1886 the attacks worsened, but he would not admit his [[tuberculosis]] to his family or his friends.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bio&quot;/&gt; He confessed to Leykin, &quot;I am afraid to submit myself to be sounded by my colleagues.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter to N.A.Leykin, 6 April 1886. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt; He continued writing for weekly periodicals, earning enough money to move the family into progressively better accommodations.

Early in 1886 he was invited to write for one of the most popular papers in [[St. Petersburg]], ''[[Novoye Vremya (newspaper)|Novoye Vremya]]'' (''New Times''), owned and edited by the millionaire magnate [[Alexey Suvorin]], who paid a rate per line double Leykin's and allowed Chekhov three times the space.{{sfn|Rayfield|1997|p=128}} Suvorin was to become a lifelong friend, perhaps Chekhov's closest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rayfield|1997|pp=448–450|ps=They only ever fell out once, when Chekhov objected to the [[antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] attacks in ''New Times'' against [[Alfred Dreyfus|Dreyfus]] and [[Émile Zola|Zola]] in 1898.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Wood 79&quot;&gt;In many ways, the right-wing Suvorin, whom [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] later called &quot;The running dog of the [[Tsar|Tzar]]&quot; (Payne, XXXV), was Chekhov's opposite; &quot;Chekhov had to function like Suvorin's kidney, extracting the businessman's poisons.&quot;{{harvnb|Wood|2000|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before long, Chekhov was attracting literary as well as popular attention. The sixty-four-year-old [[Dmitry Grigorovich]], a celebrated Russian writer of the day, wrote to Chekhov after reading his short story &quot;The Huntsman&quot; that&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1944 ''The Huntsman''.]. Retrieved 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;You have ''real'' talent, a talent that places you in the front rank among writers in the new generation.&quot; He went on to advise Chekhov to slow down, write less, and concentrate on literary quality.

Chekhov replied that the letter had struck him &quot;like a thunderbolt&quot; and confessed, &quot;I have written my stories the way reporters write up their notes about fires – mechanically, half-consciously, caring nothing about either the reader or myself.&quot;{{sfn|Malcolm|2004|pp=32–33}}&quot; The admission may have done Chekhov a disservice, since early manuscripts reveal that he often wrote with extreme care, continually revising.&lt;ref name=&quot;Payne XXIV&quot;&gt;Payne, XXIV.&lt;/ref&gt; Grigorovich's advice nevertheless inspired a more serious, artistic ambition in the twenty-six-year-old. In 1888, with a little string-pulling by Grigorovich, the short story collection ''At Dusk'' (''V Sumerkakh'') won Chekhov the coveted [[Pushkin Prize]] &quot;for the best literary production distinguished by high artistic worth.&quot;{{sfn|Simmons|1970|p=160}}

===Turning points===
In 1887, exhausted from overwork and ill health, Chekhov took a trip to Ukraine, which reawakened him to the beauty of the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe|steppe]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Masha 1887&quot;&gt;&quot;There is a scent of the steppe and one hears the birds sing. I see my old friends the ravens flying over the steppe.&quot; Letter to sister Masha, 2 April 1887. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt; On his return, he began the novella-length short story &quot;[[The Steppe (novella)|''The Steppe'']],&quot; which he called &quot;something rather odd and much too original,&quot; and which was eventually published in ''[[Severny Vestnik]]'' (''The Northern Herald'').&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Grigorovich, 12 January 1888. Quoted by {{harvnb|Malcolm|2004|p=137}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a narrative that drifts with the thought processes of the characters, Chekhov evokes a [[chaise]] journey across the steppe through the eyes of a young boy sent to live away from home, and his companions, a priest and a merchant. &quot;The Steppe&quot; has been called a &quot;dictionary of Chekhov's poetics&quot;, and it represented a significant advance for Chekhov, exhibiting much of the quality of his mature fiction and winning him publication in a literary journal rather than a newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;'The Steppe,' as Michael Finke suggests, is 'a sort of dictionary of Chekhov's poetics,' a kind of sample case of the concealed literary weapons Chekhov would deploy in his work to come.&quot; {{harvnb|Malcolm|2004|p=147}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In autumn 1887, a theatre manager named Korsh commissioned Chekhov to write a play, the result being ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'', written in a fortnight and produced that November.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;From the biographical sketch, adapted from a memoir by Chekhov's brother Mikhail, which prefaces [[Constance Garnett]]'s translation of Chekhov's letters, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Chekhov found the experience &quot;sickening&quot; and painted a comic portrait of the chaotic production in a letter to his brother Alexander, the play was a hit and was praised, to Chekhov's bemusement, as a work of originality.&lt;ref name = &quot;Alexander 1887&quot;&gt;Letter to brother Alexander, 20 November 1887. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Although Chekhov did not fully realise it at the time, Chekhov's plays, such as ''The Seagull'' (written in 1895), ''Uncle Vanya'' (written in 1897), ''The Three Sisters'' (written in 1900), and ''The Cherry Orchard'' (written in 1903) served as a revolutionary backbone to what is common sense to the medium of acting to this day: an effort to recreate and express the &quot;realism&quot; of how people truly act and speak with each other and translating it to the stage to manifest the human condition as accurately as possible in hopes to make the audience reflect upon their own definition of what it means to be human.

This philosophy of approaching the art of acting has stood not only steadfast, but as the cornerstone of acting for much of the 20th century to this day. [[Mikhail Chekhov (writer)|Mikhail Chekhov]] considered ''Ivanov'' a key moment in his brother's intellectual development and literary career.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bio&quot;/&gt; From this period comes an observation of Chekhov's that has become known as ''[[Chekhov's gun]]'', a dramatic principle that requires that every element in a narrative be necessary and irreplaceable, and that everything else be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Chekhov's Art: A Stylistic Analysis|author=Petr Mikhaĭlovich Bit︠s︡illi|year=1983|publisher=Ardis|page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Literature 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Novelists, Playwrights, and Poets of All Time|author=Daniel S.

The death of Chekhov's brother Nikolay from tuberculosis in 1889 influenced ''A Dreary Story'', finished that September, about a man who confronts the end of a life that he realises has been without purpose.&lt;ref name = &quot;Dreary&quot;&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1883 &quot;A Dreary Story.&quot;].

===Sakhalin===
In 1890, Chekhov undertook an arduous journey by train, horse-drawn carriage, and river steamer to the Russian Far East and the ''[[katorga]]'', or penal colony, on [[Sakhalin Island]], north of Japan, where he spent three months interviewing thousands of convicts and settlers for a census. The letters Chekhov wrote during the two-and-a-half-month journey to Sakhalin are considered to be among his best.{{sfn|Malcolm|2004|p=129}} His remarks to his sister about [[Tomsk]] were to become notorious.{{sfn|Simmons|1970|p=223}}{{sfn|Rayfield|1997|p=224}}
[[File:Anton Chekhov museum Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky file 3.jpg|thumb|Anton Chekhov museum in [[Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky (town)|Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky]], Russia. It is the house where he stayed in Sakhalin during 1890]]
{{quote|Tomsk is a very dull town.

[[File:Anton Chekhov monument Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky file 1.jpg|thumb|''Anton Chekhov Monument'' in [[Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky (town)|Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky]], Russia]]
Chekhov witnessed much on Sakhalin that shocked and angered him, including floggings, embezzlement of supplies, and [[sexual slavery|forced prostitution]] of women. He wrote,  &quot;There were times I felt that I saw before me the extreme limits of man's degradation.&quot;{{sfn|Wood|2000|p=85}}{{sfn|Rayfield|1997|p=230}} He was particularly moved by the plight of the children living in the penal colony with their parents. For example:

{{quote|On the [[Amur River|Amur]] steamer going to Sakhalin, there was a convict who had murdered his wife and wore fetters on his legs. His daughter, a little girl of six, was with him. I noticed wherever the convict moved the little girl scrambled after him, holding on to his fetters. At night the child slept with the convicts and soldiers all in a heap together.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to A.F.Koni, 16 January 1891.

Chekhov later concluded that charity was not the answer, but that the government had a duty to finance humane treatment of the convicts. His findings were published in 1893 and 1894 as ''Ostrov Sakhalin'' (''[[Sakhalin Island (Chekhov)|The Island of Sakhalin]]''), a work of social science, not literature.{{sfn|Malcolm|2004|p=125}}&lt;ref name = &quot;Simmons 229&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Simmons|1970|p=229}}: Such is the general critical view of the work, but Simmons calls it a &quot;valuable and intensely human document.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Chekhov found literary expression for the &quot;Hell of Sakhalin&quot; in his long short story &quot;[[s:The Murder|The Murder]],&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/13419 &quot;The Murder&quot;].

===Melikhovo===
In 1892, Chekhov bought the small country estate of [[Melikhovo]], about forty miles south of Moscow, where he lived with his family until 1899. &quot;It's nice to be a lord,&quot; he joked to his friend Ivan Leontyev (who wrote humorous pieces under the pseudonym Shcheglov),&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref1&quot;/&gt; but he took his responsibilities as a landlord seriously and soon made himself useful to the local peasants. As well as organising relief for victims of the [[famine]] and [[cholera]] outbreaks of 1892, he went on to build three schools, a fire station, and a clinic, and to donate his medical services to peasants for miles around, despite frequent recurrences of his tuberculosis.&lt;ref name = &quot;Wood 78&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Malcolm|2004|p=26}}&lt;ref name = &quot;Payne XXXI&quot;&gt;Payne, XXXI.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mikhail Chekhov, a member of the household at Melikhovo, described the extent of his brother's medical commitments:

{{quote|From the first day that Chekhov moved to Melikhovo, the sick began flocking to him from twenty miles around. They came on foot or were brought in carts, and often he was fetched to patients at a distance. Sometimes from early in the morning peasant women and children were standing before his door waiting.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;From the biographical sketch, adapted from a memoir by Chekhov's brother Mikhail, which prefaces Constance Garnett's translation of Chekhov's letters, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Chekhov's expenditure on drugs was considerable, but the greatest cost was making journeys of several hours to visit the sick, which reduced his time for writing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;From the biographical sketch, adapted from a memoir by Chekhov's brother Mihail, which prefaces Constance Garnett's translation of Chekhov's letters, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chekhov's work as a doctor enriched his writing by bringing him into intimate contact with all sections of Russian society: for example, he witnessed at first hand the peasants' unhealthy and cramped living conditions, which he recalled in his short story &quot;Peasants&quot;. Chekhov visited the upper classes as well, recording in his notebook: &quot;Aristocrats? The same ugly bodies and physical uncleanliness, the same toothless old age and disgusting death, as with market-women.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;note&quot;&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/12494 ''Note-Book''.]. Retrieved 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, Chekhov began writing his play ''The Seagull'' in a lodge he had built in the orchard at Melikhovo. In the two years since he had moved to the estate, he had refurbished the house, taken up agriculture and horticulture, tended the orchard and the pond, and planted many trees, which, according to Mikhail, he &quot;looked after&amp;nbsp;... as though they were his children. Like Colonel Vershinin in his ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'', as he looked at them he dreamed of what they would be like in three or four hundred years.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Bio&quot;/&gt;

The first night of ''The Seagull'', at the [[Alexandrinsky Theatre]] in St. Petersburg on 17 October 1896, was a fiasco, as the play was booed by the audience, stinging Chekhov into renouncing the theatre.{{sfn|Rayfield|1997|pp=394–398}} But the play so impressed the theatre director [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]] that he convinced his colleague [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] to direct a new production for the innovative [[Moscow Art Theatre]] in 1898.&lt;ref name = &quot;Ben&quot;&gt;Benedetti, ''Stanislavski: An Introduction'', 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Stanislavski's attention to psychological realism and ensemble playing coaxed the buried subtleties from the text, and restored Chekhov's interest in playwriting.&lt;ref&gt;Chekhov and the Art Theatre, in Stanislavski's words, were united in a common desire &quot;to achieve artistic simplicity and truth on the stage.&quot; Allen, 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The Art Theatre commissioned more plays from Chekhov and the following year staged ''Uncle Vanya'', which Chekhov had completed in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rayfield|1997|pp=390–391|ps=Rayfield draws from his critical study ''Chekhov's &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; and the &quot;Wood Demon&quot;'' (1995), which anatomised the evolution of the ''Wood Demon'' into ''Uncle Vanya''—&quot;one of Chekhov's most furtive achievements.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last decades of his life he became an [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tabachnikova|first=Olga|title=Anton Chekhov Through the Eyes of Russian Thinkers: Vasilii Rozanov, Dmitrii Merezhkovskii and Lev Shestov|year=2010|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=978-1-84331-841-5|page=26|quote=For Rozanov, Chekhov represents a concluding stage of classical Russian literature at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, caused by the fading of the thousand-year-old Christian tradition that had sustained much of this literature.

===Yalta===
In March 1897, Chekhov suffered a major haemorrhage of the lungs while on a visit to Moscow.  With great difficulty he was persuaded to enter a clinic, where the doctors diagnosed tuberculosis on the upper part of his lungs and ordered a change in his manner of life.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Suvorin, 1 April 1897. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

After his father's death in 1898, Chekhov bought a plot of land on the outskirts of [[Yalta]] and built a [[White Dacha|villa]], into which he moved with his mother and sister the following year. Though he planted trees and flowers, kept dogs and tame cranes, and received guests such as [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Maxim Gorky]], Chekhov was always relieved to leave his &quot;hot [[Siberia]]&quot; for Moscow or travels abroad. He vowed to move to Taganrog as soon as a water supply was installed there.&lt;ref&gt;Olga Knipper, &quot;Memoir&quot;, in Benedetti, ''Dear Writer, Dear Actress'', 37, 270.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Bartlett 2&quot;&gt;Bartlett, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In Yalta he completed two more plays for the Art Theatre, composing with greater difficulty than in the days when he &quot;wrote serenely, the way I eat pancakes now&quot;. He took a year each over ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' and ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]''.{{sfn|Malcolm|2004|pp=170–171}}

On 25 May 1901, Chekhov married [[Olga Knipper]] quietly, owing to his horror of weddings. She was a former protégée and sometime lover of Nemirovich-Danchenko whom he had first met at rehearsals for ''The Seagull''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I have a horror of weddings, the congratulations and the champagne, standing around, glass in hand with an endless grin on your face.&quot; Letter to Olga Knipper, 19 April 1901.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Benedetti 125&quot;&gt;Benedetti, ''Dear Writer, Dear Actress'', 125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rayfield|1997|p=500|ps=&quot;Olga's relations with Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko were more than professional.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to that point, Chekhov, known as &quot;Russia's most elusive literary bachelor,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Pitcher in ''Chekhov's Leading Lady'', quoted in {{harvnb|Malcolm|2004|p=59}}.&lt;/ref&gt; had preferred passing liaisons and visits to brothels over commitment.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chekhov had the temperament of a philanderer. Sexually, he preferred brothels or swift liaisons.&quot;{{harvnb|Wood|2000|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had once written to Suvorin:

{{quote|By all means I will be married if you wish it. But on these conditions: everything must be as it has been hitherto — that is, she must live in Moscow while I live in the country, and I will come and see her&amp;nbsp;... I promise to be an excellent husband, but give me a wife who, like the moon, won't appear in my sky every day.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Suvorin, 23 March 1895. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The letter proved prophetic of Chekhov's marital arrangements with Olga: he lived largely at Yalta, she in Moscow, pursuing her acting career. In 1902, Olga suffered a miscarriage; and [[Donald Rayfield]] has offered evidence, based on the couple's letters, that conception may have occurred when Chekhov and Olga were apart, although Russian scholars have rejected that claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rayfield|1997|pp=556–557|ps=Rayfield also tentatively suggests, drawing on obstetric clues, that Olga suffered an [[ectopic pregnancy]] rather than a miscarriage.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Simmons Benedetti&quot;&gt;There was certainly tension between the couple after the miscarriage, though {{harvnb|Simmons|1970|p=569}}, and Benedetti, ''Dear Writer, Dear Actress'', 241, put this down to Chekhov's mother and sister blaming the miscarriage on Olga's late-night socialising with her actor friends.&lt;/ref&gt; The literary legacy of this long-distance marriage is a correspondence that preserves gems of theatre history, including shared complaints about Stanislavski's directing methods and Chekhov's advice to Olga about performing in his plays.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti, ''Dear Writer, Dear Actress: The Love Letters of Olga Knipper and Anton Chekhov''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Yalta, Chekhov wrote one of his most famous stories,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eastoftheweb.com/short-stories/UBooks/LadyWith.shtml|title=Lady with lapdog|last=Chekhov|first=Anton|website=Short Stories}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[The Lady with the Dog (short story)|The Lady with the Dog]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rosamund, Bartlett|title=The House That Chekhov Built |journal=London Evening Standard|date= 2 February 2010|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also translated from the Russian as &quot;Lady with Lapdog&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Yael. &quot;The Presentation of the Unconscious in Chekhov's Lady With Lapdog.&quot; ''Modern Language Review'' 86.1 (1991): 126–130.

Neither expects anything lasting from the encounter.  Unexpectedly though, they gradually fall deeply in love and end up risking scandal and the security of their family lives.  The story masterfully captures their feelings for each other, the inner transformation undergone by the disillusioned male protagonist as a result of falling deeply in love, and their inability to resolve the matter by either letting go of their families or of each other.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Overview: 'The Lady with the Dog'.&quot; ''Characters in 20th-Century Literature.''

===Death===
By May 1904, Chekhov was terminally ill with [[tuberculosis]]. Mikhail Chekhov recalled that &quot;everyone who saw him secretly thought the end was not far off, but the nearer [he] was to the end, the less he seemed to realise it.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Bio&quot;/&gt; On 3 June, he set off with Olga for the German spa town of [[Badenweiler]] in the [[Black Forest]], from where he wrote outwardly jovial letters to his sister Masha, describing the food and surroundings, and assuring her and his mother that he was getting better. In his last letter, he complained about the way German women dressed.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to sister Masha, 28 June 1904. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chekhov's death has become one of &quot;the great set pieces of literary history,&quot;{{sfn|Malcolm|2004|p=62}} retold, embroidered, and fictionalised many times since, notably in the short story &quot;Errand&quot; by [[Raymond Carver]]. In 1908, Olga wrote this account of her husband's last moments:

{{quote|Anton sat up unusually straight and said loudly and clearly (although he knew almost no German): ''Ich sterbe'' (&quot;I'm dying&quot;). The doctor calmed him, took a syringe, gave him an injection of [[camphor]], and ordered champagne. Anton took a full glass, examined it, smiled at me and said: &quot;It's a long time since I drank champagne.&quot; He drained it and lay quietly on his left side, and I just had time to run to him and lean across the bed and call to him, but he had stopped breathing and was sleeping peacefully as a child&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Olga Knipper, ''Memoir'', in Benedetti, ''Dear Writer, Dear Actress'', 284.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Chekhov's body was transported to Moscow in a refrigerated railway car meant for [[oyster]]s, a detail that offended [[Maxim Gorky|Gorky]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Banality revenged itself upon him by a nasty prank, for it saw that his corpse, the corpse of a poet, was put into a railway truck 'For the Conveyance of Oysters'.&quot; Maxim Gorky in [http://www.eldritchpress.org/ac/gorky.htm ''Reminiscences of Anton Chekhov''.].

==Legacy==
A few months before he died, Chekhov told the writer [[Ivan Bunin]] that he thought people might go on reading his writings for seven years. &quot;Why seven?&quot; asked Bunin. &quot;Well, seven and a half,&quot; Chekhov replied. &quot;That's not bad. I've got six years to live.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Payne, XXXVI.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chekhov-bios1-1024.jpg|thumb|Chekhov biographies]]
Chekhov's posthumous reputation greatly exceeded his expectations. The ovations for the play ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'' in the year of his death served to demonstrate the Russian public's acclaim for the writer, which placed him second in literary celebrity only to [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], who outlived him by six years. Tolstoy was an early admirer of Chekhov's short stories and had a series that he deemed &quot;first quality&quot; and &quot;second quality&quot; bound into a book. In the first category were: ''Children'', ''The Chorus Girl'', ''A Play'', ''Home'', ''Misery'', ''The Runaway'', ''In Court'', ''Vanka'', ''Ladies'', ''A Malefactor'', ''The Boys'', ''Darkness'', ''Sleepy'', ''The Helpmate'', and ''[[The Darling (Chekhov)|The Darling]]&quot;''; in the second: ''A Transgression'', ''Sorrow'', ''The Witch'', ''Verochka'', ''In a Strange Land'', ''The Cook's Wedding'', ''A Tedious Business'', ''An Upheaval'', ''Oh! The Public!'', ''The Mask'', ''A Woman's Luck'', ''Nerves'', ''The Wedding'', ''A Defenceless Creature'', and ''Peasant Wives.''{{sfn|Simmons|1970|p=595}}  If anyone doubted the gloom and miserable poverty of Russia in the 1880's, the Russian Anarchist Kropotkin responded, &quot;read only Chekhov's novels!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In Chekhov's lifetime, British and Irish critics generally did not find his work pleasing; [[E. J. Dillon]] thought &quot;the effect on the reader of Chekhov's tales was repulsion at the gallery of human waste represented by his fickle, spineless, drifting people&quot; and [[R. E. C. Long]] said &quot;Chekhov's characters were repugnant, and that Chekhov revelled in stripping the last rags of dignity from the human soul&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meister|first=Charles W.|year=1953|title=Chekhov's Reception in England and America|journal=American Slavic and East European Review|volume=12|issue=1|pages=109–121|jstor=3004259|doi=10.2307/3004259}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, Chekhov was reappraised. [[Constance Garnett]]'s translations won him an English-language readership and the admiration of writers such as [[James Joyce]], [[Virginia Woolf]], and [[Katherine Mansfield]], whose story &quot;The Child Who Was Tired&quot; is similar to Chekhov's &quot;Sleepy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William H. New|title=Reading Mansfield and Metaphors of Reform|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|year=1999|isbn= 978-0-7735-1791-2|pages=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian critic [[D. S. Mirsky]], who lived in England, explained Chekhov's popularity in that country by his &quot;unusually complete rejection of what we may call the heroic values.&quot;{{sfn|Wood|2000|p=77}} In Russia itself, Chekhov's drama fell out of fashion after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|revolution]], but it was later incorporated into the Soviet canon. The character of Lopakhin, for example, was reinvented as a hero of the new order, rising from a modest background so as eventually to possess the gentry's estates.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, 88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Danchenko&quot;&gt;&quot;They won't allow a play which is seen to lament the lost estates of the gentry.&quot; Letter of [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]], quoted by Anatoly Smeliansky in &quot;Chekhov at the Moscow Art Theatre&quot;, from ''The Cambridge Companion to Chekhov'', 31–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first non-Russians to praise Chekhov's plays was [[George Bernard Shaw]], who subtitled his ''[[Heartbreak House]]'' &quot;A Fantasia in the Russian Manner on English Themes,&quot; and pointed out similarities between the predicament of the British landed class and that of their Russian counterparts as depicted by Chekhov: &quot;the same nice people, the same utter futility.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anna Obraztsova in &quot;Bernard Shaw's Dialogue with Chekhov&quot;, from Miles, 43–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, Chekhov's reputation began its rise slightly later, partly through the influence of [[Stanislavski's system]] of acting, with its notion of [[subtext]]: &quot;Chekhov often expressed his thought not in speeches,&quot; wrote Stanislavski, &quot;but in pauses or between the lines or in replies consisting of a single word&amp;nbsp;... the characters often feel and think things not expressed in the lines they speak.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Elizabeth (ed), ''Stanislavski's Legacy'', Theatre Arts Books, 1987, {{ISBN|978-0-87830-127-0}}, 81, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Eßlin&quot;&gt;&quot;It was Chekhov who first deliberately wrote dialogue in which the mainstream of emotional action ran underneath the surface. It was he who articulated the notion that human beings hardly ever speak in explicit terms among each other about their deepest emotions, that the great, tragic, climactic moments are often happening beneath outwardly trivial conversation.&quot; [[Martin Esslin]], from ''Text and Subtext in Shavian Drama'', in ''1922: Shaw and the last Hundred Years'', ed. Bernard. F. Dukore, Penn State Press, 1994, {{ISBN|978-0-271-01324-4}}, 200.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]], in particular, developed the subtextual approach to drama, influencing generations of [[Theater in the United States|American playwrights]], screenwriters, and actors, including [[Clifford Odets]], [[Elia Kazan]] and, in particular, [[Lee Strasberg]]. In turn, Strasberg's [[Actors Studio]] and the [[Method acting|&quot;Method&quot; acting]] approach influenced many actors, including [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Robert De Niro]], though by then the Chekhov tradition may have been distorted by a preoccupation with realism.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Lee Strasberg became in my opinion a victim of the traditional idea of Chekhovian theatre&amp;nbsp;... [he left] no room for Chekhov's imagery.&quot; Georgii Tostonogov on Strasberg's production of ''Three Sisters'' in ''The Drama Review'' (winter 1968), quoted by Styan, 121.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, the playwright [[Tennessee Williams]] adapted ''The Seagull'' as ''[[The Notebook of Trigorin]]''. One of Anton's nephews, [[Michael Chekhov]] would also contribute heavily to modern theatre, particularly through his unique acting methods which developed Stanislavski's ideas further.

Despite Chekhov's reputation as a playwright, [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]] asserts that his short stories represent the greater achievement.&lt;ref name = &quot;Boyd&quot;&gt;&quot;The plays lack the seamless authority of the fiction: there are great characters, wonderful scenes, tremendous passages, moments of acute melancholy and sagacity, but the parts appear greater than the whole.&quot; [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/classics/story/0,6000,1261403,00.html ''A Chekhov Lexicon,''] by [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]], ''The Guardian'', 3 July 2004. Retrieved 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raymond Carver]], who wrote the short story &quot;Errand&quot; about Chekhov's death, believed that Chekhov was the greatest of all short story writers:

{{quote|Chekhov's stories are as wonderful (and necessary) now as when they first appeared.

[[Ernest Hemingway]], another writer influenced by Chekhov, was more grudging: &quot;Chekhov wrote about six good stories.

For the writer [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]], Chekhov's historical accomplishment was to abandon what [[William Gerhardie]] called the &quot;event plot&quot; for something more &quot;blurred, interrupted, mauled or otherwise tampered with by life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;For the first time in literature the fluidity and randomness of life was made the form of the fiction.

Virginia Woolf mused on the unique quality of a Chekhov story in ''The Common Reader'' (1925):

{{quote|But is it the end, we ask? We have rather the feeling that we have overrun our signals; or it is as if a tune had stopped short without the expected chords to close it.

In so doing we raise the question of our own fitness as readers. Where the tune is familiar and the end emphatic—lovers united, villains discomfited, intrigues exposed—as it is in most [[Victorian literature|Victorian fiction]], we can scarcely go wrong, but where the tune is unfamiliar and the end a note of interrogation or merely the information that they went on talking, as it is in Tchekov, we need a very daring and alert sense of literature to make us hear the tune, and in particular those last notes which complete the harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, Virginia, ''The Common Reader: First Series, Annotated Edition'', Harvest/HBJ Book, 2002, {{ISBN|0-15-602778-X}}, 172.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While a Professor of Comparative Literature at Princeton University, Michael Goldman presented his view on defining the elusive quality of Chekhov's comedies stating: &quot;Having learned that Chekhov is comic&amp;nbsp;... Chekhov is comic in a very special, paradoxical way. His plays depend, as comedy does, on the vitality of the actors to make pleasurable what would otherwise be painfully awkward – inappropriate speeches, missed connections, ''faux pas'', stumbles, childishness – but as part of a deeper pathos; the stumbles are not pratfalls but an energized, graceful dissolution of purpose.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Goldman, ''The Actor's Freedom: Towards a Theory of Drama'', p72.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Twigg]], the chief editor and publisher of the Canadian book review magazine ''[[B.C. BookWorld|BC Bookworld]] wrote,
{{quote|One can argue Anton Chekhov is the second-most popular writer on the planet. Only Shakespeare outranks Chekhov in terms of movie adaptations of their work, according to the movie database IMDb.&amp;nbsp;... We generally know less about Chekhov than we know about mysterious Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Memories of Chekhov: Accounts of the Writer from His Family, Friends and Contemporaries.

Chekhov has also influenced the work of Japanese playwrights including [[Shimizu Kunio]], [[Yōji Sakate]], and [[Ai Nagai]]. Critics have noted similarities in how Chekhov and Shimizu use a mixture of light humour as well as an intense depictions of longing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rimer|first1=J.|title=Japanese Theatre and the International Stage|publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV|location=Leiden, The Netherlands|isbn=978-90-04-12011-2|pages=299–311|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakate adapted several of Chekhov's plays and transformed them in the general style of ''[[nō]]''.&lt;ref name=Clayton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clayton|first1=J. Douglas|title=Adapting Chekhov: The Text and Its Mutations|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-50969-5|pages=269–270|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nagai also adapted Chekhov's plays, including [[Three Sisters (play)|''Three Sisters'']], and transformed his dramatic style into Nagai's style of satirical realism while emphasising the social issues depicted on the play.&lt;ref name=Clayton/&gt;

Chekhov's works have been adapted for the screen, including [[Sidney Lumet]]'s ''[[The Sea Gull|Sea Gull]]'' and [[Louis Malle]]'s ''[[Vanya on 42nd Street]]''. [[Laurence Olivier]]'s final effort as a film director was a 1970 adaption of ''[[Three Sisters (1970 film)|Three Sisters]]'' in which he also played a supporting role. His work has also served as inspiration or been referenced in numerous films. In [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]'s 1975 film [[The Mirror (1975 film)|''The Mirror'']], characters discuss his short story &quot;[[Ward No. 6]]&quot;. Woody Allen has been influenced by Chekhov and reference to his works are present in many of his films including ''[[Love and Death]]'' (1975), ''[[Interiors]]'' (1978) and ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'' (1986). Plays by Chekhov are also referenced in [[François Truffaut]]'s 1980 drama film ''[[The Last Metro]]'', which is set in a theatre. ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'' has a role in the comedy film ''[[Henry's Crime]]'' (2011). A portion of a stage production of ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' appears in the 2014 drama film ''[[Still Alice]]''.
