The Hebrew term '''''Abaddon''''' ({{lang-he|אֲבַדּוֹן}} ''Avaddon'', meaning &quot;doom&quot;), and its Greek equivalent '''''Apollyon''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀπολλύων}}, ''Apollýōn'') appear in the [[Bible]] as both a place of destruction and an [[angel]] of the abyss. In the [[Hebrew Bible]], ''abaddon'' is used with reference to a bottomless pit, often appearing alongside the place שְׁאוֹל (''[[Sheol]]''), meaning the realm of the dead.

In the New Testament [[Book of Revelation]], an angel called Abaddon is described as the king of an army of [[locust]]s; his name is first transcribed in Greek (Revelation 9:11—&quot;whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, The Angel of Death&quot;) as {{lang|grc|Ἀβαδδὼν}}, and then translated (&quot;which in Greek means the Destroyer&quot;, {{lang|grc|Ἀπολλύων}}, ''Apollyon''). The Latin [[Vulgate]] and the [[Douay Rheims Bible]] have additional notes (not present in the Greek text), &quot;in Latin Exterminans&quot;, ''exterminans'' being the Latin word for &quot;destroyer&quot;.

==Etymology==
According to the [[Brown Driver Briggs]] lexicon, the Hebrew ''abaddon'' ({{lang-he|אבדון}}; ''’ăḇaddōn'') is an [[intensive word form|intensive]] form of the [[Semitic root]] and verb stem ''’ăḇāḏ'' ({{lang|he|אָבַד}})&lt;ref&gt;In modern and liturgical Hebrew, the Hebrew letter ''beit'' in some situations is pronounced like an English &quot;v&quot;, and so ''abad'' and ''abaddon'', as they would usually be transliterated, would be pronounced as ''avad'' and ''avadon''. The consistent transliteration of ''[[beth (letter)|beth]]'' as ''b'' simply follows modern scholarly norms in sources discussing biblical Hebrew, and does not imply a position on the pronunciation of the letter and ''b'' or ''v'' in biblical times.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;perish&quot; (transitive &quot;destroy&quot;), which occurs 184 times in the Hebrew Bible. The [[Septuagint]], an early Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, renders &quot;Abaddon&quot; as &quot;ἀ απώλεια&quot;, while the Greek ''Apollyon'' is the [[active participle]] of ''apollymi'' ([[:wikt:ἀπόλλυμι|ἀπόλλυμι]]), &quot;to destroy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=a%29po%2Flluwn&amp;la=greek |title=Greek Word Study Tool |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==

===Hebrew Bible===
The term ''abaddon'' appears six times in the [[Masoretic text]] of the Hebrew Bible; ''abaddon'' means destruction or &quot;place of destruction&quot;, or the realm of the dead, and is accompanied by [[Sheol]]. 
* [[Book of Job|Job]] 26:6: the grave (Sheol) is naked before Him, and destruction (Abaddon) has no covering.
* Job 28:22: destruction (Abaddon) and death say.
* Job 31:12: it is a fire that consumes to destruction (Abaddon).
* [[Book of Psalms|Psalm]] 88:11: Shall thy loving kindness be declared in the grave (Sheol) or thy faithfulness in destruction (Abaddon)?
* [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 15:11: Hell (Sheol) and Destruction (Abaddon) are before the LORD, how much more the hearts of the children of men?
* Proverbs 27:20: Hell (Sheol) and Destruction (Abaddon) are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied. ([[Authorised King James Version|KJV]], 1611)

===Second Temple era texts===
The text of the [[Thanksgiving Hymns]]—which was found in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]—tells of &quot;the Sheol of Abaddon&quot; and of the &quot;torrents of [[Belial]] [that] burst into Abaddon&quot;. The ''[[Pseudo-Philo|Biblical Antiquities]]'' (misattributed to [[Philo]]) mentions Abaddon as a place (destruction) rather than an individual. Abaddon is also one of the compartments of [[Gehenna]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Metzger|first1=Bruce M.|last2=Coogan|first2=Michael David|title=The Oxford Companion to the Bible|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780195046458|url-access=registration|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199743916|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780195046458/page/3 3]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By extension, it can mean an underworld abode of lost souls, or [[Gehenna]].

===Rabbinical literature===
In some legends, Abaddon is identified as a realm where the [[Damnation|damned]] lie in fire and snow, one of the places in [[Gehenna]] that [[Moses]] visited.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ginzberg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj206.htm |title=Chapter IV: Moses in Egypt |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
===New Testament===
The [[Scriptures#Christianity|Christian scriptures]] contain the first known depiction of ''Abaddon'' as an individual entity instead of a place.

In [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 9:11, Abaddon is described as &quot;Destroyer&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;biblegateway&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%209:11&amp;version=NIV |title=Revelation 9:11 NIV – They had as king over them the angel of |publisher=Bible Gateway |accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the angel of the [[Abyss (religion)|abyss]],&lt;ref name=&quot;biblegateway&quot;/&gt; and as the king of a plague of locusts resembling horses with crowned human faces, women's hair, lions' teeth, wings, iron breast-plates, and a tail with a scorpion's stinger that torments for five months anyone who does not have the seal of God on their foreheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%209:7-10&amp;version=NIV |title=Revelation 9:7–10 NIV – The locusts looked like horses prepared |publisher=Bible Gateway |accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbolism of Revelation 9:11 leaves the identity of Abaddon open to interpretation. Protestant commentator [[Matthew Henry]] (1708) believed Abaddon to be the [[Antichrist]],&lt;ref name=&quot;henry&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/commentaries/comm_view.cfm?AuthorID%3D4%26contentID%3D1868%26commInfo%3D5%26topic%3DRevelation|title=Archived copy|url-status=unfit|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607035557/http://www.blueletterbible.org/commentaries/comm_view.cfm?AuthorID=4&amp;contentID=1868&amp;commInfo=5&amp;topic=Revelation|archivedate=7 June 2015|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the [[Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Commentary]] (1871) and [[Henry H. Halley]] (1922) identified the angel as Satan.&lt;ref name=&quot;jfb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/Comm/jfb/Rev/Rev_009.cfm=Revelation |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102101859/http://www.blueletterbible.org/Comm/jfb/Rev/Rev_009.cfm%3DRevelation |archivedate=2 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;halley&quot;&gt;Halley (1922) ''Halley's Bible Handbook with the New International Version'', p936.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the [[Methodist]] publication ''The Interpreter's Bible'' states: &quot;Abaddon, however, is an angel not of Satan but of God, performing his work of destruction at God's bidding&quot;, citing the context at Revelation chapter 20, verses 1 through 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keck|first1=Leander E.|title=The New Interpreter's Bible: Hebrews – Revelation (Volume 12)|date=1998|publisher=Abingdon Press|location=Nashville, Tenn.|isbn=0687278252|edition=[Nachdr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2016}} [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] also cite Revelation 20:1-3 where the angel having &quot;the key of the abyss&quot; is actually shown to be a representative of God, concluding that &quot;Abaddon&quot; is another name for Jesus after his resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200000308#h=1:0-3:401|title=Apollyon—Watchtower Online Library|publisher=Watch Tower Society|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gnostic texts===
In the 3rd century [[Acts of Thomas]], Abaddon is the name of a demon, or the [[devil]] himself.

Abaddon is given particularly important roles in two sources, a [[homily]] entitled &quot;The Enthronement of Abbaton&quot; by pseudo-[[Timothy of Alexandria]], and the [[Resurrection of Jesus Christ (by Bartholomew)|Apocalypse of Bartholomew]].&lt;ref name=Aziz&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atiya|first1=Aziz S.|title=The Coptic Encyclopedia|date=1991|publisher=Macmillan [u.a.]|location=New York|isbn=0-02-897025-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2016}} In the homily by Timothy, Abaddon was first named ''Muriel'', and had been given the task by [[God]] of collecting the earth that would be used in the creation of [[Adam]]. Upon completion of this task, the angel was appointed as a guardian. Everyone, including the angels, demons, and corporeal entities feared him. Abbaton was promised that any who venerated him in life could be saved. Abaddon is also said to have a prominent role in the [[Last Judgement]], as the one who will take the souls to the [[Valley of Josaphat]].&lt;ref name=Aziz/&gt; He is described in the Apocalypse of Bartholomew as being present in the [[Tomb of Jesus]] at the moment of his [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pseudepigrapha.com/LostBooks/bartholomew.htm |title=Gospel of Bartholomew |publisher=Pseudepigrapha.com |accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
