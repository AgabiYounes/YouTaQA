'''Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.''' ('''AMD''') is an American [[multinational company|multinational]] [[semiconductor industry|semiconductor company]] based in [[Santa Clara County, California]] that develops [[computer processor]]s and related technologies for business and [[consumer markets]]. While initially it manufactured its own processors, the company later outsourced its manufacturing, a practice known as going [[Fabless manufacturing|fabless]], after [[GlobalFoundries]] was spun off in 2009. AMD's main products include [[microprocessor]]s, [[motherboard]] [[chipset]]s, [[embedded processor]]s and [[Graphics processing unit|graphics processors]] for [[server (computing)|server]]s, [[workstation]]s, personal computers and [[embedded system]] applications.

AMD is the second-largest supplier and only significant rival to [[Intel]] in the market for [[x86]]-based microprocessors. Since acquiring [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] in 2006, AMD and its competitor [[Nvidia]] have maintained a [[duopoly]] in the discrete [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU) market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lilly|first=Paul|title=Nvidia Leads in Discrete Desktop GPU Market Share, AMD in Notebook Graphics|url=http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/nvidia_leads_discrete_desktop_gpu_market_share_amd_notebook_graphics|work=Maximum PC|accessdate=February 18, 2012|date=May 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First twelve years ===
Advanced Micro Devices was formally incorporated on May 1, 1969, by [[Jerry Sanders (businessman)|Jerry Sanders]], along with seven of his colleagues from [[Fairchild Semiconductor]].&lt;ref&gt;The other founding members were [[Edwin Turney|Ed Turney]], John Carey, Sven Simonsen, [[Jack Gifford (businessman)|Jack Gifford]] and three members from Gifford's team: Frank Botte, Jim Giles, and Larry Stenger.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodengen, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Sanders, an [[electrical engineer]] who was the director of marketing at Fairchild, had, like many Fairchild executives, grown frustrated with the increasing lack of support, opportunity, and flexibility within the company, and decided to leave to start his own [[semiconductor]] company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/pdfs/fairkid.pdf &quot;Fairchild's Offspring&quot;]. ''[[Business Week]]''. August 25, 1997. p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The previous year [[Robert Noyce]], who had developed the first silicon [[integrated circuit]] in 1959 at Fairchild,&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, Scott.

In September 1969, AMD moved from its temporary location in [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]] to [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]], California.&lt;ref&gt;Rodengen, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; To immediately secure a customer base, AMD initially became a [[second source]] supplier of microchips designed by Fairchild and [[National Semiconductor]].&lt;ref name=directory&gt;Pederson, Jay P.

=== Technology exchange agreement with Intel ===
Intel had introduced the first [[x86]] microprocessors in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez, Julio and Maria P. Canton. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jtKc0k5BWA8C&amp;pg=PA95 ''Software Solutions for Engineers and Scientists'']. 
CRC Press, 2007. p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, [[IBM]] created its [[IBM Personal Computer|PC]], and wanted Intel's x86 processors, but only under the condition that Intel also provide a second-source manufacturer for its patented x86 microprocessors.&lt;ref name=singer /&gt; Intel and AMD entered into a 10-year technology exchange agreement, first signed in October 1981&lt;ref name=swaine /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/8086/MANUF-AMD.html AMD 8086 microprocessor family], ''CPU World''. (Accessed November 3, 2014.)&lt;/ref&gt; and formally executed in February 1982.&lt;ref name=sec1996 /&gt; The terms of the agreement were that each company could acquire the right to become a second-source manufacturer of semiconductor products developed by the other; that is, each party could &quot;earn&quot; the right to manufacture and sell a product developed by the other, if agreed to, by exchanging the manufacturing rights to a product of equivalent technical complexity. The technical information and licenses needed to make and sell a part would be exchanged for a royalty to the developing company.&lt;ref name=justia1994 /&gt; The 1982 agreement also extended the 1976 AMD–Intel cross-licensing agreement through 1995.&lt;ref name=justia1994 /&gt;&lt;ref name=sec1996 /&gt; The agreement included the right to invoke arbitration of disagreements, and after five years the right of either party to end the agreement with one year's notice.&lt;ref name=justia1994 /&gt; The main result of the 1982 agreement was that AMD became a second-source manufacturer of Intel's x86 microprocessors and related chips, and Intel provided AMD with database tapes for its [[8086]], [[80186]], and [[80286]] chips.&lt;ref name=sec1996 /&gt;

Beginning in 1982, AMD began volume-producing second-source Intel-licensed 8086, 8088, 80186, and 80188 processors, and by 1984 its own [[Am286]] clone of Intel's 80286 processor, for the rapidly growing market of IBM PCs and [[IBM clone]]s.&lt;ref name=singer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ziberg, Christian. [http://www.tgdaily.com/trendwatch-features/39628-timeline-how-amd-changed-over-the-past-39-years &quot;Timeline: How AMD changed over the past 39 years&quot;]. ''TGDaily''. October 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It also continued its successful concentration on proprietary [[bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]] chips.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Advanced_Micro_Devices_Inc.aspx ''International Directory of Company Histories'']. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, it introduced INT.STD.1000, the highest manufacturing quality standard in the industry.&lt;ref name=svh /&gt;&lt;ref name=HittC26 /&gt;

The company continued to spend greatly on research and development,&lt;ref&gt;Rodengen, pp. 73, 78–80.&lt;/ref&gt; and in addition to other breakthrough products, created the world's first 512K [[EPROM]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Rodengen, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; That year AMD was listed in the book ''The 100 Best Companies to Work for in America'',&lt;ref name=HittC26 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levering, Robert; Moskowitz, Milton; Katz, Michael. ''The 100 Best Companies to Work for in America''. Addison-Wesley, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; and based on 1984 income it made the [[Fortune 500|''Fortune'' 500]] list for the first time in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500_archive/full/1985/401.html 1985 Full list]. [[Fortune 500|''Fortune'' 500]]. ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' archive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodengen, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-1985, however, the microchip market experienced a severe downturn, mainly due to long-term aggressive trade practices ([[dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]]) from Japan, but also due to a crowded and non-innovative chip market in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Rodengen, pp. 85–87.&lt;/ref&gt; AMD rode out the mid-1980s crisis by aggressively innovating and modernizing,&lt;ref&gt;Rodengen, pp. 86, 90, 95, 99.&lt;/ref&gt; devising the Liberty Chip program of designing and manufacturing one new chip or chip set per week for 52 weeks in [[fiscal year]] 1986,&lt;ref name=HittC26 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodengen, pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; and by heavily lobbying the U.S. government until sanctions and restrictions were put in place to prevent predatory Japanese pricing.&lt;ref&gt;Rodengen, pp. 87–88, 97–99.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time period, AMD withdrew from the [[DRAM]] market,&lt;ref&gt;Rodengen, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the same time made some headway into the [[CMOS]] market, which it had lagged in entering, having focused instead on bipolar chips.&lt;ref&gt;Rodengen, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

AMD had some success in the mid-1980s with the AMD7910 and AMD7911 &quot;World Chip&quot; [[frequency-shift keying|FSK]] modem, one of the first multi-standard devices that covered both Bell and [[ITU-T|CCITT]] tones at up to 1200 baud half duplex or 300/300 full duplex.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-Yo_AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22amd%22+%22world+chip%22&amp;dq=%22amd%22+%22world+chip%22 ''Computer Design, Volume 25, Issues 13–22''].

==== IBM PC and the x86 architecture ====
{{Main|Am286|Am386|Am486|Am5x86}}

In February 1982, AMD signed a contract with [[Intel Corporation|Intel]], becoming a licensed second-source manufacturer of [[Intel 8086|8086]] and [[Intel 8088|8088]] processors. [[IBM]] wanted to use the Intel 8088 in its [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]], but IBM's policy at the time was to require at least two sources for its chips. AMD later produced the [[Am286]] under the same arrangement. In 1984, Intel, in order to shore up its advantage in the marketplace, internally decided to no longer cooperate with AMD in supplying product information, and delayed and eventually refused to convey the technical details of the [[Intel 80386]] to AMD.&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz, p. 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, AMD invoked arbitration over the issue, and Intel reacted by cancelling the 1982 technological-exchange agreement altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Rodengen, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; After three years of testimony, AMD eventually won in arbitration in 1992, but Intel disputed this decision. Another long legal dispute followed, ending in 1994 when the [[Supreme Court of California]] sided with the arbitrator and AMD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Greg Tang |date=February 13, 2011 |title=Intel and the x86 Architecture: A Legal Perspective |publisher=[[JOLT Digest]] |url=http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/patent/intel-and-the-x86-architecture-a-legal-perspective-2 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607113904/http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/patent/intel-and-the-x86-architecture-a-legal-perspective-2 |archivedate=June 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/4th/9/362.html|title=Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. v. Intel Corp. (1994)|work=Justia Law|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Intel also countersued AMD, renegotiating AMD's right to use derivatives of Intel's [[microcode]] for its cloned processors.&lt;ref&gt;Rodengen, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; In the face of uncertainty during the legal dispute, AMD was forced to develop [[clean room design|clean-room design]]ed versions of Intel code for its x386 and x486 processors, the former long after Intel had released its own x386 in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Rodengen, pp. 116–199.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1991, AMD released the [[Am386]], its clone of the Intel 386 processor.&lt;ref name=HittC26 /&gt; By October of the same year it had sold one million units.&lt;ref name=HittC26 /&gt;

In 1993, AMD introduced the first of the [[Am486]] family of processors,&lt;ref name=history /&gt; which proved popular with a large number of [[original equipment manufacturer]]s, including [[Compaq]], which signed an exclusive agreement using the Am486.&lt;ref name=directory /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JaQFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT499|title=Strategic Management: Concepts and Cases|publisher=|accessdate=August 6, 2015|isbn=9781111796372|last1=Hitt|first1=Michael|last2=Duane Ireland|first2=R.|last3=Hoskisson|first3=Robert|date=March 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpu-collection.de/?l0=co&amp;l1=AMD&amp;l2=486%20DX|title=cpu-collection.de &gt;&gt; AMD &gt;&gt; 486 DX|publisher=|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Am486-based processor, the [[Am5x86]], was released in November 1995 and continued AMD's success as a fast, cost-effective processor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eV1_LjW3pTkC&amp;pg=PA132|title=Upgrading and Repairing PCs|publisher=|accessdate=August 6, 2015|isbn=9780789727459|last1=Mueller|first1=Scott|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YTgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA44-IA4|title=InfoWorld|publisher=|accessdate=August 6, 2015|date=November 6, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in an agreement effective 1996, AMD received the rights to the microcode in Intel's x386 and x486 processor families, but not the rights to the microcode in the following generations of processors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=i3MLYUjRWisC&amp;pg=SA4-PA36]. pp. 4-36–4-38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zz4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA3|title=InfoWorld|publisher=|accessdate=August 6, 2015|date=January 8, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AMD's first in-house x86 processor was the [[AMD K5|K5]], which was launched in 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;CPU-INFO K5&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpu-info.com/index2.php?mainid=html/cpu/amdk5.php |title=AMD K5 |accessdate=July 11, 2007 |publisher=CPU-INFO.COM |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818021000/http://www.cpu-info.com/index2.php?mainid=html%2Fcpu%2Famdk5.php |archivedate=August 18, 2007 |url-status = dead|df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;K&quot; was a reference to [[Kryptonite]]. (In comic books, the only substance which could harm [[Superman]] was Kryptonite. This is a reference to Intel's hegemony over the market, i.e., an anthropomorphization of them as Superman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forbes-Chip-Names&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Arik | last=Hesseldahl | title=Why Cool Chip Code Names Die | date=July 6, 2000 |work=Forbes Inc | url =https://www.forbes.com/2000/07/06/mu2.html | pages = | accessdate = July 14, 2007 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;) The numeral &quot;5&quot; refers to the fifth generation of x86 processors; rival Intel had previously introduced its line of fifth-generation x86 processors as [[Pentium]] because the U.S. Trademark and Patent Office had ruled that mere numbers could not be trademarked.&lt;ref name=newyorker&gt;{{cite news |last=Colapinto |first=John |title=Famous names |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/03/111003fa_fact_colapinto|magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |date=3 October 2011 |pages=38–43 |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, AMD purchased [[NexGen]], specifically for the rights to their Nx series of x86-compatible processors. AMD gave the NexGen design team their own building, left them alone, and gave them time and money to rework the Nx686. The result was the [[AMD K6|K6]] processor, introduced in 1997. Although the K6 was based on [[Socket 7]], variants such as K6-3/450 were faster than Intel's [[Pentium II]] (sixth-generation processor).

The K7 was AMD's seventh-generation x86 processor, making its debut on June 23, 1999, under the brand name [[Athlon]]. Unlike previous AMD processors, it could not be used on the same motherboards as Intel's, due to licensing issues surrounding Intel's [[Slot 1]] connector, and instead used a [[Slot A]] connector, referenced to the [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] processor bus.  The [[Duron]] was a lower-cost and limited version of the Athlon (64KB instead of 256KB L2 cache) in a 462-pin socketed PGA (socket A) or soldered directly onto the motherboard. [[Sempron]] was released as a lower-cost Athlon XP, replacing Duron in the [[socket A]] PGA era. It has since been migrated upward to all new sockets, up to [[AM3]].

On October 9, 2001, the [[Athlon XP]] was released. On February 10, 2003, the Athlon XP with 512KB L2 Cache was released.&lt;ref name=&quot;The AMD Athlon XP Processor with 512KB L2 Cache&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Jack | last=Huynh | title=The AMD Athlon XP Processor with 512KB L2 Cache | date=February 10, 2003 | publisher=AMD | url =https://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/white_papers_and_tech_docs/26485A_AthlXPwp_2-20.pdf | work=amd.com | pages = | accessdate = October 2, 2007 | language = | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071026182602/http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/white_papers_and_tech_docs/26485A_AthlXPwp_2-20.pdf| archivedate= October 26, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Athlon 64, Opteron and Phenom ====
{{Main|Athlon 64|Opteron|Phenom (processor)}}
The K8 was a major revision of the K7 architecture, released in 2003, with the most notable features being the addition of a [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] extension to the x86 instruction set (called [[x86-64]], AMD64, or x64), the incorporation of an on-chip memory controller, and the implementation of an extremely high performance point-to-point interconnect called [[HyperTransport]], as part of the [[Direct Connect Architecture]]. The technology was initially launched as the [[Opteron]] server-oriented processor on April 22, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Wasson. &quot;[http://www.techreport.com/reviews/2003q3/workstation/index.x?pg=1 Workstation platforms compared] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127144618/http://techreport.com/reviews/2003q3/workstation/index.x?pg=1 |date=November 27, 2006 }}&quot;, ''techreport.com'', The Tech Report, LLC., September 15, 2003, Retrieved on July 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter it was incorporated into a product for desktop PCs, branded [[Athlon 64]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott Wasson. &quot;[http://www.techreport.com/reviews/2003q3/athlon64/index.x?pg=1 AMD's Athlon 64 processor] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127141205/http://techreport.com/reviews/2003q3/athlon64/index.x?pg=1 |date=November 27, 2006 }}&quot;, ''techreport.com'', The Tech Report, LLC., September 23, 2003.

Retrieved on July 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2007, AMD abandoned the string &quot;64&quot; in its dual-core desktop product branding, becoming Athlon X2, downplaying the significance of [[x86-64|64-bit computing]] in its processors. Further updates involved improvements to the microarchitecture, and a shift of target market from mainstream desktop systems to value dual-core desktop systems. In 2008, AMD started to release dual-core Sempron processors exclusively in China, branded as the Sempron 2000 series, with lower HyperTransport speed and smaller L2 cache. Thus AMD completed its dual-core product portfolio for each market segment.

Retrieved September 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Multi-core|quad-core]] versions, with all cores on a single die. AMD released a new platform, codenamed &quot;[[AMD Spider|Spider]]&quot;, which utilized the new Phenom processor, as well as an R770 GPU and a 790 GX/FX chipset from the [[AMD 700 chipset series]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hothardware&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hothardware.com/Articles/AMD_Spider_Platform__Phenom_790FX_RV670/ | title=AMD Spider Platform - Phenom, 790FX, RV670 | date=2007-11-19 | author=Marco Chiappetta | publisher=HotHardware}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, AMD built the Spider at [[65nm]], which was uncompetitive with Intel's smaller and more power-efficient [[45nm]].

In January 2009, AMD released a new processor line dubbed [[Phenom II]], a refresh of the original [[AMD Phenom|Phenom]] built using the 45&amp;nbsp;nm process.&lt;ref name=&quot;anandtech3512&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/2721 |title=The Phenom II X4 810 &amp; X3 720: AMD Gets DDR3 But Doesn't Need It |publisher=AnandTech |date=2009-02-09 |accessdate=2012-01-23|first=Anand Lal |last=Shimpi }}&lt;/ref&gt; AMD's new platform, codenamed &quot;[[AMD Dragon|Dragon]]&quot;, utilized the new Phenom II processor, and an [[ATI (brand)|ATI]] R770 GPU from the [[Radeon R700|R700]] GPU family, as well as a 790 GX/FX chipset from the [[AMD 700 chipset series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/AMD-Dragon-Phenom-II,6781.html |title=AMD Unleashes the Dragon |first=Kevin |last=Parrish |work=[[Tom's Hardware]] |date=2009-01-08 |accessdate=2014-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Phenom II came in dual-core, triple-core and quad-core variants, all using the same die, with cores disabled for the triple-core and dual-core versions. The Phenom II resolved issues that the original Phenom had, including a low clock speed, a small L3 cache and a [[Cool'n'Quiet]] bug that decreased performance. The Phenom II cost less but was not performance-competitive with Intel's mid-to-high-range [[Core 2]] Quads. The Phenom II also enhanced its predecessor's memory controller, allowing it to use [[DDR3]] in a new native socket [[AM3]], while maintaining backwards compatibility with [[AM2+]], the socket used for the Phenom, and allowing the use of the [[DDR2 SDRAM|DDR2]] memory that was used with the platform.

In April 2010, AMD released a new Phenom II hexa-core (6-core) processor codenamed &quot;[[Phenom II#Thuban|Thuban]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walrath|first1=Josh|title=AMD Phenom II X6 1090T 6-core Thuban Processor Review|url=https://www.pcper.com/reviews/Processors/AMD-Phenom-II-X6-1090T-6-core-Thuban-Processor-Review|accessdate=11 July 2017|publisher=PC Perspective|date=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a totally new die based on the hexa-core &quot;Istanbul&quot; [[Opteron]] processor. It included AMD's &quot;turbo core&quot; technology, which allows the processor to automatically switch from 6 cores to 3 faster cores when more pure speed is needed.

Magny Cours is focused on performance while the Lisbon part is focused on high performance per watt. Magny Cours is an MCM ([[multi-chip module]]) with two hexa-core &quot;Istanbul&quot; [[Opteron]] parts. This will use a new G34 socket for dual and quad socket processors and thus will be marketed as Opteron 61xx series processors. Lisbon uses C32 socket certified for dual socket use or single socket use only and thus will be marketed as Opteron 41xx processors. Both will be built on a [[45 nm]] SOI process.

==== Fusion becomes the AMD APU ====
{{main|AMD APU|l1=|AMD mobile platform}}
Following AMD's 2006 acquisition of Canadian graphics company [[ATI Technologies]], an initiative codenamed ''[[AMD Fusion|Fusion]]'' was announced to integrate a [[CPU]] and [[GPU]] together on some of AMD's microprocessors, including a built in [[PCI Express]] link to accommodate separate PCI Express peripherals, eliminating the [[Northbridge (computing)|northbridge]] chip from the motherboard. The initiative intended to move some of the processing originally done on the CPU (e.g. [[floating-point unit]] operations) to the GPU, which is better optimized for some calculations. The Fusion was later renamed to the [[AMD APU]] (Accelerated Processing Unit).&lt;ref name=&quot;APU&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=https://arstechnica.com/business/news/2010/02/amd-reveals-fusion-cpugpu-to-challege-intel-in-laptops.ars| title=AMD reveals Fusion CPU+GPU, to challenge Intel in laptops| first=Jon| last=Stokes| website=Ars Technica| date=February 8, 2010| accessdate=February 9, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100210011231/http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2010/02/amd-reveals-fusion-cpugpu-to-challege-intel-in-laptops.ars| archivedate= February 10, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CPU part of the processor was based on the [[Phenom II]] &quot;Deneb&quot; processor. AMD suffered an unexpected decrease in revenue based on production problems for the Llano.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burt, eWeek. &quot;[http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Desktops-and-Notebooks/AMD-Cuts-Q3-Forecast-Due-to-Chip-Manufacturing-Problems-581901/ AMD Cuts Q3 Forecast Due to Chip Manufacturing Problems]&quot;. September 28, 2011. Retrieved October 7, 2011. More AMD APUs for laptops running Windows 7 and Windows 8 OS are being used commonly. These include AMD's price-point APUs, the E1 and E2, and their mainstream competitors with Intel's core i-series: The Vision A- series, the A standing for accelerated. These range from the lower-performance A4 chipset to the A6, A8, and A10. These all incorporate Next-generation Radeon graphics cards, with the A4 utilizing the base Radeon HD chip and the rest using a Radeon R4 graphics card, with the exception of the highest-model A10 (A10-7300) which uses an R6 graphics card.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulldozer was AMD's microarchitecture codename for server and desktop [[AMD FX]] processors first released on October 12, 2011. This [[List of AMD CPU microarchitectures#x86 microarchitectures|family 15h microarchitecture]] is the successor to the [[AMD 10h|family 10h (K10)]] microarchitecture design. Bulldozer was a clean-sheet design, not a development of earlier processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.techpowerup.com/138328/Bulldozer-50-Faster-than-Core-i7-and-Phenom-II.html |title=Bulldozer 50% Faster than Core i7 and Phenom II |publisher=techPowerUp |date= |accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core was specifically aimed at 10–125&amp;nbsp;[[watt|W]] [[Thermal Design Power|TDP]] computing products. AMD claimed dramatic performance-per-watt efficiency improvements in [[high-performance computing]] (HPC) applications with Bulldozer cores. While hopes were high that Bulldozer would bring AMD to be performance-competitive with Intel once more, most benchmarks were disappointing. In some cases the new Bulldozer products were slower than the K10 models they were built to replace.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/100583-analyzing-bulldozers-scaling-single-thread-performance |title=Analyzing Bulldozer: Why AMD's chip is so disappointing |publisher=www.extremetech.com |date= |accessdate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/241812/lab_tested_amds_bulldozer_packs_plenty_of_cores_but_not_enough_power.html |title=Lab Tested: AMD's Bulldozer Packs Plenty Of Cores, But Not Enough Power |publisher=Pc world |date=October 12, 2011 |accessdate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/10/can-amd-survive-bulldozers-disappointing-debut/ |title=Can AMD survive Bulldozer's disappointing debut? |publisher=ars technica |date=October 20, 2011 |accessdate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Zen based CPUs and APUs ====
{{Main|Zen (microarchitecture)|Zen+|Zen 2}}

[[Zen (microarchitecture)|Zen]] is a new architecture for x86-64 based [[Ryzen|Ryzen series]] CPUs and APUs, introduced in 2017 by AMD and built from the ground up by a team led by [[Jim Keller (engineer)|Jim Keller]], beginning with his arrival in 2012, and [[Tape-out|taping out]] before his departure in September 2015. One of AMD's primary goals with Zen was an [[Instructions per cycle|IPC]] increase of at least 40%, however in February 2017 AMD announced that they had actually achieved a 52% increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/11143/amd-launch-ryzen-52-more-ipc-eight-cores-for-under-330-preorder-today-on-sale-march-2nd|title=AMD Launches Ryzen: 52% More IPC, Eight Cores for Under $330, Pre-order Today, On Sale March 2nd|last=Cutress|first=Ian|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2019|reason=Jim Keller's role or the dates of these events aren't in the source.}} Processors made on the Zen architecture are built on the 14&amp;nbsp;nm FinFET node and have a renewed focus on single-core performance and [[Heterogeneous System Architecture|HSA]] compatibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wccftech.com/breaking-amds-gen-x86-high-performance-core-code-named-zen-debut-k12/|title=AMD's Next Gen x86 High Performance Core is Ryzen – Will Debut Alongside K12 in 2016|work=WCCFtech|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous processors from AMD were either built in the 32&amp;nbsp;nm process (&quot;Bulldozer&quot; and &quot;Piledriver&quot; CPUs) or the 28&amp;nbsp;nm process (&quot;Steamroller&quot; and &quot;Excavator&quot; APUs). Because of this, Zen is much more energy efficient. The Zen architecture is the first to encompass CPUs and APUs from AMD built for a single socket (Socket AM4). Also new for this architecture is the implementation of [[simultaneous multithreading]] (SMT) technology, something Intel has had for years on some of their processors with their proprietary [[Hyper-threading|Hyper-Threading]] implementation of SMT. This is a departure from the &quot;[[Bulldozer (microarchitecture)#CMT|Clustered MultiThreading]]&quot; design introduced with the Bulldozer architecture. Zen also has support for [[DDR4 SDRAM|DDR4]] memory. AMD released the Zen-based high-end Ryzen 7 &quot;Summit Ridge&quot; series CPUs on March 2, 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amd.com/en/ryzen|title=Ryzen {{!}} AMD|website=www.amd.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; mid-range Ryzen 5 series CPUs on April 11, 2017, and entry level Ryzen 3 series CPUs on July 27, 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;zen_ars&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|title=AMD confirms Ryzen and Vega launch windows|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/amd-confirms-ryzen-and-vega-launch-windows/|accessdate=4 Feb 2017|magazine=PC Gamer|date=1 Feb 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMD later released the [[Epyc]] line of Zen derived server processors for 1P and 2P systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kampman|first1=Jeff|title=AMD's Naples datacenter CPUs will make an Epyc splash|url=https://techreport.com/news/31916/amd-naples-datacenter-cpus-will-make-an-epyc-splash|accessdate=16 May 2017|publisher=Tech Report|date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, AMD released Zen based APUs as Ryzen Mobile, incorporating [[Graphics Core Next#GCN 5th Generation (Vega)|Vega]] graphics cores.&lt;ref name='RM_AT'&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cutress|first1=Ian|title=Ryzen Mobile is Launched|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/11964/ryzen-mobile-is-launched-amd-apus-for-laptops-with-vega-and-updated-zen|accessdate=26 October 2017|publisher=Anandtech|date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018 AMD has announced their new lineup plans, with Ryzen 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-2-set-march-2018-launch-12nm-support-higher-core-memory-clock-speeds/|title=AMD Ryzen 2 Set For March 2018 Launch On 12nm - To Support Higher Core &amp; Memory Clock Speeds|first=Khalid|last=Moammer|date=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMD launched CPUs with the [[Zen+|12nm Zen+]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2nd Generation AMD Ryzen™ Desktop Processors Deliver Best-in-Class Compute Performance and Even Faster Gaming Framerates than Previous Generation |url=http://ir.amd.com/news-releases/news-release-details/2nd-generation-amd-ryzentm-desktop-processors-deliver-best-class |website=Advanced Micro Devices |accessdate=11 February 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; microarchitecture in April 2018, following up with the [[Zen 2|7nm Zen 2]] microarchitecture in June 2019, including an update to the Epyc line with new processors using the Zen 2 microarchitecture in August 2019.

==== Radeon within AMD ====
{{Main|Radeon}}
In 2008, the ATI division of AMD released the [[TeraScale (microarchitecture)|TeraScale microarchitecture]] implementing a [[unified shader model]]. This design replaced the previous fixed-function hardware of previous graphics cards with multipurpose, programmable shaders. Initially released as part of the GPU for the [[Xbox 360]], this technology would go on to be used in Radeon branded HD 2000 parts. Three generations of TeraScale would be designed and used in parts from 2008-2014.

==== Combined GPU and CPU divisions ====
In a 2009 restructuring, AMD merged the CPU and GPU divisions to support the companies APU's which fused both graphics and general purpose processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duncan|first1=Geoff|title=AMD RESTRUCTURES TO COMBINE GRAPHICS AND CHIP UNITS|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/amd-restructures-to-combine-graphics-and-chip-units/|accessdate=10 July 2017|publisher=Digital Trends|date=7 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Musil|first1=Steven|title=AMD reorg merges microprocessor, graphics units|url=https://www.cnet.com/au/news/amd-reorg-merges-microprocessor-graphics-units/|accessdate=10 July 2017|publisher=CNet|date=7 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, AMD released the successor to TeraScale, [[Graphics Core Next|Graphics Core Next (GCN)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Ryan|title=AMD's Graphics Core Next Preview|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/4455/amds-graphics-core-next-preview-amd-architects-for-compute|accessdate=11 July 2017|publisher=Anandtech|date=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new microarchitecture emphasized [[GPGPU]] compute capability in addition to graphics processing, with a particular aim of supporting heterogeneous computing on AMD's APUs. GCN's [[reduced instruction set computer|reduced instruction set]] [[Instruction set architecture|ISA]] allowed for significantly increased compute capability over TeraScale's [[very long instruction word]] ISA. Since GCN's introduction with the [[Radeon HD 7000 Series|HD 7970]], five generations of the GCN architecture have been produced from 2008 through at least 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Ryan|title=AMD Radeon HD 7970 Review|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/5261/amd-radeon-hd-7970-review|accessdate=11 July 2017|publisher=Anandtech|date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Radeon Technologies Group ====
{{Main|Radeon Technologies Group}}
In September 2015, AMD separated the graphics technology division of the company into an independent internal unit called the '''Radeon Technologies Group''' (RTG) headed by [[Raja Koduri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Higginbotham|first1=Stacey|title=AMD splits out its graphics chips into the Radeon Technology Group|url=http://fortune.com/2015/09/09/amd-graphics-chip-split/|accessdate=10 July 2017|publisher=Fortune|date=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gave the graphics division of AMD autonomy in product design and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Takahashi|first1=Dean|title=AMD celebrates a year of its revamped Radeon Technologies Group|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/09/14/amd-celebrates-a-year-of-its-revamped-radeon-technologies-group/|accessdate=10 July 2017|work=VentureBeat|date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Moorehead|first1=Patrich|title=Advanced Micro Devices's Head Of Radeon Technologies Group, Raja Koduri, Talks About Their Future|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2015/11/12/advanced-micro-devicess-head-of-radeon-technologies-group-raja-koduri-talks-about-the-future/|accessdate=10 July 2017|magazine=Forbes|date=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RTG then went on to create and release the [[Graphics Core Next#Polaris|Polaris]] and [[Graphics Core Next#Vega|Vega]] microarchitectures released in 2016 and 2017, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Ryan|title=The AMD Radeon RX 480 Preview|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/10446/the-amd-radeon-rx-480-preview|accessdate=10 July 2017|publisher=Anandtech|date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Ryan|title=The AMD Vega GPU Architecture Preview|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/11002/the-amd-vega-gpu-architecture-teaser|accessdate=10 July 2017|publisher=Anandtech|date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular the Vega, or 5th generation [[Graphics Core Next|GCN]], microarchitecture includes a number of major revisions to improve performance and compute capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Ryan|title=The AMD Vega GPU Architecture Preview|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/11002/the-amd-vega-gpu-architecture-teaser|accessdate=11 July 2017|publisher=Anandtech|date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Ryan|last2=Oh|first2=Nate|title=The AMD RX Vega 64 &amp; RX Vega 56 Review: Vega Burning Bright|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/11717/the-amd-radeon-rx-vega-64-and-56-review|accessdate=16 August 2017|publisher=Anandtech.com|date=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2020, AMD develops the second generation [[RDNA (microarchitecture)|RDNA]] graphics architecture with the aim to take on the NVIDIA RTX graphics products performance leadership.

=== Semi-custom and game console products ===
In 2012, AMD's then CEO [[Rory Read]] began a program to offer semi-custom designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shimpi|first1=Anand Lal|title=Understand AMD's Roadmap &amp; New Direction|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/5503/understanding-amds-roadmap-new-direction|accessdate=10 July 2017|publisher=Anandtech|date=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shimpi|first1=Anand Lal|title=Understanding AMD's Semi-Custom Strategy|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/7281/understanding-amd-semi-custom-strategy|accessdate=10 July 2017|publisher=Anandtech|date=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than AMD simply designing and offering a single product, potential customers could work with AMD to design a custom chip based on AMD's intellectual property. Customers pay a non-recurring engineering fee for design and development, and a purchase price for the resulting semi-custom products. In particular, AMD noted their unique position of offering both x86 and graphics intellectual property. These semi-custom designs would have design wins as the APUs in the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] and the subsequent [[PlayStation 4 Pro]], [[Xbox One S]], and [[Xbox One X]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Anandtech&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;arstechnica.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=XboxOneMay2013Anandtechcomparison&gt;{{cite news |title=The Xbox One: Hardware Analysis &amp; Comparison to PlayStation 4 |first=Anand Lal|last=Shimpi |publisher=[[AnandTech]]|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/6972/xbox-one-hardware-compared-to-playstation-4/2 |date=May 21, 2013 |accessdate=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Financially, these semi-custom products would represent a majority of the company's revenue in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Howse|first1=Brett|title=AMD Announces Q3 2016 Financial Results|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/10780/amd-announces-q3-2016-results|accessdate=10 July 2017|publisher=Anandtech|date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Team|first1=Trefis|title=AMD's Embedded and Semi-Custom Revenues To Generate High Growth In The Next 5 Years?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2016/09/14/amds-embedded-and-semi-custom-revenues-to-generate-high-growth-in-the-next-5-years|accessdate=10 July 2017|magazine=Forbes|date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017, AMD and Intel announced that Intel would market a product combining in a single package an Intel Core CPU, a semi-custom AMD Radeon GPU, and [[High Bandwidth Memory#HBM 2|HBM2]] memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kampman|first1=Jeff|title=Intel brings a Core CPU and Radeon GPU together on one package|url=https://techreport.com/news/32792/intel-brings-a-core-cpu-and-radeon-gpu-together-on-one-package|accessdate=7 November 2017|publisher=Tech Report|date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other hardware ===

==== AMD motherboard chipsets ====
{{See also|Comparison of AMD chipsets}}
Before the launch of [[Athlon 64]] processors in 2003, AMD designed [[chipset]]s for their processors spanning the [[AMD K6|K6]] and [[AMD K7|K7]] processor generations. The chipsets include the AMD-640, AMD-751 and the AMD-761 chipsets. The situation changed in 2003 with the release of [[Athlon 64]] processors, and AMD chose not to further design its own chipsets for its desktop processors while opening the desktop platform to allow other firms to design chipsets. This was the &quot;[[Open Platform Management Architecture]]&quot; with [[ATI Technologies|ATI]], [[VIA Technologies|VIA]] and [[Silicon Integrated Systems|SiS]] developing their own chipset for [[Athlon 64]] processors and later [[Athlon 64 X2]] and [[Athlon 64 FX]] processors, including the [[AMD Quad FX platform|Quad FX platform]] chipset from Nvidia.

The initiative went further with the release of [[Opteron]] server processors as AMD stopped the design of server chipsets in 2004 after releasing the AMD-8111 chipset, and again opened the server platform for firms to develop chipsets for Opteron processors. As of today, [[Nvidia]] and [[Broadcom]] are the sole designing firms of server chipsets for Opteron processors.

As the company completed the acquisition of ATI Technologies in 2006, the firm gained the ATI design team for chipsets which previously designed the [[Xpress 200|Radeon Xpress 200]] and the [[Xpress 3200|Radeon Xpress 3200]] chipsets. AMD then renamed the chipsets for AMD processors under AMD branding (for instance, the CrossFire Xpress 3200 chipset was renamed as [[AMD 580 chipset series|AMD 580X CrossFire chipset]]). In February 2007, AMD announced the first AMD-branded chipset since 2004 with the release of the AMD [[AMD 690 chipset series|690G]] chipset (previously under the development codename ''RS690''), targeted at mainstream [[Integrated Graphics Processor|IGP]] computing. It was the industry's first to implement a [[HDMI]] 1.2 port on motherboards, shipping for more than a million units. While ATI had aimed at releasing an Intel IGP chipset, the plan was scrapped and the inventories of [[AMD 690 chipset series#Radeon Xpress 1250|Radeon Xpress 1250]] (codenamed ''RS600'', sold under ATI brand) was sold to two OEMs, Abit and ASRock. Although AMD stated the firm would still produce Intel chipsets, Intel had not granted the license of {{nowrap|1333 MHz}} FSB to ATI.

On November 15, 2007, AMD announced a new chipset series portfolio, the [[AMD 700 chipset series|AMD 7-Series chipsets]], covering from enthusiast multi-graphics segment to value IGP segment, to replace the [[AMD 580 chipset series|AMD 480/570/580 chipsets]] and [[AMD 690 chipset series|AMD 690 series chipsets]], marking AMD's first enthusiast multi-graphics chipset.  Discrete graphics chipsets were launched on November 15, 2007, as part of the codenamed ''Spider'' desktop platform, and IGP chipsets were launched at a later time in spring 2008 as part of the codenamed ''Cartwheel'' platform.

AMD returned to the server chipsets market with the [[AMD 800 chipset series|AMD 800S series server chipsets]]. It includes support for up to six [[Serial ATA#SATA Revision 3.0 (SATA 6Gb/s)|SATA 6.0 Gbit/s]] ports, the C6 power state, which is featured in [[AMD Fusion|Fusion]] processors and [[Advanced Host Controller Interface|AHCI]] 1.2 with SATA [[port multiplier#FIS(Frame Information Structure)–based switching|FIS–based switching]] support. This is a chipset family supporting [[Phenom (processor)|Phenom]] processors and [[AMD Quad FX platform|Quad FX enthusiast platform]] (890FX), [[Integrated Graphics Processor|IGP]](890GX).

With the advent of AMD's APUs in 2011, traditional north bridge features such as the connection to graphics and the PCI Express controller were incorporated into the APU die. Accordingly, APUs were connected to as single chip chipset, renamed the Fusion Controller Hub (FCH), which primarily provided southbridge functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wasson|first1=Scott|title=AMD's A8-3500M Fusion APU|url=https://techreport.com/review/21099/amd-a8-3500m-fusion-apu|accessdate=10 July 2017|publisher=Tech Report|date=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AMD released new chipsets in 2017 to support the release of their new [[Ryzen]] products. As the [[Zen (microarchitecture)|Zen microarchitecture]] already includes much of the northbridge connectivity, the AM4 based chipsets primarily varied in the number of additional PCI Express lanes, USB connections, and SATA connections available.&lt;ref name=&quot;chipset_toms&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Justin|first1=Michael|last2=Sexton|first2=Allen|title=AMD's AM4 Ryzen Chipsets|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-am4-ryzen-chipsets,33806.html|accessdate=3 March 2017|publisher=Tom's Hardware|date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These AM4 chipsets were designed in conjunction with [[ASMedia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;su_interview&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cutress|first1=Ian|title=Making AMD Tick: A Very Zen Interview it Dr. Lisa Su, CEO|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/11177/making-amd-tick-a-very-zen-interview-with-dr-lisa-su-ceo|accessdate=2 March 2017|publisher=Anandtech.com|date=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Embedded CPUs =====
{{Main|Alchemy (processor)|Geode (processor)}}

In February 2002, AMD acquired Alchemy Semiconductor for its [[Alchemy (processor)|Alchemy]] line of [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] processors for the hand-held and [[portable media player]] markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Lammers|first1=David|title=AMD to buy MIPS processor startup Alchemy|url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1134862|accessdate=11 July 2017|magazine=EE Times|date=29 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 13, 2006, AMD officially announced that the line was to be transferred to Raza Microelectronics, Inc., a designer of MIPS processors for embedded applications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alchemy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |title=AMD Alchemy processor product line acquired by Raza Microelectronics |date=June 14, 2006 |publisher=technologynewsdaily.com |url=http://www.technologynewsdaily.com/node/3336 |work=TechNews |pages= |accessdate=July 11, 2007 |language= |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102020841/http://www.technologynewsdaily.com/node/3336 |archivedate=January 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2003, AMD also purchased the [[Geode (processor)|Geode]] business which was originally the [[Cyrix]] [[MediaGX]] from [[National Semiconductor]] to augment its existing line of embedded x86 processor products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Shah|first1=Agam|title=AMD Sees No Geode Chip Replacement in Sight|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/158363/article.html|accessdate=11 July 2017|magazine=PC World|date=26 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the second quarter of 2004, it launched new low-power Geode NX processors based on the K7 Thoroughbred architecture with speeds of fanless processors {{nowrap|667 MHz}} and {{nowrap|1 GHz}}, and {{nowrap|1.4 GHz}} processor with fan, of [[Thermal Design Power|TDP]] 25&amp;nbsp;W. This technology is used in a variety of embedded systems (Casino slot machines and customer kiosks for instance), several [[Ultra Mobile PC|UMPC]] designs in Asia markets, as well as the [[One Laptop per Child|OLPC]] [[OLPC XO-1|XO-1 computer]], an inexpensive laptop computer intended to be distributed to children in developing countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paul|first1=Ryan|title=A comparison of OLPC's XO laptop and Intel's Classmate PC|url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2007/03/acomparison-of-olpcs-xo-laptop-and-intels-classmate-pc/|accessdate=11 July 2017|website=Ars Technica|date=5 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Geode LX processor was announced in 2005 and is said will continue to be available through 2015.

AMD has also introduced [[x86-64|64-bit]] processors into its embedded product line starting with the AMD [[Opteron]] processor.  Leveraging the high throughput enabled through [[HyperTransport]] and the [[Direct Connect Architecture]] these server class processors have been targeted at high-end telecom and storage applications. In 2007, AMD added the AMD Athlon, [[AMD Turion]], and Mobile AMD Sempron processors to its embedded product line. Leveraging the same [[x86-64|64-bit]] instruction set and [[Direct Connect Architecture]] as the AMD [[Opteron]] but at lower power levels, these processors were well suited to a variety of traditional embedded applications. Throughout 2007 and into 2008, AMD has continued to add both single-core Mobile AMD Sempron and AMD Athlon processors and [[Multi-core (computing)|dual-core]] AMD Athlon X2 and AMD Turion processors to its embedded product line and now offers embedded [[x86-64|64-bit]] solutions starting with 8W TDP Mobile AMD Sempron and AMD Athlon processors for fan-less designs up to multi-processor systems leveraging multi-core AMD Opteron processors all supporting longer than standard availability.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amd.com/us/products/embedded/Pages/embedded.aspx AMD Embedded Solutions that are scalable, x86- based, low-power and feature-rich products].

The ATI acquisition in 2006 included the [[Imageon]] and [[Xilleon]] product lines. In late 2008, the entire handheld division was sold off to [[Qualcomm]], who have since produced the [[Adreno]] series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Scott|last=Ferguson|date=January 20, 2009|url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Mobile-and-Wireless/AMD-Sells-Handset-Division-to-Qualcomm-for-65-Million/|newspaper=eWeek|accessdate=June 6, 2014|title=AMD Sells Handset Division to Qualcomm for $65 million}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2008, the Xilleon division was sold to [[Broadcom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-10024509-92.html?hhTest=1&amp;tag=xlr8yourmac CNET report on the AMD/Broadcom Deal], retrieved August 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcom.com/press/release.php?id=1190026|title=News Room|website=www.broadcom.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, AMD announced the release of the [[AMD 690 chipset series#M690T|M690T]] integrated graphics chipset for embedded designs. This enabled AMD to offer complete processor and chipset solutions targeted at embedded applications requiring high-performance 3D and video such as emerging digital signage, kiosk and Point of Sale applications. The M690T was followed by the [[AMD 690 chipset series#M690E|M690E]] specifically for embedded applications which removed the TV output, which required [[Macrovision]] licensing for OEMs, and enabled native support for dual [[Transition Minimized Differential Signaling|TMDS]] outputs, enabling dual independent [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] interfaces.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

The [[Emirate of Abu Dhabi]] purchased the newly created company through its subsidiary [[Advanced Technology Investment Company]] (ATIC), purchasing the final stake from AMD in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Shimpi |first=Anand Lal |title=GlobalFoundries Granted Independence, Acquires Remaining Stake from AMD |url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/5627/globalfoundries-granted-independence-acquires-remaining-stake-from-amd |work=AnandTech |accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the spin-off of its foundries, AMD became a [[Fabless manufacturing|fabless]] semiconductor manufacturer, designing products to be produced at for-hire foundries. Part of the GlobalFoundries spin-off included an agreement with AMD to produce some number of products at GlobalFoundries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Ryan|title=AMD Amends GlobalFoundries Wafter Supply Agreement Through 2020, Gaining New Flexibility and New Costs|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/10631/amd-amends-globalfoundries-wafer-supply-agreement-through-2020|accessdate=10 July 2017|publisher=Anandtech|date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both prior to the spin-off and after AMD has pursued production with other foundries including [[TSMC]] and [[Samsung Electronics#Semiconductors|Samsung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nystedt|first1=Dan|title=AMD Cozies up to Contract Chip Maker TSMC|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/PCWorld/story?id=3200207|accessdate=10 July 2017|publisher=ABC News|date=22 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;samsung&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Moorhead|first1=Patrick|title=AMD Officially Diversifies 14nm Manufacturing With Samsung|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2016/07/25/amd-diversifies-14nm-manufacturing-with-samsung/|accessdate=26 July 2016|magazine=Forbes|date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that this would reduce risk for AMD by decreasing dependence on any one foundry which has caused issues in the past.&lt;ref name=&quot;samsung&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shah|first1=Agam|title=AMD records profit in Q3 despite manufacturing issues|url=https://www.arnnet.com.au/article/405600/amd_records_profit_q3_despite_manufacturing_issues/|accessdate=10 July 2017|publisher=ARN|date=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corporate affairs ==

=== Partnerships ===
AMD utilizes strategic industry partnerships to further its business interests as well as to rival Intel's dominance and resources:&lt;ref name=&quot;vr1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vr2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vr3&quot;/&gt;

* A partnership between AMD and Alpha Processor Inc. developed [[HyperTransport]], a point-to-point interconnect standard which was turned over to an industry standards body for finalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Spooner|first1=John G|title=Promoter of storied Alpha to shut doors|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/promoter-of-storied-alpha-to-shut-doors/|accessdate=10 July 2017|publisher=CNet|date=2 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now used in modern motherboards that are compatible with AMD processors.
* AMD also formed a strategic partnership with IBM, under which AMD gained [[silicon on insulator]] (SOI) manufacturing technology, and detailed advice on [[90 nm]] implementation. AMD announced that the partnership would extend to 2011 for [[32 nm]] and [[22 nm]] fabrication-related technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/DownloadableAssets/DarylOstranderAMDAnalystDay.pdf AMD Analyst Day June 2006 Presentation], slide 10  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326033318/http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/DownloadableAssets/DarylOstranderAMDAnalystDay.pdf |date=March 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To facilitate processor distribution and sales, AMD is loosely partnered with end-user companies, such as [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Dell]], [[Asus]], [[Acer (company)|Acer]], and [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kennedy|first1=Patrick|title=Most Impressive Part of the AMD EPYC Launch: The Ecosystem|url=https://www.servethehome.com/impressive-part-amd-epyc-launch-ecosystem|accessdate=10 July 2017|publisher=Serve the Home|date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1993, AMD established a 50–50 partnership with [[Fujitsu]] called FASL, and merged into a new company called FASL LLC in 2003. The joint venture went public under the name [[Spansion]] and ticker symbol SPSN in December 2005, with AMD shares drop to 37%. AMD no longer directly participates in the Flash memory devices market now as AMD entered into a non-competition agreement, {{as of|2005|December|21|lc=y|df=US}}, with Fujitsu and Spansion, pursuant to which it agreed not to directly or indirectly engage in a business that manufactures or supplies standalone semiconductor devices (including single chip, multiple chip or system devices) containing only Flash memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.shareholder.com/s/viewerContent.aspx?companyid=SPSN&amp;docid=4095716 |title=Press release }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On May 18, 2006, Dell announced that it would roll out new servers based on AMD's Opteron chips by year's end, thus ending an exclusive relationship with Intel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vance|first1=Ashlee|title=Dell hooks up with AMD|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/05/18/dell_picks_amd/|accessdate=10 July 2017|website=The Register|date=18 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2006, Dell began offering AMD Athlon X2 chips in their desktop lineup.

=== Litigation with Intel ===
{{See also|Intel Corp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.|Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. v. Intel Corp.}}
[[File:Amd 386 processor.jpg|thumb|AMD processor with Intel logo]]
AMD has a long history of litigation with former (and current) partner and x86 creator [[Intel Corporation|Intel]].&lt;ref name=litigation&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/DownloadableAssets/AMD_-_Intel_Litigation_History.pdf |title=AMD-INTEL LITIGATION HISTORY |publisher=AMD |accessdate=January 12, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108093846/http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/DownloadableAssets/AMD_-_Intel_Litigation_History.pdf |archivedate=January 8, 2007 |url-status = live|df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amd.com/us/Documents/Complaint_summary.pdf|title=Summary U.S. antitrust complaint against Intel [Dead Link]|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amd.com/us/Documents/AMD-Intel_Full_Complaint.pdf|title=Full text of U.S. antitrust complaint against Intel [Dead Link]|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1986, Intel broke an agreement it had with AMD to allow them to produce Intel's micro-chips for [[IBM]]; AMD filed for [[arbitration]] in 1987 and the arbitrator decided in AMD's favor in 1992. Intel disputed this, and the case ended up in the [[Supreme Court of California]]. In 1994, that court upheld the arbitrator's decision and awarded damages for breach of contract.
* In 1990, Intel brought a copyright infringement action alleging illegal use of its 287 microcode. The case ended in 1994 with a jury finding for AMD and its right to use Intel's microcode in its microprocessors through the 486 generation.
* In 1997, Intel filed suit against AMD and [[Cyrix]] Corp. for misuse of the term [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]]. AMD and Intel settled, with AMD acknowledging MMX as a trademark owned by Intel, and with Intel granting AMD rights to market the AMD K6 MMX processor.
* In 2005, following an investigation, the Japan Federal Trade Commission found Intel guilty on a number of violations. On June 27, 2005, AMD won an [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] suit against Intel in Japan, and on the same day, AMD filed a broad antitrust complaint against Intel in the U.S. Federal District Court in [[Delaware]]. The complaint alleges systematic use of secret rebates, special discounts, threats, and other means used by Intel to lock AMD processors out of the global market. Since the start of this action, the court has issued [[subpoena]]s to major computer manufacturers including [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Dell]], [[Lenovo]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] and [[Toshiba]].
* In November 2009, Intel agreed to pay AMD $1.25bn and renew a five-year patent cross-licensing agreement as part of a deal to settle all outstanding legal disputes between them.&lt;ref name=&quot;amd suit&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/markets/industries/technology/amd-intel-settle-legal-disputes/ Intel, AMD Settle Legal Disputes]&quot; {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
