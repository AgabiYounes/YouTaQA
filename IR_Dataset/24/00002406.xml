'''Alban Maria Johannes Berg''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑː|l|b|ɑː|n|_|ˈ|b|ɛər|g}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/alban-berg?s=ts |title=Berg |website=[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-de|ˈbɛɐ̯k|lang}}; February 9, 1885 – December 24, 1935) was an Austrian [[composer]] of the [[Second Viennese School]]. His compositional style combined [[Romantic music|Romantic]] lyricism with the [[twelve-tone technique]].{{sfn|Baron|2010}} Although he left a relatively [[List of compositions by Alban Berg|small oeuvre]], he is remembered as one of the most important composers of the 20th century for his expressive style encompassing &quot;entire worlds of emotion and structure&quot;.{{sfn|Headlam|2013}}

Berg was born and lived in Vienna. He began to compose only at the age of fifteen. He studied counterpoint, music theory and harmony with [[Arnold Schoenberg]] between 1904 and 1911, and adopted his principles of ''developing variation'' and the twelve-tone technique. Berg's major works include the operas ''[[Wozzeck]]'' (1924) and ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'' (1935, finished posthumously), the chamber pieces ''[[Lyric Suite (Berg)|Lyric Suite]]'' and [[Kammerkonzert (Berg)|Chamber Concerto]], as well as a [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]]. He also composed a number of songs (''[[lieder]]''). He is said to have brought more &quot;human values&quot; to the twelve-tone system, his works seen as more &quot;emotional&quot; than Schoenberg's.{{sfn|Ewen|1952|loc=p. 20}}

Berg died from [[sepsis]] in 1935. 

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Berg was born in [[Vienna]], the third of four children of Johanna and Konrad Berg. His father ran a successful export business, and the family owned several estates in Vienna and the countryside. The family's financial situation turned to the worse after the death of Konrad Berg in 1900, and it particularly affected young Berg, who had to repeat both his sixth and seventh grade to pass the exams.{{sfn|Jarman|2001}} Berg was more interested in literature than music as a child and did not begin to compose until he was fifteen, when he started to teach himself music. With Marie Scheuchl, a maid in the family estate of Berghof in [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] and fifteen years his senior, he fathered a daughter, Albine, born December 4, 1902.{{sfn|Jarman|1990}}

Berg had little formal music education before he became a student of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] in October 1904. With Schoenberg, he studied [[counterpoint]], [[music theory]], and [[harmony]].&lt;ref&gt;Schoenberg, Arnold. Trans. Joe Monzo.{{cite web|url=http://www.sonic-arts.org/monzo/schoenberg/harm/monzo-intro.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030927035727/http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/schoenberg/harm/monzo-intro.htm|archive-date=27 September 2003|title=&quot;Schoenberg's Harmonielehre&quot;|url-status=dead|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1906 he was studying music full-time; by 1907 he began [[musical composition|composition]] lessons. His student compositions included five drafts for [[piano sonata]]s. He also wrote songs, including his ''[[Seven Early Songs (Berg)|Seven Early Songs]]'' (''Sieben Frühe Lieder''), three of which were Berg's first publicly performed work in a concert that featured the music of Schoenberg's pupils in Vienna that year.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The early sonata sketches eventually culminated in Berg's [[Piano Sonata (Berg)|Piano Sonata]], [[opus number|Op]]. 1 (1907–1908); it is one of the most formidable &quot;first&quot; works ever written.&lt;ref&gt;Lauder (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Berg studied with Schoenberg for six years until 1911. Among Schoenberg's teaching was the idea that the unity of a musical composition depends upon all its aspects being derived from a single basic idea; this idea was later known as ''developing variation''. Berg passed this on to his students, one of whom, [[Theodor W. Adorno]], stated: &quot;The main principle he conveyed was that of variation: everything was supposed to [[Musical development|develop]] out of something else and yet be intrinsically different&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The Piano Sonata is an example—the whole composition is derived from the work's opening [[quartal and quintal harmony|quartal]] gesture and its opening phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mariinsky-theatre.com/company/other/composer/Alban_Berg/|title=Alban Berg - Composer |website=www.mariinsky-theatre.com|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innovation===
Berg was a part of Vienna's cultural elite during the heady ''[[fin de siècle]]'' period. His circle included the musicians [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]] and [[Franz Schreker]], the painter [[Gustav Klimt]], the writer and satirist [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]], the architect [[Adolf Loos]], and the poet [[Peter Altenberg]].

In 1906 Berg met the singer [[Helene Nahowski]] ([[:de:Helene Berg|de]]) (1885-1976), daughter of a wealthy family (said by some to be in fact the illegitimate daughter of Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] from his liaison with [[Anna Nahowski]]).&lt;ref&gt;Georg Markus, ''Der Kaiser Franz Joseph I.: Bilder und Dokumente''; Anna Nahowski and Friedrich Saathen, ''Anna Nahowski und Kaiser Franz Joseph : Aufzeichnungen/erstmalig herausgegeben und kommentiert von Friedrich Saathen'', Böhlau, 1986.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the outward hostility of her family, the two were married on May 3, 1911.
[[File:Watschenkonzert Karikatur in Die Zeit vom 6. April 1913.jpg|thumb|''Watschenkonzert'', caricature in ''Die Zeit'', April 6, 1913]]
In 1913 two of Berg's ''[[Altenberg Lieder]]'' (1912) were premièred in Vienna, conducted by Schoenberg in the infamous ''[[Skandalkonzert]]''. Settings of aphoristic poetic utterances, the songs are accompanied by a very large orchestra. The performance caused a riot, and had to be halted. He effectively withdrew the work, and it was not performed in full until 1952. The full score remained unpublished until 1966.{{sfn|Taruskin|2010}}

From 1915 to 1918 Berg served in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. During a period of leave in 1917 he accelerated work on his first opera, ''[[Wozzeck]]''. After the end of [[World War I]], he settled again in Vienna, where he taught private pupils. He also helped Schoenberg run his [[Society for Private Musical Performances]], which sought to create the ideal environment for the exploration and appreciation of unfamiliar new music by means of open rehearsals, repeat performances, and the exclusion of professional critics.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Berg had a particular interest in the number 23, using it to structure several works.  Various suggestions have been made as to the reason for this interest: that he took it from the [[biorhythms]] theory of [[Wilhelm Fliess]], in which a 23-day cycle is considered significant,{{sfn|Jarman|1983|pages=218–223}} or because he first suffered an asthma attack on the 23rd of the month.{{sfn|Jarman|1985|page=228–230}}

===Success of ''Wozzeck'' and inception of ''Lulu'' (1924–29)===
In 1924 three excerpts from ''Wozzeck'' were performed, which brought Berg his first public success. The opera, which Berg completed in 1922, was first performed on December 14, 1925, when [[Erich Kleiber]] conducted the first performance in [[Berlin]]. Today, ''Wozzeck'' is seen as one of the century's most important works. Berg made a start on his second opera, the three-act ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', in 1928 but interrupted the work in 1929 for the concert aria ''Der Wein'' which he completed that summer. ''Der Wein'' presaged ''Lulu'' in a number of ways, including vocal style, orchestration, design and text.{{sfn|Elliott|2014|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qrkTAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA55 p. 55]}}

Other well-known Berg compositions include the ''[[Lyric Suite (Berg)|Lyric Suite]]'' (1926), which was later shown to employ elaborate cyphers to document a secret love affair; the post-Mahlerian ''Three Pieces for Orchestra'' (completed in 1915 but not performed until after ''Wozzeck''); and the [[Kammerkonzert (Berg)|Chamber Concerto]] (''Kammerkonzert'', 1923–25) for violin, piano, and 13 wind instruments: this latter is written so conscientiously that Pierre Boulez has called it &quot;Berg's strictest composition&quot; and it, too, is permeated by cyphers and posthumously disclosed hidden programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://musopen.org/fr/education/instrument/piano/great-composers/20th-century-composers/alban-berg/|title=Alban Berg|website=musopen.org|language=fr|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final years (1930–35)===
[[File:WP Alban Berg.jpg|thumb|Sketch of Alban Berg by [[Emil Stumpp]]]]

Life for the musical world was becoming increasingly difficult in the 1930s both in Vienna and Germany due to the rising tide of [[antisemitism]] and the [[Nazi]] cultural ideology that denounced [[modernity]]. Even to have an association with someone who was Jewish could lead to denunciation, and Berg's &quot;crime&quot; was to have studied with the Jewish composer [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. Berg found that opportunities for his work to be performed in Germany were becoming rare, and eventually his music was [[proscribed]] and placed on the list of [[degenerate music]].{{sfn|Notley|2010}}

In 1932 Berg and his wife acquired an isolated lodge, the ''Waldhaus'' on the southern shore of the [[Wörthersee]], near [[Schiefling am See]] in [[Carinthia]], where he was able to work in seclusion, mainly on ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'' and the [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]].{{sfn|Hailey|2010a}} At the end of 1934, Berg became involved in the political intrigues around finding a replacement for [[Clemens Krauss]] as director of the [[Vienna State Opera]].

As more of the performances of his work in Germany were cancelled by the [[Nazis]], who had come to power in early 1933, he needed to ensure the new director would be an advocate for modernist music. Originally, the premiere of ''Lulu'' had been planned for the [[Berlin State Opera]], where [[Erich Kleiber]] continued to champion his music and had conducted the premiere of ''Wozzeck'' in 1925, but now this was looking increasingly uncertain, and ''Lulu'' was rejected by the Berlin authorities in the spring of 1934. Kleiber's production of the ''Lulu'' symphonic suite on 30 November 1934 in Berlin was also the occasion of his resignation in protest at the extent of conflation of culture with politics. Even in Vienna, the opportunities for the Vienna School of musicians was dwindling.{{sfn|Notley|2010}}

Berg had interrupted the orchestration of ''Lulu'' because of an unexpected (and financially much-needed) commission from the Russian-American violinist [[Louis Krasner]] for a [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]] (1935). This profoundly elegiac work, composed at unaccustomed speed and posthumously premiered, has become Berg's best-known and most-beloved composition.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Like much of his mature work, it employs an idiosyncratic adaptation of Schoenberg's &quot;dodecaphonic&quot; or [[twelve-tone technique]], that enables the composer to produce passages openly evoking tonality, including quotations from historical tonal music, such as a [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] chorale and a Carinthian folk song. The Violin Concerto was dedicated &quot;to the memory of an Angel&quot;, [[Manon Gropius]], the deceased daughter of architect [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Alma Mahler]].{{sfn|Pople|1991|page=28}} 

===Death===
Berg died aged 50 in Vienna, on Christmas Eve 1935, from [[blood poisoning]] apparently caused by a [[furuncle]] on his back, induced by an insect sting that occurred in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Alban Berg|url=http://www.musicacademyonline.com/composer/biographies.php?bid=24|website=musicacademyonline.com|accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2018}}&lt;!--This not-especially reliable source states it was an &quot;abscess&quot; that developed, though this claim has changed from &quot;carbuncle&quot; to &quot;furuncle&quot;. Was it a boil, boil cluster, or an abscess? If caused by an insect sting, it seems unlikely that a hair follicle was involved.--&gt; He was buried at the [[Hietzing Cemetery]] in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/1294/alban-berg |title=Alban Berg |website=Find-a-Grave}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before he died, Berg had completed the orchestration of only the first two of the three acts of ''Lulu''. The completed acts were successfully premièred in Zürich in 1937. For personal reasons Helene Berg subsequently imposed a ban on any attempt to &quot;complete&quot; the final act, which Berg had in fact completed in [[short score]].{{sfn|Jarman|1991|loc=p. 46}} An orchestration was therefore commissioned in secret from [[Friedrich Cerha]] and premièred in Paris (under [[Pierre Boulez]]) only in 1979, soon after Helene Berg's own death. The complete opera has rapidly entered the repertoire as one of the landmarks of contemporary music and, like ''Wozzeck'', remains a consistent audience draw.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Legacy==
[[Image:Alban Berg Bueste Schiefling 01.jpg|thumb|right|Bust of Alban Berg at [[Schiefling am See]], Carinthia, Austria]]

Berg is remembered as one of the most important composers of the 20th century and the most widely performed opera composer among the Second Viennese School.{{sfn|Jarman|2001}}  He is said to have brought more &quot;human values&quot; to the [[Twelve-Tone System|twelve-tone system]], his works seen as more &quot;emotional&quot; than Schoenberg's.{{sfn|Ewen|1952|loc=p. 20}} Critically, he is seen as having preserved the Viennese tradition in his music.{{sfn|Jarman|2001}}

Berg scholar Douglas Jarman writes in the ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' that &quot;[as] the 20th century closed, the 'backward-looking' Berg suddenly came as [George] [[George Perle|Perle]] remarked, to look like its most forward-looking composer.&quot;{{sfn|Jarman|2001}}

The asteroid [[4528 Berg]] is named after him (1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmadel |first=Lutz |title=Dictionary of Minor Planet Names|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VoJ5nUyIzCsC|year=2003|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-3-540-00238-3 |page=390}}&lt;/ref&gt;
