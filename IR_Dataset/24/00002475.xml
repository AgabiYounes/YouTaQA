'''Abadeh''' ({{lang-fa|آباده}}, also [[Romanize]]d as '''Ābādeh''')&lt;ref&gt;{{GEOnet3|-3051024}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a city and capital of [[Abadeh County]], in [[Fars Province]], [[Iran]]. Abadeh is situated at an elevation of {{convert|6200|ft|m|-1}} in a fertile plain on the high road between [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]] and [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]], {{convert|190|km|mi}} from the former and {{convert|270|km|mi}} from the latter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Abadeh|volume=1|page=6|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the 2006 census, its population was 52,042, in 14,184 families.&lt;ref&gt;{{IranCensus2006|07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2009, the population was estimated to be 59,042.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amar.org.ir/DesktopModules/FTPManager/upload/upload2360/newjkh/newjkh/Q11.xls Iran Statics Organization] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004115501/http://www.amar.org.ir/DesktopModules/FTPManager/upload/upload2360/newjkh/newjkh/Q11.xls |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the largest city in the Northern Fars Region (South Central-Iran), which is famed for its carved wood-work, made of the wood of [[pear]] and [[box tree]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm&quot;/&gt; Sesame oil, castor oil, grain, and various fruits are also produced there. The area is famous for its [[Abadeh rug]]s.

An interesting fact is that Abadeh is closer, road-distance-wise to 4 provincial capitals of [[Isfahan]] (193&amp;nbsp;km), [[Yasuj]] (197&amp;nbsp;km), [[Yazd]] (217&amp;nbsp;km), and [[Shahrekord]] (237&amp;nbsp;km) compared to the distance to the provincial capital of its corresponding province, [[Shiraz]] (260&amp;nbsp;km).

==Landmarks and crafts==
Abadeh historical monuments include Emirate Kolah Farangi, Tymcheh Sarafyan and Khaje tomb, located in the Khoja mountains.
Abadeh crafts can be embroidered in cotton. The town also produces [[Abadeh rug]]s.

The rugs tend to be based on a cotton warp and have a thin, tightly knotted pile. Most Abadeh rugs are closely cut making them very flat. Although some of the older Abadehs vary in style, many of the new designs are easily recognisable. These new designs, known as Heybatlu consist of a single diamond shaped medallion in the centre with smaller medallions on each corner. The pattern is typically geometrical flowers or animals and the main colours are light reds or burnt orange on top of a dark blue background with strong green details. The corners or borders are generally ivory in colour. Although some Abadeh and Shiraz rugs appear similar Abadeh can normally be differentiated by their higher knot counts as well as the fact that the warp is invariably cotton. The rugs are almost always exclusively medium in size and the KPSI of an average Abadeh is around 90. As always in the rug-world you get what you pay for however in general Abadeh are well made and fairly popular items, particularly in modern interiors or those with a Mediterranean or North African style.

==Transportation==

'''[[Road 65 (Iran)|Expressway 65]]''' passes through Abadeh. This situation helps Abadeh to improve its capabilities compared to the neighboring city, [[Eqlid]]. [[Road 78 (Iran)|Road 78]] makes connections from Abadeh to [[Abarkuh]], [[Yazd]] [[Eqlid]] and [[Yasuj]]. It has a junction with [[Road 65 (Iran)|Abadeh Shiraz Expressway]] 24&amp;nbsp;km south of the city. A road starts from Abadeh Ring Road to [[Soqad]] and [[Semirom]], [[Road 55 (Iran)|Road 55]].

The railroad from [[Isfahan]] to [[Shiraz]] passes Abadeh and there are train services at Abadeh Railway Station to Shiraz, Esfahan, Tehran and Mashad. [[Abadeh Airport]] (OISA) was planned to be built in the mid 1990s.

==Sport==
Abadeh's main sport is [[Football (Soccer)|Football]], like the rest of the country. The main stadium is [[Takhti Stadium (Abadeh)|Takhti Stadium]] located in Mo'allem Square. The main team in Abadeh is [[Behineh Rahbar Abadeh F.C.]] which is currently playing in [[Iran Football's 3rd Division]] after finishing first in Fars Provincial League (FPL) last year. It played in [[Hazfi Cup 2010-11]] reaching the fourth round.
