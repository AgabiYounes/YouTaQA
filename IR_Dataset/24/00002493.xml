'''Anthroposophy''' is a [[philosophy]] founded in the early 20th century by the esotericist [[Rudolf Steiner]] that postulates the existence of an objective, intellectually comprehensible [[spirituality|spiritual]] world, accessible to human experience. Followers of anthroposophy aim to develop mental faculties of spiritual discovery through a mode of thought independent of sensory experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;&gt;Robert McDermott, ''The Essential Steiner'', {{ISBN|0-06-065345-0}}, pp. 3&amp;ndash;11, 392&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.eb.com/eb/article-9007798 &quot;Anthroposophy&quot;], Encyclopædia Britannica online, accessed 10/09/07&lt;/ref&gt; They also aim to present their ideas in a manner verifiable by rational discourse and specifically seek a precision and clarity in studying the spiritual world mirroring that obtained by [[natural history|natural historians]] in investigations of the physical world.

==History==
[[File:Steiner um 1905.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rudolf Steiner]]]]

The early work of the founder of anthroposophy, [[Rudolf Steiner]], culminated in his ''[[Philosophy of Freedom]]'' (also translated as ''The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity'' and ''Intuitive Thinking as a Spiritual Path''). Here, Steiner developed a concept of [[free will]] based on inner experiences, especially those that occur in the creative activity of independent thought.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt;

By the beginning of the twentieth century, Steiner's interests turned almost exclusively to spirituality. His work began to interest others interested in spiritual ideas; among these was the [[Theosophical Society]]. From 1900 on, thanks to the positive reception his ideas received from Theosophists, Steiner focused increasingly on [[Rudolf Steiner and the Theosophical Society|his work with the Theosophical Society]], becoming the [[General Secretary|secretary]] of its section in Germany in 1902. During his leadership, membership increased dramatically, from just a few individuals to sixty-nine lodges.&lt;ref name=&quot;ahern2edAnthSec&quot;&gt;Of these, 55 lodges – about 2,500 people – seceded with Steiner to form his new Anthroposophical Society at the end of 1912. Geoffrey Ahern, ''[http://www.sun-at-midnight.com/  Sun at Midnight: the Rudolf Steiner Movement and Gnosis in the West, 2nd edition]'', 2009, James Clark and Co, {{ISBN|978-0-227-17293-3}}, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1907, a split between Steiner and the Theosophical Society became apparent. While the Society was oriented toward an [[Orient|Eastern]] and especially [[India]]n approach, Steiner was trying to develop a path that embraced [[Christianity]] and [[natural science]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lachman&quot;&gt;Gary Lachman, ''Rudolf Steiner'', New York:Tarcher/Penguin {{ISBN|978-1-58542-543-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The split became irrevocable when [[Annie Besant]], then president of the Theosophical Society, presented the child [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] as the [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] Christ. Steiner strongly objected and considered any comparison between Krishnamurti and Christ to be nonsense; many years later, Krishnamurti also repudiated the assertion. Steiner's continuing differences with Besant led him to separate from the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]]. He was subsequently followed by the great majority of the Theosophical Society's German members, as well as many members of other national sections.&lt;ref name=&quot;ahern2edAnthSec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lachman&quot;/&gt;

By this time, Steiner, had reached considerable stature as a spiritual teacher and [[List of occult writers|expert in the occult]].&lt;ref&gt;Ahern, Geoffrey. (1984): Sun at Midnight: the Rudolf Steiner movement and the Western esoteric tradition&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke about what he considered to be his direct experience of the [[Akashic Records]] (sometimes called the &quot;Akasha Chronicle&quot;), thought to be a spiritual chronicle of the history, pre-history, and future of the world and mankind.  In a number of works,&lt;ref&gt;especially ''How to Know Higher Worlds'' and ''An Outline of Esoteric Science''&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner described a path of inner development he felt would let anyone attain comparable spiritual experiences. In Steiner's view, sound vision could be developed, in part, by practicing rigorous forms of ethical and cognitive self-discipline, concentration, and meditation. In particular, Steiner believed a person's spiritual development could only occur after a period of moral development.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Goetheanum Dornach.jpg|thumb|right|Second [[Goetheanum]], seat of the Anthroposophical Society]]
In 1912, the Anthroposophical Society was founded. After [[World War I]], the Anthroposophical movement took on new directions. Followers of Steiner's ideas soon began applying them to create counter-cultural movements in [[Waldorf education|traditional]] and [[Camphill Movement|special education]], farming, and [[anthroposophical medicine|medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Uhrmacher |first1=P. Bruce |title=Uncommon Schooling: A Historical Look at Rudolf Steiner, Anthroposophy, and Waldorf Education |journal=Curriculum Inquiry |date=Winter 1995 |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=381–406 |doi=10.2307/1180016 |jstor=1180016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1923, a schism had formed between older members focused on inner development and younger members eager to become active in contemporary social transformations. In response, Steiner attempted to bridge the gap by establishing an overall School for ''Spiritual Science''. As a spiritual basis for the reborn movement, Steiner wrote a &quot;[[wikisource:Foundation Stone Meditation|Foundation Stone Meditation]]&quot; which remains a central touchstone of anthroposophical ideas.

Steiner died just over a year later, in 1925. The Second World War temporarily hindered the anthroposophical movement in most of Continental Europe, as the Anthroposophical Society and most of its practical counter-cultural applications were banned by the [[National Socialist|Nazi government]].&lt;ref&gt;Inge Hansen-Schaberg and Bruno Schonig (eds.), ''Waldorf-Pädogogik'', {{ISBN|3-8340-0042-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though at least one prominent member of the Nazi Party, [[Rudolf Hess]], was a strong supporter of anthroposophy, very few anthroposophists belonged to the National Socialist Party.&lt;ref name=&quot;DuganWaldorfCritics&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Flynn |first1=Tom |last2=Dugan |first2=Dan |title=The New Encyclopedia of Unbelief |date=2007 |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1591023913 |pages=74–76 |url=http://www.waldorfcritics.org/articles/Anthroposophy.html |accessdate=27 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zander&gt;Helmut Zander, ''Anthroposophie in Deutschland'', {{ISBN|978-3-525-55452-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|250}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Priestman |first1=Karen |title=Illusion of Coexistence: The Waldorf Schools in the Third Reich, 1933–1941 |journal=Doctoral Thesis at the Wilfrid Laurier University |date=2009 |url=https://scholars.wlu.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2079 |accessdate=29 November 2018 }}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ernst |first1=Edzard |title=Rudolf Hess (Hitler's deputy) on alternative medicine |url=https://edzardernst.com/2015/01/rudolf-hess-hitlers-deputy-on-alternative-medicine/ |website=Edzard Ernst |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Staudenmaier |first1=Peter |title=Between occultism and Nazism : anthroposophy and the politics of race in the fascist era |date=2014 |publisher=Aries Books |isbn=9789004270152 |pages=101–145 |url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/books/b9789004270152_005 |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2007, national branches of the Anthroposophical Society had been established in fifty countries and about 10,000 institutions around the world were working on the basis of anthroposophical ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goetheanum.org/121.html?&amp;L=1 |title=Goetheanum |publisher=Goetheanum |accessdate=2013-12-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930063201/http://www.goetheanum.org/121.html?&amp;L=1 |archive-date=2011-09-30 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology and earlier uses of the word===
''Anthroposophy'' is an amalgam of the [[Greek language|Greek]] terms {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἄνθρωπος|ἄνθρωπος]]}} (''anthropos'' = &quot;human&quot;) and {{lang|grc|[[Sophia (wisdom)|σοφία]]}} (''sophia'' = &quot;wisdom&quot;). An early English usage is recorded by [[Nathan Bailey]] (1742) as meaning &quot;the knowledge of the nature of man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anthroposophy&quot;, [[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Troxler Portrait 1830.jpg|thumb|right|Ignaz Paul Vitalis Troxler]]
The first known use of the term ''anthroposophy'' occurs within ''[[Arbatel|Arbatel de magia veterum, summum sapientiae studium]]'', a book published anonymously in 1575 and attributed to [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim|Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]]. The work describes anthroposophy (as well as theosophy) variously as an understanding of goodness, nature, or human affairs. In 1648, the Welsh philosopher [[Thomas Vaughan (philosopher)|Thomas Vaughan]] published his ''Anthroposophia Theomagica, or a discourse of the nature of man and his state after death.'' &lt;ref&gt;Thomas Vaughan (Eugenius Philalethes): ''Anthroposophia Theomagica, or a discourse of the nature of man and his state after death.'' Oxford 1648&lt;/ref&gt;

The term began to appear with some frequency in philosophical works of the mid- and late-nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;The term was used for example in a [http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ilej/image1.pl?item=page&amp;seq=1&amp;size=1&amp;id=nq.1863.5.9.3.71.x.373 discussion of Boehme] in ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', May 9, 1863, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt; In the early part of that century, [[Ignaz Paul Vitalis Troxler|Ignaz Troxler]] used the term &quot;anthroposophy&quot; to refer to philosophy deepened to self-knowledge, which he suggested allows deeper knowledge of nature as well. He spoke of human nature as a mystical unity of God and world. [[Immanuel Hermann Fichte]] used the term ''anthroposophy'' to refer to &quot;rigorous human self-knowledge,&quot; achievable through thorough comprehension of the human spirit and of the working of God in this spirit, in his 1856 work ''Anthropology: The Study of the Human Soul''. In 1872, the philosopher of religion [[Gideon Spicker]] used the term ''anthroposophy'' to refer to self-knowledge that would unite God and world: &quot;the true study of the human being is the human being, and philosophy's highest aim is self-knowledge, or Anthroposophy.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;''Die Philosophie des Grafen von Shaftesbury'', 1872&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882, the philosopher [[Robert von Zimmermann|Robert Zimmermann]] published the treatise, &quot;An Outline of Anthroposophy: Proposal for a System of Idealism on a Realistic Basis,&quot; proposing that idealistic philosophy should employ logical thinking to extend empirical experience.&lt;ref&gt;''Anthroposophie im Umriß. Entwurf eines Systems idealer Weltsicht auf realistischer Grundlage'', 1882&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner attended lectures by Zimmermann at the [[University of Vienna]] in the early 1880s, thus at the time of this book's publication.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Zimmermann ''Geschichte der Aesthetik als philosophische Wissenschaft. Vienna, 1858.  Anthroposophie im Umriss-Entwurf eines Systems idealer Weltansicht auf realistischer Grundlage.'' (Vienna, 1882): Steiner, ''Anthroposophic Movement'': Lecture Two: ''The Unveiling of Spiritual Truths'',  11 June 1923.[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA258/English/RSP1993/19230611p01.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1900s, Steiner began using the term ''anthroposophy'' (i.e. human wisdom) as an alternative to the term ''theosophy'' (i.e. divine wisdom).

==Central ideas==

===Spiritual knowledge and freedom===
Anthroposophical proponents aim to extend the clarity of the [[scientific method]] to phenomena of human soul-life and spiritual experiences. Steiner believed this required developing new faculties of objective spiritual perception, which he maintained was still possible for contemporary humans. The steps of this process of inner development he identified as consciously achieved ''[[imagination]]'', ''[[:wikt:inspiration|inspiration]]'' and ''[[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;&gt;Peter Schneider, Einführung in die Waldorfpädogogik, {{ISBN|3-608-93006-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner believed results of this form of spiritual research should be expressed in a way that can be understood and evaluated on the same basis as the results of natural science.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider20&quot;/&gt;

Steiner hoped to form a spiritual movement that would free the individual from any external authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider20&quot;&gt;Peter Schneider, ''Einführung in die Waldorfpädogogik'', pp. 20-1; Schneider quotes here from Steiner's dissertation, ''Truth and Knowledge''&lt;/ref&gt; For Steiner, the human capacity for [[rationality|rational]] thought would allow individuals to comprehend spiritual research on their own and bypass the danger of dependency on an authority such as himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider20&quot;/&gt;

Steiner contrasted the anthroposophical approach with both conventional [[mysticism]], which he considered lacking the clarity necessary for exact knowledge, and [[natural science]], which he considered arbitrarily limited to what can be seen, heard, or felt with the outward senses.

===Nature of the human being===
{{More citations needed section|date=November 2018}}
[[File:Representative of humanity.gif|thumb|upright|''The Representative of Humanity'', detail of a sculpture in wood by Rudolf Steiner and [[Edith Maryon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EM&quot;/&gt;]]

In ''Theosophy'', Steiner suggested that human beings unite a physical body of substances gathered from (and that ultimately return to) the inorganic world; a life body (also called the [[etheric body]]), in common with all living creatures (including plants); a bearer of [[sentience]] or [[consciousness]] (also called the [[astral body]]), in common with all [[animal]]s; and the ego, which anchors the faculty of self-awareness unique to human beings.

Anthroposophy describes a broad evolution of human consciousness. Early stages of human evolution possess an intuitive perception of reality, including a [[clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] perception of spiritual realities. Humanity has progressively evolved an increasing reliance on [[intellect]]ual faculties and a corresponding loss of intuitive or clairvoyant experiences, which have become atavistic. The increasing intellectualization of consciousness, initially a progressive direction of evolution, has led to an excessive reliance on [[abstraction]] and a loss of contact with both natural and spiritual realities. However, to go further requires new capacities that combine the clarity of intellectual thought with the imagination, and beyond this with consciously achieved inspiration and [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] insights.&lt;ref name=RAMcD&gt;Robert A. McDermott, &quot;Rudolf Steiner and Anthroposophy&quot;, in Faivre and Needleman, ''Modern Esoteric Spirituality'', {{ISBN|0-8245-1444-0}}, p. 299&amp;ndash;301; 288ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthroposophy speaks of the reincarnation of the human spirit: that the human being passes between stages of existence, incarnating into an earthly body, living on earth, leaving the body behind and entering into the spiritual worlds before returning to be born again into a new life on earth. After the [[death]] of the physical body, the human spirit recapitulates the past life, perceiving its events as they were experienced by the objects of its actions. A complex transformation takes place between the review of the past life and the preparation for the next life. The individual's [[karmic]] condition eventually leads to a choice of parents, physical body, disposition, and capacities that provide the challenges and opportunities that further development requires, which includes karmically chosen tasks for the future life.&lt;ref name=RAMcD/&gt;

Steiner described some conditions that determine the interdependence of a person's lives, or [[karma]].&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, Theosophy, {{ISBN|0-85440-269-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, An Outline of Esoteric Science, {{ISBN|0-88010-409-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evolution====
The anthroposophical view of [[evolution]] considers all [[animals]] to have evolved from an early, unspecialized form. As the least specialized animal, human beings have maintained the closest connection to the archetypal form;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Verhulst|first=Jos|title=Developmental Dynamics|year=2003|publisher=Adonis Press|location=Ghent, NY|isbn=978-0-932776-28-0|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; contrary to the Darwinian conception of human evolution, all other animals ''devolve'' from this archetype.&lt;ref&gt;George Trevelyan ''Operation Redemption'' 1981, pp. 117-118&lt;/ref&gt; The spiritual archetype originally created by spiritual beings was devoid of physical substance; only later did this descend into material existence on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, ''Man as Symphony of the Creative Word'' and ''Occult Science''&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, human evolution has accompanied the Earth's evolution throughout the existence of the Earth.

{{quote|The evolution of man, Steiner said, has consisted in the gradual incarnation of a spiritual being into a material body. It has been a true &quot;descent&quot; of man from a spiritual world into a world of matter. The evolution of the animal kingdom did not precede, but rather ''accompanied'' the process of human incarnation. Man is thus not the end result of the evolution of the animals, but is rather in a certain sense their ''cause''. In the succession of types which appears in the fossil record-the fishes, reptiles, mammals, and finally fossil remains of man himself — the stages of this process of incarnation are reflected.&lt;ref&gt;John Waterman ''Evolution and The Image of Man'' in A. C. Harwood ''The faithful thinker: Centenary essays on the work and thought of Rudolf Steiner'' Hodder and Stoughton, 1961, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Anthroposophy adapted [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]'s complex system of cycles of world development and human evolution. The evolution of the world is said to have occurred in cycles. The first phase of the world consisted only of heat. In the second phase, a more active condition, light, and a more condensed, gaseous state separate out from the heat. In the third phase, a fluid state arose, as well as a sounding, forming energy. In the fourth (current) phase, solid physical matter first exists. This process is said to have been accompanied by an evolution of consciousness which led up to present human culture.

===Ethics===
The anthroposophical view is that good is found in the balance between two polar influences on world and human evolution. These are often described through their mythological embodiments as spiritual adversaries which endeavour to tempt and corrupt humanity, [[Lucifer]] and his counterpart [[Ahriman]]. These have both positive and negative aspects. Lucifer is the light spirit, which &quot;plays on human pride and offers the delusion of divinity&quot;, but also motivates [[creativity]] and [[spirituality]]; Ahriman is the dark spirit that tempts human beings to &quot;...deny [their] link with divinity and to live [[materialism|entirely on the material plane]]&quot;, but that also stimulates intellectuality and [[technology]]. Both figures exert a negative effect on humanity when their influence becomes misplaced or one-sided, yet their influences are necessary for human freedom to unfold.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;/&gt;

Each human being has the task to find a balance between these opposing influences, and each is helped in this task by the mediation of the ''Representative of Humanity'', also known as the Christ being, a spiritual entity who stands between and harmonizes the two extremes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;/&gt;

===Art===
Anthroposophic painting, a style inspired by [[Rudolf Steiner]], featured prominently in the first [[Goetheanum]]'s cupola. The technique frequently begins by filling the surface to be painted with color, out of which forms are gradually developed, often images with symbolic-spiritual significance. Paints that allow for many transparent layers are preferred, and often these are derived from plant materials.&lt;ref name=Zander/&gt;{{rp|381–382, 1080, 1105}} [[Rudolf Steiner]] appointed the English sculptor [[Edith Maryon]] as head of the School of [[Fine Art]] at the [[Goetheanum]].&lt;ref  name=EM&gt;Paull, John (2018) [https://www.academia.edu/37021855/A_Portrait_of_Edith_Maryon_Artist_and_Anthroposophist A Portrait of Edith Maryon: Artist and Anthroposophist], Journal of Fine Arts, 1(2):8-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Together they carved the 9 metre tall sculpture ‘The Representative of Man’ which is on display at the [[Goetheanum]].&lt;ref name=EM/&gt;

==Social goals==
{{Main|Social Threefolding}}
For a period after World War I, Steiner was extremely active and well known in Germany, in part because he lectured widely proposing social reforms. Steiner was a sharp critic of [[nationalism]], which he saw as outdated, and a proponent of achieving social solidarity through individual freedom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt; A petition proposing a radical change in the German constitution and expressing his basic social ideas (signed by [[Herman Hesse]], among others) was widely circulated. His main book on social reform is ''Toward Social Renewal''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt;

Anthroposophy continues to aim at reforming society through maintaining and strengthening the independence of the spheres of [[culture|cultural life]], [[human rights]] and the [[economy]]. It emphasizes a particular ideal in each of these three realms of society:&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt;
* Liberty in cultural life
* [[Equality before the law|Equality]] of [[rights]], the sphere of [[legislation]]
* Fraternity in the economic sphere

==Esoteric path==

===Paths of spiritual development===
According to Steiner, a real [[supernatural|spiritual]] world exists, evolving along with the material one. Steiner held that the spiritual world can be researched in the right circumstances through direct experience, by persons practicing rigorous forms of [[ethics|ethical]] and [[Cognition|cognitive]] [[self-discipline]]. Steiner described many exercises he said were suited to strengthening such self-discipline; the most complete exposition of these is found in his book ''How To Know Higher Worlds''. The aim of these exercises is to develop higher levels of [[higher consciousness|consciousness]] through [[meditation]] and [[observation]]. Details about the spiritual world, Steiner suggested, could on such a basis be discovered and reported, though no more infallibly than the results of natural science.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;/&gt;

{{quote|Anthroposophy is a path of knowledge, to guide the spiritual in the human being to the spiritual in the universe…. Anthroposophists are those who experience, as an essential need of life, certain questions on the nature of the human being and the universe, just as one experiences hunger and thirst.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, ''Anthroposophical Leading Thoughts'' (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Steiner regarded his research reports as being important aids to others seeking to enter into spiritual experience. He suggested that a combination of spiritual exercises (for example, concentrating on an object such as a seed), moral development (control of thought, feelings and will combined with openness, tolerance and flexibility) and familiarity with other spiritual researchers' results would best further an individual's spiritual development. He consistently emphasised that any inner, spiritual practice should be undertaken in such a way as not to interfere with one's responsibilities in outer life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;/&gt; Steiner distinguished between what he considered were true and false paths of spiritual investigation.&lt;ref&gt;''True and False Paths in Spiritual Investigation'', first English edition 1927 (online [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA243/English/RSP1969/TruFal_index.html]), 2010 edition Kessinger Publishing Company {{ISBN|9781162592510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In anthroposophy, artistic expression is also treated as a potentially valuable bridge between spiritual and material reality.&lt;ref name=Lindenberg/&gt;{{rp|97}}

===Prerequisites to and stages of inner development===
{{quote|A person seeking inner development must first of all make the attempt to give up certain formerly held inclinations. Then, new inclinations must be acquired by constantly holding the thought of such inclinations, virtues or characteristics in one's mind. They must be so incorporated into one's being that a person becomes enabled to alter his soul by his own will-power. This must be tried as objectively as a chemical might be tested in an experiment. A person who has never endeavored to change his soul, who has never made the initial decision to develop the qualities of endurance, steadfastness and calm logical thinking, or a person who has such decisions but has given up because he did not succeed in a week, a month, a year or a decade, will never conclude anything inwardly about these truths.|Rudolf Steiner|&quot;On the Inner Life&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsarchive.org/Lectures/InnDev_index.html |title=The Inner Development of Man |location=Fremont, Michigan |date=1904-12-15 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Steiner's stated prerequisites to beginning on a spiritual path include a willingness to take up serious cognitive studies, a respect for factual evidence, and a responsible attitude. Central to progress on the path itself is a harmonious cultivation of the following qualities:&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann_path&quot;&gt;[[Carlo Willmann]], ''Waldorfpädagogik'', {{ISBN|3-412-16700-2}}, pp. 10&amp;ndash;13&lt;/ref&gt;
* Control over one's own thinking
* Control over one's will
* Composure
* Positivity
* Impartiality

Steiner sees meditation as a concentration and enhancement of the power of thought. By focusing consciously on an idea, feeling or intention the meditant seeks to arrive at pure thinking, a state exemplified by but not confined to pure mathematics. In Steiner's view, conventional sensory-material knowledge is achieved through relating perception and concepts. The anthroposophic path of esoteric training articulates three further stages of supersensory knowledge, which do not necessarily follow strictly sequentially in any single individual's spiritual progress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann_path&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stein&gt;Stein, W. J., ''Die moderne naturwissenschaftliche Vorstellungsart und die Weltanschauung Goethes, wie sie Rudolf Steiner vertritt'', reprinted in Meyer, Thomas, ''W.J. Stein / Rudolf Steiner'', pp. 267&amp;ndash;75; 256&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* By focusing on symbolic patterns, images, and poetic mantras, the meditant can achieve consciously directed Imaginations that allow sensory phenomena to appear as the expression of underlying beings of a soul-spiritual nature.
* By transcending such imaginative pictures, the meditant can become conscious of the meditative activity itself, which leads to experiences of expressions of soul-spiritual beings unmediated by sensory phenomena or qualities.  Steiner calls this stage Inspiration.
* By intensifying the will-forces through exercises such as a chronologically reversed review of the day's events, the meditant can achieve a further stage of inner independence from sensory experience, leading to direct contact, and even union, with spiritual beings (&quot;Intuition&quot;) without loss of individual awareness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann_path&quot;/&gt;

===Spiritual exercises===
{{Main|Rudolf Steiner's exercises for spiritual development}}

Steiner described numerous exercises he believed would bring spiritual development; other anthroposophists have added many others. A central principle is that &quot;for every step in spiritual perception, three steps are to be taken in moral development.&quot; According to Steiner, moral development reveals the extent to which one has achieved control over one's inner life and can exercise it in harmony with the spiritual life of other people; it shows the real progress in spiritual development, the fruits of which are given in spiritual perception. It also guarantees the capacity to distinguish between false perceptions or illusions (which are possible in perceptions of both the outer world and the inner world) and true perceptions: i.e., the capacity to distinguish in any perception between the influence of subjective elements (i.e., viewpoint) and objective reality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;/&gt;

==Place in Western philosophy==
Steiner built upon [[Goethe]]'s conception of an imaginative power capable of synthesizing the sense-perceptible form of a thing (an image of its outer appearance) and the concept we have of that thing (an image of its inner structure or nature). Steiner added to this the conception that a further step in the development of thinking is possible when the thinker observes his or her own thought processes. &quot;The organ of observation and the observed thought process are then identical, so that the condition thus arrived at is simultaneously one of perception through thinking and one of thought through perception.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;/&gt;

Thus, in Steiner's view, we can overcome the subject-object divide through inner activity, even though all human experience begins by being conditioned by it. In this connection, Steiner examines the step from thinking determined by outer impressions to what he calls sense-free thinking. He characterizes thoughts he considers without sensory content, such as mathematical or logical thoughts, as free deeds. Steiner believed he had thus located the origin of free will in our thinking, and in particular in sense-free thinking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;/&gt;

Some of the [[Epistemology|epistemic]] basis for Steiner's later anthroposophical work is contained in the seminal work, [[Philosophy of Freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Pifer, &quot;Saul Bellow Against the Grain&quot;, University of Pennsylvania Press, 1990; see also Steiner's doctoral thesis, ''Truth and Science''&lt;/ref&gt; In his early works, Steiner sought to overcome what he perceived as the dualism of [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] idealism and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian subjectivism by developing Goethe's conception of the human being as a natural-supernatural entity, that is: natural in that humanity is a product of nature, supernatural in that through our conceptual powers we extend nature's realm, allowing it to achieve a reflective capacity in us as philosophy, art and science.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tarnas&quot;&gt;Richard Tarnas, ''The Passion of the Western Mind'', {{ISBN|0-7126-7332-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner was one of the first European philosophers to overcome the subject-object split in [[Western thought]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tarnas&quot;/&gt; Though not well known among philosophers, his philosophical work was taken up by [[Owen Barfield]] (and through him influenced the [[Inklings]], an [[Oxford]] group of Christian writers that included [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and [[C. S. Lewis]]).&lt;ref&gt;Doris T. Myers, &quot;C.S. Lewis in Context.&quot;  Kent State University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian and Jewish mystical thought have also influenced the development of anthroposophy.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Jürgen Bader, Lorenzo Ravagli, ''Rudolf Steiner als aktiver Gegner des Antisemitismus'',  Bund der Freien Waldorfschulen, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paddock, F. and Spiegler, M., Judaism and Anthroposophy, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Union of science and spirit===
Steiner believed in the possibility of applying the clarity of scientific thinking to spiritual experience, which he saw as deriving from an objectively existing spiritual world.&lt;ref name=Lindenberg&gt;Christoph Lindenberg, ''Rudolf Steiner'', Rowohlt 1992, {{ISBN|3-499-50500-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|77ff}} Steiner identified [[mathematics]], which attains certainty through thinking itself, thus through inner experience rather than empirical observation,&lt;ref&gt;Albert Einstein, [http://www.tu-harburg.de/rzt/rzt/it/Geometry.html Geometry and Experience] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20011124171015/http%3A//www.tu%2Dharburg.de/rzt/rzt/it/geometry.html |date=2001-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the basis of his epistemology of spiritual experience.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''Anthroposophy and Science'', lecture of March 16, 1921&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to religion==

===Christ as the center of earthly evolution===
Steiner's writing, though appreciative of all religions and cultural developments, emphasizes Western tradition as having evolved to meet contemporary needs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lachman&quot;/&gt; He describes Christ and his mission on earth of bringing individuated consciousness as having a particularly important place in human evolution,&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt; whereby:&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;/&gt;
*Christianity has evolved out of previous religions;
*The being which manifests in Christianity also manifests in all faiths and religions, and each religion is valid and true for the time and cultural context in which it was born;
*All historical forms of Christianity need to be transformed considerably to meet the continuing evolution of humanity.

{{quote|Spiritual science does not want to usurp the place of Christianity; on the contrary it would like to be instrumental in making Christianity understood. Thus it becomes clear to us through spiritual science that the being whom we call Christ is to be recognized as the center of life on earth, that the Christian religion is the ultimate religion for the earth's whole future. Spiritual science shows us particularly that the pre-Christian religions outgrow their one-sidedness and come together in the Christian faith. It is not the desire of spiritual science to set something else in the place of Christianity; rather it wants to contribute to a deeper, more heartfelt understanding of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner,[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/AntChr_index.html &quot;Anthroposophy and Christianity&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, anthroposophy considers there to be a being who unifies all religions, and who is not represented by any particular religious faith. This being is, according to Steiner, not only the Redeemer of [[the Fall of Man|the Fall from Paradise]], but also the unique pivot and meaning of earth's evolutionary processes and of human history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;/&gt; To describe this being, Steiner periodically used terms such as the &quot;Representative of Humanity&quot; or the &quot;good spirit&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Steiner|first=Rudolf|title=The foundations of human experience|year=1996|publisher=Anthroposophic Press|isbn=978-0-88010-392-3|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steiner|first=Rudolf|title=A Chapter of Occult History|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/19081216p01.html|date=December 16, 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than any denominational term.

===Divergence from conventional Christian thought===
Steiner's views of Christianity diverge from conventional Christian thought in key places, and include [[gnostism|gnostic]] elements:

* One central point of divergence is Steiner's views on [[reincarnation]] and karma.
* Steiner differentiated three contemporary paths by which he believed it possible to arrive at [[Christ]]:
** Through heart-filled experiences of the [[Gospels]]; Steiner described this as the historically dominant path, but becoming less important in the future.
** Through inner experiences of a spiritual reality; this Steiner regarded as increasingly the path of spiritual or religious seekers today.
** Through [[initiation|initiatory experiences]] whereby the reality of Christ's death and resurrection are experienced; Steiner believed this is the path people will increasingly take.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;/&gt;
* Steiner also believed that there were two different [[Jesus]] children involved in the [[Incarnation]] of the Christ: one child descended from [[Solomon]], as described in the [[Gospel of Matthew]], the other child from [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]], as described in the [[Gospel of Luke]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt; (The genealogies given in the two gospels diverge some thirty generations before Jesus' birth, and 'Jesus' was a common name in biblical times.)
* His view of [[the second coming]] of Christ is also unusual; he suggested that this would not be a physical reappearance, but that the Christ being would become manifest in non-physical form, visible to spiritual vision and apparent in community life for increasing numbers of people beginning around the year 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/ReapChrist/19100125p01.html &quot;The Appearance of Christ in the Etheric World&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* He emphasized his belief that in the future humanity would need to be able to recognize the ''Spirit of Love'' in all its genuine forms, regardless of what name would be used to describe this being. He also warned that the traditional name of the ''Christ'' might be misused, and the true essence of this being of love ignored.

===Judaism===
Rudolf Steiner wrote and lectured on Judaism and Jewish issues over much of his adult life. He was a fierce opponent of popular antisemitism, but asserted that there was no justification for the existence of Judaism and Jewish culture in the modern world, a radical assimilationist perspective which saw the Jews completely integrating into the larger society.&lt;ref&gt;Jan-Erik Ebbestad Hansen, [https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/handle/18452/8831 The Jews - Teachers of the Nazis?] In: NORDEUROPAforum. Journal for the Study of Culture. Yearbook 2015. Humboldt University Berlin. {{ISSN|1863-639X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Peter&gt;Peter Staudenmeier, [https://epublications.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&amp;context=hist_fac &quot;Rudolf Steiner and the Jewish Question&quot;], Leo Baeck Institute Yearbook, Vol. 50, No. 1 (2005): 127-147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ralf&gt;Ralf Sonnenberg, [http://www.hagalil.com/antisemitismus/deutschland/steiner.htm “Judentum, Zionismus und Antisemitismus aus der Sicht Rudolf Steiners”]&lt;/ref&gt; He also supported [[Émile Zola]]'s position in the [[Dreyfus affair]].&lt;ref name=Ralf/&gt; Steiner emphasized Judaism's central importance to the constitution of the modern era in the West but suggested that to appreciate the spirituality of the future it would need to overcome its tendency toward abstraction.

In his later life, Steiner was accused by the [[Nazis]] of being a Jew, and [[Adolf Hitler]] called anthroposophy &quot;Jewish methods&quot;. The anthroposophical institutions in Germany were banned during Nazi rule and several anthroposophists sent to concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Staudenmeier, [https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/17662/Staudenmaier%2C%20Peter.pdf?sequence=1 Between Occultism and Facism] - Anthroposophy and the Politics of Race and
Nation in Germany and Italy 1900-1945, Cornell University (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo Ravagli, ''Unter Hammer und Hakenkreuz: Der völkisch-nationalsozialistische Kampf gegen die Anthroposophie'', Verlag Freies Geistesleben, {{ISBN|3-7725-1915-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Important early anthroposophists who were Jewish included two central members on the executive boards of the precursors to the modern Anthroposophical Society,&lt;ref&gt;[http://biographien.kulturimpuls.org/detail.php?&amp;id=24 Adolf Arenson] (board member 1904-1913) and [http://biographien.kulturimpuls.org/detail.php?&amp;id=724 Carl Unger] (board member 1908-1923)&lt;/ref&gt; and Karl König, the founder of the [[Camphill movement]], who had converted to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Paddock and Mado Spiegler: Judaism and Anthroposophy, pp. 125-126&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Buber]] and [[Hugo Bergmann]], who viewed Steiner's social ideas as a solution to the [[Arab–Israeli conflict|Arab–Jewish conflict]], were also influenced by anthroposophy.&lt;ref&gt;Paddock &amp; Spiegler 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous anthroposophical organisations in [[Israel]], including the anthroposophical [[kibbutz]] [[Harduf]], founded by [[Jesaiah Ben-Aharon]], forty Waldorf kindergartens and seventeen [[Waldorf schools]] (stand as of 2018).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freunde-waldorf.de/fileadmin/user_upload/images/Waldorf_World_List/Waldorf_World_List.pdf Statistics for Waldorf schools worldwide]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of these organizations are striving to foster positive relationships between the Arab and Jewish populations: The Harduf Waldorf school includes both Jewish and Arab faculty and students, and has extensive contact with the surrounding Arab communities, while the first joint Arab-Jewish kindergarten was a Waldorf program in Hilf near [[Haifa]].

===Christian Community===
{{Main|Christian Community}}
Towards the end of Steiner's life, a group of theology students (primarily Lutheran, with some Roman Catholic members) approached Steiner for help in reviving Christianity, in particular &quot;to bridge the widening gulf between modern science and the world of spirit&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt; They approached a notable [[Lutheran]] pastor, [[Friedrich Rittelmeyer]], who was already working with Steiner's ideas, to join their efforts. Out of their co-operative endeavor, the ''Movement for Religious Renewal'', now generally known as [[The Christian Community]], was born. Steiner emphasized that he considered this movement, and his role in creating it, to be independent of his anthroposophical work,&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt; as he wished anthroposophy to be independent of any particular [[religion]] or religious denomination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;/&gt;

===Scientific basis===
Though Rudolf Steiner studied [[natural science]] at the Vienna Technical University at the undergraduate level, his [[doctorate]] was in epistemology and very little of his work is directly concerned with the empirical sciences. In his mature work, when he did refer to science it was often to present phenomenological or [[Goethean science]] as an alternative to what he considered the materialistic science of his contemporaries.&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt;

Steiner's primary interest was in applying the methodology of science to realms of inner experience and the spiritual worlds (his appreciation that the essence of science is its method of inquiry is unusual among [[esoteric]]ists&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt;), and Steiner called anthroposophy ''[[Geisteswissenschaft]]'' (science of the mind, cultural/spiritual science), a term generally used in German to refer to the [[humanities]] and [[social science]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philolex.de/geistwis.htm |title=Philolex entry |publisher=Philolex.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether this is a sufficient basis for anthroposophy to be considered a spiritual science has been a matter of controversy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;&gt;Carlo Willmann, ''Waldorfpädagogik: Theologische und religionspädagogische Befunde'', {{ISBN|3-412-16700-2}}, Chap. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HammerB&gt;Olav Hammer, ''Claiming Knowledge: Strategies of Epistemology from Theosophy to the New Age'', Brill 2004, pp. 243, 329, 204, 225&amp;ndash;8&lt;/ref&gt; As Freda Easton explained in her study of Waldorf schools, &quot;Whether one accepts anthroposophy as a science depends upon whether one accepts Steiner's interpretation of a science that extends the consciousness and capacity of human beings to experience their inner spiritual world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Freda Easton, ''The Waldorf Impulse in Education'', Columbia University dissertation 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sven Ove Hansson]] has disputed anthroposophy's claim to a scientific basis, stating that its ideas are not empirically derived and neither reproducible nor testable.&lt;ref&gt;Sven Ove Hansson, ''Is Anthroposophy Science?'', Professor, Philosophy Unit of the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology, in Conceptus XXV (1991), No. 64, pp. 37&amp;ndash;49.&lt;/ref&gt; Carlo Willmann points out that as, on its own terms, anthroposophical methodology offers no possibility of being falsified except through its own procedures of spiritual investigation, no [[intersubjectivity|intersubjective validation]] is possible by conventional scientific methods; it thus cannot stand up to empiricist critics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;/&gt; Peter Schneider describes such objections as untenable, asserting that that if a non-sensory, non-physical realm exists, then according to Steiner the experiences of pure thinking possible within the normal realm of consciousness would already be experiences of that, and it would be impossible to exclude the possibility of empirically grounded experiences of other supersensory content.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;/&gt;

Olav Hammer suggests that anthroposophy carries [[scientism]] &quot;to lengths unparalleled in any other Esoteric position&quot; due to its dependence upon claims of clairvoyant experience, its subsuming natural science under &quot;spiritual science.&quot; Hammer also asserts that the development of what she calls &quot;fringe&quot; sciences such as [[anthroposophic medicine]] and [[biodynamic agriculture]] are justified partly on the basis of the ethical and ecological values they promote, rather than purely on a scientific basis.&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt;

Though Steiner saw that spiritual vision itself is difficult for others to achieve, he recommended open-mindedly exploring and rationally testing the results of such research; he also urged others to follow a spiritual training that would allow them directly to apply his methods to achieve comparable results.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;/&gt;

[[Anthony Storr]] stated about Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophy: &quot;His belief system is so eccentric, so unsupported by evidence, so manifestly bizarre, that rational skeptics are bound to consider it delusional....  But, whereas Einstein's way of perceiving the world by thought became confirmed by experiment and mathematical proof, Steiner's remained intensely subjective and insusceptible of objective confirmation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Storr|first1=Anthony|author-link1=Anthony Storr|year=1997|orig-year=1996|chapter=IV.

===Religious nature===
As an explicitly spiritual movement, anthroposophy has sometimes been called a religious philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=anthroposophy definition - Dictionary - MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561500913/anthroposophy.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125142135/http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561500913/anthroposophy.html |archivedate=2009-11-25 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 [[PLANS (Non-profit)|People for Legal and Non-Sectarian Schools (PLANS)]] started a lawsuit alleging that anthroposophy is a religion for [[Establishment Clause]] purposes and therefore several California school districts  should not be chartering Waldorf schools; the lawsuit was dismissed in 2012 for failure to show anthroposophy was a religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= PLANS, Inc. v. Sacramento City Unified School District|vol= |reporter= |opinion=2:98-cv-00266-FCD-EFB|pinpoint= |court=United States District Court Eastern District of California|date=November 5, 2010|url=http://waldorfanswers.org/351MemorandumAndOrder4November2010.pdf |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, a French court ruled that a government minister's description of anthroposophy as a cult was defamatory.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of State]], [https://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6aa9918.html ''U.S. Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices 2000 - France''], 26 Feb. 2001 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Statements on race===
Anthroposophical ideas have been criticized from both sides in the race debate:

* From the mid-1930s on, National Socialist ideologues attacked the anthroposophical world-view as being opposed to Nazi racist and nationalistic principles; anthroposophy considered &quot;Blood, Race and Folk&quot; as primitive instincts that must be overcome.&lt;ref&gt;Jakob Wilhelm Hauer, 7. Februar 1935. BAD R 4901&amp;ndash;3285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Report of the SD-Hauptamtes Berlin: &quot;Anthroposophy”, May 1936, BAD Z/B I 904.&lt;/ref&gt;
* An academic analysis of the educational approach noted that &quot;a naive version of the evolution of consciousness, a theory foundational to both Steiner's anthroposophy and Waldorf education, sometimes places one race below another in one or another dimension of development&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McDermott&quot;&gt;Ray McDermott et al.: [https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF02354381 ''Waldorf education in an inner-city public school''.] ''The Urban Review'', Volume 28, Number 2 / June, 1996, pp. 119&amp;ndash;140&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to such critiques, the [[Anthroposophical Society]] in America published a statement clarifying its stance:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We explicitly reject any racial theory that may be construed to be part of Rudolf Steiner's writings. The Anthroposophical Society in America is an open, public society and it rejects any purported spiritual or scientific theory on the basis of which the alleged superiority of one race is justified at the expense of another race.&lt;ref&gt;The General Council of the Anthroposophical Society in America (1998) [https://web.archive.org/web/20080106140711/http://www.anthroposophy.org/Gov/StatementOnDiversity.php Position Statement on Diversity].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
