She retired from politics at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]]. Since 2002, she has also made numerous television and radio appearances, including as a television presenter. A prominent [[Euroscepticism in the United Kingdom|Eurosceptic]], in 2016 she supported the [[Vote Leave]] campaign to [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|withdraw the United Kingdom]] from the [[European Union]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Bath, Somerset]], Widdecombe is the daughter of Rita Noreen (''née'' Plummer; 1911–2007) and [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] civil servant James Murray Widdecombe. Widdecombe's maternal grandfather, James Henry Plummer, was born to a [[Catholic]] family of English descent in [[Crosshaven]], [[County Cork]], [[Ireland]] in 1874.

She attended the Royal Naval School in [[Singapore]],&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCRet&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7032992.stm Ann Widdecombe set to stand down]; [[BBC News]], 7 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and La Sainte Union [[Convent]] School in Bath.&lt;ref name=AboutAnn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annwiddecombe.com/text.aspx?id=52|title=About Ann|publisher=annwiddecombe.com|accessdate=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then read [[Latin]] at the [[University of Birmingham]] and later attended [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford]], to read [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] (PPE).&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot; /&gt; While studying at Oxford, she lived next door to [[Mary Archer]], [[Edwina Currie]], and [[Gyles Brandreth]]'s wife Michèle Brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Have I Got News For You, Series 25 Episode 6 with Hugh Dennis, Gyles Brandreth &amp; Martin Freeman|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTZWT0OMpy0}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked for [[Unilever]] (1973–75) and then as an administrator at the [[University of London]] (1975–87) before entering Parliament.&lt;ref name=AboutAnn /&gt;

==Political career==
From 1976 to 1978, Widdecombe was a [[councillor]] on [[Runnymede (borough)|Runnymede District]] Council in Surrey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/nov/03/uk.conservatives|title=Seeing something of the light at the end of the tunnel|date=3 November 2003|work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=6 December 2008  | first=Jackie | last=Ashley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She contested the seat of [[Burnley (UK Parliament constituency)|Burnley]] in Lancashire in the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] and then, against [[David Owen]], the [[Plymouth Devonport (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth Devonport]] seat in the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge79/i04.htm|title=UK General Election results May 1979|date=3 May 1979|work=Political Science Resources|publisher=Richard Kimber|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925040210/http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge79/i04.htm|archivedate=25 September 2006|accessdate=16 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge83/i16.htm|title=UK General Election results June 1983|date=9 June 1983|work=Political Science Resources|publisher=Richard Kimber|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320065802/http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge83/i16.htm|archivedate=20 March 2008|accessdate=16 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widdecombe was first elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], in the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]] as member for the constituency of [[Maidstone (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidstone]] (which became [[Maidstone and The Weald (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidstone and The Weald]] in 1997).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/guide/seat-profiles/maidstoneandtheweald Maidstone and The Weald], UKPollingReport&lt;/ref&gt;

===In government===
Widdecombe joined [[John Major]]'s government as [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] for Social Security in 1990. In 1993, she was moved to the [[Department of Employment]], and she was promoted to [[Minister of State]] the following year. In 1995, she joined the [[Home Office]] as Minister of State for Prisons and visited every prison in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/talking_politics/104160.stm|title=Ann Widdecombe&amp;nbsp;– political sketch |work=BBC Online |accessdate=17 June 2009 |date=2 June 1998 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shadow Cabinet===
After the Conservative landslide defeat at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], she served as [[Shadow Secretary of State for Health|Shadow Health Secretary]] between 1998–1999 and later as [[Shadow Home Secretary]] from 1999 to 2001 under the leadership of [[William Hague]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/person/5516/ann-widdecombe|title=Ann Widdecombe: Electoral history and profile|work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=22 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership contest and backbenches===
During the [[2001 Conservative Party (UK) leadership election|2001 Conservative leadership election]], she could not find sufficient support amongst Conservative MPs for her leadership candidacy. She first supported [[Michael Ancram]], who was eliminated in the first round, and then [[Kenneth Clarke]], who lost in the final round. She afterwards declined to serve in [[Shadow Cabinet of Iain Duncan Smith|Iain Duncan Smith's Shadow Cabinet]] (although she indicated on the television programme ''[[When Louis Met...]]'', prior to the leadership contest, that she wished to retire to the [[backbenches]] anyway).

In the [[2005 Conservative Party (UK) leadership election|2005 leadership election]], she initially supported Kenneth Clarke again. Once he was eliminated, she turned support towards [[Liam Fox]]. Following Fox's subsequent elimination, she took time to reflect before finally declaring for [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]]. She expressed reservations over the eventual winner [[David Cameron]], feeling that he did not, like the other candidates, have a proven track record, and she was later a leading figure in parliamentary opposition to his A-List policy, which she has said is &quot;an insult to women&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1221684/David-Cameron-risks-fury-Tory-grass-roots-plans-women-shortlists.html |title=Cameron cuties: Tory anger as leader calls for all-women MP shortlists |work=Daily Mail | location=London | first=Jason | last=Groves | date=21 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the October 2006 Conservative Conference, she was Chief Dragon in a political version of the television programme ''[[Dragons' Den]]'', in which A-list candidates were invited to put forward a policy proposal, which was then torn apart by her team of [[Rachel Elnaugh]], [[Oliver Letwin]] and [[Michael Brown (British politician)|Michael Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dale|first1=Iain|title=Taking the media beast to the dragon's den|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/oct/03/whenyouvegotnothingtowrit|accessdate=17 February 2018|work=The Guardian|date=3 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' in September 2006 she stated that if Parliament were of a normal length, it was likely she would retire at the next general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Andrew Williams |title=60 Seconds: Ann Widdecombe |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/fame/interviews/article.html?in_article_id=19578&amp;in_page_id=11 |work=Metro |date=11 September 2006 |accessdate=6 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225229/http://www.metro.co.uk/fame/interviews/article.html?in_article_id=19578&amp;in_page_id=11| archivedate= 26 September 2007 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; She confirmed her intention to stand down to ''[[The Observer]]'''s Pendennis diary in September 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;Pendennis&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Marre |first=Oliver |title=Widdy knows the way to a man's heart |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/7days/story/0,,2160786,00.html |work=The Observer |location=London |date=2 September 2007 |accessdate=7 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in October 2007 after Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] quashed speculation of an autumn 2007 general election.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7032992.stm |work=BBC News  |title=Ann Widdecombe set to stand down | date=8 October 2007 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, she moved into the house of an [[Islington]] Labour Councillor to experience life on a [[council estate]], her response to her experience being &quot;Five years ago I made a speech in the House of Commons about the forgotten decents. I have spent the last week on estates in the Islington area finding out that they are still forgotten.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Anne gets taste of council estate life | date=22 November 2006 | accessdate=28 November 2006 | work=Islington Gazette |url=http://www.islingtongazette.co.uk/content/islington/gazette/news/story.aspx?brand=ISLGOnline&amp;category=news&amp;tBrand=northlondon24&amp;tCategory=newsislg&amp;itemid=WeED22%20Nov%202006%2013%3A00%3A30%3A717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widdecombe was one of the 98 MPs who voted to keep their expense details secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article1816072.ece |work=The Times |location=London |title=How your MP voted on the FOI Bill |date=20 May 2007 |accessdate=25 April 2010 |first1=Philippe |last1=Naughton |first2=Miles |last2=Costello}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the expenses claims were [[United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal|leaked]], however, Widdecombe was described by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' as one of the &quot;saints&quot; amongst all MPs.&lt;ref name=&quot;TGEx&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title = MPs' expenses: The saints (Part i) |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5342811/MPs-expenses-The-saints-Part-i.html?image=5 |accessdate=21 June 2009 |date=18 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090521124714/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5342811/MPs-expenses-The-saints-Part-i.html?image=5| archivedate= 21 May 2009 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, following the resignation of [[Michael Martin, Baron Martin of Springburn|Michael Martin]] as [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]], it was reported that Widdecombe was gathering support for election as interim Speaker until the next general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Speaker: Runners and riders|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8057450.stm |work=BBC |date=21 May 2009 |accessdate=21 May 2009 |location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090521094143/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8057450.stm| archivedate= 21 May 2009 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 June 2009, she confirmed her bid to be the Speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8094377.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Ann Widdecombe seeks Speaker role | date=11 June 2009 | accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made it through to the second ballot but came last and was eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8111887.stm |title=Two left in Commons Speaker race |accessdate=22 June 2009 |date=22 June 2009 |publisher=BBC online |location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090622191726/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8111887.stm| archivedate= 22 June 2009 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widdecombe retired from politics at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]]. It was rumoured that she would be a Conservative candidate for [[Police and Crime Commissioner]] in 2012, but she refused. She has since spoken about her opposition to the Coalition Government and her surprise at not being given a peerage by [[David Cameron]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chorley&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/04/15/ann-widdecombe-on-hating-the-coalition-doing-big-brother-and-her-rude-autobiography/ |title=Ann Widdecombe on hating the coalition, doing Big Brother and her rude autobiography |work=independent.co.uk |location=London |first=Matt |last=Chorley |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622114535/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/04/15/ann-widdecombe-on-hating-the-coalition-doing-big-brother-and-her-rude-autobiography/ |archivedate=22 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, she supported [[Brexit]] during the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 EU referendum]] and, following the resignation of [[David Cameron]], endorsed [[Andrea Leadsom]] in her candidacy for [[2016 Conservative Party (UK) leadership election|election for the leadership of the governing Conservative Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/comment/columnists/ann-widdecombe/652956/Why-I-back-Brexit-Ann-Widdecombe|title=Here's why I back Brexit - says ANN WIDDECOMBE|first=Ann|last=Widdecombe|date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/comment/columnists/ann-widdecombe/686700/Andrea-Leadsom-picked-Tory-prime-minister-MPs-Brexit|title=Tories NEED to pick Angela Leadsom as leader: ANN WIDDECOMBE calls for LEAVE-backing PM|first=Ann|last=Widdecombe|date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to politics – Brexit Party===
In 2019 she returned to politics as a candidate for the [[Brexit Party]] in the [[2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|European parliament elections]] in [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)|South West England]], which were held on 23 May, though she maintained that she would still vote for the Conservatives in the local elections that took place three weeks before.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot; /&gt; She was expelled by the Conservative Party immediately after her announcement.&lt;ref name=&quot;expelled&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1118490/Brexit-news-UK-Brexit-Party-Ann-Widdecombe-Conservative-Party-Farage-European-elections |title=Ann Widdecombe reveals she has been EXPELLED from Tories after defection to Brexit Party |work=Express online |date=24 April 2019 |accessdate=14 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widdecombe had considered joining the Brexit Party in March 2019, but joined later, in May.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDF9o0aBtRE Iain Dale Interviews: Ann Widdecombe]&lt;/ref&gt;

Widdecombe said that her decision to stand resulted from the Government's failure to deliver Britain's departure from the EU on schedule. &quot;Both major parties need a seismic shock,&quot; she said, &quot;to see the extent of public disgust.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;expelled&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot; /&gt; She subsequently won her seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brexit Party's Ann Widdecombe wins South West seat |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-48417344 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |accessdate=14 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widdecombe became a member of the [[European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs]] (LIBE).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sed/doc/news/flash/22641/List%20of%20committees_for%20CoP_rev3_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Widdecombe stood as a candidate for [[Plymouth Sutton and Devonport (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth Sutton and Devonport]] in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 UK general election]], coming a distant third but retaining her deposit with 5.5% of the vote. [[Nigel Farage]] claimed that she was told by the Conservative Party that she would be part of their Brexit negotiations if she stood down as a candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/14/nigel-farage-says-he-is-unlikely-to-vote-for-any-party-in-election|title=Ann Widdecombe 'was offered Brexit talks role to stand down as Farage candidate'|work=The Guardian|date=14 November 2019 |accessdate=22 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
===Social issues===
As an MP, Widdecombe expressed socially conservative views, including opposition to abortion; it was understood during her time in frontline politics that she would not become [[Secretary of State for Health|Health Secretary]] as long as this involved responsibility for abortions. Although a committed Christian, she has characterised the issue as one of life and death on which her view had been the same when she was agnostic&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-1999&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/280692.stm|title=Ann Widdecombe answers your questions|date=16 February 1999|work=BBC News|accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a member of the [[Society for the Protection of Unborn Children]]&lt;!-- source says &quot;society for the protection of the unborn child&quot;, but most likely refers to SPUC --&gt; while studying at Oxford.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roth&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/20/profiles.parliament16|title=Ann Widdecombe|last1=Roth|first1=Andrew|date=20 March 2001|work=The Guardian|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She converted from the [[Church of England]] to the Catholic Church following the decision of the Church of England on the [[Ordination of women in the Anglican Communion|ordination of women as priests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/112152.stm|title=Widdecombe rejects abortion role|date=13 June 1998|work=BBC News|accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminal justice===
In her speech at the 2000 Conservative conference, she called for a [[zero tolerance]] policy of prosecution, with the punishment of £100 fines for users of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. This was well received by rank-and-file Conservative delegates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/oct/06/drugsandalcohol.conservatives2000|title=Widdecombe fights back firm|last=Watt|first=Nicholas|date=6 October 2000|work=The Guardian|accessdate=22 August 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, Widdecombe has expressed her support for a reintroduction of the death penalty, which was abolished in the UK in 1965. She notably spoke of her support for its reintroduction for the worst cases of murder in the aftermath of the murder of two 10-year-old girls from [[Soham]], Cambridgeshire, in August 2002, in the [[Soham murders]]. She supported the argument that the death penalty would have deterrent value, as within five years of its abolition the national murder rate had more than doubled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2204738.stm|title=UK &amp;#124; Politics &amp;#124; Death penalty call renewed|date=21 August 2002|work=BBC News|accessdate=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental and science issues===
She is a committed animal lover and one of the few Conservative MPs to have consistently voted for the ban on [[fox hunting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/mp.php?mpid=1701&amp;dmp=1050 &quot;Ann Widdecombe compared to 'Fox hunting&amp;nbsp;– Ban'&quot;], [[Public Whip]]. Retrieved on 21 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Widdecombe was among more than 20 high-profile people who signed a letter to Members of Parliament in 2015 to oppose David Cameron's plan to amend the [[Hunting Act 2004]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.stv.tv/scotland-decides/news/1324609-snp-to-vote-against-tories-on-fox-hunting-ban-in-england-and-wales/|title=SNP to vote against Tories on fox hunting ban in England and Wales|date=13 July 2015|work=STV|accessdate=17 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715203740/http://news.stv.tv/scotland-decides/news/1324609-snp-to-vote-against-tories-on-fox-hunting-ban-in-england-and-wales/|archivedate=15 July 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has expressed a variety of views on scientific issues such as [[climate change]] but has been opposed to legislation reducing emissions. Her views on the subject appear to have hardened over time. In 2007, she wrote that she did not want to belittle the issue but was sceptical of the claims that specific actions would prevent catastrophe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/2489/Switching-lightbulbs-won-t-save-the-world|title=Switching Lightbulbs won't change the world|date=21 March 2007|publisher=Express.co.uk|accessdate=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; then in 2008 that her doubts had been &quot;crystalised&quot; by Nigel Lawson's book ''[[An Appeal to Reason]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/ourcomments/view/48856|title=Yes, I am a heretic on global warming|date=18 June 2008|publisher=Express.co.uk|accessdate=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; before stating in 2009 that &quot;There is no climate change, hasn’t anybody looked out of their window recently?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/79580/Now-the-EU-wants-to-ban-your-plasma-television|title=Article including refutation of any global warming|date=12 January 2009|publisher=Express.co.uk|accessdate=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of the five MPs who voted against the [[Climate Change Act 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2008-10-28&amp;number=298|title=Climate Change Bill&amp;nbsp;— Third Reading (and other amendments)|date=28 October 2008|publisher=The Public Whip|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 she expressed the view that &quot;climate change money should go to armed services&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Express&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/ourcomments/view/262765|title=Climate change money should go to armed services|newspaper=[[Daily Express]]|accessdate=9 October 2012|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous year, she voted to support a parliamentary motion supporting [[homeopathy]], criticising the Science and Technology Committee's Report on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2009-10/908|title=UK Parliament Early day motion 908|date=23 February 2010|publisher=Parliament UK|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homosexuality===
Widdecombe supported the UK's [[Sexual Offences Act 1967|partial decriminalisation of homosexuality in 1967]]. After that, Widdecombe consistently opposed further reforms while in Parliament. Out of the 17 parliamentary votes between 1998 and 2008 considered by the [[Public Whip]] website to concern equal rights for homosexuals, Widdecombe took the opposing position in 15 cases, not being present at the other two votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/mp.php?mpid=1701&amp;dmp=826 &quot;Ann Widdecombe compared to 'Homosexuality&amp;nbsp;– Equal rights'&quot;], [[Public Whip]]. Retrieved on 24 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Widdecombe stated that &quot;I do not think that [homosexuality] can be promoted as an equally valid lifestyle to [heterosexual] marriage, but I would say the same about irregular heterosexual arrangements.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-1999&quot; /&gt;

She has consistently argued against an equal [[age of consent]] for same-sex relationships, voting against a [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|1994 Act]] (which would have [[Age of consent reform in the United Kingdom|reduced the age of consent]] for some male-male sexual activity from 21 to 18), secondly in 1998 (arguing against a further reduction from 18 to 16, which later occurred [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000|in 2000]]);&lt;ref name=&quot;Roth2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Andrew|title=Ann (Noreen) WIDDECOMBE|url=http://internetserver.bishopsgate.org.uk/files/Parliamentary%20Profiles%20Archive/S-Z/WIDDECOMBE,%20Anne/WIDDECOMBE,%20Anne.pdf|journal=Parliamentary Profile Services Ltd|page=4|accessdate=7 September 2018|authorlink1=Andrew Roth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;May1998&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Protect your sons from legal gay sex at 16|last1=Widdecombe|first1=Ann|date=24 May 1998|work=[[The Mail on Sunday]]|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the latter point, she wrote in ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' that &quot;one of the sundry horrors for which this Government is likely to be remembered will be that it gave its [[wikt:imprimatur|imprimatur]] to sodomy at 16&quot;, adding that if the age of consent was equalised, &quot;there will be no protection for the vulnerable and confused against the predatory attentions of older men&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;May1998&quot; /&gt; She later said in 2000: &quot;I do not believe that issues of equality should override the imperatives of protecting the young.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/feb/11/uk.politicalnews1|title=Commons approves bill to lower gay age of consent|date=11 February 2000|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2 June 2015|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Widdecombe opposed the repeal of [[Section 28]] of the [[Local Government Act 1988|Local Government Act]], which banned the [[promotion of homosexuality]] by local governments.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} In 2012, Widdecombe voiced support in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' for the practise of [[conversion therapy]], which claims to change the orientation of homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/comment/columnists/ann-widdecombe/299271/Helping-those-who-aren-t-glad-to-be-gay|title=Helping those who aren't glad to be gay|last1=Widdecombe|first1=Ann|date=1 February 2012|website=The Daily Express|language=en|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/02/02/anne-widdecome-defends-gay-conversion-therapy_n_1249697.html|title=Ann Widdecombe Defends Gay Conversion Therapy|last1=Simons|first1=Ned|date=2 February 2012|website=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widdecombe has also expressed her opposition to [[Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom|same-sex marriage]], introduced by [[David Cameron]]'s government in 2014, arguing that &quot;the state must have a preferred model&quot; and &quot;a union that is generally open to procreation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/06/ann-widdecombe-david-cameron-listen-people|title=Ann Widdecombe: 'I wish David Cameron would listen to people'|last=Moss|first=Stephen|date=6 June 2013|work=The Guardian|accessdate=8 February 2014|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In 1990, following the assassination of the Conservative politician [[Ian Gow]] by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), the [[1990 Eastbourne by-election|Eastbourne by-election]] for his seat in the House of Commons was won by the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] [[David Bellotti]]. Upon the announcement, Widdecombe told the voters that the IRA would be &quot;toasting their success&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roth&quot; /&gt;

In 1996, Widdecombe, as prisons minister, defended the Government's policy to [[Use of restraints on pregnant women|shackle pregnant prisoners]] with handcuffs and chains when in hospital receiving ante-natal care. Widdecombe told the Commons the restrictions were needed to prevent prisoners from escaping. &quot;Some MPs may like to think that a pregnant woman would not or could not escape. Unfortunately this is not true. The fact is that hospitals are not secure places in which to keep prisoners, and since 1990, 20 women have escaped from hospitals&quot;. [[Jack Straw]], Labour's Home Affairs spokesman at the time, said it was &quot;degrading and unnecessary&quot; for a woman to be shackled at any stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chaining-women-backed-1323238.html|title=Chaining women backed|date=10 January 1996|work=The Independent|accessdate=20 October 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101012143641/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chaining-women-backed-1323238.html|archivedate=12 October 2010 |url-status=live|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/mar/18/fiction1|title=Hague's head girl|date=18 March 2000|work=The Guardian|accessdate=20 October 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916011112/http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2000/mar/18/fiction1|archivedate=16 September 2010 |url-status=live|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1997, in the context of an inquiry into a series of prison escapes, Widdecombe remarked of former Home Secretary [[Michael Howard]], under whom she had served, that there is &quot;something of the night&quot; about him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/widdecombe-goes-for-the-jugular-1261224.html?amp|title=Widdecombe goes for the jugular|last1=Sengupta|first1=Kim|date=12 May 1997|work=The Independent|accessdate=3 April 2017|last2=Abrams|first2=Fran}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This much quoted comment is thought to have contributed to failure of Howard's [[1997 Conservative Party leadership election|1997 bid for the Conservative Party leadership]], including by Howard and Widdecombe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8435904.stm|title=Ann Widdecombe 'tested out' Howard quip|work=BBC News|date=31 December 2009|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crick|first=Michael|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mission-accomplished-how-howard-was-knifed-757lktbmgdt|title='Mission accomplished': how Howard was knifed|work=The Times|date=30 March 2005|accessdate=3 April 2017}} {{subscription required}} Extract from Crick's book ''In search of Michael Howard''.&lt;/ref&gt; and led to him being caricatured as a [[vampire]], in part due to his [[Romania]]n ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holland|first1=David|title=Interview with a Vampire|url=http://thetab.com/uk/cambridge/2011/05/03/interview-with-a-vampire-2630|work=The Tab|date=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such characterisations caused discontent among members of Britain's Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Freedland|first1=Jonathan|title=The trailblazer|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/oct/31/conservatives.politicalcolumnists|work=The Guardian|date=31 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Raphael2015&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n_RBCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT68|title=Anti-Semitism: (Provocations)|author=Frederic Raphael|date=25 August 2015|publisher=Biteback Publishing|isbn=978-1-84954-962-2|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard still became party leader in 2003, and Widdecombe then stated, &quot;I explained fully what my objections were in 1997 and I do not retract anything I said then.

In 2001, when [[Michael Portillo]] was running for leader of the Conservative Party, Widdecombe described him and his allies as &quot;[[wikt:backbiter|backbiters]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;news.bbc.co.uk&quot; /&gt; due to his alleged destabilising influence under Hague.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heppell2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4G0AAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA143|title=Choosing the Tory Leader: Conservative Party Leadership Elections from Heath to Cameron|author=Timothy Heppell|date=28 November 2007|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85771-134-2|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to say that, should he be appointed leader, she would never give him her allegiance.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.bbc.co.uk&quot; /&gt; This was amidst a [[homophobic]] campaign led by socially conservative critics of Portillo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heppell2007&quot; /&gt;

In 2019 Widdecombe defended comments she made in a 2012 article that supported &quot;gay conversion&quot; therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.express.co.uk/comment/columnists/ann-widdecombe/299271/Helping-those-who-aren-t-glad-to-be-gay|title=Helping those who aren't glad to be gay|date=1 February 2012|work=Daily Mirror|accessdate=2 June 2019|location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; She told [[Sky News]] that science may yet &quot;provide an answer&quot; to the question of whether people can &quot;switch sexuality&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.sky.com/story/ann-widdecombe-science-may-produce-an-answer-to-homosexuality-11733559|title=Ann Widdecombe: Science may 'produce an answer' to homosexuality|date=2 June 2019|work=Sky News|accessdate=2 June 2019|location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Widdecombe's apparent endorsement of conversion therapy, at least one venue, the Landmark theatre in [[Ilfracombe]], [[Devon]], cancelled a performance of her one-woman show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/05/ann-widdecombe-one-woman-show-pulled-after-gay-therapy-remark|title=Ann Widdecombe one-woman show pulled after gay therapy remark|last=Weaver|first=Matthew|date=5 June 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=5 June 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widdecombe was elected as a [[Member of the European Parliament]] for the [[Brexit Party]] on 23 May 2019 in the [[2019 European Parliament election|European elections]]. On 3 July 2019 she used her maiden speech in Strasbourg to compare Brexit to slaves revolting against their owners and to a colonised country rising up against occupying forces, a stance which was criticized by members of both the European Parliament and the British House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/video-anne-widdecombe-says-brexitu-ilike-slaves-rising-up-against-owners-2019-7|title=Brexit Party's Ann Widdecombe condemned for 'disgraceful' remarks comparing the EU to slave owners|last1=Payne|first1=Adam|last2=Colson|first2=Thomas|website=Business Insider|accessdate=4 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/04/ann-widdecombe-likens-brexit-to-emancipation-of-slaves|title=Ann Widdecombe likens Brexit to emancipation of slaves|last1=Boffey|first1=Daniel|date=4 July 2019|website=The Guardian|accessdate=4 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48869520|title=Widdecombe's slavery remarks 'disgusting'|last1=Scott|first1=Jennifer|date=4 July 2019|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widdecombe has been criticised for appearances on the [[David Icke]]-affiliated ''[[Richie Allen Show]]'', which has promoted [[Holocaust denial]] and [[antisemitic conspiracy theories]] about [[Rothschild family|the Rothschilds]] and [[Zionism]]. Widdecombe appeared three times between August 2017 and April 2019 and was described as an &quot;old friend of the show&quot; by the host during one appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Erich, Ben (18 August 2019).
