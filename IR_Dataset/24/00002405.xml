'''Aon plc''' is a large global professional services firm that sells a range of financial risk-mitigation products, including insurance, pension administration, and health-insurance plans.{{solution-inline|date=October 2019}} Aon has approximately 50,000 employees in 120 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aon.com/about-aon/about-aon.jsp |title=About Aon |work=Aon |accessdate=7 August 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170808011445/http://aon.com/about-aon/about-aon.jsp |archivedate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aon was created in 1982 when the Ryan Insurance Group merged with the [[Combined Insurance|Combined Insurance Company of America]]. In 1987, that company was renamed Aon, a [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] word meaning &quot;[[one]]&quot;.

==History==
[[File:Aon Center LA.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Aon Center (Los Angeles)|Aon Center]], Los Angeles]]

[[W. Clement Stone]]'s mother bought a small Detroit insurance agency, and in 1918 brought her son into the business. Mr. Stone sold low-cost, low-benefit accident insurance, underwriting and issuing policies on-site. The next year he founded his own agency, the '''Combined Registry Co.'''

As the [[Great Depression]] began, Stone reduced his workforce and improved training. Forced by his son's respiratory illness to winter in the South, Stone moved to Arkansas and Texas. In 1939 he bought American Casualty Insurance Co. of Dallas, Texas. It was consolidated with other purchases as the [[Combined Insurance|Combined Insurance Co. of America]] in 1947. The company continued through the 1950s and 1960s, continuing to sell health and accident policies. In the 1970s, Combined expanded overseas despite being hit hard by the recession.

In 1982, after 10 years of stagnation under Clement Stone Jr., the elder Stone, then 79, resumed control until the completion of a [[merger]] with '''Ryan Insurance Co.''' allowed him to transfer control to [[Pat Ryan (executive)|Patrick Ryan]]. Ryan, the son of a Ford dealer in Wisconsin, had started his company as an auto credit insurer in 1964. In 1976, the company bought the insurance brokerage units of the [[JBS USA#Esmark|Esmark]] conglomerate. Ryan focused on insurance brokering and added more upscale insurance products. He also trimmed staff and took other cost-cutting measures, and in 1987 he changed Combined's name to '''Aon'''. In 1992, he bought Dutch insurance broker '''Hudig-Langeveldt'''. In 1995, the company sold its remaining direct life insurance holdings to [[Genworth Financial|General Electric]] to focus on consulting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/27/business/ge-capital-to-acquire-an-insurer.html|title=GE Capital To Acquire An Insurer|date=27 December 1995|work=The New York Times|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102220859/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/27/business/ge-capital-to-acquire-an-insurer.html|archivedate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, it began offering hostile takeover insurance policies to small and mid-sized companies.

Aon built a global presence through purchases. In 1997, it bought The Minet Group, as well as insurance brokerage Alexander &amp; Alexander Services, Inc. in a deal that made Aon (temporarily) the largest insurance broker worldwide. The firm made no US buys in 1998, but doubled its employee base with purchases including Spain's largest retail insurance broker, Gil y Carvajal, and the formation of Aon Korea, the first non-Korean firm of its kind{{clarify|date=June 2010}} to be licensed there.

Responding to industry demands, Aon announced its new fee disclosure policy in 1999, and the company reorganised to focus on buying personal line insurance firms and to integrate its acquisitions. That year it bought Nikols Sedgwick Group, an Italian insurance firm, and formed RiskAttack (with [[Zurich Financial Services|Zurich US]]), a risk analysis and financial management concern aimed at technology companies. The cost of integrating its numerous purchases, however, hammered profits in 1999.

Despite its troubles, in 2000 Aon bought Reliance Group's accident and health insurance business, as well as Actuarial Sciences Associates, a compensation and employee benefits consulting company. Later in that year, however, the company decided to cut 6% of its workforce as part of a restructuring effort. In 2003, the company saw revenues increase primarily because of rate hikes in the insurance industry. Also that year, Endurance Specialty, a Bermuda-based underwriting operation that Aon helped to establish in November 2001 along with other investors, went public. The next year Aon sold most of its holdings in Endurance.

In late 2007, Aon announced the divestiture of its underwriting business. With this move, the firm sold off its two major underwriting subsidiaries: Combined Insurance Company of America (acquired by ACE Limited for $2.4 billion) and Sterling Life Insurance Company (purchased by Munich Re Group for $352 million). The low margin and capital-intensive nature of the underwriting industry was the primary reason for the firm's decision to divest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2007/12/17/85703.htm |title=Aon Sells Combined to ACE for $2.4 Billion; Sterling to Munich Re |work=Insurance Journal |date=17 December 2007 |accessdate=14 March 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525204803/http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2007/12/17/85703.htm |archivedate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/economy/2007-12-17-1549592899_x.htm |title=Aon sells two insurance units for $2.75B |work=USA Today |date=17 December 2007|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion of the move, Aon turned its attention to expanding its broking and consulting capabilities.

This growth strategy manifested in November 2008 when Aon announced it had acquired reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor Benfield Group Limited for $1.75 billion. The acquisition amplified the firm's broking capabilities, positioning Aon one of the largest players in the reinsurance brokerage industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2008/08/22/92993.htm|title=Aon to Acquire Broker Benfield for $1.75 Billion|author=Jerry Geisel|work=Insurance Journal|date=22 August 2008|accessdate=14 March 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525223414/http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2008/08/22/92993.htm|archivedate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Aon made its most significant acquisition to date with the purchase of Hewitt Associates for $4.9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20101001/NEWS/101009985 |title=Aon completes acquisition of Hewitt |work=Business Insurance |date=1 October 2010|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from drastically boosting Aon's human resources consulting capacity and entering the firm into the business process outsourcing industry, the move added 23,000 colleagues and more than $3 billion in revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/13/business/13insure.html?_r=0 |title=Aon Buys Hewitt in Move to Expand Its Consulting Arm |work=New York Times |date=12 July 2010 |accessdate=15 March 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601015124/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/13/business/13insure.html?_r=0 |archivedate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Aon announced that its headquarters would be moved from [[Chicago]] to London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970204542404577158633936346056|title=Aon Shifts Headquarters to London|last=Tadena|first=Nathalie|date=14 January 2013|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=10 May 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723003546/http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970204542404577158633936346056|archivedate=23 July 2015|url-status=|last2=Dean|first2=Jason|last3=Scism|first3=Leslie|url-access=subscription}} — Note: only first hundred or so words archived, but that is sufficient to support fact here.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 10 February 2017, Aon announced that it was selling its employee benefits outsourcing business to private equity firm [[The Blackstone Group]] for US$4.8 billion (£3.8 billion)&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aon-benefits-blackstone-exclusive-idUSKBN15O2TV|title=Exclusive: Blackstone to acquire Aon's benefits outsourcing for...|first=Greg|last=Roumeliotis|website=reuters.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803211754/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aon-benefits-blackstone-exclusive-idUSKBN15O2TV|archivedate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2020, Aon named Eric Andersen as president of Aon after co-president Michael O'Connor departed the company to pursue new opportunities. He will be reporting to Greg Case, the firm's CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2020/02/24/559233.htm|title=Aon Names Andersen President, While Former Co-President O'Connor Exits|date=2020-02-24|website=Insurance Journal|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===11 September attacks===
Aon's New York offices were on the 92nd and 98th–105th floors of the [[Two World Trade Center tenants|South Tower]] of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] at the time of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|11 September 2001 terrorist attack]]. When the North Tower was struck at 8:46&amp;nbsp;a.m., many executives began evacuating their employees from the upper floors of the South Tower. The evacuation of Aon's offices, ordered by Eric Eisenberg, was carried out quickly as 924 of the estimated 1,100 Aon employees present at the time managed to evacuate the building before [[United Airlines Flight 175]] struck it twenty stories below them at 9:03&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/update-on-dead-missing-at-world-trade-center-firms |title=Companies slowly add to WTC reports |author=Shawn Langlois |work=CBS.MarketWatch.com |date=14 September 2001 |accessdate=23 February 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013004109/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/update-on-dead-missing-at-world-trade-center-firms |archivedate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many were influenced to stay by security guards and security announcements, or did not exit the building in time. As a result, 176 employees of Aon were killed in the attacks, including Eisenberg and [[Kevin Cosgrove]], a vice-president of the company, who was making a call to 911 when the tower collapsed at 9:59.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.investmentnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070911/REG/70911011 |title=Industry honors fallen on 9/11 anniversary |publisher=InvestmentNews |author=Aaron Siegel |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915130042/http://www.investmentnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20070911%2FREG%2F70911011 |archivedate=15 September 2007 |date=11 September 2007 |accessdate=23 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spitzer investigation===
In 2004–2005, Aon, along with other brokers including [[Marsh &amp; McLennan]] and [[Willis Group Holdings|Willis]], fell under regulatory investigation under [[New York Attorney General]] [[Eliot Spitzer]] and other [[State attorney general|state attorneys general]]. At issue was the practice of insurance companies' payments to brokers (known as contingent commissions). The payments were thought to bring a conflict of interest, swaying broker decisions on behalf of carriers, rather than customers. In the spring of 2005, without acknowledging any wrongdoing, Aon agreed to a $190 million [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]], payable over 30 months.

===UK regulatory breach===
In January 2009, Aon was fined £5.69 million in the UK by the Financial Services Authority, who stated that the fine related to the company's inadequate bribery and corruption controls, claiming that between 14 January 2005 and 30 September 2007 Aon had failed to properly assess the risks involved in its dealings with overseas firms and individuals. The Authority did not find that any money had actually made its way to illegal organisations. Aon qualified for a 30% discount on the fine as a result of its co-operation with the investigation. Aon said its conduct was not deliberate, adding it had since &quot;significantly strengthened and enhanced its controls around the usage of third parties&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ifaonline.co.uk/ifaonline/news/1348483/aon-hit-record-fsa-fine?page=ifa2006_articleimport&amp;tempPageName=833667 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725195637/http://www.ifaonline.co.uk/ifaonline/news/1348483/aon-hit-record-fsa-fine?page=ifa2006_articleimport&amp;tempPageName=833667 |url-status=dead |archive-date=25 July 2011 |title=Aon hit with record FSA fine |publisher=Ifaonline.co.uk |author=Scott Sinclair |date=8 January 2009 |accessdate=23 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations===
In December 2011, Aon Corporation paid a $16.26 million penalty to the [[US Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and the [[US Department of Justice]] (DOJ) for violations of the US [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.fbi.gov/washingtondc/press-releases/2011/aon-corporation-agrees-to-pay-a-1.76-million-criminal-penalty-to-resolve-violations-of-the-foreign-corrupt-practices-act| title=Aon Pays $1.76 Million Criminal Penalty| author=The FBI| publisher=The FBI| date=20 December 2011| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510003229/http://www.fbi.gov/washingtondc/press-releases/2011/aon-corporation-agrees-to-pay-a-1.76-million-criminal-penalty-to-resolve-violations-of-the-foreign-corrupt-practices-act| archivedate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the SEC, Aon's subsidiaries made improper payments of over $3.6 million to government officials and third-party facilitators in [[Costa Rica]], [[Egypt]], [[Vietnam]], [[Indonesia]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Myanmar]] and [[Bangladesh]], between 1983 and 2007, to obtain and retain insurance contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
