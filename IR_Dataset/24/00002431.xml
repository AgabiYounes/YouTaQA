A '''minute of arc''', '''arcminute''' (arcmin), '''arc minute''', or '''minute arc''' is a unit of [[Angular unit|angular]] measurement equal to {{sfrac|1|60}} of one [[Degree (angle)|degree]]. Since one degree is {{sfrac|1|360}} of a [[turn (geometry)|turn]] (or complete rotation), one minute of arc is {{sfrac|1|{{val|21,600}}}} of a turn.  The [[nautical miles|nautical mile]] was originally defined as a minute of latitude on a hypothetical spherical Earth so the actual Earth circumference is very near 21 600 nautical miles.  A minute of arc is {{sfrac|{{pi}}|{{val|10,800}}}} of a [[radian]].

A '''second of arc''', '''arcsecond''' (arcsec), or '''arc second''' is {{sfrac|1|60}} of an arcminute, {{sfrac|1|{{val|3,600}}}} of a degree, {{sfrac|1|{{val|1,296,000}}}} of a turn, and {{sfrac|{{pi}}|{{val|648,000}}}} (about {{sfrac|1|{{val|206,265}}}}) of a radian.

These units originated in [[Babylonian astronomy]] as [[sexagesimal]] subdivisions of the degree; they are used in fields that involve very small angles, such as [[astronomy]], [[optometry]], [[ophthalmology]], [[optics]], [[navigation]], [[land surveying]], and [[marksmanship]].

To express even smaller angles, standard [[SI prefix]]es can be employed; the '''milliarcsecond''' (mas) and '''microarcsecond''' (μas), for instance, are commonly used in astronomy.

The number of square arcminutes{{clarify|date=December 2019|reason=[[Square arcminute]] redirects to [[Solid_angle#Definition_and_properties]] which does not define the term}} in a complete sphere is &lt;math&gt;4 \pi \left(\frac{10\,800}{\pi}\right)^2 = \frac{466\,560\,000}{\pi} \approx &lt;/math&gt; {{val|148,510,660}} square arcminutes (the surface area of a unit sphere in square units divided by the solid angle area subtended by a square arcminute, also in square units – so that the final result is a dimensionless number).

The fact that the terms &quot;minute&quot; and &quot;second&quot; also denote units of time derives from [[Babylonian astronomy]], where the corresponding time-related terms denoted the duration of the Sun's apparent motion of one minute or one second of arc, respectively, through the [[ecliptic]]. In present terms, the Babylonian degree of time was four minutes long so the &quot;minute&quot; of time was four seconds long and the &quot;second&quot; {{sfrac|1|15}} of a second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Correll |first=Malcolm |journal=The Physics Teacher |volume=15 |pages=476–479 |issue=8 |date=November 1977 |doi=10.1119/1.2339739 |title=Early Time Measurements}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy|author1=[[F.

==Symbols and abbreviations==
The [[Prime (symbol)|prime symbol]] (′) (U+2032) designates the arcminute, though a single quote (') (U+0027) is commonly used where only [[ASCII]] characters are permitted. One arcminute is thus written 1′. It is also abbreviated as '''arcmin''' or '''amin''' or, less commonly, the prime with a [[circumflex]] over it (&lt;math&gt;\hat{'}&lt;/math&gt;).

Similarly, [[double prime]] (″) (U+2033) designates the arcsecond, though a double quote (&quot;) (U+0022) is commonly used where only [[ASCII]] characters are permitted. One arcsecond is thus written 1″. It is also abbreviated as '''arcsec''' or '''asec'''.

In [[celestial navigation]], seconds of arc are rarely used in calculations, the preference usually being for degrees, minutes and decimals of a minute, for example, written as 42° 25.32′ or 42° 25.322′.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CELESTIAL NAVIGATION COURSE|url=http://www.learntonavigate.com/celestial.htm|publisher=International Navigation School|accessdate=4 November 2010|quote=It is a straightforward method [to obtain a position at sea] and requires no mathematical calculation beyond addition and subtraction of degrees and minutes and decimals of minutes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Astro Navigation Syllabus|url=http://www.kumquat-data.com/Astro%20Navigation%20Syllabus.htm|accessdate=4 November 2010|quote=[Sextant errors] are sometimes [given] in seconds of arc, which will need to be converted to decimal minutes when you include them in your calculation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notation has been carried over into [[Global Positioning System|marine GPS]] receivers, which normally display latitude and longitude in the latter format by default.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shipmate GN30 |url=http://norinco.co.in/NCMS/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=53&amp;Itemid=81 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124133039/http://norinco.co.in/NCMS/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=53&amp;Itemid=81 |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 January 2008 |publisher=Norinco |accessdate=4 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common examples ==

The full [[moon]]'s average [[angular diameter|apparent size]] is about 31 arcminutes (or 0.52°).

An arcminute is approximately the [[Visual acuity|resolution of the human eye]].

An arcsecond is approximately the [[Subtended angle|angle subtended]] by a [[Dime (United States coin)|U.S. dime coin]] (18&amp;nbsp;mm) at a distance of {{convert|4|km|mi|disp=x| (about |)}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexei Filippenko|Filippenko, Alex]], ''Understanding the Universe'' (of ''The Great Courses'', on DVD), Lecture 43, time 12:05, The Teaching Company, Chantilly, VA, USA, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; An arcsecond is also the angle subtended by
* an object of diameter {{val|725.27|u=km}} at a distance of one [[astronomical unit]],
* an object of diameter {{val|45,866,916|u=km}} at one [[light-year]],
* an object of diameter one astronomical unit ({{val|149,597,870.7|u=km}}) at a distance of one [[parsec]], per the definition of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmic Distance Scales - The Milky Way|url=https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/cosmic/milkyway_info.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A milliarcsecond is about the size of a dime atop the [[Eiffel Tower]] as seen from [[New York City]].

A microarcsecond is about the size of a period at the end of a sentence in the Apollo mission manuals left on the Moon as seen from Earth.

A nanoarcsecond is about the size of a penny on [[Neptune]]'s moon [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] as observed from Earth.

Also notable examples of size in arcseconds are:
* [[Hubble Space Telescope]] has calculational resolution of 0.05 arcseconds and actual resolution of almost 0.1 arcseconds, which is close to the [[diffraction limit]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.astro.cornell.edu/academics/courses/astro201/diff_limit.htm | title=The Diffraction Limit of a Telescope}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* crescent [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] measures between 60.2 and 66 seconds of arc.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==Uses==

===Astronomy===
[[File:Comparison angular diameter solar system.svg|thumb|300px|Comparison of angular diameter of the Sun, Moon, planets and the International Space Station. True representation of the sizes is achieved when the image is viewed at a distance of 103 times the width of the &quot;Moon: max.&quot; circle. For example, if the &quot;Moon: max.&quot; circle is 10&amp;nbsp;cm wide on a computer display, viewing it from {{convert|10.3|m|yd|abbr=in}} away will show true representation of the sizes.]]

Since antiquity the arcminute and arcsecond have been used in [[astronomy]]. In the [[ecliptic coordinate system]], latitude (β) and longitude (λ); in the [[Horizontal coordinate system|horizon system]], altitude (Alt) and [[azimuth]] (Az); and in the [[equatorial coordinate system]], [[declination]] (δ), are all measured in degrees, arcminutes and arcseconds. The principal exception is [[right ascension]] (RA) in equatorial coordinates, which is measured in time units of hours, minutes, and seconds.

The arcsecond is also often used to describe small astronomical angles such as the angular diameters of planets (e.g. the angular diameter of Venus which varies between 10″ and 60″), the [[proper motion]] of stars, the separation of components of [[binary star system]]s, and [[parallax]], the small change of position of a star in the course of a year or of a solar system body as the Earth rotates. These small angles may also be written in milliarcseconds (mas), or thousandths of an arcsecond. The unit of distance, the [[parsec]], named from the ''par''allax of one arc ''sec''ond, was developed for such parallax measurements. It is the distance at which the mean radius of the Earth's orbit (more precisely, one astronomical unit) would subtend an angle of one arcsecond.

The ESA [[astrometry|astrometric]] satellite [[Gaia mission|Gaia]], launched in 2013, can approximate star positions to 7 microarcseconds (µas).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37355154 |title=Celestial mapper plots a billion stars|last=Amos|first=Jonathan|date=2016-09-14|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-31|language=en-GB }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HAWK-I view of the Milky Way's central region.jpg|left|thumb|[[Milky Way]]’s central region with an angular resolution of 0.2 arcseconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ESO Telescope Images Stunning Central Region of Milky Way, Finds Ancient Star Burst |url = https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1920/ |website=www.eso.org |access-date=18 December 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]Apart from the Sun, the star with the largest [[angular diameter]] from Earth is [[R Doradus]], a [[red giant]] with a diameter of 0.05 arcsecond.{{NoteTag|Some studies have shown a larger angular diameter for [[Betelgeuse]]. Various studies have produced figures of between 0.042 and 0.069 arcseconds for the star's diameter. The variability of Betelgeuse and difficulties in producing a precise reading for its angular diameter make any definitive figure conjectural.}} Because of the effects of atmospheric [[astronomical seeing|blurring]], ground-based [[telescope]]s will smear the image of a star to an angular diameter of about 0.5 arcsecond; in poor conditions this increases to 1.5 arcseconds or even more. The dwarf planet [[Pluto]] has proven difficult to resolve because its [[angular diameter]] is about 0.1 arcsecond.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/plutofact.html NASA.gov] Pluto Fact Sheet&lt;/ref&gt;

Space telescopes are not affected by the Earth's atmosphere but are [[Diffraction limit#Diffraction limit of telescopes|diffraction limited]]. For example, the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] can reach an angular size of stars down to about 0.1″. Techniques exist for improving seeing on the ground. [[Adaptive optics]], for example, can produce images around 0.05 arcsecond on a 10&amp;nbsp;m class telescope.

===Cartography===

Minutes (′) and seconds (″) of arc are also used in [[cartography]] and [[navigation]]. At [[sea level]] one minute of arc along the [[equator]] or a [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] (indeed, any [[great circle]]) equals exactly one [[geographical mile]] along the Earth's equator or approximately {{convert|1|nmi|m mi|sigfig=4|spell=in|abbr=off|lk=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oceannavigator.com/January-February-2003/Nautical-mile-approximates-an-arcminute/ |title=Nautical mile approximates an arcminute |date=1 January 2003 |first=George H. |last=Kaplan |magazine=Ocean Navigator |publisher=Navigator Publishing |access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second of arc, one sixtieth of this amount, is roughly {{convert|30|m|abbr=off}}. The exact distance varies along [[meridian arc]]s because the [[figure of the Earth]] is slightly [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] (bulges a third of a percent at the equator).

Positions are traditionally given using degrees, minutes, and seconds of arcs for [[latitude]], the arc north or south of the equator, and for [[longitude]], the arc east or west of the [[Prime Meridian]]. Any position on or above the Earth's [[reference ellipsoid]] can be precisely given with this method. However, when it is inconvenient to use  [[radix|base]]-60 for minutes and seconds, positions are frequently expressed as decimal fractional degrees to an equal amount of precision. Degrees given to three decimal places ({{sfrac|1|{{val|1000}}}} of a degree) have about {{sfrac|1|4}} the precision of degrees-minutes-seconds ({{sfrac|1|{{val|3600}}}} of a degree) and specify locations within about {{convert|120|m|abbr=off}}.

===Property cadastral surveying===

Related to cartography, property boundary [[surveying]] using the [[metes and bounds]] system relies on fractions of a degree to describe property lines' angles in reference to [[cardinal direction]]s. A boundary &quot;mete&quot; is described with a beginning reference point, the cardinal direction North or South followed by an angle less than 90 degrees and a second cardinal direction, and a linear distance. The boundary runs the specified linear distance from the beginning point, the direction of the distance being determined by rotating the first cardinal direction the specified angle toward the second cardinal direction. For example, ''North&amp;nbsp;65°&amp;nbsp;39′ 18″ West&amp;nbsp;85.69&amp;nbsp;feet'' would describe a line running from the starting point 85.69 feet in a direction 65° 39′ 18″ (or 65.655°) away from north toward the west.

===Firearms===
[[File:Ballistic table for 7.62x51 mm NATO (mil and moa).png|thumb|right|Example ballistic table for a given [[7.62×51mm NATO]] load. Bullet drop and wind drift are shown both in [[milliradian|mil]] and minute of angle.]]

The arcminute is commonly found in the [[firearm]]s industry and literature, particularly concerning the accuracy of [[rifle]]s, though the industry refers to it as '''minute of angle''' (MOA). It is especially popular with shooters familiar with the [[imperial measurement system]] because 1&amp;nbsp;MOA [[subtension|subtends]] a sphere with a diameter of 1.047 [[inch]]es at 100 [[yard]]s (2.908&amp;nbsp;cm at 100&amp;nbsp;m), a traditional distance on U.S. [[Shooting range|target ranges]]. The [[subtension]] is linear with the distance, for example, at 500 yards, 1&amp;nbsp;MOA  subtends a sphere with a diameter of 5.235 inches, and at 1000 yards 1&amp;nbsp;MOA subtends a sphere with a diameter of 10.47 inches.
Since many modern [[telescopic sight]]s are adjustable in half ({{sfrac|1|2}}), quarter ({{sfrac|1|4}}), or eighth ({{sfrac|1|8}}) MOA increments, also known as ''clicks'', zeroing and adjustments are made by counting 2, 4 and 8 clicks per MOA respectively.

For example, if the point of impact is 3 inches high and 1.5 inches left of the point of aim at 100 yards (which for instance could be measured by using a [[spotting scope]] with a calibrated reticle), the scope needs to be adjusted 3 MOA down, and 1.5 MOA right. Such adjustments are trivial when the scope's adjustment dials have a MOA scale printed on them, and even figuring the right number of clicks is relatively easy on scopes that ''click'' in fractions of MOA. This makes zeroing and adjustments much easier:
* To adjust a {{frac|1|2}} MOA scope 3 MOA down and 1.5 MOA right, the scope needs to be adjusted 3 × 2 = 6 clicks down and 1.5 x 2 = 3 clicks right
* To adjust a {{frac|1|4}} MOA scope 3 MOA down and 1.5 MOA right, the scope needs to be adjusted 3 x 4 = 12 clicks down and 1.5 × 4 = 6 clicks right
* To adjust a {{frac|1|8}} MOA scope 3 MOA down and 1.5 MOA right, the scope needs to be adjusted 3 x 8 = 24 clicks down and 1.5 × 8 = 12 clicks right

Another common system of measurement in firearm scopes is the [[milliradian]] or mil. Zeroing a mil based scope is easy for users familiar with [[decimal|base ten]] systems. The most common adjustment value in mil based scopes is {{sfrac|1|10}} mil (which approximates {{frac|1|3}} MOA).
* To adjust a {{sfrac|1|10}} mil scope 0.9 mil down and 0.4 mil right, the scope needs to be adjusted 9 clicks down and 4 clicks right (which equals approximately 3 and 1.5 MOA respectively).

One thing to be aware of is that some MOA scopes, including some higher-end models,{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} are calibrated such that an adjustment of 1 MOA on the scope knobs corresponds to exactly 1 inch of impact adjustment on a target at 100 yards, rather than the mathematically correct 1.047&quot;. This is commonly known as the Shooter's MOA (SMOA) or Inches Per Hundred Yards (IPHY). While the difference between one true MOA and one SMOA is less than half of an inch even at 1000 yards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mann |first=Richard |url=http://www.shootingillustrated.com/index.php/6227/mil-moa-or-inches/ |title=Mil, MOA or inches? |publisher=Shooting Illustrated |date=2011-02-18 |accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; this error compounds significantly on longer range shots that may require adjustment upwards of 20–30 MOA to compensate for the bullet drop. If a shot requires an adjustment of 20 MOA or more, the difference between true MOA and SMOA will add up to 1 inch or more. In competitive target shooting, this might mean the difference between a hit and a miss.

The physical group size equivalent to ''m'' minutes of arc can be calculated as follows: group size = tan({{sfrac|''m''|60}})&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;distance. In the example previously given, for 1 minute of arc, and substituting 3,600&amp;nbsp;inches for 100 yards, 3,600 tan({{sfrac|1|60}}) ≈ 1.047&amp;nbsp;inches. In [[metric units]] 1 MOA at 100 metres ≈ 2.908 centimetres.

Sometimes, a precision firearm's accuracy will be measured in MOA. This simply means that under ideal conditions i.e. no wind, match-grade ammo, clean barrel, and a vise or a benchrest used to eliminate shooter error, the gun is capable of producing a [[shot grouping|group of shots]] whose center points (center-to-center) fit into a circle, the average diameter of circles in several groups can be subtended by that amount of arc. For example, a ''1 MOA rifle'' should be capable, under ideal conditions, of shooting an average 1-inch groups at 100 yards. Most higher-end rifles are warrantied by their manufacturer to shoot under a given MOA threshold (typically 1 MOA or better) with specific ammunition and no error on the shooter's part. For example, Remington's [[M24 Sniper Weapon System]] is required to shoot 0.8 MOA or better, or be rejected.

Rifle manufacturers and gun magazines often refer to this capability as ''sub-MOA'', meaning it shoots under 1 MOA. This means that a single group of 3 to 5 shots at 100 yards, or the average of several groups, will measure less than 1 MOA between the two furthest shots in the group, i.e. all shots fall within 1 MOA. If larger samples are taken (i.e., more shots per group) then group size typically increases, however this will ultimately average out. If a rifle was truly a 1 MOA rifle, it would be just as likely that two consecutive shots land exactly on top of each other as that they land 1 MOA apart. For 5-shot groups, based on 95% [[confidence interval|confidence]], a rifle that normally shoots 1 MOA can be expected to shoot groups between 0.58 MOA and 1.47 MOA, although the majority of these groups will be under 1 MOA. What this means in practice is if a rifle that shoots 1-inch groups on average at 100 yards shoots a group measuring 0.7 inches followed by a group that is 1.3 inches, this is not statistically abnormal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert E. |last=Wheeler |title=Statistical notes on rifle group patterns |url=http://www.bobwheeler.com/guns/GroupStat.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926154900/http://www.bobwheeler.com/guns/GroupStat.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 September 2006 |accessdate=21 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Denton |last=Bramwell |date=January 2009 |title=Group Therapy The Problem: How accurate is your rifle? |url=http://www.longrangehunting.com/articles/accurate-rifle-groups-1.php |journal=Varmint Hunter |volume=69 |accessdate=21 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Metric system|Metric System]] counterpart of the MOA is the [[milliradian]] or '''mil''', being equal to one 1000th of the target range, laid out on a circle that has the observer as centre and the target range as radius. The number of mils on a full such circle therefore always is equal to 2 × {{pi}} × 1000, regardless the target range. Therefore, 1 MOA ≈ 0.2908 mil. This means that an object which spans 1 mil on the [[reticle]] is at a range that is in metres equal to the object's size in millimetres{{dubious|reason=the size of an object is specified in cubic measure, not in millimetres|date=December 2019}} (e.g. an object of 100&amp;nbsp;mm @ 1 mrad is 100 metres away). So there is no conversion factor required, contrary to the MOA system.  A reticle with markings (hashes or dots) spaced with a one mil apart (or a fraction of a mil) are collectively called a mil reticle. If the markings are round they are called '''mil-dots'''.

In the table below conversions from mil to metric values are exact (e.g. 0.1&amp;nbsp;mil equals exactly 1&amp;nbsp;cm at 100 metres), while conversions of minutes of arc to both metric and imperial values are approximate.

===Human vision===
In humans, [[Normal vision|20/20 vision]] is the ability to resolve a [[spatial pattern]] separated by a [[visual angle]] of one minute of arc.
A 20/20 letter subtends 5 minutes of arc total.

===Materials===
The deviation from parallelism between two surfaces, for instance in [[optical engineering]], is usually measured in arcminutes or arcseconds.
In addition, arcseconds are sometimes used in [[rocking curve]] (ω-scan) [[x ray diffraction]] measurements of high-quality [[epitaxy|epitaxial]] thin films.

===Manufacturing===
Some measurement devices make use of arcminutes and arcseconds to measure angles when the object being measured is too small for direct visual inspection. For instance, a toolmaker's [[optical comparator]] will often include an option to measure in &quot;minutes and seconds&quot;.
