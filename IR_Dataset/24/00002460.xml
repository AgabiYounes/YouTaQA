As with most forms of sexual activity, anal sex participants risk contracting [[sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs). Anal sex is considered a high-risk sexual practice because of the vulnerability of the anus and rectum. The anal and rectal tissues are delicate and do not provide lubrication like [[Vaginal lubrication|the vagina does]], so they can easily tear and permit disease transmission, especially if a [[personal lubricant]] is not used.&lt;ref name=&quot;WebMD&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Krasner&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert I Krasner| title =The Microbial Challenge: Science, Disease and Public Health| publisher =[[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers]]|year = 2010|pages=416–417|accessdate = August 28, 2013| isbn = 978-0763797355 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nThtlYxP84QC&amp;pg=PA416}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anal sex without protection of a [[condom]] is considered the riskiest form of sexual activity,&lt;ref name=&quot;Krasner&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hales&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Dianne Hales|title=An Invitation to Health Brief 2010-2011| publisher = [[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2008|accessdate=August 29, 2013|pages =269–271| isbn = 978-0495391920|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oP91HVIMPRIC&amp;pg=PA269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Werner&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Werner W.

Strong views are often expressed about anal sex. It is controversial in various cultures, especially with regard to [[religion and homosexuality|religious prohibitions]]. This is commonly due to prohibitions against anal sex among males or teachings about the [[Reproduction|procreative]] purpose of sexual activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeRoy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Discovery.com&quot;/&gt; It may be considered [[taboo]] or unnatural, and is a [[Crime|criminal offense]] in some countries, punishable by [[Corporal punishment|corporal]] or [[capital punishment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LeRoy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Discovery.com&quot;/&gt; By contrast, anal sex may also be considered&lt;!--NOTE: Refer to the Discovery.com source.

The abundance of [[Nerve|nerve endings]] in the anal region and [[rectum]] can make anal sex pleasurable for men or women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Answer&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LeRoy&quot;/&gt; The [[Sphincter ani internus muscle|internal]] and [[Sphincter ani externus muscle|external]] [[sphincter]] muscles control the opening and closing of the anus; these muscles, which are sensitive membranes made up of many nerve endings, facilitate pleasure or pain during anal sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LeRoy&quot;/&gt; ''Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia'' states that &quot;the inner third of the anal canal is less sensitive to touch than the outer two-thirds, but is more sensitive to pressure&quot; and that &quot;the rectum is a curved tube about eight or nine inches long and has the capacity, like the anus, to expand&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeRoy&quot;/&gt;

Stimulation from anal sex can additionally be affected by popular perception or portrayals of the activity, such as [[erotica]] or [[pornography]]. In pornography, anal sex is commonly portrayed as a desirable, painless routine that does not require [[personal lubricant]]; this can result in couples performing anal sex without care, and men and women believing that it is unusual for women, as receptive partners, to find discomfort or pain instead of pleasure from the activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;McBride and Fortenberry&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Crooks&quot;&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=MpRnPtmdRVwC&amp;pg=PA560 page 560] for effects of viewing pornography with regard to anal sex, and [https://books.google.com/books?id=MpRnPtmdRVwC&amp;pg=PA286 pages 286–289] for anal sex as a birth control method. {{cite book | title = Our Sexuality | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | year = 2010–2011 | pages = 570 pages | accessdate = May 7, 2013 |isbn = 978-0495812944| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MpRnPtmdRVwC |author1=Robert Crooks |author2=Karla Baur }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyle&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last= Flood | first = Michael | author-link = Michael Flood | contribution = Young men using pornography | editor-last = Boyle | editor-first = Karen | editor-link = Karen Boyle | title = Everyday pornography | pages = 170–171 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2010 | isbn = 9780415543781 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.xyonline.net/sites/default/files/Flood,%20Young%20men%20using%20porn.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020075102/http://www.xyonline.net/sites/default/files/Flood%2C%20Young%20men%20using%20porn.pdf |date=October 20, 2016 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=8yznvRX-hfAC&amp;pg=PA170 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johansson&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = The Transformation of Sexuality: Gender And Identity In Contemporary Youth Culture | publisher = [[Ashgate Publishing]] | year = 2007 | pages = 56–58 | accessdate = May 7, 2013 |isbn = 978-1409490784| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XPm3JEiunnsC&amp;pg=PA56| author = Thomas Johansson}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, each person's sphincter muscles react to penetration differently, the anal sphincters have tissues that are more prone to tearing, and the anus and rectum do not provide lubrication for sexual penetration like [[Vaginal lubrication|the vagina does]].

The anal sphincters are usually tighter than the [[pelvic floor|pelvic muscles]] of the vagina, which can enhance the sexual pleasure for the inserting male during male-to-female anal intercourse because of the pressure applied to the penis.&lt;ref name=&quot;WebMD&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Taormino&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Understanding&quot;/&gt; Men may also enjoy the penetrative role during anal sex because of its association with dominance, because it is made more alluring by a female partner or society in general insisting that it is forbidden, or because it presents an additional option for penetration.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeRoy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Understanding&quot;/&gt;

In a 2010 clinical review article of heterosexual anal sex, ''anal intercourse'' is used to specifically denote penile-anal penetration, and ''anal sex'' is used to denote any form of anal sexual activity. The review suggests that anal sex is exotic among the sexual practices of some heterosexuals and that &quot;for a certain number of heterosexuals, anal intercourse is pleasurable, exciting, and perhaps considered more intimate than vaginal sex&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McBride and Fortenberry&quot;/&gt;

Anal intercourse is sometimes used as a substitute for vaginal intercourse during [[menstruation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LeRoy&quot;/&gt; The likelihood of [[pregnancy]] occurring&lt;!-- NOTE: This paragraph, including this line, relates to practice far more than it does to health, so it seemingly fits better here than in the Health risks section. --&gt; during anal sex is greatly reduced, as anal sex alone cannot lead to pregnancy unless sperm is somehow transported to the vaginal opening. Because of this, some couples practice anal intercourse as a form of [[Birth control|contraception]], often in the absence of a condom.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeRoy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Crooks&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SIECUS ''Prevalence of Unprotected Anal Sex among Teens Requires New Education Strategies''[https://web.archive.org/web/20171231103438/http://www.sexedlibrary.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Feature.showFeature&amp;featureid=1036&amp;pageid=682&amp;parentid=478] Accessed January 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Male-to-female anal sex is commonly viewed as a way of preserving female [[virginity]] because it is non-procreative and does not tear the [[hymen]]; a person, especially a teenage girl or woman, who engages in anal sex or other sexual activity with no history of having engaged in vaginal intercourse is often regarded among heterosexuals and researchers as not having yet experienced virginity loss. This is sometimes called ''[[technical virginity]].''&lt;ref name=&quot;Carpenter&quot;&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=6qNCeI2AcY4C&amp;pg=PT11 here] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=pXXZn_qSoDoC&amp;pg=PA48 pages 48–49] for the majority of researchers and heterosexuals defining virginity loss/&quot;technical virginity&quot; by whether or not a person has engaged in vaginal sex. {{Cite book|author=Laura M.

Carpenter stated that this view &quot;dates to the late 1600s, with explicit 'rules' appearing around the turn of the twentieth century, as in marriage manuals defining petting as 'literally every caress known to married couples but does not include complete sexual intercourse.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carpenter&quot;/&gt;

===Prevalence===

Because most research on anal intercourse addresses [[men who have sex with men]], little data exists on the prevalence of anal intercourse among heterosexual couples.&lt;ref name=&quot;McBride and Fortenberry&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coleman&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Hardin L.K. |editor-last=Coleman |editor-first2=Christine |editor-last2=Yeh|title =Handbook of School Counseling|isbn = 978-1135283599|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2011|page=247|accessdate=December 10, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rBiPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA247}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Kimberly R. McBride's 2010 clinical review on heterosexual anal intercourse and other forms of anal sexual activity, it is suggested that changing [[Norm (social)|norms]] may affect the frequency of heterosexual anal sex. McBride and her colleagues investigated the prevalence of non-intercourse anal sex behaviors among a sample of men (n=1,299) and women (n=1,919) compared to anal intercourse experience and found that 51% of men and 43% of women had participated in at least one act of oral–anal sex, manual–anal sex, or anal sex toy use.&lt;ref name=&quot;McBride and Fortenberry&quot;/&gt; The report states the majority of men (n=631) and women (n=856) who reported heterosexual anal intercourse in the past 12 months were in exclusive, monogamous relationships: 69% and 73%, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;McBride and Fortenberry&quot;/&gt; The review added that because &quot;relatively little attention [is] given to anal intercourse and other anal sexual behaviors between heterosexual partners&quot;, this means that it is &quot;quite rare&quot; to have research &quot;that specifically differentiates the anus as a sexual organ or addresses anal sexual function or dysfunction as legitimate topics. As a result, we do not know the extent to which anal intercourse differs qualitatively from coitus.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McBride and Fortenberry&quot;/&gt;

According to a 2010 study from the [[National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior]] (NSSHB) that was authored by [[Debby Herbenick]] et al., although anal intercourse is reported by fewer women than other partnered sex behaviors, partnered women in the age groups between 18–49 are significantly more likely to report having anal sex in the past 90 days. Women engaged in anal intercourse less commonly than men. Vaginal intercourse was practiced more than insertive anal intercourse among men, but 13% to 15% of men aged 25 to 49 practiced insertive anal intercourse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll 2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Janell L.

With regard to adolescents, limited data also exists.&lt;ref name=Coleman/&gt; This may be because of the taboo nature of anal sex and that teenagers and caregivers subsequently avoid talking to one another about the topic. It is also common for subject review panels and schools to avoid the subject.&lt;ref name=Coleman/&gt; A 2000 study found that 22.9% of college students who self-identified as non-virgins had anal sex.  They used condoms during anal sex 20.9% of the time as compared with 42.9% of the time with vaginal intercourse.&lt;ref name=Coleman/&gt;

Anal sex being more common among heterosexuals today than it was previously has been linked to the increase in consumption of anal pornography among men, especially among those who view it on a regular basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyle&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johansson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Seidman&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title =Introducing the New Sexuality Studies|edition =2nd|author=Steven Seidman|author2=Nancy Fischer|author3=Chet Meeks|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2011|pages=108–112|isbn=978-1136818103|accessdate=December 22, 2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2rmjynItoEkC&amp;pg=PA108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seidman et al. argued that &quot;cheap, accessible and, especially, interactive media have enabled many more people to produce as well as consume pornography&quot;, and that this modern way of producing pornography, in addition to the buttocks and anus having become more eroticized, has led to a significant interest in or obsession with anal sex among men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seidman&quot;/&gt;

Women may sexually stimulate a man's anus by fingering the exterior or interior areas of the anus; they may also stimulate the [[perineum]] (which, for males, is between the base of the [[scrotum]] and the anus), [[prostate massage|massage the prostate]] or engage in anilingus.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeRoy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zdrok&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Keesling&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Barbara|last=Keesling| title = Sexual Pleasure: Reaching New Heights of Sexual Arousal and Intimacy | publisher =[[Hunter House Publishers|Hunter House]]|year = 2005|page=221|accessdate = July 6, 2013| isbn = 9780897934350 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=EG2qGvbgneoC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex toys, such as a [[dildo]], may also be used.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeRoy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zdrok&quot;/&gt; The practice of a woman penetrating a man's anus with a [[strap-on dildo]] for sexual activity is called [[Pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawley&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Dan|last=Savage|title=We Have a Winner!|newspaper=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]|date=June 21, 2001|accessdate=July 5, 2011|url=http://thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=7730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly, heterosexual men reject the idea of being receptive partners during anal sex because they believe it is a [[Femininity|feminine]] act, can make them vulnerable, or contradicts their sexual orientation (for example, that it is indicative that they are gay).&lt;ref name=&quot;Zdrok&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Odets&quot;/&gt; The ''[[BMJ]]'' stated in 1999, however:{{quote|There are little published data on how many heterosexual men would like their anus to be sexually stimulated in a heterosexual relationship.

As with other sexual practices, people without sound knowledge about the sexual risks involved are susceptible to STIs.

Although anal sex alone does not lead to pregnancy, pregnancy can still occur with anal sex or other forms of sexual activity if the penis is near the vagina (such as during [[intercrural sex]] or other [[Sex position#Genital-genital rubbing|genital-genital rubbing]]) and its sperm is deposited near the vagina's entrance and travels along the vagina's lubricating fluids; the risk of pregnancy can also occur without the penis being near the vagina because sperm may be transported to the vaginal opening by the vagina coming in contact with fingers or other non-genital body parts that have come in contact with semen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=R.

Most cases of anal cancer are related to infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV). Anal sex alone does not cause anal cancer; the risk of anal cancer through anal sex is attributed to HPV infection, which is often contracted through unprotected anal sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anal cancer&quot;/&gt; Anal cancer is relatively rare, and significantly less common than cancer of the colon or rectum ([[colorectal cancer]]); the [[American Cancer Society]] states that it affects approximately 7,060 people (4,430 in women and 2,630 in men) and results in approximately 880 deaths (550 in women and 330 in men) in the United States, and that, though anal cancer has been on the rise for many years, it is mainly diagnosed in adults, &quot;with an average age being in the early 60s&quot; and it &quot;affects women somewhat more often than men.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anal cancer&quot;/&gt; Though anal cancer is serious, treatment for it is &quot;often very effective&quot; and most anal cancer patients can be cured of the disease; the American Cancer Society adds that &quot;receptive anal intercourse also increases the risk of anal cancer in both men and women, particularly in those younger than the age of 30. Because of this, men who have sex with men have a high risk of this cancer.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anal cancer&quot;/&gt;

In later [[Greek literature#Roman Age|Roman-era Greek poetry]], anal sex became a common literary convention, represented as taking place with &quot;eligible&quot; youths: those who had attained the proper age but had not yet become adults. Seducing those not of proper age (for example, non-adolescent children) into the practice was considered very shameful for the adult, and having such relations with a male who was no longer adolescent was considered more shameful for the young male than for the one mounting him. Greek courtesans, or [[hetaera]]e, are said to have frequently practiced male-female anal intercourse as a means of preventing pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = James E.|year = 1995 | title = The Practices of Romans 1:26: Homosexual or Heterosexual? | url = | journal = Novum Testamentum | volume = 37 | issue = 1| page = 9 | quote = Heterosexual anal intercourse is best illustrated in Classical vase paintings of hetaerae with their clients, and some scholars interpret this as a form of contraception | doi=10.1163/1568536952613631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A male citizen taking the passive (or receptive) role in anal intercourse (''paedicatio'' in [[Latin]]) was condemned in Rome as an act of ''impudicitia'' (immodesty or un[[chastity]]); free men, however, could take the active role with a young male slave, known as a ''[[catamite]]'' or ''puer delicatus''. The latter was allowed because anal intercourse was considered equivalent to vaginal intercourse in this way; men were said to &quot;take it like a woman&quot; (muliebria pati, &quot;to undergo womanly things&quot;) when they were anally penetrated, but when a man performed anal sex on a woman, she was thought of as playing the boy's role.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skinner&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title =Invading the Roman Body: Manliness and Impenetrability in Roman Thought.
