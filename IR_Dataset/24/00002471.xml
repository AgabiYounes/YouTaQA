The '''Ababda''' or '''Ababde''' – the '''Gebadei''' of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], and possibly the '''[[Troglodytae|Troglodytes]]''' of other [[Outline of classical studies|classical writers]] – are [[nomad]]s living in the area between the [[Nile]] and the [[Red Sea]], in the vicinity of [[Aswan]] in [[Egypt]] and north [[Sudan]].  Secondary sources in European languages often describe them as a Beja tribe, but they do not consider themselves Beja, and are not considered so by other Beja peoples. There is no evidence that they historically spoke Beja rather than Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=ضرار |first1=محمّد صالح |title=تاريخ شرق السودان: ممالك البجة‥ قبائلها وتاريخها |date=2012 |publisher=مكتبة التوبة |location=Khartoum |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Sheikh Hasan Aly Mustafa.png|thumb|left|Sheikh Hasan Aly Mustafa of the Ababda.]]
The Ababda extend from the [[Nile]] at [[Aswan]] to the [[Red Sea]], and reach northward to the [[Qena]]-[[El Qoseir|Quseir]] road, thus occupying the southern border of [[Egypt]] east of the Nile. They call themselves &quot;sons of the Jinns.&quot; With some of the clans of the [[Bishari tribe|Bisharin]] and possibly the [[Hadendoa]], they represent the [[Blemmyes]] of classic geographers, and their location today is almost identical with that assigned them in [[ancient Rome|Roman]] times.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abābda|volume=1|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From time immemorial, they have acted as guides to [[Caravan (travellers)|caravans]] through the [[Nubia]]n [[Nubian Desert|desert]] and up the Nile valley as far as [[Sennar]]. They intermarried with the [[Nubians]], and settled in small colonies at [[Shendi]] and elsewhere up to [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali's]] conquest of the region in the early 19th century. They are still great trade carriers and visit very distant districts.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;
