Precious little history surfaces in these modern visions...Over the centuries, many commentators have spread the myth of the bigoted, evil Aurangzeb on the basis of shockingly thin evidence. Many false ideas still mar popular memory of Aurangzeb, including that he massacred millions of Hindus and destroyed thousands of temples. Neither of these commonly believed “facts” is supported by historical evidence, although some scholars have attempted, usually in bad faith, to provide an alleged basis for such tall tales. More common than bald-faced lies, however, have been biased interpretations of cherry-picked episodes selected with the unabashed goal of supporting a foregone rebuke of Aurangzeb.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aurangzeb has been subject to criticism. Critics argue that his policies abandoned his predecessors' legacy of pluralism and religious tolerance, citing his introduction of the ''[[jizya]]'' tax and other policies based on [[Islamic ethics]], demolition of [[Hindu temple]]s, the executions of his elder brother [[Dara Shikoh]], [[Maratha Kingdom|Maratha]] king [[Sambhaji]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Mehta2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

According to Abraham Eraly, &quot;in 1670, all temples around Ujjain were destroyed&quot; and later &quot;300 temples were destroyed in and around Chitor, Udaipur and Jaipur&quot; among other Hindu temples destroyed elsewhere in campaigns through 1705.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avari writes, &quot;Aurangzeb's religious policy caused friction between him and the ninth Sikh guru, Tegh Bahadur. In both Punjab and Kashmir the Sikh leader was roused to action by Aurangzeb's excessively zealous Islamic policies. Seized and taken to Delhi, he was called upon by Aurangzeb to embrace Islam and, on refusal, was tortured for five days and then beheaded in November 1675. Two of the ten Sikh gurus thus died as martyrs at the hands of the Mughals.

Richard Eaton, the leading authority on the subject, puts the number of confirmed temple destructions during Aurangzeb's rule at just over a dozen, with fewer tied to the emperor's direct commands. Other scholars have pointed out additional temple demolitions not counted by Eaton, such as two orders to destroy the Somanatha Temple in 1659 and 1706 (the existence of a second order suggests that the first was never carried out). Aurangzeb also oversaw temple desecrations. For example, in 1645 he ordered mihrabs (prayer niches, typically located in mosques) erected in Ahmedabad's Chintamani Parshvanath Temple, built by the Jain merchant Shantidas. Even adding in such events, however, to quote Eaton, &quot;the evidence is almost always fragmentary, incomplete, or even contradictory&quot;.

==Early life==

Aurangzeb was born on 3 November 1618, in [[Dahod]], Gujarat. He was the third son and sixth child of [[Shah Jahan]] and [[Mumtaz Mahal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Waseem |editor-first=M. |year=2003 |title=On Becoming an Indian Muslim: French Essays on Aspects of Syncretism |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New Delhi |page=103 |isbn=978-0-19-565807-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1626, after an unsuccessful rebellion by his father, Aurangzeb and his brother [[Dara Shukoh]] were kept as hostages under their grandparents' ([[Nur Jahan]] and [[Jahangir]]) [[Lahore]] court. On 26 February 1628, Shah Jahan was officially declared the Mughal Emperor, and Aurangzeb returned to live with his parents at [[Agra Fort]], where Aurangzeb received his formal education in [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. His daily allowance was fixed at Rs. 500, which he spent on religious education and the study of history.

On 28 May 1633, Aurangzeb escaped death when a powerful [[war elephant]] stampeded through the Mughal Imperial encampment. He rode against the elephant and struck its trunk with a [[lance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schimmel|first=Annemarie|url=https://books.google.com/?id=N7sewQQzOHUC|year=2004|title=The empire of the great Mughals|publisher=Reaktion Books|place=London|isbn=978-1-86189-185-3|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; and successfully defended himself from being crushed. Aurangzeb's valour was appreciated by his father who conferred him the title of ''[[Rao Bahadur|Bahadur]]'' (Brave) and had him weighed in gold and presented gifts worth Rs. 200,000. This event was celebrated in Persian and [[Urdu]] verses, and Aurangzeb said:&lt;ref name=&quot;Hansen1986&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Waldemar Hansen|title=The Peacock Throne: The Drama of Mogul India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AV--abKg9GEC&amp;pg=PA122|accessdate=23 November 2012|date=1 January 1986|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0225-4|pages=122–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|What did his brothers do?|date=February 2020}}

===Bundela War===

[[File:The capture of Orchha by imperial forces (October 1635).jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Mughal Army]] under the command of Aurangzeb recaptures [[Orchha]] in October 1635.]]

Aurangzeb was nominally in charge of the force sent to [[Bundelkhand]] with the intent of subduing the rebellious ruler of [[Orchha State|Orchha]], [[Jhujhar Singh]], who had attacked another territory in defiance of Shah Jahan's policy and was refusing to atone for his actions. By arrangement, Aurangzeb stayed in the rear, away from the fighting, and took the advice of his generals as the [[Mughal Army]] gathered and commenced the Siege of Orchha in 1635. The campaign was successful and Singh was removed from power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richards1996p130&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Mughal Empire |series=The New Cambridge History of India |volume=5 |first=John F. |last=Richards |edition=Reprinted |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=9780521566032 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&amp;pg=PA1 |page=130 |accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1644, Aurangzeb's sister, [[Jahanara Begum Sahib|Jahanara]], was burned when the chemicals in her perfume were ignited by a nearby lamp while in [[Agra]]. This event precipitated a family crisis with political consequences. Aurangzeb suffered his father's displeasure by not returning to Agra immediately but rather three weeks later. Shah Jahan had been nursing Jahanara back to health in that time and thousands of vassals had arrived in Agra to pay their respects.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Shah Jahan was outraged to see Aurangzeb enter the interior palace compound in military attire and immediately dismissed him from his position of viceroy of the Deccan; Aurangzeb was also no longer allowed to use red tents or to associate himself with the official military standard of the Mughal emperor.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Other sources tell us that Aurangzeb was dismissed from his position because Aurangzeb left the life of luxury and became a Faqir.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad, Fazl. Heroes of Islam. Lahore: Sh. Muhammad Ashraff, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1645, he was barred from the court for seven months and mentioned his grief to fellow Mughal commanders. Thereafter, Shah Jahan appointed him governor of Gujarat where he served well and was rewarded for bringing stability.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In 1647, Shah Jahan moved Aurangzeb from Gujarat to be governor of [[Balkh]], replacing a younger son, [[Murad Baksh]], who had proved ineffective there. The area was under attack from [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] and [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] tribes. While the Mughal artillery and muskets were a formidable force, so too were the skirmishing skills of their opponents. The two sides were in stalemate and Aurangzeb discovered that his army could not live off the land, which was devastated by war. With the onset of winter, he and his father had to make a largely unsatisfactory deal with the Uzbeks, giving away territory in exchange for nominal recognition of Mughal sovereignty. The Mughal force suffered still further with attacks by Uzbeks and other tribesmen as it retreated through the snow to [[Kabul]]. By the end of this two-year campaign, into which Aurangzeb had been plunged at a late stage, a vast sum of money had been expended for little gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Richards|1996|pp=132–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further inauspicious military involvements followed, as Aurangzeb was appointed governor of [[Multan]] and [[Sindh]]. His efforts in 1649 and 1652 to [[Three Sieges of Kandahar|dislodge]] the Safavids at [[Kandahar]], which they had recently retaken after a decade of Mughal control, both ended in failure as winter approached. The logistical problems of supplying an army at the extremity of the empire, combined with the poor quality of armaments and the intransigence of the opposition have been cited by John Richards as the reasons for failure, and a third attempt in 1653, led by Dara Shikoh, met with the same outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Richards|1996|pp=134–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aurangzeb became viceroy of the Deccan again after he was replaced by Dara Shukoh in the attempt to recapture Kandahar. Aurangzeb regretted this and harboured feelings that Shikoh had manipulated the situation to serve his own ends. Aurangbad's two ''[[jagir]]s'' (land grants) were moved there as a consequence of his return and, because the Deccan was a relatively impoverished area, this caused him to lose out financially. So poor was the area that grants were required from [[Malwa]] and Gujarat in order to maintain the administration and the situation caused ill-feeling between father and son. Shah Jahan insisted that things could be improved if Aurangzeb made efforts to develop cultivation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandra2005p267&quot; /&gt; Aurangzeb appointed Murshid Quli Khan{{Citation needed|reason=Murshid Quli Khan was born at 1670|date=June 2016}} to extend to the Deccan the ''zabt'' revenue system used in northern India. Murshid Quli Khan organised a survey of agricultural land and a tax assessment on what it produced. To increase revenue, Murshid Quli Khan granted loans for seed, livestock, and irrigation infrastructure. The Deccan returned to prosperity,&lt;ref name=&quot;Markovits2004p103&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Richards|1996|pp=140, 188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aurangzeb proposed to resolve the situation by attacking the dynastic occupants of [[Golconda]] (the [[Qutb Shahi]]s) and [[Bijapur district, Karnataka|Bijapur]] (the [[Adil Shahi]]s). As an adjunct to resolving the financial difficulties, the proposal would also extend Mughal influence by accruing more lands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandra2005p267&quot; /&gt; Aurangzeb advanced against the Sultan of Bijapur and [[Siege of Bidar|besieged Bidar]]. The ''[[Kiladar]]'' (governor or captain) of the fortified city, Sidi Marjan, was mortally wounded when a gunpowder magazine exploded. After twenty-seven days of hard fighting, [[Bidar]] was captured by the Mughals and Aurangzeb continued his advance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prasad1974&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Prasad |first=Ishwari |year=1974 |title=The Mughal Empire |location=Allahabad |publisher=Chugh Publications |pages=524–525 |oclc=1532660 |quote=[Aurangzeb] marched in the direction of Bijapur and on reaching Bidar laid siege to it ...

Thus was the fort of Bidar taken after a siege of 27 days ... Sidi Marjan died of his wounds soon afterwards ... Aurangzeb arrived at Kalyani.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, he was to feel that Dara had exerted influence on his father: believing that he was on the verge of victory in both instances, Aurangzeb was frustrated that Shah Jahan chose then to settle for negotiations with the opposing forces rather than pushing for complete victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandra2005p267&quot; /&gt;

===War of Succession===
[[File:Aurangzebs palace.jpg|thumb|[[Sepoy]]s loyal to the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb maintain their positions around the palace, at Aurangabad, in 1658.]]
The four sons of Shah Jahan all held governorships during their father's reign. The emperor favoured the eldest, [[Dara Shukoh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scroll.in/article/879195/aurangzeb-and-dara-shikohs-fight-for-the-throne-was-entwined-with-the-rivalry-of-their-two-sisters|title=Aurangzeb and Dara Shikoh's fight for the throne was entwined with the rivalry of their two sisters}}&lt;/ref&gt; This had caused resentment among the younger three, who sought at various times to strengthen alliances between themselves and against Dara. There was no Mughal tradition of [[primogeniture]], the systematic passing of rule, upon an emperor's death, to his eldest son.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandra2005p267&quot; /&gt; Instead it was customary for sons to overthrow their father and for brothers to war to the death among themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;google96&quot;&gt;{{cite book |date=2004 |origyear=First published 1994 as ''Histoire de l'Inde Moderne'' |editor-first=Claude |editor-last=Markovits |title=A History of Modern India, 1480–1950 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uzOmy2y0Zh4C |edition=2nd |location=London |publisher=Anthem Press |page=96 |isbn=978-1-84331-004-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Satish Chandra]] says that &quot;In the ultimate resort, connections among the powerful military leaders, and military strength and capacity [were] the real arbiters&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandra2005p267&quot; /&gt; The contest for power was primarily between Dara Shikoh and Aurangzeb because, although all four sons had demonstrated competence in their official roles, it was around these two that the supporting cast of officials and other influential people mostly circulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Richards|1996|pp=151–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were ideological differences&amp;nbsp;— Dara was an intellectual and a religious liberal in the mould of Akbar, while Aurangzeb was much more conservative&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;but, as historians [[Barbara D. Metcalf]] and [[Thomas R. Metcalf]] say, &quot;To focus on divergent philosophies neglects the fact that Dara was a poor general and leader. It also ignores the fact that factional lines in the succession dispute were not, by and large, shaped by ideology.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Concise History of Modern India |first1=Barbara D. |last1=Metcalf |first2=Thomas R. |last2=Metcalf |authorlink1=Barbara D.

Jahanara, certainly, interceded at various times on behalf of all of the princes and was well-regarded by Aurangzeb even though she shared the religious outlook of Dara.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandra2005p271&quot; /&gt;

In 1656, a general under [[Qutb Shahi dynasty]] named Musa Khan led an army of 12,000 musketeers to attack Aurangzeb,{{where|date=July 2018}} and later on the same campaign Aurangzeb, in turn, rode against an army consisting 8,000 horsemen and 20,000 [[Karnataka]] musketeers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kolff |first1=Dirk H.

Having made clear that he wanted Dara to succeed him, Shah Jahan became ill with [[stranguary]] in 1657 and was closeted under the care of his favourite son in the newly built city of [[Shahjahanabad]] (Old Delhi). Rumours of the death of Shah Jahan abounded and the younger sons were concerned that Dara might be hiding it for Machiavellian reasons. Thus, they took action: [[Shah Shuja (Mughal)|Shah Shuja]] In [[Bengal]], where he had been governor since 1637, Prince Muhammad Shuja crowned himself King at RajMahal, and brought his cavalry, artillery and river flotilla upriver towards Agra. Near Varanasi his forces confronted a defending army sent from Delhi under the command of Prince Sulaiman Shukoh, son of Dara Shukoh, and Raja Jai Singh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=John F|title=The New Cambridge History of India|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Delhi|isbn=978-81-85618-49-4|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Murad did the same in his governorship of Gujarat and Aurangzeb did so in the Deccan.

[[File:Aurangzeb detail from- Estampes par Nicolas de Larmessin.f153.Aurangzeb, grand moghol (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Aurangzeb becomes emperor.]]
After regaining some of his health, Shah Jahan moved to Agra and Dara urged him to send forces to challenge Shah Shuja and Murad, who had declared themselves rulers in their respective territories. While Shah Shuja was defeated at [[Varanasi|Banares]] in February 1658, the army sent to deal with Murad discovered to their surprise that he and Aurangzeb had combined their forces,&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandra2005p271&quot; /&gt; the two brothers having agreed to partition the empire once they had gained control of it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandra2005p272&quot; /&gt; The two armies clashed at Dharmat in April 1658, with Aurangzeb being the victor. Shuja was being chased through [[Bihar]] and the victory of Aurangzeb proved this to be a poor decision by Dara Shikoh, who now had a defeated force on one front and a successful force unnecessarily pre-occupied on another. Realising that his recalled Bihar forces would not arrive at Agra in time to resist the emboldened Aurangzeb's advance, Dara scrambled to form alliances in order but found that Aurangzeb had already courted key potential candidates. When Dara's disparate, hastily concocted army clashed with Aurangzeb's well-disciplined, battle-hardened force at the [[Battle of Samugarh]] in late May, neither Dara's men nor his generalship were any match for Aurangzeb. Dara had also become over-confident in his own abilities and, by ignoring advice not to lead in battle while his father was alive, he cemented the idea that he had usurped the throne.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandra2005p271&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals |volume=2 |publisher=Har-Anand Publications |year=2005 |isbn=9788124110669 |first=Satish |last=Chandra |authorlink=Satish Chandra |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Rm9MC4DDrcC&amp;pg=PA270 |pages=270–271 |accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;After the defeat of Dara, Shah Jahan was imprisoned in the fort of Agra where he spent eight long years under the care of his favourite daughter Jahanara.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sen2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Sailendra |title=A Textbook of Medieval Indian History |publisher=Primus Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-38060-734-4 |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aurangzeb then broke his arrangement with Murad Baksh, which probably had been his intention all along.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandra2005p272&quot; /&gt; Instead of looking to partition the empire between himself and Murad, he had his brother arrested and imprisoned at Gwalior Fort. Murad was executed on 4 December 1661, ostensibly for the murder of the ''[[Diwan (title)|diwan]]'' of Gujarat sometime earlier. The allegation was encouraged by Aurangzeb, who caused the ''diwan's'' son to seek retribution for the death under the principles of [[Sharia law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Richards|1996|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Dara gathered his forces, and moved to the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. The army sent against Shuja was trapped in the east, its generals [[Jai Singh I|Jai Singh]] and Dilir Khan submitted to Aurangzeb, but Dara's son, Suleiman Shikoh, escaped. Aurangzeb offered Shah Shuja the governorship of Bengal. This move had the effect of isolating Dara Shikoh and causing more troops to defect to Aurangzeb. Shah Shuja, who had declared himself emperor in Bengal began to annex more territory and this prompted Aurangzeb to march from Punjab with a new and large army that fought during the [[Battle of Khajwa]], where Shah Shuja and his [[chain mail|chain-mail]] armoured war elephants were routed by the forces loyal to Aurangzeb. Shah Shuja then fled to [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] (in present-day Burma), where he was executed by the local rulers.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge History of India'' (1922), vol. IV, p. 481.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Shuja and Murad disposed of, and with his father immured in Agra, Aurangzeb pursued Dara Shikoh, chasing him across the north-western bounds of the empire. Aurangzeb claimed that Dara was no longer a Muslim {{citation needed |date=June 2018}} and accused him of poisoning the Mughal [[Grand Vizier]] Saadullah Khan. After a series of battles, defeats and retreats, Dara was betrayed by one of his generals, who arrested and bound him. In 1658, Aurangzeb arranged his formal coronation in Delhi.

On 10 August 1659, Dara was executed on grounds of apostasy and his head was sent to Shahjahan.&lt;ref name=&quot;sen2&quot;/&gt; Having secured his position, Aurangzeb confined his frail father at the Agra Fort but did not mistreat him. Shah Jahan was cared for by Jahanara and died in 1666.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandra2005p272&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals |volume=2 |publisher=Har-Anand Publications |year=2005 |isbn=9788124110669 |first=Satish |last=Chandra |authorlink=Satish Chandra |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Rm9MC4DDrcC&amp;pg=PA270 |page=272 |accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reign==
===Bureaucracy===
[[File:Mughal-empire-map.jpg|thumb|Mughal Empire under Aurangzeb in early 18th century]]

Aurangzeb's imperial bureaucracy employed significantly more [[Hindu]]s than that of his predecessors. Between 1679 and 1707, the number of Hindu officials in the Mughal administration rose by half, many of them [[Marathas]] and [[Rajputs]]. His increasing employment of Hindus and [[Shia Muslim]]s was deemed controversial at the time, with several of his fellow [[Sunni Muslim]] officials petitioning against it, which he rejected, and responded, &quot;What connection have earthly affairs with religion? And what right have administrative works to meddle with bigotry? 'For you is your religion and for me is mine.&quot; He insisted on employment based on ability rather than religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Truschke50&quot;/&gt;

Under Aurangzeb's reign, Hindus rose to represent 31.6% of Mughal nobility, the highest in the Mughal era. This was largely due to a substantial influx of Marathas, who played a key role in his successful [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Truschke60&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Aurangzeb: The Life and Legacy of India's Most Controversial King|author=Audrey Truschke|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|year=2017|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oUUkDwAAQBAJ |page=60 |isbn=9781503602595|quote=As expected, Aurangzeb’s ascension initially changed little about the Hindu share in Mughal administration. Under Akbar, for example, Hindus were 22.5 percent of all Mughal nobles. That percentage hardly budged in either direction under Shah Jahan, and, in the first twenty-one years of Aurangzeb’s reign (1658–79), it stayed level at 21.6 percent. But between 1679 and 1707 Aurangzeb increased Hindu participation at the elite levels of the Mughal state by nearly 50 percent. Hindus rose to 31.6 percent of the Mughal nobility. This dramatic rise featured a substantial influx of Marathas as a strategic aspect of expanding Mughal sovereignty across the Deccan.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time, the number of Hindu Mansabdars increased from 22% to over 31% in the Mughal administration, as he needed them to continue his fight in the Deccan.&lt;ref name=&quot;google1&quot;/&gt; However, one of his Rajput nobles, [[Jaswant Singh of Marwar|Jaswant Singh of Jodhpur]], Hindu ruler of [[Jodhpur]], &quot;destroyed [[mosques]] and built idol-temples in their stead&quot; around 1658–1659, according to Aurangzeb. Despite this, relationships did not turn sour between the two, as they worked together for the next two decades up until Singh's death in the late 1670s.&lt;ref name=&quot;wire&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=As Aurangzeb is Erased, Here are Some Tales From the Flip Side of History|website=[[The Wire (Indian web publication)|The Wire]]|author=Harbans Mukhia|year=2015|url=https://thewire.in/9943/as-aurangzeb-is-erased-here-are-some-tales-from-the-flip-side-of-history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishment of Islamic law===
[[File:Aurangzeb 27.jpg|thumb|Aurangzeb compiled [[Hanafi]] law by introducing the [[Fatawa-e-Alamgiri]].]]

Aurangzeb was an orthodox Muslim ruler. Subsequent to the policies of his three predecessors, he endeavored to make [[Islam]] a dominant force in his reign. However these efforts brought him into conflict with the forces that were opposed to this revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=|first=|date=1977|editor-last=Holt|editor-first=P.

Historian Katherine Brown has noted that &quot;The very name of Aurangzeb seems to act in the popular imagination as a signifier of politico-religious bigotry and repression, regardless of historical accuracy.&quot; The subject has also resonated in modern times with popularly accepted claims that he intended to destroy the [[Bamiyan Buddhas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Katherine Butler |last=Brown |date=January 2007 |title=Did Aurangzeb Ban Music?

A principal factor was the popular revulsion against his treatment of his brothers, Murad and Dara, both of whom had the reputation of being liberal patrons of the poor and needy.

The introduction of ''jizya'' in 1679 was a response to several events shortly before its introduction: the great [[Rajput]] rebellion of 1678, the Maratha alliance with the [[Shia]] [[Golconda]], and the Mughal expansion into the Deccan. However, according to Jamal Malik, the contemporary historian Khafi Khan (died 1733), whose family had served Aurangzeb, noted that ''jizya'' could not be levied and remained largely a tax on paper only.&lt;ref name=&quot;google1&quot;/&gt;

===Policy on temples and mosques===
[[File:The Qoeens and ladies of the harem of the emperor Aurangazeb travelling to Kashmir.jpg|thumb|The Queens and ladies of the harem of the emperor Aurangazeb travelling to Kashmir]]
During his reign, Aurangzeb ordered the destruction of many temples and some mosques. For example, he ordered the destruction of [[Kashi Vishwanath Temple|Vishvanath Temple]] at [[Varanasi]] for being a centre of conspiracy against the state, and he ordered the destruction of the [[Jama Masjid]] at [[Golkonda|Golkunda]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=K. Moti Gokulsing |author2=Wimal Dissanayake |year=2009 |title=Popular Culture in a Globalised India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXx9AgAAQBAJ |publisher=Routledge |page=99 |isbn=978-1-134-02307-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; after finding out that its ruler had built the mosque in order to hide revenues from the state.

Aurangzeb displayed a particular animus towards Hindus and their temples. In the first volume of his Pulitzer Prize winning book series, historian Will Durant&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will 1935, p.475.&lt;/ref&gt; stated the following:

{{quote|Aurangzeb cared nothing for art, destroyed its &quot;heathen&quot; monuments with coarse bigotry, and fought, through a reign of half a century, to eradicate from India almost all religions but his own. He issued orders to the provincial governors, and to his other subordinates, 'to raze to the ground all the temples of either Hindus or Christians, to smash every idol, and to close every Hindu school. In one year (1679–80) sixty-six temples were broken to pieces in Amber alone, sixtythree at Chitor, one hundred and twenty-three at Udaipur; and over the site of a Benares temple especially sacred to the Hindus he built, in deliberate insult, a Mohammedan mosque. He forbade all public worship of the Hindu faiths, and laid upon every unconverted Hindu a heavy capitation tax.

As a result of his fanaticism, thousands of the temples which had represented or housed the art of India through a millennium were laid in ruins. We can never know, from looking at India today, what grandeur and beauty she once possessed. Aurangzeb converted a handful of timid Hindus to Islam, but he wrecked his dynasty and his country. A few Moslems worshiped him as a saint, but the mute and terrorized millions of India looked upon him as a monster, fled from his tax-gatherers, and prayed for his death. During his reign the Mogul empire in India reached its height, extending into the Deccan; but it was a power that had no foundation in the affection of the people, and was doomed to fall at the first hostile and vigorous touch. The Emperor himself, in his last years, began to realize that by the very narrowness of his piety he had destroyed the heritage of his fathers.}}

Aurangzeb changed the name of one of Hinduism's holiest cities, [[Varanasi|Benaras]], to ''Muhammadabad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1DDjCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT149&amp;dq=aurangzeb+benaras#v=onepage&amp;q=aurangzeb%20benaras&amp;f=false|title=The Saffron Book|first=Prafull|last=Goradia|year=2016|isbn=9788128816628}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Jat rebellion in Mathura, Aurangzeb ordered the city's [[Kesava Deo temple]] demolished, and built an ''[[Eidgah]]'' in its place. In 1679, he ordered destruction of several prominent temples that had become associated with his enemies, including those of Khandela, Udaipur, Chittor and Jodhpur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eaton |first=Richard |year=2000 |title=Temple Desecration and Indo-Muslim States |journal=Journal of Islamic Studies |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=307–308 |quote=In early 1670, soon after the ring-leader of these rebellions had been captured near Mathura, Aurangzeb ordered the destruction of the city's Keshava Deva temple and built an Islamic structure ('īd-gāh) on its site ...

Udaipur and Chitor.|doi=10.1093/jis/11.3.283 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars point out that Aurangzeb also built many temples. Ian Copland says that he built more temples than he destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Copland2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ian Copland |author2=Ian Mabbett |author3=Asim Roy |author4=Kate Brittlebank |author5=Adam Bowles |title=A History of State and Religion in India |year=2013 |publisher=Routledge |page=119 |isbn=978-1-136-45950-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ram Puniyani]] states that Aurangzeb was not fanatically anti-Hindu, but rather continuously adapted his policies depending on circumstances. He banned the construction of new temples, but allowed the repair and maintenance of existing temples, and even made generous donations of ''jagirs'' to many temples to gain the goodwill of his Hindu subjects. There are several ''firman''s (orders) in his name, supporting temples and [[gurudwara]]s, including [[Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga|Mahakaleshwar temple]] of [[Ujjain]], Balaji temple of [[Chitrakoot district|Chitrakoot]], [[Umananda Temple]] of [[Guwahati]] and the [[Shatrunjaya]] [[Jain]] temples, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ram |last=Puniyani |author-link=Ram Puniyani |year=2003 |title=Communal politics: facts versus myths |publisher=SAGE Publications |page=60 |isbn=978-0-7619-9667-5 |quote=he kept changing his policies depending on the needs of the situation ... he had put a brake on the construction of new temples but the repair and maintenance of old temples was permitted.

''firmans'' include the ones from the temples of Mahakaleshwar (Ujjain), Balaji temple (Chitrakut), Umanand temples (Guwahati) and Jain temples of Shatrunjaya. Also there are ''firmans'' supporting other temples and gurudwaras in north India.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Execution of opponents===
The first prominent execution during the long reign of Aurangzeb started with that of his brother Prince [[Dara Shikoh]], who was accused of being influenced by Hinduism although some sources argue it was done for political reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson&quot;&gt;Gerald James Larson, ''India's Agony Over Religion'', (State University of New York Press, 1995), 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Aurangzeb had his allied brother Prince [[Murad Baksh]] held for murder, judged and then executed.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Shorter History of India'', Vol. II, ed.

===Expansion of the Mughal Empire===
[[File:Darbarscene.jpg|thumb|Aurangzeb seated on a golden throne holding a [[Hawk]] in the [[Durbar (court)|Durbar]]. Standing before him is his son, [[Azam Shah]].]]

In 1663, during his visit to [[Ladakh]], Aurangzeb established direct control over that part of the empire and loyal subjects such as Deldan Namgyal agreed to pledge tribute and loyalty. Deldan Namgyal is also known to have constructed a Grand Mosque in [[Leh]], which he dedicated to Mughal rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mg8My6WaWRcC&amp;pg=PA63 |title=Rediscovery of Ladakh |first=H.

[[File:Aurangzeb T0000253 104.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Aurangzeb seated on the [[Peacock Throne]].]]

In 1664, Aurangzeb appointed [[Shaista Khan]] [[subedar]] (governor) of Bengal. Shaista Khan eliminated Portuguese and [[Arakanese people|Arakanese]] pirates from the region, and in 1666 recaptured the port of [[Chittagong]] from the Arakanese king, [[Sanda Thudhamma]]. Chittagong remained a key port throughout Mughal rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=2004 |origyear=First published 1994 as ''Histoire de l'Inde Moderne'' |editor-first=Claude |editor-last=Markovits |title=A History of Modern India, 1480–1950 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uzOmy2y0Zh4C |edition=2nd |location=London |publisher=Anthem Press |page=106 |isbn=978-1-84331-004-4 |quote=Shayista Khan ... was appointed [Bengal's] governor in 1664 and swept the region clean of Portuguese and Arakanese pirates ... in 1666, he recaptured the port of Chittagong ... from the king of Arakan. A strategic outpost, Chittagong would remain the principal commercial port of call before entering the waters of the delta.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1685, Aurangzeb dispatched his son, [[Muhammad Azam Shah]], with a force of nearly 50,000 men to capture [[Bijapur Fort]] and defeat [[Sikandar Adil Shah]] (the ruler of Bijapur) who refused to be a vassal. The Mughals could not make any advancements upon Bijapur Fort,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=sxhAtCflwOMC&amp;pg=PA263&amp;dq=Aurangzeb+bijapur+1686#v=onepage&amp;q=Aurangzeb%20bijapur%201686&amp;f=false|title=A Comprehensive History of Medieval India: Twelfth to the Mid-Eighteenth Century|isbn=9788131732021|last1=Farooqui|first1=Salma Ahmed|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly because of the superior usage of cannon batteries on both sides. Outraged by the stalemate Aurangzeb himself arrived on 4 September 1686 and commanded the [[Siege of Bijapur]]; after eight days of fighting, the Mughals were victorious.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Only one remaining ruler, [[Abul Hasan Qutb Shah]] (the Qutbshahi ruler of Golconda), refused to surrender. He and his servicemen fortified themselves at Golconda and fiercely protected the [[Kollur Mine]], which was then probably the world's most productive diamond mine, and an important economic asset. In 1687, Aurangzeb led his grand Mughal army against the Deccan Qutbshahi fortress during the [[Siege of Golconda]]. The Qutbshahis had constructed massive fortifications throughout successive generations on a [[granite]] hill over 400&amp;nbsp;ft high with an enormous eight-mile long wall enclosing the city. The main gates of Golconda had the ability to repulse any war elephant attack. Although the Qutbshahis maintained the impregnability of their walls, at night Aurangzeb and his infantry erected complex [[scaffold]]ing that allowed them to scale the high walls. During the eight-month siege the Mughals faced many hardships including the death of their experienced commander [[Kilich Khan II|Kilich Khan Bahadur]]. Eventually, Aurangzeb and his forces managed to penetrate the walls by capturing a gate, and their entry into the fort led Abul Hasan Qutb Shah to surrender peacefully.

Despite these innovations, most soldiers used bows and arrows, the quality of sword manufacture was so poor that they preferred to use ones imported from England, and the operation of the cannons was entrusted not to Mughals but to European gunners. Other weapons used during the period included rockets, cauldrons of boiling oil, muskets and [[manjaniq]]s (stone-throwing catapults).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Greek Fire and Gunpowder |first=James Riddick |last=Partington |authorlink=James Riddick Partington |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=1998 |origyear=1960 (Cambridge: W.

====War elephants====
In 1703, the Mughal commander at [[Coromandel Coast|Coromandel]], [[Daud Khan Panni]] spent 10,500 coins to purchase 30 to 50 [[war elephant]]s from [[Ceylon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=3C1vz5ioOMwC |page=122 |title=Mughal Warfare: Indian Frontiers and Highroads to Empire, 1500–1700 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art and culture===
Aurangzeb had a more austere nature than his predecessors, and greatly reduced imperial patronage of the figurative [[Mughal miniature]].&lt;ref&gt;''Imperial Mughal Painting'', [[Stuart Cary Welch]], (New York: George Braziller, 1978), pp. 112-13. &quot;In spite of his later austerity, which turned him against music, dance, and painting, a few of the best Mughal paintings were made for [Aurangzeb] 'Alamgir. Perhaps the painters realized that he might close the workshops and therefore exceeded themselves in his behalf&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; This had the effect of dispersing the court atelier to other regional courts. Being religious he encouraged Islamic calligraphy. His reign also saw the building of the Lahore [[Badshahi Masjid]] and [[Bibi Ka Maqbara]] in Aurangabad for his wife Rabia-ud-Daurani.

====Calligraphy====
[[File:Aurangzeb Handwritten Quran.jpg|thumb|right|Manuscript ''[[Quran]]'', parts of which are believed to have been written in Aurangzeb's own hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://abna.ir/data.asp?lang=3&amp;id=202553 |title = Emirates owner to sell Quran inscribed by Aurangzeb |date = 2018-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb is known to have patronised works of [[Islamic calligraphy]] during his reign particularly [[Syed Ali Tabrizi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Architecture====
Unlike his father, Aurangzeb was not much interested in architecture. Aurangzeb constructed a small marble mosque known as the [[Moti Masjid (Delhi)|Moti Masjid]] (Pearl Mosque) in the [[Red Fort]] complex in Delhi. He ordered the construction of the [[Badshahi Mosque]] in [[Lahore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=2004 |origyear=First published 1994 as ''Histoire de l'Inde Moderne'' |editor-first=Claude |editor-last=Markovits |title=A History of Modern India, 1480–1950 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uzOmy2y0Zh4C |edition=2nd |location=London |publisher=Anthem Press |page=166 |isbn=978-1-84331-004-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also constructed a mosque on [[Benares]]. The mosque he constructed in Srinagar is still the largest in [[Kashmir]]. The structure of [[Bibi Ka Maqbara]] in Aurangabad, which now is a historical monument was constructed by the sons of Aurangzeb in remembrance of their mother. The inspiration came from Taj mahal as is quite visible from its architecture.&lt;ref name=bibi&gt;{{cite web |title=World Heritage Sites.

====Textiles====
The textile industry in the Mughal Empire emerged very firmly during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb and was particularly well noted by Francois Bernier, a French physician of the Mughal Emperor. Francois Bernier writes how ''Karkanahs'', or workshops for the artisans, particularly in textiles flourished by &quot;employing hundreds of embroiderers, who were superintended by a master&quot;. He further writes how &quot;Artisans manufacture of silk, fine brocade, and other fine muslins, of which are made turbans, robes of gold flowers, and tunics worn by females, so delicately fine as to wear out in one night, and cost even more if they were well embroidered with fine needlework&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;saudiaramcoworld&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Werner |first=Louis |date=July–August 2011 |title=Mughal Maal |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/201104/mughal.maal.htm |magazine=Saudi Aramco World |access-date=3 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222152801/http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/201104/mughal.maal.htm |archive-date=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also explains the different techniques employed to produce such complicated textiles such as ''Himru'' (whose name is Persian for &quot;brocade&quot;), ''Paithani'' (whose pattern is identical on both sides), ''Mushru'' (satin weave) and how ''Kalamkari'', in which fabrics are painted or block-printed, was a technique that originally came from Persia. Francois Bernier provided some of the first, impressive descriptions of the designs and the soft, delicate texture of [[Shawl|Pashmina Shawls]] also known as ''Kani'', which were very valued for their warmth and comfort among the Mughals, and how these textiles and shawls eventually began to find their way to France and England.&lt;ref name=&quot;saudiaramcoworld2&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Hansen |first=Eric |date=July–August 2002 |title=Pashmina: Kashmir's Best Cashmere |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200204/pashmina-kashmir.s.best.cashmere.htm |magazine=Saudi Aramco World |access-date=3 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041027085612/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200204/pashmina-kashmir.s.best.cashmere.htm |archive-date=27 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aurangzeb sent diplomatic missions to [[Mecca]] in 1659 and 1662, with money and gifts for the [[Sharif of Mecca|Sharif]]. He also sent alms in 1666 and 1672 to be distributed in Mecca and [[Medina]]. Historian Naimur Rahman Farooqi writes that, &quot;By 1694, Aurangzeb's ardour for the Sharifs of Mecca had begun to wane; their greed and rapacity had thoroughly disillusioned the Emperor ... Aurangzeb expressed his disgust at the unethical behavior of the Sharif who appropriated all the money sent to the [[Hijaz]] for his own use, thus depriving the needy and the poor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Farooqi |first=Naimur Rahman |year=1989 |title=Mughal-Ottoman Relations |location=Delhi |publisher=Idarah-i Adabiyat-i Delli |pages=124, 126 |oclc=20894584 |quote=In November 1659, shortly after his formal coronation, Aurangzeb sent ... a diplomatic mission to Mecca ... entrusted with 630.000 rupees for the Sharif families of Mecca and Medina ...

In 1666 ... alms and offerings; ... six years later ... several lakhs of rupees; the money was to be spent in charity in Mecca and Medina.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations with the Uzbek===
Subhan Quli, [[Balkh]]'s Uzbek ruler was the first to recognise him in 1658 and requested for a general alliance, he worked alongside the new Mughal Emperor since 1647, when Aurangzeb was the Subedar of Balkh.

===Relations with the Safavid dynasty===
Aurangzeb received the embassy of [[Abbas II of Persia]] in 1660 and returned them with gifts. However, relations between the Mughal Empire and the [[Safavid dynasty]] were tense because the Persians attacked the Mughal army positioned near [[Kandahar]]. Aurangzeb prepared his armies in the Indus River Basin for a counteroffensive, but Abbas II's death in 1666 caused Aurangzeb to end all hostilities. Aurangzeb's rebellious son, [[Sultan Muhammad Akbar]], sought refuge with [[Suleiman I of Persia]], who had rescued him from the [[Imam]] of [[Musqat]] and later refused to assist him in any military adventures against Aurangzeb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rudi |last=Matthee |title=Persia in Crisis: Safavid Decline and the Fall of Isfahan |pages=126, 136 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fFaw4od7nfUC&amp;pg=PA126|isbn=9781845117450 |date=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations with the French===
In 1667, the French East India Company ambassadors Le Gouz and Bebert presented [[Louis XIV of France]]'s letter which urged the protection of French merchants from various rebels in the Deccan. In response to the letter, Aurangzeb issued a [[Firman]] allowing the French to open a factory in [[Surat]].

===Relations with the Sultanate of Maldives===
In the 1660s, the Sultan of the Maldives, [[Ibrahim Iskandar I]], requested help from Aurangzeb's representative, the [[Faujdar]] of [[Balasore]]. The sultan was concerned about the impact of Dutch and English trading ships but the powers of Aurangzeb did not extend to the seas, the Maldives were not under his governance, and nothing came of the request.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Tripathy |first=Rasananda |year=1986 |title=Crafts and commerce in Orissa in the sixteenth-seventeenth centuries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ybX1-CqEXPkC&amp;pg=PA91 |location=Delhi |publisher=Mittal Publications |page=91 |oclc=14068594 |access-date=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations with the Ottoman Empire===
Like his father, Aurangzeb was not willing to acknowledge the Ottoman claim to the [[caliphate]]. He often supported the Ottoman Empire's enemies, extending cordial welcome to two rebel Governors of Basra, and granting them and their families a high status in the imperial service. Sultan [[Suleiman II of the Ottoman Empire|Suleiman II]]'s friendly postures were ignored by Aurangzeb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uB1uAAAAMAAJ |title=Mughal-Ottoman relations: a study of political &amp; diplomatic relations |first=Naimur Rahman|last=Farooqi |publisher=Idarah-i Adabiyat-i Delli|year=1989|pages=332–333|quote=Aurangzeb, who seized the Peacock throne from Shahjahan, was equally unwilling to acknowledge the Ottoman claim to the Khilafat.

In 1686, the [[East India Company|British East India Company]], which had unsuccessfully tried to obtain a [[firman]] (imperial directive) that would grant [[England]] regular trading privileges throughout the Mughal empire, initiated the so-called [[Child's War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Asia.aspx# |title=Asia Facts, information, pictures &amp;#124; Encyclopedia.com articles about Asia &amp;#124; Europe, 1450 to 1789: Encyclopedia of the Early Modern World |publisher=encyclopedia.com|accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hostility against the empire ended in disaster for the English, particularly in 1689 when Aurangzeb dispatched a strong fleet of [[Grab (ship)|grab]] ships from [[Janjira State|Janjira]] that blockaded [[Bombay]]. The ships, commanded by [[Sidi Yaqub]], were manned by [[Mappila]] (loyal to [[Arakkal kingdom|Ali Raja Ali II]]) and [[Abyssinian people|Abyssinian]] sailors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vvNtAAAAMAAJ |title=Aurangzeb and His times |first=Zahiruddin |last=Faruki |publisher=Idarah-i Adabiyāt-i Delli |year=1935 |location=Bombay |edition=Reprinted |accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2012}} In 1690, the company sent envoys to Aurangzeb's camp to plead for a pardon. The company's envoys had to prostrate themselves before the emperor, pay a large indemnity, and promise better behaviour in the future.

In September 1695, English pirate [[Henry Every]] perpetrated one of the most profitable pirate raids in history with his capture of a Grand Mughal grab convoy near [[Surat]]. The Indian ships had been returning home from their annual pilgrimage to Mecca when the pirates struck, capturing the ''[[Ganj-i-Sawai]]'', reportedly the greatest ship in the Muslim fleet, and its escorts in the process. When news of the piracy reached the mainland, a livid Aurangzeb nearly ordered an armed attack against the English-governed city of Bombay, though he finally agreed to compromise after the East India Company promised to pay financial reparations, estimated at £600,000 by the Mughal authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burgess&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burgess |first1=Douglas R. |year=2009 |title=Piracy in the Public Sphere: The Henry Every Trials and the Battle for Meaning in Seventeenth‐Century Print Culture |journal=Journal of British Studies |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=887–913 |doi=10.1086/603599 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Aurangzeb shut down four of the East India Company's [[Factory (trading post)|factories]], imprisoned the workers and captains (who were nearly lynched by a rioting mob), and threatened to put an end to all English trading in India until Every was captured.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burgess&quot;/&gt; The Privy Council and East India Company offered a massive bounty for Every's apprehension, leading to the first worldwide manhunt in recorded history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pirates' Pact: The Secret Alliances Between History's Most Notorious Buccaneers and Colonial America |last=Burgess |first=Douglas R. |year=2009 |publisher= McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-07-147476-4 |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Every successfully eluded capture.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Aurangzeb felt that verses from the ''Quran'' should not be stamped on coins, as done in former times, because they were constantly touched by the hands and feet of people.

Traditional and newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, Rajputs, [[Hindu Jats]], [[Pashtuns]], and [[Sikh]]s, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or opposition, gave them both recognition and military experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Metcalf |first1=Barbara D. |authorlink1=Barbara D.

In 1669, [[Hindu Jats]] began to organise a rebellion that is believed to have been caused by Aurangzeb's imposition of ''[[jizya]]'' (a form of organised religious taxation).{{sfn|Avari|2013|p=131|ps=: Crisis arose in the north among the Jat agriculturists dissatisfied with punitive imperial taxation ...

Gokula was caught and executed. But the Jats once again attempted began their rebellion.

In 1657, while Aurangzeb attacked Golconda and Bijapur in the Deccan, the Hindu [[Maratha]] warrior, [[Shivaji]], used guerrilla tactics to take control of three Adil Shahi forts formerly under his father's command. With these victories, Shivaji assumed de facto leadership of many independent Maratha clans. The Marathas harried the flanks of the warring Adil Shahis, gaining weapons, forts, and territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kincaid |first=Dennis |year=1937 |title=The Grand Rebel: An Impression of Shivaji, Founder of the Maratha Empire |location=London |publisher=Collins |pages=72–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shivaji's small and ill-equipped army survived an all out Adil Shahi attack, and Shivaji personally killed the Adil Shahi general, Afzal Khan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kincaid |first=Dennis |year=1937 |title=The Grand Rebel: An Impression of Shivaji Maharaj, Founder of the Maratha Empire |location=London |publisher=Collins |pages=121–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this event, the Marathas transformed into a powerful military force, capturing more and more Adil Shahi territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kincaid |first=Dennis |year=1937 |title=The Grand Rebel: An Impression of Shivaji, Founder of the Maratha Empire |location=London |publisher=Collins |pages=130–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shivaji went on to neutralise Mughal power in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=2004 |origyear=First published 1994 as ''Histoire de l'Inde Moderne'' |editor-first=Claude |editor-last=Markovits |title=A History of Modern India, 1480–1950 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uzOmy2y0Zh4C |edition=2nd |location=London |publisher=Anthem Press |page=102 |isbn=978-1-84331-004-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1659, Aurangzeb sent his trusted general and maternal uncle Shaista Khan, the [[Wali]] in Golconda to recover forts lost to the Maratha rebels. Shaista Khan drove into Maratha territory and took up residence in [[Pune]]. But in a daring raid on the governor's palace in Pune during a midnight wedding celebration, led by Shivaji himself, the Marathas killed Shaista Khan's son and Shivaji maimed Shaista Khan by cutting off three fingers of his hand. Shaista Khan, however, survived and was re-appointed the administrator of Bengal going on to become a key commander in the war against the Ahoms.

Shivaji captured forts belonging to both Mughals and Bijapur. At last Aurangzeb ordered the armament of the [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra|Daulatabad Fort]] with two [[Bombard (weapon)|bombards]] (the Daulatabad Fort was later used as a Mughal bastion during the Deccan Wars). Aurangzeb also sent his general [[Jai Singh I|Raja Jai Singh]] of [[Amber, India|Amber]], a Hindu Rajput, to attack the Marathas. Jai Singh won the [[Purandar fort|fort of Purandar]] after fierce battle in which the Maratha commander [[Murarbaji]] fell. Foreseeing defeat, Shivaji agreed for a truce and a meeting with Aurangzeb at Delhi. Jai Singh also promised Shivaji his safety, placing him under the care of his own son, the future Raja [[Ram Singh I]]. However, circumstances at the Mughal court were beyond the control of the Raja, and when Shivaji and his son [[Sambhaji]] went to Agra to meet Aurangzeb, they were placed under house arrest because of Shivaji's apparent misbehaviour, from which they managed to effect a daring escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kincaid |first=Dennis |year=1937 |title= The History of Medieviel India:from sultanates to mughals by Satish Chandra|publisher=Penguin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shivaji returned to the Deccan, and crowned himself ''Chhatrapati'' or the ruler of the Maratha Kingdom in 1674.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kincaid |first=Dennis |year=1937 |title=The Grand Rebel: An Impression of Shivaji, Founder of the Maratha Empire |location=London |publisher=Collins |page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Aurangzeb continued to send troops against him, Shivaji expanded Maratha control throughout the Deccan until his death in 1680. Shivaji was succeeded by his son, Sambhaji. Militarily and politically, Mughal efforts to control the Deccan continued to fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Mughal History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AZdCrUxFAHEC&amp;pg=PA42|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publication|first=Ashvini|last=Agrawal|year=1983|isbn=9788120823266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Aurangzeb's third son [[Sultan Muhammad Akbar|Akbar]] left the Mughal court along with a few Muslim Mansabdar supporters and joined Muslim rebels in the Deccan. Aurangzeb in response moved his court to Aurangabad and took over command of the Deccan campaign. The rebels were defeated and Akbar fled south to seek refuge with Sambhaji, Shivaji's successor. More battles ensued, and Akbar fled to [[Persia]] and never returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great Moghuls |first1=Bamber |last1=Gascoigne |first2=Christina |last2=Gascoigne |authorlink1=Bamber Gascoigne |publisher=Cape |year=1971 |pages=228–229 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ryFAAAAIAAJ |isbn=978-0-224-00580-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1689, Aurangzeb's forces captured and executed Sambhaji. His successor [[Rajaram Chhatrapati|Rajaram]], later Rajaram's widow [[Tarabai]] and their Maratha forces fought individual battles against the forces of the Mughal Empire. Territory changed hands repeatedly during the years (1689–1707) of interminable warfare . As there was no central authority among the Marathas, Aurangzeb was forced to contest every inch of territory, at great cost in lives and money. Even as Aurangzeb drove west, deep into Maratha territory&amp;nbsp;– notably conquering [[Satara district|Satara]]&amp;nbsp;— the Marathas expanded eastwards into Mughal lands&amp;nbsp;– [[Malwa]] and [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]]. The Marathas also expanded further South into Southern India defeating the independent local rulers there capturing[[Gingee|Jinji]] in Tamil Nadu. Aurangzeb waged continuous war in the Deccan for more than two decades with no resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great Moghuls |first1=Bamber |last1=Gascoigne |first2=Christina |last2=Gascoigne |authorlink1=Bamber Gascoigne |publisher=Cape |year=1971 |pages=239–246 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ryFAAAAIAAJ |isbn=978-0-224-00580-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thus lost about a fifth of his army fighting rebellions led by the Marathas in [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan India]]. He travelled a long distance to the Deccan to conquer the Marathas and eventually died at the age of 88, still fighting the Marathas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Stewart|title=The Marathas 1600–1818|date=1993|publisher=Cambridge University|location=New York|isbn=978-0521268837|pages=101–105|edition=1. publ.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iHK-BhVXOU4C&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=sarkar+shivaji+maratha#v=snippet&amp;q=aurangzeb%201707&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aurangzeb's shift from conventional warfare to anti-insurgency in the Deccan region shifted the paradigm of Mughal military thought. There were conflicts between Marathas and Mughals in [[Pune]], Jinji, Malwa and [[Vadodara]]. The Mughal Empire's port city of [[Surat]] was sacked twice by the Marathas during the reign of Aurangzeb and the valuable port was in ruins.&lt;ref name=&quot;google7&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of India|author1=Stein, B.|author2=Arnold, D.|date=2010|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9781444323511|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QY4zdTDwMAQC|page=181|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Matthew White (historian)|Matthew White]] estimates that about 2.5 million of Aurangzeb's army were killed during the Mughal–Maratha Wars (100,000 annually during a quarter-century), while 2 million civilians in war-torn lands died due to [[drought]], [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and [[Famine in India|famine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Matthew White|year=2011|title=Atrocitology: Humanity's 100 Deadliest Achievements|publisher=[[Canongate Books]] |page=113|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Q5w9qmd1UeMC&amp;pg=PP113|isbn=9780857861252|author-link=Matthew White (historian)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Aurangzeb and his brother Shah Shuja had been fighting against each other, the Hindu rulers of [[Kuch Behar]] and [[Assam]] took advantage of the disturbed conditions in the Mughal Empire, had invaded imperial dominions. For three years they were not attacked,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} but in 1660 [[Mir Jumla II]], the viceroy of Bengal, was ordered to recover the lost territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Sarkar |editor-first=Jadunath |editor-link=Jadunath Sarkar |year=1973 |orig-year=First published 1948 |title=The History of Bengal |volume=Volume II: Muslim Period, 1200-1757 |location=Patna |publisher=Academica Asiatica |page=346 |oclc=924890 |quote=Mir Jumla was appointed governor of Bengal (June 1660) and ordered to punish the kings of Kuch Bihar and Assam.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mughals set out in November 1661. Within weeks they occupied the capital of Kuch Behar, which they annexed. Leaving a detachment to garrison it, the Mughal army began to retake their territories in Assam. Mir Jumla II advanced on Garhgaon, the capital of the [[Ahom kingdom]], and reached it on 17 March 1662. The ruler, Raja [[Sutamla]], had fled before his approach. The Mughals captured 82 elephants, 300,000 rupees in cash, 1000 ships, and 173 stores of rice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Sarkar |editor-first=Jadunath |editor-link=Jadunath Sarkar |year=1973 |orig-year=First published 1948 |title=The History of Bengal |volume=Volume II: Muslim Period, 1200-1757 |location=Patna |publisher=Academica Asiatica |pages=346–347 |oclc=924890 |quote=[Mir Jumla] left Dacca on 1st November 1661 ... the Mughal army entered the capital of Kuch Bihar on 19th December ...

Munnawar Khan emerged as a leading figure and is known to have supplied food to vulnerable Mughal forces in the region near Mathurapur. Although the Mughals under the command of Syed Firoz Khan the [[Faujdar]] at Guwahati were overrun by two Ahom armies in 1667, but they continued to hold and maintain presence in their eastern territories even after the [[Battle of Saraighat]] in 1671.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The Battle of Saraighat was fought in 1671 between the Mughal empire (led by the Kachwaha king, Raja Ramsingh I), and the Ahom Kingdom (led by Lachit Borphukan) on the Brahmaputra river at Saraighat, now in Guwahati. Although much weaker, the Ahom Army defeated the Mughal Army by brilliant uses of the terrain, clever diplomatic negotiations to buy time, guerrilla tactics, psychological warfare, military intelligence and by exploiting the sole weakness of the Mughal forces—its navy.

The Battle of Saraighat was the last battle in the last major attempt by the Mughals to extend their empire into Assam. Though the Mughals managed to regain Guwahati briefly after a later Borphukan deserted it, the Ahoms wrested control in the Battle of Itakhuli in 1682 and maintained it till the end of their rule.&lt;ref name=ahom2&gt;Sarkar, J.

In May 1672, the Satnami sect obeying the commandments of an &quot;old toothless woman&quot; (according to Mughal accounts) organised a massive{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=April 2015}} revolt in the agricultural heartlands of the Mughal Empire. The Satnamis were known to have shaved off their heads and even eyebrows and had temples in many regions of [[Northern India]].

Aurangzeb responded by organising a [[Army of the Mughal Empire|Mughal army]] of 10,000 troops and artillery, and dispatched detachments of his own personal Mughal imperial guards to carry out several tasks. To boost Mughal morale, Aurangzeb wrote Islamic prayers, made [[amulet]]s, and drew designs that would become emblems in the Mughal Army.

Early in Aurangzeb's reign, various insurgent groups of Sikhs engaged Mughal troops in increasingly bloody battles. The ninth Sikh Guru, [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]], like his predecessors was opposed to conversion of the local population as he considered it wrong. According to Sikh sources, approached by [[Kashmiri Pandit]]s to help them retain their faith and avoid [[forced conversion|forced religious conversions]], Guru Tegh Bahadur took on Aurangzeb. The emperor perceived the rising popularity of the Guru as a threat to his sovereignty and in 1670 had him executed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sehgal |first=Narender |year=1994 |title=Converted Kashmir: Memorial of Mistakes |url=http://www.kashmir-information.com/ConvertedKashmir/Chapter14.html |location=Delhi |publisher=Utpal Publications |pages=152–153 |isbn=978-8185217062 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418030529/http://www.kashmir-information.com/ConvertedKashmir/Chapter14.html |archive-date=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which infuriated the Sikhs.

The Safi tribes retaliated against the soldiers. This attack provoked a reprisal, which triggered a general revolt of most of tribes. Attempting to reassert his authority, Amir Khan led a large Mughal Army to the [[Khyber Pass]], where the army was surrounded by tribesmen and routed, with only four men, including the Governor, managing to escape.

Aurangzeb's incursions into the Pashtun areas were described by Khushal Khan Khattak as &quot;Black is the Mughal's heart towards all of us Pathans&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sugata Bose|author2=Ayesha Jalal|title=Modern South Asia: History, Culture, Political Economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T4U0DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT80|date=7 September 2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-351-60305-8|pages=80–|quote='Black is the Mughal's heart towards all us Pathans', complained the Pushto poet Khushal Khan Khattak about Aurangzeb's incursions in the tribal regions of the northwest frontier of India.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aurangzeb employed the scorched earth policy, sending soldiers who massacred, looted and burnt many villages. Aurangzeb also proceeded to use bribery to turn the Pashtun tribes against each other, with the aim that they would distract a unified Pashtun challenge to Mughal authority, and the impact of this was to leave a lasting legacy of mistrust among the tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Omrani|first1=Bijan|title=The Durand Line: History and Problems of the Afghan-Pakistan Border|journal=Asian Affairs|date=July 2009|volume=XL|page=182|quote=The situation deteriorated and matters came to a head in 1675, at the time of the last great Mughal Emperor, Aurangzeb. He launched a terrible scorched earth policy, sending thousands of soldiers into the valleys, burning, despoiling, smashing villages and killing as many tribesmen as possible. He also successfully used bribery to set the tribal chiefs against each other, thus fomenting so much mutual suspicion that they were too busy fighting each other to fight the Mughal Empire. This worked up to a point. But the resulting legacy of mistrust between the tribes destroyed any prospect that unified political institutions might slowly emerge or that the laws and government of the settled regions might be adopted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After that the revolt spread, with the Mughals suffering a near total collapse of their authority in the Pashtun belt. The closure of the important [[Attock]]-[[Kabul]] trade route along the [[Grand Trunk road]] was particularly disastrous. By 1674, the situation had deteriorated to a point where Aurangzeb camped at Attock to personally take charge. Switching to diplomacy and bribery along with force of arms, the Mughals eventually split the rebels and partially suppressed the revolt, although they never managed to wield effective authority outside the main trade route.

Many Indian historians consider his death year 1707 as the one which marks the end of Medieval Indian history and the start of Modern Indian history when classifying Indian history. This is because of the start of decline of the Mughal empire and the start of domination of European powers in India.

Brown writes that after his death, &quot;a string of weak emperors, wars of succession, and coups by noblemen heralded the irrevocable weakening of Mughal power&quot;. She notes that the populist but &quot;fairly old-fashioned&quot; explanation for the decline is that there was a reaction to Aurangzeb's oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Katherine Butler |last=Brown |date=January 2007 |title=Did Aurangzeb Ban Music?

Immediately after Bahadur Shah occupied the throne, the [[Maratha Empire]]&amp;nbsp;– which Aurangzeb had held at bay, inflicting high human and monetary costs even on his own empire – consolidated and launched effective invasions of Mughal territory, seizing power from the weak emperor.

He left instructions that his funeral should be ascetically simple, and that no money should be spent on his shroud except the four rupees that he had made by sewing caps. The top of his coffin was to be covered with a plain piece of canvas. To the poor he left three hundred rupees earned by copying the Koran. He died at the age of eighty-nine, having long outstayed his welcome on the earth. Within seventeen years of his death his empire was broken into fragments. The support of the people, so wisely won by Akbar, had been forfeited by the cruelty of Jehangir, the wastefulness of Jehan, and the intolerance of Aurangzeb. The Moslem minority, already enervated by India's heat, had lost the military ardor and physical vigor of their prime, and no fresh recruits were coming from the north to buttress their declining power. Meanwhile, far away in the west, a little island had sent its traders to cull the riches of India. Soon it would send its guns, and take over this immense empire in which Hindu and Moslem had joined to build one of the great civilizations of history.

His critics argue that his ruthlessness and religious bigotry made him unsuitable to rule the mixed population of his empire.  Some critics assert that the persecution of [[Shia]]s, [[Sufi]]s and non-Muslims to impose practices of orthodox Islamic state, such as imposition of sharia and ''[[jizya]]'' religious tax on non-Muslims, doubling of custom duties on Hindus while abolishing it for Muslims, executions of Muslims and non-Muslims alike, and destruction of temples eventually led to numerous rebellions.&lt;ref name=bitory1&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Pletcher |editor-first=Kenneth |year=2010 |title=The History of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hdmcAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA183 |publisher=Britannica Educational Publishing |page=183 |isbn=978-1-61530-201-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bitory2&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Joseph |editor-first=Paul |year=2016 |title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of War: Social Science Perspectives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idw0DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA433 |publisher=SAGE Publications |pages=432–433 |isbn=978-1-4833-5988-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gupta |first1=R.K. |last2=Bakshi |first2=S.R. |year=2008 |title=Dalit Literature: Our Response |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DLQeSBLpUwsC&amp;pg=PA77 |publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons |page=77 |isbn=978-81-7625-841-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bitory4&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Shakir |editor-first1=Moin |year=1989 |title=Religion State And Politics In India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x_gQAQAAIAAJ |publisher=Ajanta Publications (India) |page=47 |isbn=978-81-202-0213-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bitory5&gt;{{cite book |last1=Upshur |first1=Jiu-Hwa L. |last2=Terry |first2=Janice J. |last3=Holoka |first3=Jim |year=2011 |title=Cengage Advantage Books: World History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mBo-2D0TKUcC&amp;pg=PA527 |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=527 |isbn=978-1-111-34514-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bitory6&gt;Amy Chua, 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0307472450 &quot;Day of Empire: How Hyperpowers Rise to Global Dominance—and Why They Fall.&quot;], [[Random House|Anchor Books]], p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; G.

===Reception in Pakistan===

Whereas he has his critics, to many he left a positive and lasting legacy, often for the same reasons, notably in [[Pakistan]] where author Haroon Khalid writes that &quot;Aurangzeb is presented as a hero who fought and expanded the frontiers of the Islamic empire&quot; and &quot;is imagined to be a true believer who removed corrupt practices from religion and the court, and once again purified the empire.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Haroon Khalid (1 October 2018), &quot;In India and Pakistan, religion makes one country’s hero the other’s villain&quot;, ''Quartz India''. Retrieved 21 April 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; The academic Munis Faruqui also opines that the &quot;Pakistani state and its allies in the religious and political establishments include him in the pantheon of premodern Muslim heroes, especially lauding him for his militarism, personal piety, and seeming willingness to accommodate Islamic morality within state goals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Munis D. Faruqui &quot;Book review of ''Aurangzeb: The Life and Legacy of India’s Most Controversial King''&quot; in ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'', Volume 87, Issue 1, March 2019, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muhammad Iqbal]], considered the spiritual founder of Pakistan, compared him favorably to the [[prophet Abraham]] for his warfare against Akbar's ''[[Din-i Ilahi]]'' and idolatry,&lt;ref&gt;Sisir Kumar Das, ''History of Indian Literature: 1911-1956, struggle for freedom : triumph and tragedy'', Sahitya Akademi (2005), p. 368&lt;/ref&gt; while Iqbal Singh Sevea, in his book on the [[political philosophy]] of the thinker, says that &quot;Iqbal considered that the life and activities of Aurangzeb constituted the starting point of [[Muslim nationalism in South Asia|Muslim nationality in India]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Iqbal Singh Sevea, ''The Political Philosophy of Muhammad Iqbal: Islam and Nationalism in Late Colonial India'', Cambridge University Press (2012), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maulana Shabbir Ahmad Usmani]], in his funeral oration, hailed [[M.A. Jinnah]], the founder of Pakistan, to be the greatest Muslim since Aurangzeb.&lt;ref&gt;Venkat Dhulipala, ''Creating a New Medina: State Power, Islam, and the Quest for Pakistan in Late Colonial North India'', Cambridge University Press (2015), p. 489&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]], known for his [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization|Islamization]] drive, has been described as &quot;a conceptual descendent of Aurangzeb.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Pakistan Journal of History and Culture'', vol. 13 (1996), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the individual appreciations, Aurangzeb is seminal to Pakistan's national self-consciousness, as historian [[Ayesha Jalal]], while referring to the [[Pakistani textbooks controversy]], mentions M. D. Zafar's ''A Text Book of Pakistan Studies'' where we can read that, under Aurangzeb, &quot;Pakistan spirit gathered in strength&quot;, while his death &quot;weakened the Pakistan spirit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ayesha Jalal, &quot;Conjuring Pakistan: History as Official Imagining&quot; in ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'', Vol. 27, No. 1 (Feb., 1995), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Another historian from Pakistan, [[Mubarak Ali]], also looking at the textbooks, and while noting that Akbar &quot;is conveniently ignored and not mentioned in any school textbook from class one to matriculation&quot;, contrasts him with Aurangzeb, who &quot;appears in different textbooks of Social Studies and Urdu language as an orthodox and pious Muslim copying the Holy Quran and sewing caps for his livelihood.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mubarak Ali, &quot;Akbar in Pakistani Textbooks&quot; ''in Social Scientist'', Vol. 20, No. 9/10 (Sep. - Oct., 1992), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

This image of Aurangzeb as an Islamic radical isn't limited to Pakistan's official historiography. Historian Audrey Truschke points out that [[BJP]] and other [[Hindu nationalists]] regard him as Muslim zealot. [[Nehru]] claimed that, due to his reversal of the cultural and religious syncretism of the previous Mughal emperors, Aurangzeb acted &quot;more as a Moslem than an Indian ruler&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Audrey Truschke, ''Aurangzeb: The Life and Legacy of India's Most Controversial King'', Stanford University Press (2017), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;
