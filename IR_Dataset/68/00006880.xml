A '''Caesar salad''' (also spelled '''Cesar''' and '''Cesare''') is a [[Salad green|green salad]] of [[romaine lettuce]] and [[crouton]]s dressed with [[lemon juice]] (or [[lime juice]]), [[olive oil]], [[Egg (food)|egg]], [[Worcestershire sauce]], [[anchovy (food)|anchovies]], [[garlic]], [[Dijon mustard]], [[Parmigiano-Reggiano|Parmesan cheese]], and [[black pepper]].

In its original form, this salad was prepared and served tableside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=dHPvtWR6TkkC&amp;pg=PA67|page=67 |chapter=Caesar salad|title=David Burke's New American Classics |first1=David |last1=Burke |first2=Judith |last2=Choate |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |date=2009 |isbn=9780307519436 |accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
&lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT add the claim that this salad is attributed to Julius Caesar. Reliable sources do not exist for this claim, so if it is added, it will just be deleted again. --&gt;
The salad's creation is generally attributed to restaurateur [[Caesar Cardini]], an [[Italians|Italian]] immigrant who operated restaurants in Mexico and the United States.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |title=Cesar Cardini, Creator of Salad, Dies at 60 |quote=Caesar Cardini, 60, credited with the invention of the Caesar salad, died [...] |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=5 November 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardini was living in [[San Diego]] but he was also working in [[Tijuana]] where he avoided the restrictions of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosa1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1442086/Rosa-Cardini.html|title=Rosa Cardini|date=21 September 2003|newspaper=The Telegraph|accessdate=2012-02-10|quote=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Rosa recounted that her father invented the salad at his restaurant [[Caesar's]] (at the Hotel Cesar) when a [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] rush in 1924 depleted the kitchen's supplies. Cardini made do with what he had, adding the dramatic flair of the table-side tossing &quot;by the chef.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdawriter.blogspot.com/2006_02_01_archive.html|title=Hail Caesar!

[[Julia Child]] said that she had eaten a Caesar salad at [[Caesar's|Cardini's restaurant]] when she was a child in the 1920s.&lt;ref name='child'&gt;{{cite book |author=Julia Child |author2=Paul Child |title=From Julia Child's Kitchen |year=1975 |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |isbn=978-0394480718 |url=https://archive.org/details/fromjuliachildsk00chil |author-link=Julia Child }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, newspaper columnist [[Dorothy Kilgallen]] wrote of a Caesar containing anchovies, differing from Cardini's version:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The big food rage in Hollywood&amp;mdash;the Caesar salad&amp;mdash;will be introduced to New Yorkers by Gilmore's Steak House. It's an intricate  concoction that takes ages to prepare and contains (zowie!)  lots of garlic, raw or slightly coddled eggs, croutons, romaine,  anchovies, parmeasan [''sic''] cheese, olive oil, vinegar and plenty of black pepper.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2731250/early_caesar_salad_reference/ Dorothy Kilgallen, The Voice of Broadway], News-Herald, Franklin, Penn. (Aug. 2, 1946).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to Rosa Cardini, the original Caesar salad (unlike his brother Alex's ''Aviator's salad'', which was later renamed to Caesar salad)&lt;ref name=&quot;grant&quot;/&gt; did not contain pieces of [[Anchovy (food)|anchovy]]; the slight anchovy flavor comes from the [[Worcestershire sauce]]. Cardini was opposed to using anchovies in his salad.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;My father always used [[Lea and Perrins]] Worcestershire sauce, and anchovies are one of its ingredients. [...] He meant this to be a subtle salad, and anchovies can be overwhelming.&quot; (Above quoted 1987 interview with Rosa Cardini)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short|date=September 2018}}

In the 1970s, Cardini's daughter said that the original recipe included whole lettuce leaves, which were meant to be lifted by the stem and eaten with the fingers; [[coddled egg]]s; and Italian olive oil.&lt;ref name='child'/&gt;

Although the original recipe does not contain anchovies, modern recipes typically include anchovies as a key ingredient, which frequently is emulsified in bottled versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Best Caesar salad|url=https://www.seriouseats.com/amp/2013/10/ask-the-food-lab-caesar-salad-recipe.html|website=Seriouseats.com|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bottled Caesar dressings are now produced and marketed by many companies.

The trademark brands &quot;Cardini's&quot;, &quot;Caesar Cardini's&quot; and &quot;The Original Caesar Dressing&quot; are all claimed to date to February 1950, although they were only registered decades later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Patent and Trademark Office, serial numbers 73426710 &quot;Cardini's&quot;, registered 1983 by Caesar Cardini Foods, 73782270 &quot;The Original Caesar Dressing&quot; and &quot;Caesar Cardini's&quot;, registered 1989 by Dolefam Corporation, which later merged with T. Marzetti|url=http://tess2.uspto.gov|website=Tess.uspto.gov|accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more than a dozen varieties of bottled ''Cardini's'' dressing are available today, with various ingredients.

==Health concerns==
{{Main|Egg as food#Contamination}}
There is inherent risk of infection by [[salmonella]] bacteria occasionally found in raw egg from cracked or improperly washed eggshells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/egg-products-preparation/egg-products-and-food-safety/ct_index/!ut/p/a1/jZFdb8IgFIZ_DZeU4-qM7q5psqib7YzZrL0x2FJKUoEA2m2_fuhu6tcmXADnfQ-c80BykpFc0r3g1AklaXM454M1zGHQG8UwTUe9Z5gkH_P0JY5huHj0htUfhiS8M__GiOC__OkdDzyYWTzjJNfU1VjISpGMM4eptC0zlmSVUiW2tGLuC1e0cNjWjDkvMM6xNqrcFc76DdPUHMGcKVSWuHMHyQq3FrJkn2RJ8tP6oOfnJAkX_fE0CSHtnxuuAPw13CbkEfBGbY6_tYrkJhz6Xg2rmGEm2Bkfrp3TTwgQtG0bVFbYYGdLGnC19yFtEWhlHG0QHDQETmlR-LXLhflWj70j6LA79XTYIbjF7lS5VnKtrCPZRalEb9-z79doDOJtuxza6AdKMIk9/ U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service ''Egg Products and Food Safety'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short|date=September 2018}} However, some countries such as the UK have eliminated this risk through vaccination and tracking strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-41568998|title=Runny eggs 'safe for pregnant women'|first=Dominic|last=Hughes|date=11 October 2017|accessdate=2 October 2018|website=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a concern with many similar dressings that are [[emulsion|emulsified]] with eggs, though generally the [[pH]] level is thought to be acidic enough to kill those bacteria. Nevertheless, later versions of the recipe call at least for briefly cooked [[coddled egg]]s or [[pasteurized eggs]]. Recipes may omit the egg and produce a &quot;Caesar [[vinaigrette]]&quot;. Many variations of this salad exist; [[yogurt]] is sometimes substituted for the eggs to maintain a creamy texture and others call for using mayonnaise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/14172/caesar-salad-supreme|title=Caesar Salad Supreme Recipe|website=Allrecipes.com|accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
