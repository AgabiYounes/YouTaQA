The '''City of London''' is a [[city status in the United Kingdom|city]], [[counties of England|county]] and a [[local government district]]{{NoteTag|The City of London is a ''[[sui generis]]'' unit of local government, referred by the [[Ordnance Survey]] as the '''City and County of the City of London'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/doc/7000000000011105|title=City and County of the City of London|publisher=Ordnance Survey|accessdate=29 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish it as such on their mapping and in their datasets.}} that contains the historic centre and the primary [[central business district]] (CBD) of [[London]]. It constituted most of London from its [[Londinium|settlement]] by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in the 1st century AD to the [[Middle Ages]], but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders.&lt;ref name=&quot;beckett&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=City status in the British Isles, 1830–2002 |series=Historical urban studies |author=Beckett, J V |year=2005 |publisher=Ashgate |location=Aldershot |isbn=978-0-7546-5067-6 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mills&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of London Place Names|year=2010|last=Mills|first= AD|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=UWKcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152 152] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |quote=Of course until relatively recent times the name London referred only to the City of London with even ''Westminster'' remaining a separate entity. But when the County of London was created in 1888, the name often came to be rather loosely used for this much larger area, which was also sometimes referred to as ''Greater London'' from about this date. However, in 1965 '''Greater London''' was newly defined as a much enlarged area. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The City is now only a tiny part of the [[Greater London Built-up Area|metropolis of London]], though it remains a notable part of [[central London]]. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 [[districts of England|local authority districts]] of [[Greater London]]; however, the City of London is not a [[London borough]], a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the [[City of Westminster]]). It is also a separate [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]], being an [[enclave]] surrounded by Greater London, and is the smallest county in the United Kingdom.

The City of London is widely referred to simply as '''the City''' (differentiated from the phrase &quot;the city of London&quot; by capitalising ''City'') and is also colloquially known as the '''Square Mile''', as it is {{convert|1.12|sqmi|acre km2|2|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/nr/rdonlyres/10feeb0b-3ded-4c2d-93d1-8534fcb28cc5/0/Census%202001.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=10 April 2009 | title=City of London Resident Population Census 2001 | publisher=Corporation of London | date=July 2005 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612220841/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/nr/rdonlyres/10feeb0b-3ded-4c2d-93d1-8534fcb28cc5/0/Census%202001.pdf | archive-date=12 June 2011 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; in area.

''London'' most often denotes the sprawling London metropolis, or the 32 London boroughs, in addition to the City of London itself. This wider usage of ''London'' is documented as far back as 1888, when the [[County of London]] was created.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mills&quot; /&gt;

The [[local government in England|local authority]] for the City, namely the [[City of London Corporation]], is unique in the UK and has some unusual responsibilities for a local council, such as being the police authority. It is also unusual in having responsibilities and ownerships beyond its boundaries. The Corporation is headed by the [[Lord Mayor of London|Lord Mayor of the City of London]], an office separate from (and much older than) the [[Mayor of London]]. The Lord Mayor, as of November 2019, is [[William Russell (Lord Mayor)|William Russel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/about-the-city/the-lord-mayor/Pages/default.aspx|title=The Lord Mayor - City of London|publisher=City of London|access-date=13 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190922054152/https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/about-the-city/the-lord-mayor/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=22 September 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The insurance industry is focused around the eastern side of the City, around [[Lloyd's building]]. A secondary financial district exists outside the City, at [[Canary Wharf]], {{convert|2.5|mi|km|0}} to the east.

The City has a resident population of 9,401 ([[Office of National Statistics|ONS]] estimate, mid-2016) but over 500,000 are employed there&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/business/economic-research-and-information/Pages/economic-statistics.aspx|title=Statistics about the City - City of London|website=www.cityoflondon.gov.uk|access-date=2019-07-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190828214510/https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/business/economic-research-and-information/Pages/economic-statistics.aspx|archive-date=28 August 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and some estimates put the number of workers in the city to be over 1 million.

== History ==
{{Main|History of London}}

=== Origins ===
{{Main|Roman London}}
[[File:Horned helmet.jpg|thumb|The [[Waterloo Helmet]], c. 150–50 BC, found in the [[River Thames]]]]
[[File:London Wall fragment.jpg|thumb|A surviving fragment of the [[London Wall]], built around AD 200, close to [[Tower Hill]]]]

Known as &quot;Londinium&quot;, the Roman legions established a settlement on the current site of the City of London around AD 43. Its bridge over the [[River Thames]] turned the city into a [[#Roads|road nexus]] and major [[#Port|port]], serving as a major commercial centre in [[Roman Britain]] until its abandonment during [[#5th century|the 5th century]]. Archaeologist Leslie Wallace notes that, because extensive archaeological excavation has not revealed any signs of a significant [[Prehistoric Britain#Late pre-Roman Iron Age (LPRIA)|pre-Roman]] presence, &quot;arguments for a purely Roman foundation of London are now common and uncontroversial.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wallace |first1=Leslie |title=Late pre-Roman Iron Age (LPRIA) |date=2015 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-1-107-04757-0 |page=9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=gbMkBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=pre-roman+london#v=onepage&amp;q=pre-roman%20london&amp;f=false |accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its height, the Roman city had a population of approximately 45,000–60,000 inhabitants. Londinium was an ethnically diverse city, with inhabitants from across the Roman Empire, including natives of Britannia, [[continental Europe]], the Middle East, and North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-34809804 |title=DNA study finds London was ethnically diverse from start |first=Pallab |last=Ghosh |work=[[BBC News]] |date=23 November 2015 |access-date=7 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023225005/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-34809804 |archive-date=23 October 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans built the [[London Wall]] some time between AD 190 and 225. The boundaries of the Roman city were similar to those of the City of London today, though the City extends further west than Londonium's [[Ludgate]], and the Thames was undredged and thus wider than it is today, with Londonium's shoreline slightly north of the City's present shoreline. The Romans built a bridge across the river, as early as AD 50, near to today's [[London Bridge]].

=== Decline ===
By the time '''the London Wall''' was constructed, the City's fortunes were in decline, and it faced problems of plague and fire. The Roman Empire entered a long period of [[Decline of the Roman Empire|instability and decline]], including the [[Carausian Revolt]] in Britain. In the 3rd and 4th centuries, the city was under attack from [[Picts]], Scots, and [[Saxons|Saxon]] raiders. The decline continued, both for Londinium and the Empire, and in AD 410 the Romans withdrew entirely from Britain. Many of the Roman public buildings in Londinium by this time had fallen into decay and disuse, and gradually after the formal withdrawal the city became almost (if not, at times, entirely) uninhabited. The centre of trade and population moved away from the walled Londinium to [[Lundenwic]] (&quot;London market&quot;), a settlement to the west, roughly in the modern day [[Strand, London|Strand]]/[[Aldwych]]/[[Covent Garden]] area.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

=== Anglo-Saxon restoration ===

{{Main|Anglo-Saxon London}}
During the Anglo-Saxon [[Heptarchy]], the London area came in turn under the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]], [[Mercia]], and later [[Wessex]], though from the mid 8th century it was frequently under the control or threat of the [[Vikings]].
[[File:Southwark Bridge City Plaque.JPG|left|thumb|Plaque near [[Southwark Bridge]] noting the activities around the time of [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]].]]

[[Bede]] records that in AD 604 [[Augustine of Canterbury|St Augustine]] consecrated [[Mellitus]] as the first bishop to the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of the [[East Saxons]] and their king, [[Sæberht of Essex|Sæberht]]. Sæberht's uncle and overlord, [[Æthelberht of Kent|Æthelberht]], king of [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], built a church dedicated to St Paul in London, as the seat of the new bishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bede |authorlink=Bede |title=Ecclesiastical History of the English People |place=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon |year=1969 |editor-last=Colgrave |editor-first=Bertram |editor2-last=Mynors |editor2-first=R. A. B. |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bedesecclesiasti0000bede/page/142 142–3]|title-link=Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is assumed, although unproven, that this first Anglo-Saxon cathedral stood on the same site as the later medieval and the present cathedrals.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[Alfred the Great]], [[King of Wessex]] (and arguably the first king of the &quot;English&quot;) occupied and began the resettlement of the old [[Roman Empire|Roman]] walled area, in 886, and appointed his son-in-law [[Earl Aethelred of Mercia|Earl Æthelred of Mercia]] over it as part of their reconquest of the Viking occupied parts of England. The refortified Anglo-Saxon settlement was known as [[Lundenburh]] (&quot;London Fort&quot;, a [[borough]]). The historian Asser said that &quot;Alfred, king of the Anglo-Saxons, restored the city of London splendidly&amp;nbsp;... and made it habitable once more.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Asser's ''Life of King Alfred'', ch. 83, trans. Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great: Asser's Life of King Alfred &amp; Other Contemporary Sources'' (Penguin Classics) (1984), pp.&amp;nbsp;97–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred's &quot;restoration&quot; entailed reoccupying and refurbishing the nearly deserted Roman walled city, building quays along the Thames, and laying a new city street plan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Vince|Vince, Alan]], ''Saxon London: An Archaeological Investigation'', The Archaeology of London series (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred's taking of London and the rebuilding of the old Roman city was a turning point in history, not only as the permanent establishment of the City of London, but also as part of a unifying moment in early England, with Wessex becoming the dominant English kingdom and the repelling (to some degree) of the Viking occupation and raids. While London, and indeed England, were afterwards subjected to further periods of Viking and Danish raids and occupation, the establishment of the City of London and the [[Kingdom of England]] prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;''London: The Biography'', 2000, [[Peter Ackroyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;33–35&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 10th century, [[Athelstan]] permitted eight [[royal mint|mints]] to be established, compared with six in his capital, [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]], indicating the wealth of the city. [[London Bridge]], which had fallen into ruin following the Roman evacuation and abandonment of Londinium, was rebuilt by the Saxons, but was periodically destroyed by Viking raids and storms.

As the focus of trade and population was moved back to within the old Roman walls, the older Saxon settlement of Lundenwic was largely abandoned and gained the name of ''Ealdwic'' (the &quot;old settlement&quot;). The name survives today as [[Aldwych]] (the &quot;old market-place&quot;), a name of a street and an area of the [[City of Westminster]] between [[Westminster]] and the City of London.

=== Medieval era ===

{{See also|Norman and Medieval London}}
Following the [[Battle of Hastings]], [[William the Conqueror]] marched on London ''(reaching as far as [[Southwark]])'', but failed to get across London Bridge or to defeat the Londoners. He eventually crossed the River Thames at [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], pillaging the land as he went. Rather than continuing the war, [[Edgar the Ætheling]], [[Edwin, Earl of Mercia|Edwin of Mercia]] and [[Morcar]] of Northumbria surrendered at [[Berkhamsted]]. William granted the citizens of London a charter in 1075; the City was one of a few examples of the English retaining some authority. The City was not covered by the [[Domesday Book]].

William built three castles nearby, to keep Londoners subdued:

* [[Tower of London]]
* [[Baynard's Castle]]
* [[Montfichet's Tower]]

About 1130, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] granted a [[Shrievalty of London|sheriff]] to the people of London, along with control of the county of [[Middlesex]]: this meant that the two entities were regarded as one administratively (not that the county was a dependency of the City) until the [[Local Government Act 1888]].&lt;ref name=vch_middlesex&gt;[[Victoria County History]]: A history of the County of Middlesex: Vol 2 pp&amp;nbsp;15–60 paragraph 12, [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22153] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531055113/http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22153 |date=31 May 2012 }}. Retrieved 2 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; By 1141 the whole body of the citizenry was considered to constitute a single community. This 'commune' was the origin of the [[City of London Corporation]] and the citizens gained the right to appoint, with the king's consent, a mayor in 1189—and to directly elect the mayor from 1215.

From medieval times, the City has been composed of [[Wards of the City of London|25 ancient wards]], each headed by an [[alderman]], who chairs [[Wardmote]]s, which still take place at least annually. A [[Folkmoot]], for the whole of the City held at the outdoor cross of [[St Paul's Cathedral]], was formerly also held. Many of the medieval offices and traditions continue to the present day, demonstrating the unique nature of the City and its [[Corporation of London|Corporation]].

In 1381, the [[Peasants' Revolt]] affected London. The rebels took the City and the Tower of London, but the rebellion ended after its leader, Wat Tyler, was killed during a confrontation that included Lord Mayor [[William Walworth]].

The City was burnt severely on a number of occasions, the worst being in 1123 and (more famously) in the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666. Both of these fires were referred to as ''the'' Great Fire. After the fire of 1666, a number of plans were drawn up to remodel the City and its street pattern into a [[renaissance]]-style city with planned urban blocks, squares and boulevards. These plans were almost entirely not taken up, and the medieval street pattern re-emerged almost intact.

=== Early modern period ===
By the late 16th century, London increasingly became a major centre for banking, international trade and commerce. The [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] was founded in 1565 by Sir [[Thomas Gresham]] as a centre of commerce for London's merchants, and gained Royal patronage in 1571. Although no longer used for its original purpose, its location at the corner of [[Cornhill, London|Cornhill]] and [[Threadneedle Street]] continues to be the geographical centre of the City's core of banking and financial services, with the [[Bank of England]] moving to its present site in 1734, opposite the Royal Exchange on Threadneedle Street. Immediately to the south of Cornhill, [[Lombard Street, London|Lombard Street]] was the location from 1691 of [[Lloyd's Coffee House]], which became the world-leading insurance market. London's insurance sector continues to be based in the area, particularly in [[Lime Street (ward)|Lime Street]].

In 1708, [[Christopher Wren]]'s masterpiece, [[St Paul's Cathedral]], was completed on his birthday. The first service had been held on 2 December 1697, more than 10 years earlier. It replaced the original St Paul's, which had been completely destroyed in the Great Fire of London, and is considered to be one of the finest cathedrals in Britain and a fine example of [[Baroque architecture]].

=== Growth of London ===

The 18th century was a period of rapid growth for [[London]], reflecting an increasing national population, the early stirrings of the [[Industrial Revolution]], and London's role at the centre of the evolving [[British Empire]]. The urban area expanded beyond the borders of the City of London, most notably during this period towards the [[West End of London|West End]] and [[Westminster]].

Expansion continued and became more rapid by the beginning of the 19th century, with London growing in all directions. To the [[East End of London|East]] the [[Port of London]] grew rapidly during the century, with the construction of many docks, needed as the Thames at the City could not cope with the volume of trade. The arrival of the railways and the [[London Underground|Tube]] meant that London could expand over a much greater area. By the mid-19th century, with London still rapidly expanding in population and area, the City had already become only a small part of the wider metropolis.

=== 19th and 20th centuries ===
An attempt was made in 1894 with the [[Royal Commission on the Amalgamation of the City and County of London]] to end the distinction between the City and the surrounding County of London, but a change of government at Westminster meant the option was not taken up. The City as a distinct [[polity]] survived despite its position within the London conurbation and [[History of local government in London|numerous local government reforms]]. Supporting this status, the City was a special [[parliamentary borough]] that elected four members to the [[unreformed House of Commons]], who were retained after the [[Reform Act 1832]]; reduced to two under the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]]; and ceased to be a separate constituency under the [[Representation of the People Act 1948]]. Since then the City is a minority (in terms of population and area) of the [[Cities of London and Westminster]].
[[File:St Pauls Cathedral in 1896.JPG|thumb|left|[[St Paul's Cathedral]], 1896.]]

The City's population fell rapidly in the 19th century and through most of the 20th century, as people moved outwards in all directions to London's vast [[Metro-land|suburbs]], and many residential buildings were demolished to make way for office blocks. Like many areas of London and other British cities, the City fell victim to large scale and highly destructive aerial bombing during [[World War II]], especially in [[the Blitz]]. Whilst St Paul's Cathedral survived the onslaught, large swathes of the area did not and the particularly heavy raids of late December 1940 led to a [[firestorm]] called the [[Second Great Fire of London]].

There was a major rebuilding programme in the decades following the war, in some parts (such as at the Barbican) dramatically altering the urban landscape. But the destruction of the older historic fabric allowed the construction of modern and larger-scale developments, whereas in those parts not so badly affected by bomb damage the City retains its older character of smaller buildings. The street pattern, which is still largely medieval, was altered slightly in places, although there is a more recent trend of reversing some of the post-war modernist changes made, such as at [[Paternoster Square]].

The City suffered terrorist attacks including the [[1993 Bishopsgate bombing]] ([[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]]) and the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] ([[Islamic terrorism|Islamist]]). In response to the 1993 bombing, a system of road barriers, checkpoints and surveillance cameras referred to as the &quot;[[ring of steel (London)|ring of steel]]&quot; has been maintained to control entry points to the City.

The 1970s saw the construction of tall office buildings including the 600-foot (183&amp;nbsp;m), 47-storey [[Natwest Tower]], the first skyscraper in the UK. Office space development has intensified especially in the central, northern and eastern parts, with skyscrapers including [[30 St Mary Axe|30 St. Mary Axe]] (&quot;the Gherkin&quot;'), [[122 Leadenhall Street|Leadenhall Building]] (&quot;the Cheesegrater&quot;), [[20 Fenchurch Street]] (&quot;the Walkie-Talkie&quot;), the [[Broadgate Tower]] and the [[Heron Tower]], the tallest in the City. Another skyscraper, [[22 Bishopsgate]], is under construction.

The main residential section of the City today is the [[Barbican Estate]], constructed between 1965 and 1976. The [[Museum of London]] is based there, as are a number of other services provided by the Corporation.

{{See also|City of London Corporation|History of local government in England#The City of London}}
The City has a unique political status, a legacy of its uninterrupted integrity as a corporate city since the [[Heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon period]] and its singular relationship with the [[British monarchy|Crown]]. Historically its system of government was not unusual, but it was not reformed by the [[Municipal Reform Act 1835]] and little changed by later reforms.

It is administered by the [[City of London Corporation]], headed by the [[Lord Mayor of London]] (''not the same as the more recent [[Mayor of London]]''), which is responsible for a number of functions and has interests in land beyond the City's boundaries. Unlike other English local authorities, the Corporation has two council bodies: the (now largely ceremonial) [[Court of Aldermen]] and the [[Court of Common Council]]. The [[Court of Aldermen]] represents the wards, with each ward (irrespective of size) returning one Alderman. The chief executive of the Corporation holds the ancient office of [[Town Clerk of London]].

The City is a [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] which has a Commission of Lieutenancy headed by the Lord Mayor instead of a [[Lord-Lieutenant]] and has [[Sheriffs of the City of London|two Sheriffs]] instead of a [[High Sheriff]] (see [[list of Sheriffs of London]]), quasi-judicial offices appointed by the [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]], an ancient political system based on the representation and [[Guild|protection of trades (Guilds)]]. Senior members of the Livery Companies are known as [[Liveryman|Liverymen]] and form the Common Hall, which chooses the Lord Mayor, the Sheriffs and certain other officers.

=== Wards ===
{{Main|Wards of the City of London}}
The City is made up of [[:Category:Wards of the City of London|25 wards]]. They are survivors of the medieval government system that allowed a very local area to exist as a self-governing unit within the wider city.&lt;ref&gt;''The City of London: A History''. Borer, Mary Irene Cathcart: New York, D. McKay Co., 1978 {{ISBN|0-09-461880-1}} p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; They can be described as electoral/political divisions; ceremonial, geographic and administrative entities; sub-divisions of the City. Each ward has an [[Alderman]], who until the mid-1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Hansard |house=House of Commons |title=LOCAL GOVERNMENT BILL |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1963/feb/13/schedule-1-the-london-boroughs#column_1364 |date=13 February 1963 |column_start=278 |column_end=291 |accessdate=4 February 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204201537/http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1963/feb/13/schedule-1-the-london-boroughs#column_1364 |archivedate=4 February 2015 |url-status=live }} [[Michael Stewart, Baron Stewart of Fulham|Michael Stewart]], ([[Labour Party (UK)|L]], [[Fulham (UK Parliament constituency)|Fulham]]&lt;/ref&gt; held office for life but since put themselves up for re-election at least every 6 years.

[[File:City of London UK labelled ward map 2003.svg|thumb|A map of the wards since 2003]]

Following boundary changes in 1994, and later reform of the business vote in the City, there was a major boundary and electoral representation revision of the wards in 2003, and they were reviewed again in 2010 for change in 2013, though not to such a dramatic extent. The review was conducted by senior officers of the Corporation and senior judges of the [[Old Bailey]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Council_and_democracy/Councillors_democracy_and_elections/ward_boundary_review.htm Corporation of London] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114041508/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Council_and_democracy/Councillors_democracy_and_elections/ward_boundary_review.htm |date=14 January 2010 }} Ward Boundary Review (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; the wards are reviewed by this process to avoid [[malapportionment]]. The procedure of review is unique in the United Kingdom as it is not conducted by the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] or a local government boundary commission every 8 to 12 years, which is the case for all other [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|wards in Great Britain]]. Particular churches, [[livery company]] halls and other historic buildings and structures are associated with a ward, such as St Paul's Cathedral with [[Castle Baynard]], and London Bridge with Bridge; boundary changes in 2003 removed some of these historic connections.

Each ward elects an [[Alderman]] to the [[Court of Aldermen]], and [[Commoners]] (the City equivalent of a [[Councillor]]) to the [[Court of Common Council]] of the Corporation. Only electors who are [[Freeman of the City of London|Freemen of the City of London]] are eligible to stand. The number of Commoners a ward sends to the Common Council varies from two to ten, depending on the number of electors in each ward. Since the 2003 review it has been agreed that the four more residential wards: [[Portsoken]], [[Queenhithe]], [[Aldersgate]] and [[Cripplegate]] together elect 20 of the 100 Commoners, whereas the business-dominated remainder elect the remaining 80 Commoners. 2003 and 2013 boundary changes have increased the residential emphasis of the mentioned four wards.

Census data provides eight nominal rather than 25 real wards, all of varying size and population. Being subject to renaming and definition at any time, these census 'wards' are notable in that four of the eight wards accounted for 67% of the 'square mile' and held 86% of the population, and these were in fact similar to and named after four City of London wards:

=== Elections ===
The City has a unique electoral system. Most of its voters are representatives of businesses and other bodies that occupy premises in the City. Its ancient wards have very unequal numbers of voters. In elections, both the businesses based in the City and the residents of the City vote.

The City of London Corporation was not reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], because it had a more extensive electoral franchise than any other borough or city; in fact, it widened this further with its own equivalent legislation allowing one to become a [[Freedom of the City|freeman]] without being a [[liveryman]]. In 1801, the City had a population of about 130,000, but increasing development of the City as a central business district led to this falling to below 5,000 after the Second World War.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} It has risen slightly to around 9,000 since, largely due to the development of the [[Barbican Estate]]. In 2009, the business vote was about 24,000, greatly exceeding residential voters.&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribunemagazine.co.uk/2009/02/12/labour-runs-in-city-of-london-poll-against-%E2%80%98get-rich%E2%80%99-bankers/|title=Labour runs in City of London poll against 'get-rich' bankers|date=12 February 2009|author=René Lavanchy|work=[[Tribune (magazine)|The Express Tribune]]|accessdate=14 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222210319/http://www.tribunemagazine.co.uk/2009/02/12/labour-runs-in-city-of-london-poll-against-%E2%80%98get-rich%E2%80%99-bankers/|archive-date=22 December 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the City of London Corporation has not been affected by other municipal legislation over the period of time since then, its electoral practice has become increasingly anomalous. Uniquely for city or borough elections, its elections remain independent-dominated.

The business or &quot;[[non-residential vote]]&quot; was abolished in other UK local council elections by the [[Representation of the People Act 1969]], but was preserved in the City of London. The principal reason given by successive UK governments for retaining this mechanism for giving businesses representation, is that the City is &quot;primarily a place for doing business&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Hansard |house=House of Commons |title=City of London (Ward Elections) Bill (By Order) – Second Reading |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmhansrd/vo990224/debtext/90224-48.htm |date=24 February 1999 |column_start=482 |column_end=485 |accessdate=30 August 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204070310/https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmhansrd/vo990224/debtext/90224-48.htm |archivedate=4 February 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 330,000 non-residents constitute the day-time population and use most of its services, far outnumbering residents, who number around 7,000 (2011). By contrast, opponents of the retention of the business vote argue that it is a cause of institutional inertia.&lt;ref&gt;Shaxson, N. (2011).

The [[City of London (Ward Elections) Act 2002]], a private Act of Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/locact02/20020006.htm |title=HMSO '&amp;#39;City of London (Ward Elections) Act 2002 (2002 Chapter vi)'&amp;#39; |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |date=21 October 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6D7ATW71b?url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga |archive-date=23 December 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; reformed the voting system and greatly increased the business franchise, allowing many more businesses to be represented. Under the new system, the number of non-resident voters has doubled from 16,000 to 32,000. Previously disenfranchised firms (and other organisations) are entitled to nominate voters, in addition to those already represented, and all such bodies are now required to choose their voters in a representative fashion. Bodies employing fewer than ten people may appoint one voter; those employing ten to 50 people one voter for every five employees; those employing more than 50 people ten voters and one additional voter for each 50 employees beyond the first 50. The Act also removed other anomalies which had been unchanged since the 1850s.

===&lt;!-- [[London within the Bars]] redirects here--&gt; The boundary of the City ===
[[File:City of London Sign - geograph.org.uk - 1304788.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dragon boundary mark|City of London boundary marker]]]]
The size of the City was constrained by a defensive perimeter wall, known as [[London Wall]], which was built by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in the late 2nd century to protect their strategic port city. However the boundaries of the City of London no longer coincide with the old city wall, as the City expanded its jurisdiction slightly over time. During the [[medieval]] era, the City's jurisdiction expanded westwards, crossing the historic western border of the original settlement—the [[River Fleet]]—along [[Fleet Street]] to [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]]. The City also took in the other &quot;City bars&quot; which were situated just beyond the old walled area, such as at Holborn, Aldersgate, Bishopsgate and Aldgate. These were the important entrances to the City and their control was vital in maintaining the City's special privileges over certain trades.
[[File:Temple-bar-griffin.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Dragon statue on the [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] monument, which marks the boundary between the City of London and [[City of Westminster]].]]

Most of the wall has disappeared, but several sections remain visible. A section near the [[Museum of London]] was revealed after the devastation of an air raid on 29 December 1940 at the height of the [[The Blitz|Blitz]]. Other visible sections are at [[St Alphage London Wall|St Alphage]], and there are two sections near the [[Tower of London]]. The River Fleet was [[canal]]ised after the Great Fire of 1666 and then in stages was bricked up and has been since the 18th century one of London's &quot;[[Subterranean rivers of London|lost rivers or streams]]&quot;, today underground as a [[storm drain]].

The boundary of the City was unchanged until minor boundary changes on 1 April 1994, when it expanded slightly to the west, north and east, taking small parcels of land from the London Boroughs of [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]], [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]], [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] and [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]]. The main purpose of these changes was to tidy up the boundary where it had been rendered obsolete by changes in the urban landscape. In this process the City also lost small parcels of land, though there was an overall net gain (the City grew from 1.05 to 1.12 square miles). Most notably, the changes placed the (then recently developed) [[Broadgate]] estate entirely in the City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1993/Uksi_19931445_en_1.htm |title=The City and London Borough Boundaries Order 1993 |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |date=4 July 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620210431/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1993/Uksi_19931445_en_1.htm |archivedate=20 June 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Southwark]], to the south of the City on the other side of the [[River Thames|Thames]], was within the City between 1550 and 1899 as the ''Ward of [[Bridge Without]]'', a situation connected with the [[Guildable Manor]]. The City's administrative responsibility there had in practice disappeared by the mid-[[Victorian era|Victorian]] period as various aspects of metropolitan government were extended into the neighbouring areas. Today it is part of the [[London Borough of Southwark]]. The [[Tower of London]] has always been outside the City and comes under the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]].

=== Arms, motto and flag ===

[[File:Arms of the City of London on an horse blanket 2011.jpg|thumb|City of London arms on a saddle blanket, as seen outside the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] during the [[Lord Mayor's Show]], 2011.]]
The Corporation of the City of London has a full [[achievement (heraldry)|achievement]] of armorial bearings consisting of a shield on which the arms are displayed, a [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] displayed on a helm above the shield, [[supporters]] on either side and a motto displayed on a scroll beneath the arms.&lt;ref name=briggs&gt;{{cite book |last=Briggs |first= Geoffrey |title=Civic and Corporate Heraldry: A Dictionary of Impersonal Arms of England, Wales and Northern Ireland |year=1971 |publisher=Heraldry Today |location=London |isbn=978-0-900455-21-6 |page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bening&gt;{{cite book|last=Beningfield|first=Thomas James|title=London, 1900–1964: Armorial bearings and regalia of the London County Council, the Corporation of London and the Metropolitan Boroughs|year=1964|publisher=J Burrow &amp; Co Ltd|location=Cheltenham and London|pages=21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arms /&gt;

The [[coat of arms]] is &quot;[[time immemorial|anciently recorded]]&quot; at the [[College of Arms]]. The arms consist of a silver shield bearing a red cross with a red upright sword in the first quarter. They combine the emblems of the patron saints of England and London: the [[St George's Cross|Cross of St George]] with the symbol of the martyrdom of [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]].&lt;ref name=bening /&gt;&lt;ref name=arms /&gt; The sword is often erroneously supposed to commemorate the killing of [[Peasants' Revolt]] leader [[Wat Tyler]] by [[Lord Mayor of London]] [[William Walworth]]. However the arms were in use some months before Tyler's death, and the tradition that Walworth's dagger is depicted may date from the late 17th century.&lt;ref name=bening /&gt;&lt;ref name=sgiles&gt;{{cite book |last=Scott-Giles |first=C Wilfrid |authorlink=Wilfrid Scott-Giles |title=Civic Heraldry of England and Wales, 2nd edition |year=1953 |publisher=[[J.

The [[Latin]] motto of the City is &quot;''Domine dirige nos''&quot;, which translates as &quot;''Lord, direct (guide) us''&quot;. It appears to have been adopted in the 17th century, as the earliest record of it is in 1633.&lt;ref name=&quot;arms&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/65DC8039-12C4-4AC4-8DAD-16F1608E99B7/0/cityarms.PDF |title=The City Arms |publisher=Corporation of London Records Office |accessdate=17 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927154602/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/65DC8039-12C4-4AC4-8DAD-16F1608E99B7/0/cityarms.PDF |archivedate=27 September 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=foxdavies&gt;{{cite book |last=Fox-Davies |first=A C |authorlink=Arthur Charles Fox-Davies |title=The Book of Public Arms |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924029798927 |edition=2 |year=1915 |publisher=T C &amp; E C Jack |location=London |pages=456–458 |access-date=12 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421010124/https://archive.org/details/cu31924029798927 |archive-date=21 April 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[banner of arms|banner of the arms]] (the design on the shield) is flown as a [[flag of the City of London|flag]].

== Geography ==
The City is England's [[List of ceremonial counties of England|smallest ceremonial county]] by area and population, and the fourth most densely populated. Of the [[Districts of England|326 English districts]], it is the second smallest [[List of English districts by population|by population]], after the [[Isles of Scilly]], and the smallest [[List of English districts by area|by area]]. It is also [[List of cities in the United Kingdom#England|the smallest English]] [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] by population (and in Britain, only two cities in Wales are smaller), and the [[List of smallest cities in the United Kingdom|smallest in the UK by area]].

The elevation of the City ranges from sea level at the Thames to {{convert|21.6|m|ft}} at the junction of High Holborn and Chancery Lane.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ordnance Survey]] data&lt;/ref&gt; Two small but notable hills are within the historic core, [[Ludgate Hill]] to the west and [[Cornhill, London|Cornhill]] to the east. Between them ran the [[Walbrook]], one of the many [[Subterranean rivers of London|&quot;lost&quot; rivers or streams of London]] (another is the [[River Fleet|Fleet]]).

=== Boundary ===
[[File:City of London map 01.svg|thumb|right|Borders of the City of London, showing surrounding [[London borough]]s and the pre-1994 boundary (where changed) in red. The area covered by the [[Inner Temple|Inner]] and [[Middle Temple]] is marked.]]
[https://web.archive.org/web/20171221090919/http://www.mapping.cityoflondon.gov.uk/geocortex/mapping/?viewer=compass Official boundary map, with wards.]

Beginning in the west, where the City borders Westminster, the boundary crosses the [[Victoria Embankment]] from the Thames, passes to the west of [[Middle Temple]], then turns for a short distance along [[Strand, London|Strand]] and then north up [[Chancery Lane]], where it borders Camden. It turns east along [[Holborn]] to Holborn Circus, and then goes north east to [[Charterhouse Street]]. As it crosses [[Farringdon Road]] it becomes the boundary with Islington. It continues to [[Aldersgate]], goes north, and turns east into some back streets soon after Aldersgate becomes [[Goswell Road]], since 1994 embracing all of the Corporation's Golden Lane Estate. Here, at Baltic Street West, is the most northerly extent. The boundary includes all of the [[Barbican Estate]] and continues east along Ropemaker Street and its continuation on the other side of [[Moorgate]], becomes South Place. It goes north, reaching the border with Hackney, then east, north, east on back streets, with Worship Street forming a northern boundary, so as to include the [[Broadgate]] estate. The boundary then turns south at [[Norton Folgate]] and becomes the border with [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]]. It continues south into [[Bishopsgate]], and takes some backstreets to Middlesex Street ([[Petticoat Lane]]) where it continues south-east then south. It then turns south-west, crossing the [[Minories]] so as to exclude the [[Tower of London]], and then reaches the river. It then runs up the centre of the Thames, with the exception that [[Blackfriars Bridge]] falls within the City; the City controls [[London Bridge]] (as part of [[Bridge (ward)|Bridge]] ward) but only half of the river underneath it, a feature which is unique in British local administration.

The boundaries are marked by black bollards bearing the City's emblem, and by [[dragon boundary mark]]s at major entrances, such as Holborn. A more substantial monument marks the boundary at [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] on Fleet Street.

In some places the financial district extends slightly beyond the boundaries, notably to the north and east, into the London Boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Islington, and informally these locations are seen as part of the &quot;Square Mile&quot;. Since the 1990s the eastern fringe, extending into Hackney and Tower Hamlets, has increasingly been a focus for large office developments due to the availability of large sites compared to within the City.

=== Gardens and public art ===
{{See also|List of public art in the City of London}}
[[File:Finsbury Circus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Finsbury Circus]], the largest public open space, seen from [[Tower 42]]]]
The City has no sizeable parks within its boundary, but does have a network of a large number of gardens and small open spaces, many of them maintained by the Corporation. These range from formal gardens such as the one in [[Finsbury Circus]], containing a [[bowling green]] and [[bandstand]], to churchyards such as [[St Olave Hart Street]], to water features and artwork in courtyards and pedestrianised lanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gardensofthecityoflondon.co.uk |title=Gardens of the City of London |publisher=Gardens of the City of London |accessdate=30 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115212318/http://www.gardensofthecityoflondon.co.uk/ |archive-date=15 November 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardens include:
* Barber-Surgeon's Hall Garden, [[London Wall]]
* Cleary Garden, [[Queen Victoria Street, London|Queen Victoria Street]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://baytrust.org.uk/about/the-history-of-the-bay-trust/ |title=The History of the Bay Trust, Fred Cleary – Founder |publisher=baytrust.org.uk |year=2013 |accessdate=8 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109223713/http://baytrust.org.uk/about/the-history-of-the-bay-trust/ |archivedate=9 January 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* St Olave Hart Street churchyard, Seething Lane
* St Paul's churchyard, [[St Paul's Cathedral]]
* West Smithfield Garden, [[West Smithfield]]
* Whittington Gardens, College Street

There are a number of private gardens and open spaces, often within courtyards of the larger commercial developments. Two of the largest are those of the [[Inner Temple]] and [[Middle Temple]] Inns of Court, in the far southwest.

The Thames and its riverside walks are increasingly being valued as open space and in recent years efforts have been made to increase the ability for pedestrians to access and walk along the river.

=== Climate ===
The nearest weather station has historically been the London Weather Centre at [[Kingsway, London|Kingsway]]/ [[Holborn]], although observations ceased in 2010. Now St. James Park provides the nearest official readings.

The City has an [[Maritime Climate|oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] &quot;Cfb&quot;) modified by the [[Urban Heat Island]] in the centre of London. This generally causes higher night-time minima than outlying areas. For example, the August mean minimum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[YR.NO]] |url=http://www.yr.no/place/United_Kingdom/England/Old_Bailey/statistics.html |title=Aug Min |access-date=16 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811122818/http://www.yr.no/place/United_Kingdom/England/Old_Bailey/statistics.html |archive-date=11 August 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; of {{convert|14.7|C|F}} compares to a figure of {{convert|13.3|C|F}} for Greenwich&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[MetOffice]] |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/sites/greenwich.html |title=Aug Min |access-date=16 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628141612/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/sites/greenwich.html |archive-date=28 June 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Heathrow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[MetOffice]] |url=http://www.yr.no/place/United_Kingdom/England/Heathrow/statistics.html |title=Aug Min |access-date=16 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224110511/http://www.yr.no/place/United_Kingdom/England/Heathrow/statistics.html |archive-date=24 December 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas is {{convert|11.6|C|F}} at Wisley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[MetOffice]] |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/sites/wisley.html |title=Aug Min |access-date=16 September 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6DRlW6a60?url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/sites/wisley.html |archive-date=5 January 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the middle of several square miles of [[Metropolitan Green Belt]]. All figures refer to the observation period 1971–2000.

Accordingly, the weather station holds the record for the UK's warmest overnight minimum temperature, {{convert|24.0|C|F}}, recorded on 4 August 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Tutiempo |url=http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/LONDON_WEA_CENTER/04-08-1990/37780.htm |title=Aug 1990 Min}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum is {{convert|37.6|C|F}}, set on 10 August 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Tutiempo |url=http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/London_Weather_Centre/10-08-2003/37790.htm |title=Aug 2003 Max}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absolute minimum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Tutiempo |url=http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/LONDON_WEA_CENTER/12-01-1987/37780.htm |title=Jan 1987 Min}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the weather station is a mere {{convert|−8.2|C|F}}, compared to readings around {{convert|−15.0|C|F}} towards the edges of London. Unusually, this temperature was during a windy and snowy cold spell (mid-January 1987), rather than a cold clear night—cold air drainage is arrested due to the vast urban area surrounding the city.

The station holds the record for the highest British mean monthly temperature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Tutiempo|url=http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/London_Weather_Centre/07-2006/37790.htm|title=Jul 2006 Mean|access-date=16 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005131733/http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/London_Weather_Centre/07-2006/37790.htm|archive-date=5 October 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|24.5|C|F}} (mean maximum {{convert|29.2|C|F}}, mean minimum {{convert|19.7|C|F}} during July 2006).

The City is a [[police area]] and has its own [[territorial police force|police force]], the [[City of London Police]], separate from the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] covering the majority of Greater London. The City Police have three police stations, at Snow Hill, [[Wood Street, London|Wood Street]] and [[Bishopsgate]], and an administrative headquarters at Guildhall Yard East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/about-the-city/about-us/Pages/how-to-find-us.aspx|title=How to find us – City of London|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|access-date=10 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702152322/https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/about-the-city/about-us/Pages/how-to-find-us.aspx|archive-date=2 July 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The force comprises 735 police officers including 273 detectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.colp.uk/resources/|title=Resources – City of London Police Annual Report 2018|access-date=5 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190113215657/http://www.colp.uk/resources/|archive-date=13 January 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the smallest territorial police force in [[England and Wales]], in both geographic area and the number of police officers.

Where the majority of British police forces have silver-coloured [[Cap badge|badges]], those of the City of London Police are black and gold featuring the City crest. The force has rare [[Sillitoe_Tartan#United_Kingdom|red and white]] chequered cap bands and unique red and white striped duty arm bands on the sleeves of the tunics of constables and sergeants (red and white being the colours of the City), which in most other British police forces are black and white. City police sergeants and constables wear crested [[Custodian helmet|custodian helmets]] whilst on foot patrol. These helmets do not feature either [[St Edward's Crown]] or the [[Brunswick Star]], which are used on most other police helmets in [[England and Wales]].

The City's position as the United Kingdom's financial centre and a critical part of the country's economy, contributing about 2.5% of the UK's [[gross national product]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/media_centre/keyfacts.htm |title=Key facts |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |accessdate=30 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023000216/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/media_centre/keyfacts.htm |archivedate=23 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has resulted in it becoming a target for political violence. The [[Provisional IRA]] exploded several [[bomb]]s in the early 1990s, including the [[1993 Bishopsgate bombing]].

The area is also spoken of as a possible target for [[al-Qaeda]]. For instance, when in May 2004 the BBC's ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' programme examined the preparedness of Britain's emergency services for a terrorist attack on the scale of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]], they simulated a chemical explosion on [[Bishopsgate]] in the east of the City.

The [[Ring of steel (London)|&quot;Ring of Steel&quot;]] is a particularly notable measure, established in the wake of the IRA bombings, that has been taken against terrorist threats.

=== Fire brigade ===
{{Main|London Fire Brigade}}
The City has fire risks in many historic buildings, including [[St Paul's Cathedral]], [[Old Bailey]], [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]], [[Smithfield Market]], the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]], and also in numerous high-rise buildings. There is one London Fire Brigade station in the City, at [[Dowgate]], with one [[Fire appliances in the United Kingdom|pumping appliance]].&lt;ref name=&quot;zlqtbi&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/about_us/media/City_of_London.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005231358/http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/about_us/media/City_of_London.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 October 2007 |title=London Fire Brigade – City of London Profile |publisher=London-fire.gov.uk |accessdate=30 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The City relies upon stations in the surrounding London boroughs to support it at some incidents. The first fire engine is in attendance in roughly five minutes on average, the second when required in a little over five and a half minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;zlqtbi&quot; /&gt; There were 1,814 incidents attended in the City in 2006/2007—the lowest in Greater London. No-one died in an event arising from a fire in the four years prior to 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;zlqtbi&quot; /&gt;

===Power===
There is [[power station]] located in [[Charterhouse Street]] that also provides heat to some of the surrounding buildings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/28/londons-hidden-gas-plant-which-could-heat-and-power-the-future|title=London's hidden gas plant which could heat and power the future|last=Vaughan|first=Adam|date=28 July 2017|website=The Guardian|access-date=25 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181025185907/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/28/londons-hidden-gas-plant-which-could-heat-and-power-the-future|archive-date=25 October 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Office for National Statistics]] recorded the population in 2011 as 7,375;&lt;ref name=&quot;2010pop&quot;&gt;{{English district population citation}}&lt;/ref&gt; slightly higher than in the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|last census]], 2001,&lt;ref name=&quot;census&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/00aa.asp|title=City of London Census 2001 profile|accessdate=23 October 2010|website=[[United Kingdom Census 2001|Census 2001]]|publisher=The [[Office for National Statistics]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629184519/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/00aa.asp|archive-date=29 June 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and estimates the population as at mid-2016 to be 9,401. At the 2001 census the ethnic composition was 84.6% [[White people|White]], 6.8% [[British Asian|South Asian]], 2.6% [[Black British|Black]], 2.3% [[British Mixed-Race|Mixed]], 2.0% [[British Chinese|Chinese]] and 1.7% were listed as &quot;[[Ethnic groups in the United Kingdom|other]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;census&quot; /&gt; To the right is a table showing the change in population since 1801, based on [[Census in the United Kingdom|decadal censuses]].

The only notable boundary change since the first census in 1801 occurred in 1994.

The City's full-time working residents have much higher gross weekly pay than in London and Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland): £773.30 compared to £598.60 and £491.00 respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;nomis&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/la/2038431860/report.aspx?town=city%20of%20london#tabrespop|title=Labour Market Profile: City of London|website=nomis|publisher=The [[Office for National Statistics]]|accessdate=24 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615052536/https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/la/2038431860/report.aspx?town=city%20of%20london#tabrespop|archive-date=15 June 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a large inequality of income between genders (£1,085.90 in men compared to £653.50 in women), though this can be explained by job type and length of employment respectively.&lt;ref name=nomis /&gt; The 2001 Census showed the City as a unique district amongst 376 districts surveyed in [[List of English districts|England]] and [[Districts of Wales|Wales]].&lt;ref name=census /&gt; The City had the highest proportional population increase, one-person households, people with qualifications at degree level or higher and the highest indications of overcrowding.&lt;ref name=census /&gt; It recorded the lowest proportion of households with cars or vans, people who travel to work by car, married couple households and the lowest average household size: just 1.58 people.&lt;ref name=census /&gt; It also ranked highest within the Greater London area for the percentage of people with no religion and people who are employed.&lt;ref name=census /&gt;

[[File:Banco de Inglaterra, Londres, Inglaterra, 2014-08-11, DD 141.JPG|thumb|The [[Bank of England]], on [[Threadneedle Street]], is the central bank of the United Kingdom.]]
The City vies with New York City's [[Lower Manhattan|Downtown Manhattan]] as the [[financial centre|financial capital]] of the world; many banking and insurance institutions have their headquarters there. The [[London Stock Exchange]] ([[Stock|shares]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]), [[Lloyd's of London]] (insurance) and the [[Bank of England]] are all based in the City. Over 500 banks have offices in the City, and the City is an established leader in trading in [[Eurobond (international)|Eurobond]]s, [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]], energy [[Futures contract|futures]] and global insurance. The [[Alternative Investment Market]], a market for trades in [[Stock|equities]] of smaller firms, is a recent development. In 2009, the City of London accounted for 2.4% of UK GDP.&lt;ref name=citylondon /&gt;

London is the world's greatest [[foreign exchange market]], with much of the trade conducted in the City of London. Of the $3.98&amp;nbsp;trillion daily global turnover, as measured in 2009, trading in London accounted for around $1.85&amp;nbsp;trillion, or 46.7% of the total.&lt;ref name=citylondon /&gt; The [[pound sterling]], the currency of the United Kingdom, is globally the fourth most traded currency and the third most held [[reserve currency]].

Since 1991 [[Canary Wharf]], a few miles east of the City in Tower Hamlets, has become another centre for London's financial services industry which houses many banks and other institutions formerly located in the Square Mile. Although growth has continued in both locations, and there have been relocations in both directions, the Corporation has come to realise that its planning policies may have been causing financial firms to choose Canary Wharf as a location.

=== Headquarters ===
[[File:Paternoster Square.jpg|thumb|[[Paternoster Square]], since 2004 the home of the [[London Stock Exchange]]]]
Many major global companies have their headquarters in the City, including [[Aviva]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviva.com/about-us/contact-us/|title=Contact us|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Aviva|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007062338/http://www.aviva.com/about-us/contact-us/|archive-date=7 October 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BT Group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/thegroup/contactbt/index.cfm|title=Contact BT|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=BT Group|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6DosNnqp9?url=http://www.btplc.com/thegroup/contactbt/index.cfm|archive-date=20 January 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lloyds Banking Group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/about_us/company_contacts.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310191913/http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/about_us/company_contacts.asp|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 March 2009|title=Company Contacts|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Lloyds Banking Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old Mutual]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldmutual.com/ir/contacts.jsp|title=Investor Relations Contacts|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Old Mutual|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829165111/http://www.oldmutual.com/ir/contacts.jsp|archive-date=29 August 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prudential plc|Prudential]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prudential.co.uk/prudential-plc/siteservices/directory/plccontact/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060106183040/http://www.prudential.co.uk/prudential-plc/siteservices/directory/plccontact/|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 January 2006|title=Contact|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Prudential}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Schroders plc|Schroders]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schroders.com/en/contact-us/worldwide-locations/uk/|title=Contact us|accessdate=3 November 2016|publisher=Schroders|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104014437/http://www.schroders.com/en/contact-us/worldwide-locations/uk/|archive-date=4 November 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Standard Chartered Bank|Standard Chartered]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standardchartered.com/uk/contact-us/en/|title=Contact Us|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Standard Chartered|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829014438/http://www.standardchartered.com/uk/contact-us/en/|archive-date=29 August 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Unilever PLC|Unilever]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unilever.com/resource/unilever-registered-offices.aspx Unilever registered offices] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830072007/http://www.unilever.com/resource/unilever-registered-offices.aspx |date=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of the world's largest law firms are headquartered in the City, including four of the &quot;[[Magic Circle (law firms)|Magic Circle]]&quot; law firms ([[Allen &amp; Overy]], [[Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer]], [[Linklaters]] and [[Slaughter &amp; May]]), as well as other firms such as [[DLA Piper]], [[Eversheds Sutherland]], [[Herbert Smith Freehills]] and [[Hogan Lovells]].

=== Other sectors ===
[[File:Barbican Centre City of London.jpg|thumb|right|Barbican Centre]]
Whilst the financial sector, and related businesses and institutions, continue to dominate, the economy is not limited to that sector. The legal profession has a strong presence, especially in the west and north (i.e., towards the [[Inns of Court]]). Retail businesses were once important, but have gradually moved to the [[West End of London]], though it is now Corporation policy to encourage retailing in some locations, for example at [[Cheapside]] near St Paul's. The City has a number of visitor attractions, mainly based on its historic heritage as well as the [[Barbican Centre]] and adjacent [[Museum of London]], though tourism is not at present a major contributor to the City's economy or character. The City has many pubs, bars and restaurants, and the &quot;night-time&quot; economy does feature in the [[Bishopsgate]] area, towards [[Shoreditch]]. The meat market [[Smithfield Market|at Smithfield]], wholly within the City, continues to be one of London's main markets (the only one remaining in central London) and the country's largest [[butcher|meat market]]. In the east is [[Leadenhall Market]], a fresh food market that is also a visitor attraction.

=== Retail and residential ===
The trend for purely office development is beginning to reverse as the Corporation encourages residential use, albeit with development occurring when it arises on windfall sites. The City has a target of 90 additional dwellings per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Environment_and_planning/Planning/Local_Development_Framework/core_strategy.htm City of London Corporation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512135507/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Environment_and_planning/Planning/Local_Development_Framework/core_strategy.htm |date=12 May 2010 }} Core Strategy&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the extra accommodation is in small pre-[[World War II]] [[listed building]]s, which are not suitable for occupation by the large companies which now provide much of the City's employment. Recent residential developments include &quot;the Heron&quot;, a high-rise residential building on the Milton Court site adjacent to the Barbican, and the [[Heron Tower#Heron Plaza|Heron Plaza]] development on Bishopsgate is also expected to include residential parts.

Since the 1990s, the City has diversified away from near exclusive office use in other ways. For example, several hotels and the first [[department store]] opened in the 2000s. A shopping centre was more recently opened at [[One New Change]], [[Cheapside]] (near St Paul's Cathedral) in October 2010, which is open seven days a week. However, large sections remain quiet at weekends, especially in the eastern section, and it is quite common to find shops, [[Public house|pubs]] and cafes closed on these days.

== Landmarks ==

=== Historical buildings ===
Fire bombing and post-[[World War II]] redevelopment have meant that the City, despite its history, has fewer intact historic structures than one might expect. Nonetheless, there remain many dozens of (mostly Victorian and Edwardian) fine buildings, typically in historicist and [http://claxity.com/ neoclassical style]. They include the [[Monument to the Great Fire of London]] (&quot;the Monument&quot;), [[St Paul's Cathedral]], [[Guildhall, London|the Guildhall]], the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]], [[Dr. Johnson's House]], [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] and a [[:Category:Churches in the City of London|great many churches]], many designed by [[Sir Christopher Wren]], who also designed St Paul's. [[2 King's Bench Walk]] and [[Prince Henry's Room]] are notable historic survivors of heavy bombing of [[Temple, London|the Temple]] area, which has largely been rebuilt to its historic form. Another example of a bomb-damaged place having been restored is [[Staple Inn]] on Holborn. A few small sections of the Roman [[London Wall]] exist, for example near the Tower of London and in the Barbican area. Among the twentieth-century [[listed buildings]] are [[Bracken House, London|Bracken House]], the first post World War II buildings in the country to be given statutory protection, and the whole of the [[Barbican Estate|Barbican]] and [[Golden Lane Estate]].

The [[Tower of London]] is not in the City, but is a notable visitor attraction which brings tourists to the southeast of the City. Other landmark buildings with historical significance include the [[Bank of England]], the [[Old Bailey]], the [[Custom House, City of London|Custom House]], [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield Market]], [[Leadenhall Market]] and [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]]. Noteworthy contemporary buildings include a number of modern high-rise buildings (see section below) as well as the [[Lloyd's building]].

[[File:Royal Exchange Panorama.jpg|centre|thumb|upright=2.25|The Bank of England (left) and the Royal Exchange (centre) are two of the many significant buildings in the City of London.]]

=== Skyscrapers and tall buildings ===
{{See also|List of tallest buildings and structures in London}}

[[File:2016-02 City of London.jpg|thumb|The City skyline in February 2016, including [[20 Fenchurch Street]] (left), the [[122 Leadenhall Street|Leadenhall Building]] (centre) and [[30 St Mary Axe]] (right)]]

;Completed

A growing number of tall buildings and skyscrapers are principally used by the financial sector. Almost all are situated in the eastern side around [[Bishopsgate]], [[Leadenhall Street]] and [[Fenchurch Street]], in the financial core of the City. In the north there is a smaller cluster comprising the [[Barbican Estate]]'s three tall residential towers and the commercial [[CityPoint]] tower. In 2007, the {{convert|100|m|0|adj=on|abbr=on}} tall [[Drapers' Gardens]] building was demolished and replaced by a shorter tower.

The City's buildings of more than {{convert|100|m|0|abbr=on}} in height are:

=== River ===
One [[London River Services]] pier is on the Thames in the City, [[Blackfriars Millennium Pier]], though the [[Tower Millennium Pier]] lies adjacent to the boundary near the Tower of London. One of the [[Port of London]]'s 25 [[safeguarded wharf|safeguarded wharves]], [[Walbrook Wharf]], is adjacent to Cannon Street station, and is used by the Corporation to transfer waste via the river. Swan Lane Pier, just upstream of London Bridge, is proposed to be replaced and upgraded for regular passenger services, planned to take place in 2012–2015. Before then, Tower Pier is to be extended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lda.gov.uk/upload/pdf/River_Thames_Pier_Plan_Diagram_9_1.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615021648/http://www.lda.gov.uk/upload/pdf/River_Thames_Pier_Plan_Diagram_9_1.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 June 2011 |title=River Thames Pier Plan |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |accessdate=30 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a public riverside walk along the river bank, opened in stages over recent years. The only section not running along the river is a short stretch at [[Queenhithe]]. The walk along Walbrook Wharf is closed to pedestrians when waste is being transferred onto barges.

== Criticism ==
Author and journalist [[Nicholas Shaxson]] argued that, in return for the financial institutions based in the City raising loans and finance for the British government, the City &quot;has extracted privileges and freedoms from rules and laws to which the rest of Britain must submit&quot;. He further claims that the assistance provided to the institutions based within it, many of which help their rich clients with offshore tax arrangements, mean that the City is &quot;a [[tax haven]] in its own right&quot;.&lt;ref name=Shaxson&gt;{{cite news|last=Shaxson|first=Nicholas|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/economy/2011/02/london-corporation-city|title=The tax haven in the heart of Britain|accessdate=13 January 2013|newspaper=New Statesman|date=24 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208163939/http://www.newstatesman.com/economy/2011/02/london-corporation-city|archive-date=8 February 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary ''[[The Spider's Web: Britain's Second Empire]]'' asserts the tax haven status that the City provides.{{dubious|Tax haven|date=December 2019}}
