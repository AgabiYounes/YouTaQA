The relatively small city has provided a unique place for noted [[Modern architecture]] and public art, commissioning numerous works since the mid-20th century; the annual program [[Exhibit Columbus]] celebrates this legacy. Located about {{convert|40|mi|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Indianapolis]], on the east fork of the [[White River (Indiana)|White River]], it is the state's 20th-largest city. It is the principal city of the Columbus, Indiana [[metropolitan statistical area]], which encompasses all of Bartholomew County. Columbus is the birthplace of former [[Indiana Governor]] and current [[Vice President of the United States]], [[Mike Pence]].

==History==
The land developed as Columbus was bought by General [[John Tipton]] and Luke Bonesteel in 1820. Tipton built a log cabin on Mount Tipton, a small hill overlooking [[White River (Indiana)|White River]] and the surrounding flat, heavily forested and swampy valley. It held wetlands of the river. The town was first known as Tiptonia, named in honor of Tipton. The town's name was changed to Columbus on March 20, 1821. General Tipton was upset by the name change and decided to leave the newly founded town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Distler|first=A. David|title=Anarchy in the Heartland: The Reno Gang Saga|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lUBacXZ39GIC&amp;pg=PA6|date=October 2008|publisher=A David Distler|isbn=978-0-9705297-1-8|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later appointed as the highway commissioner for the [[State of Indiana]] and was assigned to building a highway from [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, Indiana]] to [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. When the road reached Columbus, Tipton constructed the first bypass road ever built; it detoured south around the west side of Columbus en route to [[Seymour, Indiana|Seymour]].

Joseph McKinney was the first to plot the town of Columbus, but no date was recorded.

Local history books for years said that the land on which Columbus sits was donated by General Tipton. But in 2003, [http://www.historiccolumbusindiana.org Historic Columbus Indiana] acquired a deed showing that General Tipton sold the land.

A ferry was established below the confluence of the [[Flatrock River|Flatrock]] and Driftwood rivers, which form the White River. A village of three or four log cabins developed around the ferry landing, and a store was added in 1821. Later that year, Bartholomew County was organized by an act of the [[Indiana General Assembly|State Legislature]] and named to honor the famous Hoosier militiaman, [[Joseph Bartholomew (General)|General Joseph Bartholomew]]. Columbus was incorporated on June 28, 1864.

The first railroad in Indiana was constructed to Columbus from [[Madison, Indiana]] in 1844. This eventually became the Madison branch of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. The railroad fostered the growth of the community into one of the largest in Indiana, and three more railroads reached the city by 1850.

Columbus is host to the oldest theater in Indiana, [[The Crump Theatre]], which was built in 1889 by John Crump. Today the building is included within the [[Columbus Historic District (Columbus, Indiana)|Columbus Historic District]]. Before it closed permanently in 2010, it was an all-ages venue with occasional musical performances. Columbus was host to the oldest continually operated bookstore in Indiana, Cummins Bookstore, which began operations in 1892. It closed in late 2007.

The [[Irwin Conference Center|Irwin Union Bank]] building was built in 1954. It was designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] by the [[National Park Service]] in 2001 in recognition of its unique architecture. The building consists of a one-story bank structure adjacent to a three-story office annex. A portion of the office annex was built along with the banking hall in 1954. The remaining larger portion, designed by [[Roche-Dinkeloo|Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates]], was built in 1973. [[Eero Saarinen]] designed the bank building with its glazed hall to be set off against the blank background of its three-story brick annex. Two steel and glass vestibule connectors lead from the north side of this structure to the annex. The building was designed to distance the Irwin Union Bank from traditional banking architecture, which mostly echoed imposing, neoclassical style buildings of brick or stone. Tellers were behind iron bars and removed from their customers. Saarinen worked to develop a building that would welcome customers rather than intimidate them.

Columbus has been home to many manufacturing companies, including Noblitt-Sparks Industries (which built radios under the Arvin brand in the 1930s)&lt;ref&gt;McMahon, Morgan E. ''A Flick of the Switch 1930–1950'' (Antiques Electronics Supply, 1990), pp.58–9.&lt;/ref&gt; and Arvin Industries, now [[Meritor|Meritor, Inc.]] After merging with Meritor Automotive on July 10, 2000, the headquarters of the newly created ArvinMeritor Industries was established in Troy, Michigan, the home of parent company, [[Rockwell International]]. It was announced in February 2011 that the company name would revert to Meritor, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ArvinMeritor posts loss, changing name|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/01/arvinmeritor-idUSN0129143020110201?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=cyclicalConsumerGoodsSector&amp;rpc=43|accessdate=July 25, 2011|newspaper=Reuters|date=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cummins|Cummins, Inc.]] is by far the region's largest employer, and the Infotech Park&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Infotech Park of Columbus, Indiana|url=http://www.columbusinfotechpark.com/index.php|accessdate=July 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; accounts for a sizable number of research jobs in Columbus proper. Just south of Columbus are the North American headquarters of [[Toyota Material Handling, U.S.A., Inc.]], the world's largest material handling ([[Forklift truck|forklift]]) manufacturer. Other notable industries include architecture, a discipline for which Columbus is famous worldwide. The late [[J. Irwin Miller]] (then president and chairman of [[Cummins|Cummins Engine Company]]) launched the Cummins Foundation, a charitable program that helps subsidize a large number of architectural projects throughout the city by up-and-coming engineers and architects.

Early in the 20th century, Columbus also was home to a number of pioneering car manufacturers, including [[Milton Reeves|Reeves]], which produced the unusual four-axle [[Octoauto]] and the twin rear-axle Sextoauto, both around 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877–1925''. (New York: Bonanza, 1950), p.122-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly 19,000 workers commute into the city from the surrounding townships and villages.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} In recent years city officials have explored ways to revitalize the city. They recognize the value of [[J. Irwin Miller]]'s support of architectural excellence in the mid-20th century, when the Cummins Foundation made it a mecca of modern architecture. Economic development, widespread beautification innovations, various tax incentives, and increased law enforcement have helped Columbus overcome what some considered a slump during the 1980s and 1990s.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In addition to the Columbus Historic District and Irwin Union Bank, the city has numerous buildings listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], including seven [[National Historic Landmarks]] of modernist architecture: [[Bartholomew County Courthouse]], [[Columbus City Hall (Columbus, Indiana)|Columbus City Hall]], [[First Baptist Church (Columbus, Indiana)|First Baptist Church]], [[First Christian Church (Columbus, Indiana)|First Christian Church]], [[Haw Creek Leather Company]], [[Mabel McDowell Adult Education Center|Mabel McDowell Elementary School]], [[McEwen-Samuels-Marr House]], [[McKinley School (Columbus, Indiana)|McKinley School]], [[Miller House (Columbus, Indiana)|Miller House]], [[North Christian Church]], and [[The Republic (Columbus, Indiana)|The Republic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a|dateform=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nps&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20121102.htm|title=National Register of Historic Places Listings|date=November 2, 2012|work=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 10/22/12 through 10/27/12|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus is a city known for its [[modern architecture]] and [[public art]]. [[J. Irwin Miller]], 2nd CEO and a nephew of a co-founder of [[Cummins|Cummins Inc.]], the Columbus-headquartered diesel engine manufacturer, instituted a program in which the Cummins Foundation paid the architects' fees, provided the client selected a firm from a list compiled by the foundation.
