'''Carlos Alberto Valderrama Palacio''' (&lt;small&gt;[[Colombian Spanish]]:&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-es|ˈkaɾlos alˈβeɾto βaldeˈrama paˈlasjo|}}; born 2 September 1961), also known as ''El Pibe'' (&quot;The Kid&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile-Colombia.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia.com/biografias/autonoticias/deportes/2002/07/25/detallenoticia590.asp|title=CARLOS 'EL PIBE' VALDERRAMA (Futbolista)|publisher=colombia.com|language=Spanish|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Colombian former [[Association football|footballer]] who played as an [[attacking midfielder]]. A creative [[playmaker]], he is regarded as one of the best Colombian footballers of all time, and by some as Colombia's greatest player ever. His distinctive hairstyle, as well as his precise passing and technical skills made him one of South America's most recognisable footballers in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He won the [[South American Footballer of the Year]] award in 1987 and 1993, and in 1999, he was also named one of the top 100 players of the 20th century by [[World Soccer (magazine)|World Soccer]]. In 2004, he was included in the [[FIFA 100]], a list of the 125 &quot;greatest living footballers&quot; chosen by [[Pelé]] to celebrate the 100th anniversary of [[FIFA]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Colombian king&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/world-cup/feature?id=780320&amp;cc=5901&amp;ver=us|title=Carlos Valderrama: Colombian king|publisher=ESPN|author1=Jon Carter|accessdate=5 January 2017|date=5 May 2010|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140306211159/http://espnfc.com/world-cup/feature?id=780320&amp;cc=5901&amp;ver=us|archivedate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Colombia aren't creative enough&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/live-scores/news/y=2011/m=6/news=valderrama-colombia-aren-creative-enough-1451394.html|title=Valderrama: Colombia aren't creative enough|publisher=FIFA.com|date=13 June 2011|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boots and a bouffant&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/newscentre/features/news/newsid=1619243/index.html?intcmp=newsreader_news_box_4|title=Boots and a bouffant|publisher=FIFA.com|date=23 April 2012|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggio Takes Great Strides Toward Soccer Greatness&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-06-15/features/9406150766_1_baggio-great-soccer-players-goals-in-world|title=Baggio Takes Great Strides Toward Soccer Greatness|newspaper=The Orlando Sentinel|author1=Mike Zizzo|date=15 June 1994|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/news/newsid=1451394.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-4705245|title=Elegidos los cinco mejores jugadores de la historia de Colombia en los 60 años de fútbol profesional|newspaper=El Tiempo|language=Spanish|date=4 December 2008|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Valderrama was a member of the [[Colombia national football team]] from 1985 until 1998. He represented Colombia in 111 full internationals and scored 11 times, making him the most capped [[Association footballer|player]] in the country's history. He played a major role during the golden era of Colombian football in the 1990s, representing his national side in three [[FIFA World Cup]]s and five [[Copa América]] tournaments.

After spending most of his career playing club football in South America and Europe, towards the end of his career Valderrama played in [[Major League Soccer]], joining the league in its first season. One of the most recognisable players in the league at the time of its inception, he helped popularise the league during the second half of the 1990s. To this day, he is an icon and is considered one of the most decorated players to ever play in MLS; in 2005, he was named to the [[MLS All-Time Best XI]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Colombian flavour on the rise&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/live-scores/news/y=2012/m=4/news=colombian-flavour-the-rise-mls-1614638.html|title=Colombian flavour on the rise in MLS|publisher=FIFA.com|date=15 April 2012|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mlssoccer1&quot;&gt;[http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2012/03/08/colombians-mls-stability-status-influence-recent-shift Colombians in MLS: Stability, status influence recent shift | MLSsoccer.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/19/mls-colombia-colombians-portland-timbers-diego-chara Why are so many Colombians keen to play in MLS? | Football | The Guardian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/1110/major-league-soccer/2010/10/19/2172421/colombia-makes-an-impact-on-major-league-soccer Colombia Makes An Impact On Major League Soccer - Goal.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=1614638.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Colombia and Europe===
Born in [[Santa Marta]], [[Colombia]], Valderrama began his career at [[Unión Magdalena]] of the Colombian First Division in 1981. He also later played for [[Millonarios]] in 1984. He joined [[Deportivo Cali]] in 1985, where he played most of his Colombian football. In 1988, he moved to the [[Ligue 1|French First Division]] side [[Montpellier Hérault SC|Montpellier]]. He struggled to adapt to the less technical and the faster, more physical, and tactical brand of football being played in Europe, losing his place in the squad. However, his passing ability later saw him become the club's main creative force, and he played a decisive role as his side won the [[Coupe de France]] in [[1990 Coupe de France Final|1990]]. In 1991, he remained in Europe and joined Spanish side [[Real Valladolid]] for a season. He then returned to Colombia in 1992 and went on to play for [[Independiente Medellín]], and subsequently [[Atlético Junior]] in 1993, with whom he won the Colombian championship in 1993 and 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile-Colombia.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;treccani&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

===MLS career===
[[File:Carlos Valderrama 1998.jpg|thumb|200px|Valderrama at a [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] fan meet in 1998]]
Valderrama began his [[Major League Soccer]] career with the US side [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] in the league's inaugural year of 1996, and won its ever first [[Supporters' Shield]] and [[Major League Soccer MVP Award|Most Valuable Player award]], finishing the season with 4 goals and 17 assists. He remained with the club for the 1997 season, and also spent a spell on loan back at Deportivo Cali in Colombia, before moving to another MLS side, [[Miami Fusion]], in 1998, where he also remained for two seasons. He returned to Tampa Bay in 2000, spending two more seasons with the club; while a member of the Mutiny, the team would sell Carlos Valderrama wigs at [[Tampa Stadium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile-Colombia.com&quot;/&gt; In the [[2000 MLS season]], Valderrama recorded the only 20+ assist season in MLS history—ending the season with 26 — a single season assist record that remains intact to this day, and which MLS itself suggested was an &quot;unbreakable&quot; record in a 2012 article.&lt;ref name=unbreakable&gt;[http://www.mlssoccer.com/video/2012/06/22/power-5-unbreakable-records-valderramas-26-assists-2000 Power 5 Unbreakable Records - Valderrama's 26 assists in 2000 | MLSsoccer.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Valderrama joined the [[Colorado Rapids]], and remained with the team until 2002, when he retired; his American soccer league career spanned a total of eight years, during which he made 175 appearances. In the MLS, Valderrama scored relatively few goals (16) for a midfielder, but is the league's fourth all-time leader in assists (114) after [[Brad Davis (soccer)|Brad Davis]] (123), [[Steve Ralston]] (135) - a former teammate, [[Landon Donovan]] (145). In 2005, he was named to the [[MLS All-Time Best XI]].&lt;ref name=mlssoccer.com&gt;[http://www.mlssoccer.com/players/carlos-valderrama Carlos Valderrama | MLSsoccer.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Valderrama was a member of the [[Colombia national football team]] from 1985 until 1998; he made 111 international appearances, scoring 11 goals, making him the most capped [[Association footballer|player]] in the country's history. He represented and [[Captain (association football)|captained]] his national side in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]], [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]], and 
[[1998 FIFA World Cup]]s, and also took part in the [[1987 Copa América|1987]], [[1989 Copa América|1989]], [[1991 Copa América|1991]], [[1993 Copa América|1993]], and [[1995 Copa América]] tournaments.&lt;ref name=&quot;FIFA Profile&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/players-coaches/people=44708/index.html|title=FIFA Profile - Carlos Valderrama|publisher=FIFA.com|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Valderrama made his international debut on 27 October 1985, in a 3–0 defeat to [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] in a [[1986 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|1986 World Cup qualifying match]], at the age of 24. In his first major international tournament, he helped Colombia to a third-place finish at the 1987 Copa América in Argentina, as his team's captain, where he was named the tournament's best player; during the tournament he scored the opening goal in Colombia's 2–0 over [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] on 1 July, their first match of the group stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile-Colombia.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Colombian king&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Valderrama colombia 1993.jpg|thumb|120px|Valderrama with Colombia in 1993]]
Some of Valderrama's most impressive international performances came during the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] in Italy, during which he served as Colombia's captain. He helped his team to a 2–0 win against the [[United Arab Emirates national football team|UAE]] in Colombia's opening match of the group stage, scoring the second goal of the match with a strike from 20 yards. Colombia lost their second match against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]], however, needing at least a draw against the eventual champions [[German national football team|West Germany]] in their final group match in order to advance to the next round of the competition. In the decisive game, German striker [[Pierre Littbarski]] scored what appeared to be the winning goal in the 88th minute of the game; however, within the last minute of injury time, Valderrama beat several opposing players and made a crucial left-footed pass to [[Freddy Rincon]], who subsequently equalised, sealing a place for Colombia in the second round of the tournament with a 1–1 draw. Colombia were eliminated in the round of 16, following a 2–1 extra time loss to [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile-Colombia.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Colombian king&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ami5tGXM0VU Italia 90 Mundial World Cup 1990 Germany v Colombia - YouTube&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 September 1993, Valderrama contributed to Colombia's historic 5–0 victory over South American rivals [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] at the ''[[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti|Monumental]]'' in Buenos Aires, which allowed them to [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|qualify for the 1994 World Cup]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; Although much was expected of Valderrama at the World Cup, an injury during a pre-tournament warm-up game put his place in the squad in jeopardy; although he was able to regain match fitness in time for the tournament, Colombia disappointed and suffered a first round elimination following defeats to [[Romania national football team|Romania]] and the hosts [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]], though it has been contributed by the internal problem and threats by cartel groups at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile-Colombia.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Colombian king&quot;/&gt;

Four years later, Valderrama led his nation to [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|qualify for the 1998 World Cup]] in France, scoring three goals during the qualifying stages. His impact in the final tournament at the advancing age of 37, however, was less decisive, and, despite defeating [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]], Colombia once again suffered a first round exit, following a 2–0 defeat against [[England national football team|England]], which was Valderrama's final international appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile-Colombia.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Colombian king&quot;/&gt;

==Playing style==
Although Valderrama is often defined as a 'classic [[Squad number (association football)|number 10]] [[playmaker]]', due to his creativity and offensive contribution, in reality he was not a classic playmaker in the traditional sense. Although he often wore the number 10 shirt throughout his career and was deployed as an attacking midfielder at times, he played mostly in deeper positions in the [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|centre]] of the pitch – often operating in a free role as a [[Midfielder#Deep-lying playmaker|deep-lying playmaker]], rather than in [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|more advanced midfield positions]] behind the forwards – in order to have a greater influence on the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colombian king&quot;/&gt; A team-player, Valderrama was also known to be an extremely selfless [[midfielder]], who preferred assisting his teammates over going for goal himself;&lt;ref name=&quot;mlssoccer1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=dios&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia.com/informes_especiales/2004/pibe/columnista0.asp|title=&quot;El Pibe, un pequeño dios&quot;|publisher=Colombia.com|language=Spanish|author1=Andrés Gómez V.|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Global Art of Soccer&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Witzig|first1=Richard|title=The Global Art of Soccer|date=2006|publisher=CusiBoy Publishing|location=New Orleans|isbn=9780977668809|page=166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H2T0ZD5S86QC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=carlos+valderrama+colombia&amp;hl=it&amp;ei=ZlIeTPGzONiS4gbty6CeDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=carlos%20valderrama%20colombia&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collie|first1=Ashley Jude|title=World of Soccer: A Complete Guide to the World's Most Popular Sport|date=2005|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0823936988|page=64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bgrsn7ybvNoC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=%22carlos+valderrama%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=17#v=onepage&amp;q=%22carlos%20valderrama%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; his tactical intelligence, positioning, efficient movement and versatile range of passing enabled him to both set the tempo of his team in midfield with short, first time exchanges, or create chances with long lobbed passes or through balls.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile-Colombia.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggio Takes Great Strides Toward Soccer Greatness&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chi ha sbagliato Pagliuca&quot;&gt;[http://chihasbagliatopagliuca.blogspot.com/2012/08/how-maturana-changed-football.html Chi ha sbagliato Pagliuca?: How Maturana changed football&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube1&quot;&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoyBzAYFg8E Valderrama 1990/1991 French D1 (assists) part2 - YouTube&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Diez veces gracias&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia.com/informes_especiales/2004/pibe/col1.asp|title=Diez veces gracias|publisher=Colombia.com|language=Spanish|author1=Jaime Bernal|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;I'd do it all again&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/live-scores/news/y=2006/m=2/news=carlos-valderrama-all-again-102983.html|title=Carlos Valderrama: I'd do it all again|publisher=FIFA.com|date=20 February 2006|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Valderrama's most instantly recognisable physical features were his big afro-blonde hairstyle, jewelry, and moustache,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; but he was best known for his grace and elegance on the ball, as well as his agility, and quick feet as a footballer. His control, [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] ability and footwork were similar to those of smaller players, which for a player of Valderrama's size and physical build was fairly uncommon, and he frequently stood out throughout his career for his ability to use his strength, balance, composure, and flamboyant technique to shield the ball from opponents when put under pressure, and retain possession in difficult situations, which made him extremely popular with the fans. Valderrama's mix of physical strength, two-footed ability, unpredictability and flair enabled him to produce key and incisive performances against top tier teams, while his world class vision and exceptional passing and [[Cross (football)|crossing]] ability with his right foot made him one of the best [[Assist (football)|assist]] providers of his time; his height, physique and elevation also made him effective in the air, and he was also an accurate [[Direct free kick|free kick]] taker and striker of the ball, despite not being a particularly prolific goalscorer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colombian king&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Colombia aren't creative enough&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boots and a bouffant&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggio Takes Great Strides Toward Soccer Greatness&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Colombian flavour on the rise&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;treccani&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/carlos-valderrama_(Enciclopedia-dello-Sport)/|title=Valderrama, Carlos|publisher=Treccani: Enciclopedia dello Sport (2002)|language=Italian|author1=Matteo Dotto|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/news/newsid=87394/index.html Valderrama: an artist's short spell in Montpellier - FIFA.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Global Art of Soccer&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/news/newsid=2167928/index.html The day Colombia rocked the Monumental - FIFA.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCpLicqLvOA 1996 Valderrama vs West MLS All star - YouTube&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube2&quot;&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp7vf5So3_k MLS LEGENDS | Carlos &quot;El Pibe&quot; Valderrama - YouTube&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube3&quot;&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7A5smuVFs8 Carlos VALDERRAMA keep and pass compilation - christinayan - YouTube&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia.com/informes_especiales/2004/pibe/|title=Informe Especial del *Pibe* Valderrama|publisher=Colombia.com|language=Spanish|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia.com/informes_especiales/2004/pibe/col4.asp|title=El más querido, el inolvidable...|publisher=Colombia.com|language=Spanish|author1=César Muñoz|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his natural talent and ability as a footballer, Valderrama earned a reputation for having a &quot;languid&quot; playing style, as well as lacking notable pace, being unfit, and for having a poor defensive work-rate on the pitch, in particular after succumbing to the physical effects of ageing in his later career in the MLS. In his first season in France, he also initially struggled to adapt to the faster-paced, more physical and tactically rigorous European brand of football, which saw him play in an unfamiliar position, and gave him less space and time on the ball to dictate attacking passing moves; he was criticised at times for his lack of match fitness and his low defensive contribution, which initially limited his appearances with the club, although he later successfully became a key creative player in his team's starting line-up due to his discipline, skill, and his precise and efficient passing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colombian king&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;treccani&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=dios/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Diez veces gracias&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;I'd do it all again&quot;/&gt; Despite these claims, earlier in his career, however, Valderrama demonstrated substantial pace, stamina, and defensive competence.&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;prestigio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elgrafico.com.ar/2008/07/21/C-115-no-tengo-miedo-a-perder-el-prestigio.php|title=&quot;No tengo miedo a perder el prestigio&quot;|publisher=El Gráfico|language=Spanish|author1=Diego Borinsky|date=21 July 2008|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former French defender [[Laurent Blanc]], who played with Valderrama in Montpellier, voiced one of the most accurate descriptions for Valderrama, &quot;In the fast and furious European game he wasn't always at his ease. He was a natural exponent of 'toque', keeping the ball moving. But he was so gifted that we could give him the ball when we didn't know what else to do with it knowing he wouldn't lose it... and often he would do things that most of us only dream about.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

In February 2004, Valderrama ended his 22-year career in a tribute match at the Metropolitan stadium of [[Barranquilla]], with some of the most important football players of South America, such as [[Diego Maradona]], [[Enzo Francescoli]], [[Iván Zamorano]], and [[José Luis Chilavert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eluniverso.com/2004/02/02/0001/15/E4661A95CE2B49E1B98CA668813DFD77.html|title=Valderrama anotó un gol en su despedida|publisher=www.eluniverso.com|language=Spanish|date=2 February 2004|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a 22-foot bronze statue of Valderrama, created by Colombian artist [[Amilkar Ariza]], was erected outside [[Estadio Eduardo Santos]] in Valderrama's birthplace of [[Santa Marta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://aldianews.com/articles/culture/sports/el-pibe-predicts-chat-colombia-s-soccer-deity/50038|title=El Pibe Predicts: A Chat With Colombia's Soccer Deity|date=25 September 2017|work=AL DÍA News|access-date=10 July 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Valderrama was the only Colombian to feature in FIFA's [[FIFA 100|125 Top Living Football Players list]] in March 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pele&quot; /&gt;

===Media===
Valderrama appeared on the cover of [[Konami]]'s ''[[International Superstar Soccer Pro 98]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/572464-international-superstar-soccer-pro-98/images/145995|title=International Superstar Soccer Pro '98 Box Shot for PlayStation - GameFAQs|website=gamefaqs.gamespot.com|language=en|access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Nintendo 64]] version of the game, he is referred to by his nickname, ''El Pibe''.

== Coaching career ==
Since retiring from professional football, Valderrama has become assistant manager of [[Atlético Junior]]. On 1 November 2007, Valderrama accused a referee of corruption by waving cash in the face of Oscar Julian Ruiz when the official awarded a penalty to [[América de Cali]]. Junior lost the match 4–1, which ended the club's hopes of playoff qualification.&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press|AP]] (2007), [https://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2007-11-01-3659438715_x.htm Valderrama expelled from match for taunting referee with cash], [[USA Today]], 1 November 2007, usatoday.com. Retrieved 10 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He later also served as a coach for a football academy called Clearwater Galactics in [[Clearwater, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/galacticsfc|title=Galactics Clearwater|website=www.facebook.com|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabayinformer.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=itemlist&amp;layout=category&amp;task=category&amp;id=24&amp;Itemid=36|title=International Soccer Festival 2007 on Saturday December 1st|publisher=Tampa Bay Informer|format=13 November 2007|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
