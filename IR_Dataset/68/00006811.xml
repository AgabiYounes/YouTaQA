The '''Centers for Disease Control and Prevention''' ('''CDC''') is the leading [[National public health institutes|national public health institute]] of the United States. The CDC is a [[Federal agencies of the United States|United States federal agency]] under the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] and is headquartered in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/city-atlanta-expansion-emory-and-cdc-approved/kMYzghHbvzD6THTyWpN1zH/|title=City of Atlanta's expansion to Emory and CDC approved|website=www.ajc.com|accessdate=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its main goal is to protect [[public health]] and safety through the control and prevention of disease, injury, and [[disability]] in the US and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/about/organization/mission.htm |title=Mission, Role and Pledge |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |access-date=January 16, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC focuses national attention on developing and applying disease control and prevention. It especially focuses its attention on [[infectious disease]], [[Foodborne illness|food borne pathogens]], [[environmental health]], [[occupational safety and health]], [[health promotion]], [[injury prevention]] and educational activities designed to improve the health of [[United States citizens]]. In addition, the CDC researches and provides information on [[non-infectious diseases]] such as [[obesity]] and [[diabetes]] and is a founding member of the [[International Association of National Public Health Institutes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cdcoffwebsite&quot;&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov CDC Home Page], cdc.gov; retrieved November 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Communicable Disease Center was founded July 1, 1946, as the successor to the [[World War II]] [[National Malaria Eradication Program|Malaria Control in War Areas]] program&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8955706&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Parascandola J|title=From MCWA to CDC—origins of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|journal=Public Health Reports|date=November–December 1996|pmid=8955706|volume=111|issue=6|pages=549–51|pmc=1381908}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Office of National Defense Malaria Control Activities.&lt;ref name=NARA&gt;{{cite web|title=Records of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Record Group 442) 1921–2004 |work=Guide to Federal Records |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]] |location=United States |date=November 9, 2010 |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/442.html |accessdate=2009-10-04 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119230544/http://archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/442.html |archivedate=November 19, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preceding its founding, organizations with global influence in [[malaria]] control were the Malaria Commission of the [[League of Nations]] and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].&lt;ref name=Najera&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nájera JA|title=Malaria control: achievements, problems and strategies|journal=Parassitologia|volume=43|issue=1–2|pages=1–89|date=June 2001|pmid=11921521}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rockefeller Foundation greatly supported malaria control,&lt;ref name=Najera/&gt; sought to have the governments take over some of its efforts, and collaborated with the agency.&lt;ref name=Stapelton&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stapleton DH|title=Lessons of history?

The new agency was a branch of the [[U.S. Public Health Service]] and Atlanta was chosen as the location because [[malaria]] was endemic in the Southern United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/repo_A87OY4Vt|title=War, Tropical Disease, and the Emergence of National Public Health Capacity in the United States|last=Sledge|first=Daniel|date=2012|journal=Studies in American Political Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency changed names (see infobox on top) before adopting the name ''Communicable Disease Center'' in 1946. Offices were located on the sixth floor of the Volunteer Building on Peachtree Street.

With a budget at the time of about $1{{nbsp}}million, 59 percent of its personnel were engaged in [[mosquito]] abatement and habitat control with the objective of control and eradication of malaria in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Division of Parasitic Diseases|title=Malaria Control in War Areas (1942–1945)|work=The History of Malaria, an Ancient Disease (2004)|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|location=[[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]|date=February 8, 2010|url=https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/history/index.htm#mcwa|accessdate=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[National Malaria Eradication Program]]).

Among its 369 employees, the main jobs at CDC were originally [[entomology]] and engineering. In CDC's initial years, more than six and a half million homes were sprayed, mostly with [[DDT]]. In 1946, there were only seven medical officers on duty and an early organization chart was drawn, somewhat fancifully, in the shape of a mosquito. Under [[Joseph Walter Mountin]], the CDC continued to advocate for public health issues and pushed to extend its responsibilities to many other [[Infectious disease|communicable diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2030772|pmid=14930166|volume=67|issue=5|title=Dr. Joseph W. Mountin, pioneer in public health, 1891–1952|year=1952|journal=Public Health Rep|page=425|author1=Scheele|first1=L. A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, the CDC made a token payment of $10 to [[Emory University]] for {{convert|15|acre|m2}} of land on Clifton Road in DeKalb County, still the home of CDC headquarters as of 2019. CDC employees collected the money to make the purchase. The benefactor behind the &quot;gift&quot; was [[Robert W. Woodruff]], [[chairman of the board]] of [[The Coca-Cola Company]]. Woodruff had a long-time interest in [[malaria]] control, which had been a problem in areas where he went hunting. The same year, the PHS transferred its San Francisco based plague laboratory into the CDC as the Epidemiology Division, and a new Veterinary Diseases Division was established.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8955706&quot;/&gt; An [[Epidemic Intelligence Service]] (EIS) was established in 1951, originally due to biological warfare concerns arising from the Korean War; it evolved into two-year postgraduate training program in epidemiology, and a prototype for [[Field Epidemiology Training Program]]s (FETP), now{{when|date=August 2019}} found in numerous countries, reflecting CDC's influence in promoting this model internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=Mark|first2=Sharon M.|last2=McDonnell|first3=Denise H.|last3=Werker|first4=Victor M.|last4=Cardenas|first5=Stephen B.|last5=Thacker|year=2001|title=Partnerships in International Applied Epidemiology Training and Service|journal=[[American Journal of Epidemiology]]|volume=154|issue=11|pages=993–999|doi=10.1093/aje/154.11.993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission of CDC expanded beyond its original focus on malaria to include [[sexually transmitted disease]]s when the Venereal Disease Division of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) was transferred to the CDC in 1957. Shortly thereafter, Tuberculosis Control was transferred (in 1960) to the CDC from PHS, and then in 1963 the Immunization program was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Beth E.

It became the ''National Communicable Disease Center (NCDC)'' effective July 1, 1967.&lt;ref name=NARA/&gt; The organization was renamed the ''Center for Disease Control (CDC)'' on June 24, 1970, and ''Centers for Disease Control'' effective October 14, 1980.&lt;ref name=NARA/&gt; An act of the [[United States Congress]] appended the words &quot;and Prevention&quot; to the name effective October 27, 1992. However, Congress directed that the initialism ''CDC'' be retained because of its name recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=CDC: the nation's prevention agency |journal=MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep |volume=41 |issue=44 |page=833 |year=1992 |pmid=1331740 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00017924.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611163317/http://cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00017924.htm |archivedate=June 11, 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently{{when|date=August 2019}}, the CDC focus has broadened to include [[Chronic (medical)|chronic diseases]], [[Disability|disabilities]], injury control, [[Occupational safety and health|workplace hazards]], [[environmental health]] threats, and terrorism preparedness. CDC combats emerging diseases and other health risks, including [[Congenital disorder|birth defects]], [[West Nile virus]], [[obesity]], [[Avian influenza|avian]], [[Swine influenza|swine]], and [[pandemic flu]], [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]], and [[bioterrorism]], to name a few. The organization would also prove to be an important factor in preventing the abuse of [[penicillin]]. In May 1994 the CDC admitted having sent several biological warfare agents to the Iraqi government from 1984 through 1989, including [[Botulinum toxin]], [[West Nile virus]], [[Yersinia pestis]] and [[Dengue fever]] virus.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The eleventh plague: the politics of biological and chemical warfare&quot; (pp. 84–86) by [http://www.leonardcole.com Leonard A. Cole] (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 21, 2005, then–CDC Director [[Julie Gerberding]] formally announced the reorganization of CDC to &quot;confront the challenges of 21st-century health threats&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/futures/g_letter_04-21-05.htm|title=CDC Office of Director, The Futures Initiative|publisher=CDC—National Center for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=2008-12-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629062149/http://www.cdc.gov/futures/g_letter_04-21-05.htm|archive-date=June 29, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four Coordinating Centers—established under the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|G. W. Bush Administration]] and Gerberding—&quot;diminished the influence of national centers under [their] umbrella&quot;,{{Clarify|date=August 2015}} and were ordered cut under the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama Administration]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koenig|first=Robert|url=http://blogs.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/08/new-chief-order.html|title=New Chief Orders CDC to Cut Management Layers|publisher=Blogs.sciencemag.org|accessdate=2012-04-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920141107/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/08/new-chief-order.html|archive-date=September 20, 2009|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today{{when|date=August 2019}}, the CDC's [[Biosafety Level 4]] laboratories are among the few that exist in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dhcpp/vspb|title=Viral Special Pathogens Branch|accessdate=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and serve as one of only two official repositories of [[smallpox]] in the world. The second smallpox store resides at the [[State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR]] in the Russian Federation. The CDC revealed in 2014 that it had discovered several misplaced smallpox samples and also that lab workers had potentially been infected with anthrax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scutti |first=Susan |url=http://www.newsweek.com/recent-cdc-anthrax-and-smallpox-mishaps-signal-potential-dangers-259923 |title=CDC Smallpox and Anthrax Mishaps Signal Other Potential Dangers |website=[[Newsweek]] |date=2014-07-16 |accessdate=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The CDC is organized into &quot;Centers, Institutes, and Offices&quot; (CIOs), with each organizational unit implementing the agency's activities in a particular area of expertise while also providing intra-agency support and resource-sharing for cross-cutting issues and specific health threats. Generally, CDC &quot;Offices&quot; are subdivided into Centers, which in turn are composed of Divisions and Branches.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8955706&quot; /&gt; However, the Center for Global Health and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health are freestanding organizational units and do not belong to a parent Office.

As of August 2019, the CIOs are:

* Director
** Principal Deputy Director
*** Deputy Director - Public Health Service and Implementation Science
**** Office of Minority Health and Health Equity
**** Center for Global Health
**** Center for Preparedness and Response
**** Center for State, Tribal, Local, and Territory Support

**** [[National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases]]
**** National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (includes the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, which issues [[quarantine]] orders)
**** [[National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention]]
*** [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]
** Office of the Director
*** Chief of Staff

*** Associate Director - Policy and Strategy

The Office of Public Health Preparedness was created during the 2001 anthrax attacks shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Its purpose was to coordinate among the government the response to a range of biological terrorism threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/05/politics/bioterrorism-office-gets-a-new-director.html|title=Bioterrorism Office Gets a New Director|last=|first=|date=2002-05-02|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Budget and operations==
CDC's budget for fiscal year 2018 is $11.9{{nbsp}}billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/about/budget/fy2018/budget-in-brief/cdc/index.html|title=FY 2018 Budget in Brief – CDC|author =Office of Budget|publisher = Department of Health and Human Services|date=2017-05-23|website =HHS.gov|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its Atlanta headquarters, CDC's other domestic locations are [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]], [[Hyattsville, Maryland|Hyattsville]], [[Research Triangle Park]], [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan (Puerto Rico)]], and [[Washington, D.C.]], while NIOSH operates its own facilities in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], [[Morgantown, West Virginia|Morgantown]], [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]], [[Denver]], and Anchorage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/jobs/living-in-atlanta.html|title=Living in Atlanta|last=|first=|date=2019-04-23|website=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=2019-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, CDC operates quarantine facilities in 20 cities in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/quarantine-stations-us.html|title=U.S. Quarantine Stations|last=|first=|date=2019-04-24|website=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=2019-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDC offers [[Federal grants in the United States|grants]] that help many organizations each year advance health, safety and awareness at the community level throughout the United States. The CDC awards over 85 percent of its annual budget through these grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://charity.lovetoknow.com/CDC_Grants|title=CDC Grants at LoveToKnow Charity|accessdate=2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Workforce ==
{{As of|2008}}, CDC staff numbered approximately 15,000 (including 6,000 contractors and 840 [[United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps|Commissioned Corps]] officers) in 170 occupations. Eighty percent held bachelor's degrees or higher; almost half had advanced degrees (a master's degree or a doctorate such as a PhD, [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]], or [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/about/stateofcdc/html/budget-workforce.htm|title=State of CDC: Budget and Workforce|author=Office of the Associate Director for Communication|date=May 19, 2010|work=CDC Impact Story Topics|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|format=[[XHTML]]|accessdate=2011-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122030856/http://www.cdc.gov/about/stateofcdc/html/budget-workforce.htm|archive-date=January 22, 2013|url-status=dead}} For more data on 2008, click on the &quot;2008&quot; link.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Epidemic Intelligence Service]] (EIS) is composed of &quot;boots-on-the-ground disease detectives&quot; who investigate public health problems domestically and globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/eis/index.html|title=Epidemic Intelligence Service|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When called upon by a governmental body, EIS officers may embark on short-term epidemiological assistance assignments, or &quot;Epi-Aids&quot;, to provide technical expertise in containing and investigating disease outbreaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/eis/epiaids.html|title=Epidemiologic Assistance|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Infectious diseases: emergence and re-emergence: a geographical analysis|last=Cliff|first=A.D.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=0199244731|location=Oxford, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koplan|first=Jeffrey P.|last2=Foege|first2=William H.|date=2011-12-01|title=Introduction: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Epi-Aids--a fond recollection|url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/174/suppl_11/S1.long|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|volume=174|issue=11 Suppl|pages=S1–3|doi=10.1093/aje/kwr303|issn=1476-6256|pmid=22135388}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EIS program is a model for the international [[Field Epidemiology Training Program]].

=== Public Health Associates Program ===
The CDC also operates the Public Health Associate Program (PHAP), a two-year paid fellowship for recent college graduates to work in public health agencies all over the United States. PHAP was founded in 2007 and currently{{when|date=August 2019}} has 159 associates in 34 states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/phap/index.html Public Health Associate Program website], Cdc.gov; retrieved April 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of focus==
[[File:Smallpox eradication team.jpg|right|thumb|[[Donald Henderson]] as part of the CDC's smallpox eradication team in 1966.]]

===Communicable diseases===
The CDC's programs address more than 400 diseases, health threats, and conditions that are major causes of death, disease, and disability. The CDC's website has information on various infectious (and noninfectious) diseases, including [[smallpox]], [[measles]], and others.

==== Influenza ====

The CDC has launched campaigns targeting the transmission of [[influenza]], including the [[H1N1]] swine flu, and launched websites to educate people in proper hygiene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.htm|title = Influenza (Flu)|publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Division of Select Agents and Toxins ====
Within the division are two programs: the Federal Select Agent Program (FSAP) and the Import Permit Program. The FSAP is run jointly with an office within the U.S. Department of Agriculture, regulating agents that can cause disease in humans, animals, and plants. The Import Permit Program regulates the importation of &quot;infectious biological materials.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/phpr/dsat/about.htm|title=About the Division of Select Agents and Toxins {{!}} CDC|date=2018-10-10|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDC runs a program that protects the public from rare and dangerous substances such as [[anthrax]] and the [[Ebola virus]]. The program, called the Federal [[Select agent|Select Agent]] Program, calls for inspections of labs in the U.S. that work with dangerous pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Bryan. [http://bioprepwatch.com/biological-threats/cdcs-select-agents-program-protects-against-bioterror-threats/335879 &quot;CDC's Select Agents Program protects against bioterror threats&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20141018024321/http://bioprepwatch.com/biological-threats/cdcs-select-agents-program-protects-against-bioterror-threats/335879 |date=October 18, 2014 }}, BioPrepWatch, February 10, 2014; accessed October 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa|2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa]], the CDC helped coordinate the return of two infected American aid workers for treatment at [[Emory University Hospital]], the home of a special unit to handle highly infectious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Achenbach|first1=Joel|last2=Dennis|first2=Brady|last3=Hogan|first3=Caelainn|title=American doctor infected with Ebola returns to U.S.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/us-confirms-2-americans-with-ebola-coming-home-for-treatment/2014/08/01/c20a27cc-1995-11e4-9e3b-7f2f110c6265_story.html?hpid=z1|website=washingtonpost.com|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=August 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak, Congress passed a Continuing Appropriations Resolution allocating $30,000,000 towards CDC's efforts to fight the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2015|url=https://beta.congress.gov/113/bills/hjres124/BILLS-113hjres124ih.pdf|publisher=congress.gov|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-communicable diseases===
The CDC also works on non-communicable diseases, including chronic diseases caused by [[obesity]], physical inactivity and tobacco-use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/obesity|title=Overweight &amp; Obesity|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antibiotic resistance===
The CDC implemented their ''National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria'' as a measure against the spread of antibiotic resistance in the United States. This initiative has a budget of $161{{nbsp}}million and includes the development of the [[Antibiotic Resistance Lab Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/solutions-initiative/ar-lab-networks.html |title=Antibiotic Resistance Lab Network &amp;#124; Antibiotic/Antimicrobial Resistance &amp;#124; CDC |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=2017-01-05 |accessdate=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global health ===
The CDC works with other organizations around the world to address global health challenges and contain disease threats at their source. It works closely with many international organizations such as the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as well as ministries of health and other groups on the front lines of outbreaks. The agency maintains staff in more than 60 countries, including some from the U.S. but even more from the  countries in which it operates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/what/default.htm|title=CDC Global Health – What We're Doing|date=2017-09-15|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency's global divisions include the Division of Global HIV and TB (DGHT), the Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria (DPDM), the Division of Global Health Protection (DGHP), and the Global Immunization Division (GID).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/organization.htm |title = Organization of the CDC Center for Global Health|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date = March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDC is integral in working with the WHO to implement the [[International Health Regulations|''International Health Regulations'' (IHR)]], a legally binding agreement between 196 countries to prevent, control, and report on the international spread of disease, through initiatives including the Global Disease Detection Program (GDD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.uniteforsight.org/surveillance/module2 |website =Unite for Sight|title = Module 2: WHO and CDC Global Surveillance Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDC is also a lead implementer of key U.S. global health initiatives such as the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief|President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)]] and the [[President's Malaria Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/globalhivtb/who-we-are/about-us/globalhiv/globalhiv.html|title=CDC's Role in Global HIV Control|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travelers' health===
The CDC collects and publishes health information for travelers in a comprehensive book, ''CDC Health Information for International Travel'', which is commonly known as the &quot;yellow book.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/yellowbook-home|title=2018 Yellow Book Home {{!}} Travelers' Health {{!}} CDC|website=wwwnc.cdc.gov|accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is available online and in print as a new edition every other year and includes current travel health guidelines, vaccine recommendations, and information on specific [[Tourist attraction|travel destinations]]. The CDC also issues travel health notices on its website, consisting of three levels:

&quot;Watch&quot;: Level 1 (practice usual precautions)

&quot;Alert&quot;: Level 2 (practice enhanced precautions)

&quot;Warning&quot;: Level 3 (avoid nonessential travel)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices|title=Travel Health Notices {{!}} Travelers' Health {{!}} CDC|website=wwwnc.cdc.gov|date = 29 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foundation ==
The CDC Foundation operates independently from CDC as a private, nonprofit [[501(c)(3)]] organization incorporated in the State of Georgia. The creation of the Foundation was authorized by section 399F of the [[Public Health Service Act]] to support the mission of CDC in partnership with the private sector, including organizations, foundations, businesses, educational groups, and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=42 U.S. Code § 280e–11 – Establishment and duties of Foundation |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/280e-11 |website=Legal Information Institute |accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdcfoundation.org|title=CDCfoundation.org|publisher=CDCfoundation.org|accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture and controversies==

===Lead contamination in Washington, D.C. drinking water===
Because of the [[Lead contamination in Washington, D.C. drinking water]] the [[United States House of Representatives]] conducted an investigation, that uncovered that the CDC had made claims in a report that had indicated there was no risk from high lead levels - although it is the opposite.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}

===Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male===
For 15 years, the CDC had direct oversight over the [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm|title=The Tuskegee Timeline |publisher= CDC|website = NCHHSTP|date = 22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the study, which lasted from 1932 to 1972, a group of African American men (nearly 400 of whom had syphilis) were studied to learn more about the disease. Notably, the disease was left untreated in the research subjects and they never gave their informed consent to serve as research subjects. The Tuskegee Study was [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment|initiated in 1932]] by the Public Health Service.  The CDC took over the study in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exopolitics.blogs.com/ebolagate/2014/08/cdc-ran-the-tuskegee-experiment-for-15-years-.html|title=CDC Ran the Tuskegee Experiment for 15 Years: Any Connection To Operation Paperclip?|publisher=exopolitics.blogs.com|date=August 27, 2014 |accessdate=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDC's response to the AIDS crisis in the 1980s has been criticized for promoting some public health policies that harmed HIV+ people and for providing ineffective public education. The agency's response to the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] was also criticized for ineffective communication with other public health agencies and with the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Public Health in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZhzCQAAQBAJ|publisher=Routledge|date=2015-05-20|isbn=9781317455264|first=Kant|last=Patel|first2=Mark E.|last2=Rushefsky|pages=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CDC zombie apocalypse outreach campaign===
On May 16, 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's blog [[Preparedness 101: Zombie Apocalypse|published an article instructing the public on]] what to do to prepare for a [[Zombie (fictional)|zombie]] invasion. While the article did not claim that such a scenario was possible, it did use the popular culture appeal as a means of urging citizens to prepare for all potential hazards, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, and floods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Khan|first=Ali S.|title=CDC Zombie Warning|url=http://blogs.cdc.gov/publichealthmatters/2011/05/preparedness-101-zombie-apocalypse|work=&quot;Preparedness 101: Zombie Apocalypse&quot;|date=2011-05-16|accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to David Daigle, the Associate Director for Communications, Public Health Preparedness and Response, the idea arose when his team was discussing their upcoming hurricane-information campaign and Daigle mused that &quot;we say pretty much the same things every year, in the same way, and I just wonder how many people are paying attention.&quot; A social-media employee mentioned that the subject of zombies had come up a lot on [[Twitter]] when she had been tweeting about the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] and [[radiation]]. The team realized that a campaign like this would most likely reach a different audience from the one that normally pays attention to hurricane-preparedness warnings and went to work on the zombie campaign, launching it right before hurricane season began. &quot;The whole idea was, if you're prepared for a zombie apocalypse, you're prepared for pretty much anything,&quot; said Daigle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepticality.com/centers-zombie-control-prevention|title=Skepticality Podcast|work=Centers for Zombie Control and Prevention|date=2011-10-25|accessdate=2014-03-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225000204/http://www.skepticality.com/centers-zombie-control-prevention/|archive-date=December 25, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the blog article became popular, the CDC announced an open contest for [[YouTube]] submissions of the most creative and effective videos covering preparedness for a [[zombie apocalypse]] (or apocalypse of any kind), to be judged by the &quot;CDC Zombie Task Force&quot;. Submissions were open until October 11, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prepare.challenge.gov|title=Are You Prepared? Video Contest|publisher=Prepare.challenge.gov|accessdate=2012-04-16}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also released a zombie-themed graphic novella available on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/phpr/zombies_novella.htm |title=Zombie Novella&amp;#124;Zombie Preparedness&amp;#124;Are We Prepared? |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=2015-04-10 |accessdate=2017-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729111741/https://www.cdc.gov/phpr/zombies_novella.htm |archive-date=July 29, 2017 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zombie-themed educational materials for teachers are available on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/phpr/zombies.htm |title=Zombie Preparedness&amp;#124;Are We Prepared?&amp;#124;PHPR |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=2015-04-10 |accessdate=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gun violence===
One area of current{{when|date=August 2019}} partisan dispute related to CDC funding is studying gun violence. The 1996 [[Dickey Amendment]] states &quot;none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ208/pdf/PLAW-104publ208.pdf|title=Public Law 104–208|date=September 30, 1996|work=Congressional Record|quote=... none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Advocates for [[gun control]] oppose the amendment and have tried to overturn it.&lt;ref name=PRI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-07-02/quietly-congress-extends-ban-cdc-research-gun-violence|title=Quietly, Congress extends a ban on CDC research on gun violence|publisher=Pri.org|accessdate=2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, [[Mark L. Rosenberg]] and five CDC colleagues founded the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, with an annual budget of c. $260,000 that focused on &quot;identifying the root causes of firearm deaths and the best methods to prevent them&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;theatlantic_Masters_2016&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/cdc-gun-violence/476814 |title=Why Did the CDC Stop Researching Gun Violence? |newspaper=The Atlantic |quote=&quot;The agency's former leaders say it could do more to explore the subject, but its officials fear political—and personal—retribution.&quot; |first=Kate |last=Masters |date=April 5, 2016 |access-date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first report which was published in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' in 1993, entitled &quot;Gun Ownership as a Risk Factor for Homicide in the Home&quot; reported that the &quot;mere presence of a gun in a home increased the risk of a firearm-related death by 2.7 percent, and suicide fivefold—a &quot;huge&quot; increase.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theatlantic_Masters_2016&quot;/&gt; In response, the NRA launched a &quot;campaign to shut down the Injury Center.&quot; [[Doctors for Responsible Gun Ownership]] and [[Doctors for Integrity and Policy Research]] joined the pro-gun effort and by 1995, politicians also supported the pro-gun initiative. In 1996, [[Jay Dickey]] (R) Arkansas introduced the [[Dickey Amendment]] statement &quot;which stated &quot;none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control&quot; as a rider&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; in the 1996 [[Appropriations bill (United States)|appropriations bill]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theatlantic_Masters_2016&quot;/&gt; In 1997, &quot;Congress redirected all of the money previously earmarked for gun violence research to the study of traumatic brain injury.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theatlantic_Masters_2016&quot;/&gt; [[David Satcher]], who was the CDC head from 1993 to 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Office of Public Health and Science |title=David Satcher (1998–2002) |url=http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/history/biosatcher.htm |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |date=January 4, 2007 |accessdate=January 17, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205160010/http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/history/biosatcher.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2007 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; advocated for gun violence research until he left in 1998. In 1999 Rosenberg was fired.&lt;ref name=&quot;theatlantic_Masters_2016&quot;/&gt; Over a dozen &quot;public health insiders, including current and former CDC senior leaders&quot; told ''[[The Trace (website)|The Trace]]'' interviewers that CDC senior leaders took an overly cautious stance in their interpretation of the Dickey amendment. They could have done much more.&lt;ref name=&quot;theatlantic_Masters_2016&quot;/&gt; Rosenberg told ''The Trace'' in 2016, &quot;Right now, there is nothing stopping them from addressing this life-and-death national problem.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theatlantic_Masters_2016&quot;/&gt;

The [[American Medical Association]], the [[American Psychological Association]] and the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] sent a letter to the leaders of the Senate Appropriations Committee in 2013 asking them &quot;to support at least $10{{nbsp}}million within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in FY 2014 along with sufficient new funding at the National Institutes of Health to support research into the causes and prevention of gun violence. Furthermore, we urge Members to oppose any efforts to reduce, eliminate, or condition CDC funding related to gun violence prevention research.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/congressional/Democrats_push_to_restart_CDC_funding_for_gun_violence_research.html|title=Democrats push to restart CDC funding for gun violence research|publisher=Philly.com|accessdate=2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress maintained the ban in subsequent budgets.&lt;ref name=PRI/&gt;
