Born in [[Zhejiang|Chekiang]] (Zhejiang) Province, Chiang was a member of the [[Kuomintang]] and a lieutenant of [[Sun Yat-sen]] in the revolution to overthrow the [[Beiyang government]] and reunify China. With Soviet and [[Communist Party of China|communist]] (CPC) help, Chiang organized the military for Sun's [[Guangzhou#Kuomintang rule|Canton Nationalist Government]] and headed the [[Whampoa Military Academy]]. Commander in chief of the [[National Revolutionary Army]] (from which he came to be known as [[Generalissimo]]), he led the [[Northern Expedition]] from 1926 to 1928, before defeating a coalition of warlords and nominally reunifying China under a new [[Nationalist government]]. Midway through the campaign, the [[First United Front|KMT–CPC alliance]] broke down and Chiang [[Shanghai Massacre|purged the communists]] inside the party, triggering a [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] with the [[Communist Party of China|CCP]], which he eventually lost in 1949.

As leader of the Republic of China in the [[Nanjing decade]], Chiang sought to strike a difficult balance between the modernizing China while also devoting resources to defending the nation against the impending [[Mukden Incident|Japanese threat]]. Trying to avoid a war with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] while hostilities with CCP continued, he was kidnapped in the [[Xi'an Incident]] and obliged to form an [[Second United Front|Anti-Japanese United Front]] with the CCP. Following the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] in 1937, he mobilized China for the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. For eight years he led the war of resistance against a vastly superior enemy, mostly from the wartime capital [[Chongqing]]. As the leader of a major [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] power, Chiang met with British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] and U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in the [[Cairo Conference]] to discuss terms for [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]]. No sooner had the [[Second World War]] ended than the [[Chinese Civil War|Civil War]] with the communists, by then led by [[Mao Zedong]], resumed. Chiang's nationalists were mostly defeated in a few decisive battles in 1948.

In 1949 Chiang's government and army [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|retreated to]] [[Formosa|Taiwan]], where Chiang imposed [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] and persecuted critics during the [[White Terror (Taiwan)|White Terror]]. Presiding over a period of [[Land Reform in Taiwan|social reforms]] and [[Taiwan Miracle|economic prosperity]], Chiang won five elections to six-year terms as [[President of the Republic of China]] and was Director-General of the Kuomintang until his death in 1975, three years into his fifth term as President and just one year before Mao's death.

One of the longest-serving non-royal heads of state in the 20th century, Chiang was the [[List of leaders of China|longest-serving non-royal ruler of China]] having held the post for 46 years. Like [[Mao Zedong|Mao]], he is regarded as a controversial figure. Supporters credit him with playing a major part in unifying the nation and leading the Chinese resistance against Japan, as well as with countering [[Soviet Union|Soviet-communist]] encroachment. Detractors and critics denounce him as a dictator at the front of an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regime who suppressed opponents.

==Names==
Like many other Chinese historical figures, Chiang used several names throughout his life. The name inscribed in the [[Chinese kin|genealogical records of his family]] is Chiang Chou-t‘ai ({{zh|t=蔣周泰|hp=Jiǎng Zhōutài|w=Chiang3 Chou1-t‘ai4|c=|s=}}). This so-called &quot;register name&quot; (譜名) is the one under which his extended relatives knew him, and the one he used in formal occasions, such as when he got married. In deference to tradition, family members did not use the [[register name]] in conversation with people outside of the family. The concept of a &quot;real&quot; or original name is/was not as clear-cut in China as it is in the Western world.

In honor of tradition, Chinese families waited a number of years before officially naming their children. In the meantime, they used a &quot;[[milk name]]&quot; ({{Lang|zh|乳名}}), given to the infant shortly after his birth and known only to the close family, thus the actual name that Chiang received at birth was Jiang Ruiyuan ({{zh|t=蔣瑞元|w=''Chiang Jui-yüan''}}).

In 1903, the 16-year-old Chiang went to [[Ningbo]] to be a student, and he chose a &quot;[[school name]]&quot; ({{Lang|zh|學名}}). This was actually the formal name of a person, used by older people to address him, and the one he would use the most in the first decades of his life (as the person grew older, younger generations would have to use one of the [[courtesy name]]s instead). Colloquially, the school name is called &quot;big name&quot; ({{zh|c=大名|labels=no}}), whereas the &quot;milk name&quot; is known as the &quot;small name&quot; ({{zh|c=小名|labels=no}}). The school name that Chiang chose for himself was Zhiqing ({{zh|c=志清|w=Chi-ch‘ing}}, which means &quot;purity of aspirations&quot;). For the next fifteen years or so, Chiang was known as Jiang Zhiqing ([[Wade-Giles]]: Chiang Chi-ch‘ing). This is the name under which [[Sun Yat-sen]] knew him when Chiang joined the republicans in [[Guangzhou|Kwangtung]] in the 1910s.

In 1912, when Jiang Zhiqing was in Japan, he started to use the name Chiang Kai-shek ({{zh|t=蔣介石 |w={{Audio|Zh-Jiang_Jieshi.ogg|''Chiang&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Chieh&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-shih&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''}} |p=Jiǎng Jièshí}}) as a pen name for the articles that he published in a Chinese magazine he founded: ''Voice of the Army'' ({{zh|t=軍聲|labels=no}}). ''Jieshi'' is the [[Pinyin]] romanization of this name, based on [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], but the most recognized romanized rendering is ''Kai-shek'' which is in [[Cantonese]] romanization. As the republicans were based in Canton (a Cantonese speaking area, now commonly known as [[Guangdong]]), Chiang became known by Westerners under the Cantonese romanization of his courtesy name, while the family name as known in English seems to be the Mandarin pronunciation of his Chinese family name, transliterated in [[Wade-Giles]].

&quot;Kai-shek&quot;/&quot;Jieshi&quot; soon became Chiang's [[courtesy name]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|字}}). Some think the name was chosen from the classic Chinese book the ''[[I Ching]]''; {{zh|labels=no|c=&quot;介于石&quot; |l=&quot;[he who is] firm as a rock&quot;}}, is the beginning of line 2 of [[I Ching hexagram 16|Hexagram 16]], &quot;{{linktext|lang=zh|豫}}&quot;. Others note that the first character of his courtesy name is also the first character of the courtesy name of his brother and other male relatives on the same generation line, while the second character of his courtesy name ''shi'' ({{Lang|zh|石}}—meaning &quot;stone&quot;) suggests the second character of his &quot;register name&quot; ''tai'' ({{Lang|zh|泰}}—the famous [[Mount Tai]]). Courtesy names in China often bore a connection with the personal name of the person. As the courtesy name is the name used by people of the same generation to address the person, Chiang soon became known under this new name.

Sometime in 1917 or 1918, as Chiang became close to [[Sun Yat-sen]], he changed his name from Jiang Zhiqing to Chiang Chung-cheng&lt;ref name=&quot;ckspresen&quot;/&gt; ({{zh|t=蔣中正|w=Chiang3 Chung1-cheng4}}). By adopting the name Chung-cheng (&quot;central uprightness&quot;), he was choosing a name very similar to the name of Sun Yat-sen, who was (and still is) known among Chinese as Zhongshan ({{Lang|zh|中山}}—meaning &quot;central mountain&quot;), thus establishing a link between the two. The meaning of uprightness, rectitude, or orthodoxy, implied by his name, also positioned him as the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] heir of Sun Yat-sen and his ideas. It was readily accepted by members of the [[Chinese Nationalist Party]] and is the name under which Chiang Kai-shek is still commonly known in Taiwan. However, the name was often rejected by the Chinese Communists{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}, and is not as well known in [[mainland China]].  Often the name is shortened to &quot;Chung-cheng&quot; only (&quot;Zhongzheng&quot; in [[Pinyin]]). Many public places in Taiwan are named [[Chungcheng]] after Chiang. For many years passengers arriving at the [[Chiang Kai-shek International Airport]] were greeted by signs in Chinese welcoming them to the &quot;Chung Cheng International Airport&quot;. Similarly, the monument erected to Chiang's memory in Taipei, known in English as [[Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall]], was literally named &quot;Chung Cheng Memorial Hall&quot; in Chinese. In Singapore, [[Chung Cheng High School (Main)|Chung Cheng High School]] was named after him.

His name is also written in Taiwan as &quot;The Late President Honorable Chiang&quot; ({{Lang|zh-tw|先總統　蔣公}}), where the one-character-wide space in front of his name known as [[nuo tai]] shows respect. He is often called ''Honorable Chiang'' ({{Lang|zh-tw|蔣公}}) (without the title or space), or his name Chiang Chung-cheng, in Taiwan.&lt;ref name=&quot;ckspresen&quot;/&gt;

{{anchor|Biography|History}}

== Early life ==
Chiang was born in [[Xikou, Fenghua|Xikou]], a town in [[Fenghua]], Zhejiang, about {{convert|30|km|sp=us}} west of central [[Ningbo]]. He was born into a family of [[Wu Chinese-speaking people]] with their [[Ancestral home (China)|ancestral home]]—a concept important in [[Chinese culture|Chinese society]]—in Heqiao ({{lang|zh-hant|和橋鎮}}), a town in [[Yixing]], Jiangsu, about {{convert|38|km|abbr=on|sp=us}} southwest of central [[Wuxi]] and {{convert|10|km|abbr=on|sp=us}} from the shores of [[Lake Tai]]. He was the third child and second son of his father {{ill|Chiang Chao-Tsung|zh|蔣肇聰}} (1842&amp;ndash;1895; {{zh|labels=no|t=蔣肇聰}}) and the first child of his father's third wife {{ill|Wang Tsai-yu|zh|王采玉}} (1863&amp;ndash;1921; {{zh|labels=no|c=王采玉}}) who were members of a prosperous family of salt merchants. Chiang lost his father when he was eight, and he wrote of his mother as the &quot;embodiment of [[Confucianism|Confucian virtues]]&quot;. The young Chiang was inspired throughout his youth by the realisation that the reputation of an honored family rested upon his shoulders. He was a mischievous child, at only three years old he thrust a pair of chopsticks down his throat to see how far they would reach. They became stuck and were removed with great difficulty. Even at a young age he was interested in war, and directed mimic campaigns with a wooden sword and spear. As he grew older, Chiang became more aware of the issues that surrounded him and in his speech to the Kuomintang in 1945 said:

{{quote|As you all know I was an orphan boy in a poor family. Deprived of any protection after the death of her husband, my mother was exposed to the most ruthless exploitation by neighbouring ruffians and the local gentry. The efforts she made in fighting against the intrigues of these family intruders certainly endowed her child, brought up in such environment, with an indomitable spirit to fight for justice. I felt throughout my childhood that mother and I were fighting a helpless lone war. We were alone in a desert, no available or possible assistance could we look forward to. But our determination was never shaken, nor hope abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tong|first1=Hollington K.|title=Chiang Kai-Shek|date=1953|publisher=China Publishing Company|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Education in Japan==
Chiang grew up at a time in which military defeats, natural disasters, famines, revolts, [[Unequal treaty|unequal treaties]] and civil wars had left the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]-dominated [[Qing dynasty]] destabilized and in debt. Successive demands of the [[Western powers]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] since the [[First Opium War|Opium War]] had left China owing millions of [[tael]]s of silver. During his first visits to Japan to pursue a military career in 1906, he describes having strong nationalistic feelings with a desire among other things to, 'expel the Manchu Qing and to restore China'.&lt;ref&gt;http://edizionicafoscari.unive.it/media/pdf/books/978-88-6969-127-0/978-88-6969-127-0-ch-01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He decided to pursue a military career. He began his military training at the [[Baoding Military Academy]] in 1906, the same year Japan left its bimetallic currency standard, devaluing its [[Japanese yen|yen]]. He left for [[Tokyo Shinbu Gakko]], a preparatory school for the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]] intended for Chinese students, in 1907. There, he came under the influence of compatriots to support the revolutionary movement to overthrow the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]-dominated [[Qing dynasty]] and to set up a [[Han Chinese|Han]]-dominated Chinese republic. He befriended [[Chen Qimei]], and in 1908 Chen brought Chiang into the [[Tongmenghui]], an important revolutionary brotherhood of the era. Finishing his military schooling at Tokyo Shinbu Gakko, Chiang served in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] from 1909 to 1911.

==Return to China==
After learning of the [[Wuchang Uprising]], Chiang returned to China in 1911, intending to fight as an artillery officer. He served in the revolutionary forces, leading a regiment in Shanghai under his friend and mentor [[Chen Qimei]], as one of Chen's chief lieutenants. In early 1912 a dispute arose between Chen and [[Tao Chen-chang]], an influential member of the Revolutionary Alliance who opposed both Sun Yat-sen and Chen. Tao sought to avoid escalating the quarrel by hiding in a hospital but Chiang discovered him there. Chen dispatched assassins. Chiang may not have taken part in the act, but would later assume responsibility to help Chen avoid trouble. Chen valued Chiang despite Chiang's already legendary temper, regarding such bellicosity as useful in a military leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor2009p24, 31&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2009|pp= 24, 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang's friendship with Chen Qimei signaled an association with Shanghai's [[Financial crime|criminal syndicate]] (the [[Green Gang]] headed by [[Du Yuesheng]] and [[Huang Jinrong]]). During Chiang's time in Shanghai, the British-administered [[Shanghai International Settlement]] police watched him and charged him with various felonies. These charges never resulted in a trial, and Chiang was never jailed.&lt;ref&gt;Loh 1971, pp. 20, 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang became a founding member of the KMT after the success (February 1912) of the [[Xinhai Revolution|1911 Revolution]]. After the takeover of the Republican government by [[Yuan Shikai]] and the failed [[Second Revolution (China)|Second Revolution]] in 1913, Chiang, like his KMT comrades, divided his time between exile in Japan and the havens of the [[Shanghai International Settlement]]. In Shanghai, Chiang cultivated ties with the city's underworld gangs, which were dominated by the notorious Green Gang and its leader Du Yuesheng. On 18 May 1916, agents of Yuan Shikai assassinated Chen Qimei. Chiang then succeeded Chen as leader of the [[Chinese Revolutionary Party]] in Shanghai. Sun Yat-sen's political career reached its lowest point during this time when most of his old Revolutionary Alliance comrades refused to join him in the exiled Chinese Revolutionary Party.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor2009p25-26&quot;&gt;

== Establishing the Kuomintang's position ==

In 1917 Sun Yat-sen moved his base of operations to [[Guangzhou|Canton]] (now known as Guangzhou), and Chiang joined him in 1918. At this time Sun remained largely sidelined - without arms or money, he was soon expelled from Kwangtung and exiled again to Shanghai. He was restored to Kwangtung with mercenary help in 1920. After his return to Kwangtung, a rift developed between Sun, who sought to militarily unify China under the KMT, and Guangdong Governor [[Chen Jiongming]], who wanted to [[Federalism in China|implement a federalist system]] with Guangdong as a model province. On 16 June 1922 [[Ye Ju]], a general of Chen's whom Sun had attempted to exile, led an assault on [[Guangzhou's Presidential Palace|Kwangtung's Presidential Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Chan |first= Anthony B. |title= Arming the Chinese: The Western Armaments Trade in Warlord China, 1920–1928 |publisher= UBC Press |location= Vancouver |date= 2010 |p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=T6eXCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA106 106]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sun had already fled to the naval yard{{sfnp|Hahn|1955||p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=8VPVCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT42 42]}} and boarded the SS&amp;nbsp;''Haiqi'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Dreyer |first= Edward L. |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YsWOAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |title= China at War, 1901–1941 |publisher= Routledge |location= Abingdon |date= 1995 |p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=YsWOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA104 104]|isbn= 9781317899846 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Soong Ching-ling|his wife]] narrowly evaded [[Mortar (weapon)|shelling]] and rifle-fire as she fled.{{sfnp|Pakula|2009|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZpVntUTZfkC&amp;pg=PA95 95–97]}} They met on the [[SS Zhongshan|SS ''Yongfeng'']], where Chiang joined them as swiftly as he could return from [[Shanghai International Settlement|Shanghai]], where he was ritually mourning his mother's death.&lt;ref name=bdrc&gt;{{citation | title= Biographical Dictionary of Republican China, ''Vol. III'' |at= [https://books.google.com/books?id=KWHREtBHNqYC&amp;pg=PA322 &quot;Chiang Kai-shek&quot;, p. 322] }}.&lt;/ref&gt; For about 50 days,&lt;ref name=soc/&gt; Chiang stayed with Sun, protecting and caring for him and earning his lasting trust.

Sun regained control of Kwangtung in early 1923, again with the help of mercenaries from [[Yunnan]] and of the [[Comintern]]. Undertaking a reform of the KMT, he established a revolutionary government aimed at unifying China under the KMT. That same year Sun sent Chiang to spend three months in Moscow studying the Soviet [[Politics of the Soviet Union|political]] and military system. During his trip in Russia, Chiang met [[Leon Trotsky]] and other Soviet leaders, but quickly came to the conclusion that the Russian model of government was not suitable for China. Chiang later sent his eldest son, Ching-kuo, to study in Russia. After his father's split from the [[First United Front]] in 1927, Ching-kuo was forced{{by whom|date=May 2019}} to stay there, as a hostage, until 1937. Chiang wrote in his diary, &quot;It is not worth it to sacrifice the interest of the country for the sake of my son.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_5R2fnVZXiwC&amp;pg=PA59 |title= The Generalissimo's son: Chiang Ching-kuo and the revolutions in China and Taiwan |author= Jay Taylor |year= 2000 |publisher= Harvard University Press | page = 59 | isbn = 0-674-00287-3 |accessdate= 28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YkREps9oGR4C&amp;pg=PA205 |title= Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost | first = Jonathan | last = Fenby |year= 2005 | publisher = Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers |page= 205 |isbn = 0-7867-1484-0 | accessdate = 28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiang even refused to negotiate a prisoner swap for his son in exchange for the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZpVntUTZfkC&amp;pg=PA247 | title = The last empress: Madame Chiang Kai-shek and the birth of modern China | first = Hannah | last = Pakula |year= 2009 |publisher= Simon and Schuster |page= 247|isbn= 978-1-4391-4893-8 |accessdate= 28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His attitude remained consistent, and he continued to maintain, by 1937, that &quot;I would rather have no offspring than sacrifice our nation's interests.&quot; Chiang had absolutely no intention of ceasing the war against the Communists.&lt;ref&gt;

Chiang Kai-shek returned to Kwangtung and in 1924 Sun appointed him [[Commandant]] of the [[Whampoa Military Academy]]. Chiang resigned from the office after one month in disagreement with Sun's extremely close cooperation with the Comintern, but returned at Sun's demand. The early years at Whampoa allowed Chiang to cultivate a cadre of young officers loyal both to the KMT and to himself.

Throughout his rise to power, Chiang also benefited from membership within the nationalist [[Tiandihui]] fraternity, to which Sun Yat-sen also belonged, and which remained a source of support during his leadership of the Kuomintang.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McIsaac|first=Lee|date=December 2000|title=&quot;Righteous Fraternities&quot; and Honorable Men: Sworn Brotherhoods in Wartime Chongqing|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/2652035?origin=crossref|journal=American Historical Review|volume=105|issue=5|pages=1641–1655|doi=10.2307/2652035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contest ensued among [[Wang Jingwei]], [[Liao Zhongkai]], and [[Hu Hanmin]]. In August, Liao was assassinated and Hu arrested for his connections to the murderers. Wang Jingwei, who had succeeded Sun as chairman of the Kwangtung regime, seemed ascendant but was forced into exile by Chiang following the [[Canton Coup]]. The {{nowrap|SS ''Yongfeng''}}, renamed the [[SS Zhongshan|''Zhongshan'']] in Sun's honor, had appeared off [[Changzhou Island|Changzhou]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Van de Ven |first=Hans |date=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC |title=War and Nationalism in China: 1925–1945 |series=Studies in the Modern History of Asia |publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |location=London |isbn=978-0415145718 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC&amp;pg=PA101 101] }}.&lt;/ref&gt;—the location of the [[Whampoa Military Academy|Whampoa Academy]]—on apparently falsified orders{{sfnp|Van de Ven|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC&amp;pg=PA103 103]}} and amid a series of unusual phone calls trying to ascertain Chiang's location.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Ah Xiang |contribution-url=http://www.republicanchina.org/Zhongshan-Warship-Incident.pdf |contribution=The ''Zhongshan'' Warship Incident |title=Tragedy of Chinese Revolution |date=1998 |p=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially considered fleeing Kwangtung and even booked passage on a Japanese steamer, but then decided to use his military connections to declare martial law on 20 March 1926, and crack down on Communist and Soviet influence over the [[National Revolutionary Army|NRA]], the military academy, and the party.{{sfnp|Van de Ven|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC&amp;pg=PA103 103]}} The right wing of the party supported him and [[Stalin]]—anxious to maintain Soviet influence in the area—had his lieutenants agree to Chiang's demands{{sfnp|Ah Xiang|1998|p=3}} regarding a reduced Communist presence in the KMT leadership in exchange for certain other concessions.{{sfnp|Van de Ven|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC&amp;pg=PA103 103]}} The rapid replacement of leadership enabled Chiang to effectively end civilian oversight of the military after 15 May, though his authority was somewhat limited{{sfnp|Ah Xiang|1998|p=3}} by the army's own regional composition and divided loyalties. On 5 June 1926, he was named [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[National Revolutionary Army]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor2009p57&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2009|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, on 27 July, he finally launched Sun's long-delayed [[Northern Expedition]], aimed at conquering the northern warlords and bringing China together under the KMT.

The NRA branched into three divisions: to the west was the returned Wang Jingwei, who led a column to take [[Wuhan]]; [[Bai Chongxi]]'s column went east to take Shanghai; Chiang himself led in the middle route, planning to take [[Nanjing]] before pressing ahead to capture Beijing. However, in January 1927, Wang Jingwei and his KMT leftist allies took the city of Wuhan amid much popular mobilization and fanfare. Allied with a number of [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]] and advised by Soviet agent [[Mikhail Borodin]], Wang declared the National Government as having moved to Wuhan. Having taken Nanjing in March (and briefly visited Shanghai, now under the control of his close ally Bai Chongxi), Chiang halted his campaign and prepared a violent break with Wang's leftist elements, which he believed threatened his control of the KMT.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Now with an established national government in Nanjing, and supported by conservative allies including [[Hu Hanmin]], Chiang's expulsion of the Communists and their Soviet advisers led to the beginning of the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Wang Jingwei's National Government was weak militarily, and was soon ended by Chiang with the support of a local warlord ([[Li Zongren]] of [[Guangxi]]). Eventually, Wang and his leftist party surrendered to Chiang and joined him in Nanjing. In the [[Central Plains War]], Beijing was taken on June 1928, from an alliance of the warlords [[Feng Yuxiang]] and [[Yan Xishan]]. In December, the [[Manchuria]]n warlord [[Zhang Xueliang]] pledged allegiance to Chiang's government, completing Chiang's nominal unification of China and ending the [[Warlord Era]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

In 1927, when he was setting up the Nationalist government in Nanjing, he was preoccupied with &quot;the elevation of our leader Dr. Sun Yat-sen to the rank of 'Father of our Chinese Republic'. Dr. Sun worked for 40 years to lead our people in the Nationalist cause, and we cannot allow any other personality to usurp this honored position&quot;. He asked [[Chen Guofu]] to purchase a photograph that had been taken in Japan around 1895 or 1898. It showed members of the Revive China Society with [[Yeung Kui-wan]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|楊衢雲}} or {{lang|zh-Hans|杨衢云}}, [[pinyin]] Yáng Qúyún) as President, in the place of honor, and Sun, as secretary, on the back row, along with members of the Japanese Chapter of the Revive China Society. When told that it was not for sale, Chiang offered a million dollars to recover the photo and its negative. &quot;The party must have this picture and the negative at any price. They must be destroyed as soon as possible. It would be embarrassing to have our Father of the Chinese Republic shown in a subordinate position&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;'&quot;Chiang Kai-Shek's Secret Past: The Memoir of His Second Wife, Ch'en Chieh-ju&quot; by Ch'en Chieh-ju and George Chan, ed. by Lloyd E. Eastman, Westview Press, Boulder, 1993, pp. 248–249.&lt;/ref&gt; Chiang never obtained either the photo or its negative.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Chiang made great efforts to gain recognition as the official successor of Sun Yat-sen. In a pairing of great political significance, Chiang was Sun's brother-in-law: he had married [[Soong Mei-ling]], the younger sister of [[Soong Ching-ling]], Sun's widow, on 1 December 1927. Originally rebuffed in the early 1920s, Chiang managed to ingratiate himself to some degree with Soong Mei-ling's mother by first divorcing his wife and concubines and promising to sincerely study the precepts of Christianity. He read the copy of the Bible that May-ling had given him twice before making up his mind to become a Christian, and three years after his marriage he was baptized in the Soong's [[Methodist]] church. Although some observers felt that he adopted Christianity as a political move, studies of his recently opened diaries suggest that his faith was strong and sincere and that he felt that Christianity reinforced Confucian moral teachings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor2009p91&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2009|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon reaching Beijing, Chiang paid homage to Sun Yat-sen and had his body moved to the new capital of Nanjing to be enshrined in a [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum|grand mausoleum]].

On 12 April 1927, Chiang carried out [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|a purge]] of thousands of suspected Communists and dissidents in Shanghai, and began large-scale massacres across the country collectively known as the [[White Terror (mainland China)|&quot;White Terror&quot;]].

Having gained control of China, Chiang's party remained surrounded by &quot;surrendered&quot; warlords who remained relatively autonomous within their own regions. On 10 October 1928, Chiang was named director of the State Council, the equivalent to President of the country, in addition to his other titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2009|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with his predecessor Sun Yat-sen, the Western media dubbed him &quot;[[Generalissimo]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor2009p57&quot;/&gt;

According to [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s plans, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) was to rebuild China in three steps: [[Martial law|military rule]], political tutelage, and constitutional rule. The ultimate goal of the KMT revolution was democracy, which was not considered to be feasible in China's fragmented state. Since the KMT had completed the first step of revolution through seizure of power in 1928, Chiang's rule thus began a period of what his party considered to be &quot;political tutelage&quot; in Sun Yat-sen's name. During this so-called Republican Era, many features of a modern, functional Chinese state emerged and developed.

From 1928 to 1937, a time period known as the [[Nanjing decade]], some aspects of foreign [[imperialism]], [[Concessions in China|concessions]] and privileges{{clarify|date=August 2018}} in China were moderated through diplomacy. The government acted to modernize the legal and penal systems, attempted to stabilize prices, amortize debts, reform the banking and currency systems, build railroads and highways, improve [[public health]] facilities, legislate against traffic in [[narcotic]]s, and augment industrial and agricultural production. Not all of these projects were successfully completed. Efforts were made towards improving education standards, and in an effort to unify Chinese society, the [[New Life Movement]] was launched to encourage [[Confucianism|Confucian]] moral values and personal discipline. ''[[Standard Chinese|Guoyu]]'' (&quot;national language&quot;) was promoted as a [[Official language|standard tongue]], and the establishment of communications facilities (including radio) were used to encourage a sense of [[Chinese nationalism]] in a way that was not possible when the nation lacked an effective central government.

Any successes that the Nationalists did make, however, were met with constant political and military upheavals. While much of the urban areas were now under the control of the KMT, much of the countryside remained under the influence of weakened yet undefeated [[warlord]]s and Communists. Chiang often resolved issues of warlord obstinacy through military action, but such action was costly in terms of men and material. The 1930 [[Central Plains War]] alone nearly bankrupted the Nationalist government and caused almost {{formatnum:250000}} casualties on both sides. In 1931, [[Hu Hanmin]], Chiang's old supporter, publicly voiced a popular concern that Chiang's position as both premier and president flew in the face of the democratic ideals of the Nationalist government. Chiang had Hu put under [[house arrest]], but he was released after national condemnation, after which he left Nanjing and supported a rival government in [[Guanzhou|Canton]]. The split resulted in a military conflict between Hu's Kwangtung government and Chiang's Nationalist government. Chiang only won the campaign against Hu after a shift in allegiance by [[Zhang Xueliang]], who had previously supported Hu Hanmin.

Throughout his rule, complete eradication of the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] remained Chiang's dream. After assembling his forces in [[Jiangxi]], Chiang led his armies against the newly established [[Chinese Soviet Republic]]. With help from foreign military advisers, Chiang's [[Fifth Encirclement Campaign against Jiangxi Soviet|Fifth Campaign]] finally surrounded the [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese Red Army]] in 1934. The Communists, tipped off that a Nationalist offensive was imminent, retreated in the [[Long March]], during which [[Mao Zedong]] rose from a mere military official to the most influential leader of the Communist Party of China.

Chiang, as a [[Chinese nationalism|nationalist]] and a Confucianist, was against the [[iconoclasm]] of the [[May Fourth Movement]]. Motivated by his sense of nationalism, he viewed some [[Western culture|Western ideas]] as foreign, and he believed that the great introduction of Western ideas and [[Western literature|literature]] that the [[May Fourth Movement]] promoted was not beneficial to China. He and Dr. Sun criticized the May Fourth intellectuals as corrupting the morals of China's youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Dc4UAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA13 |title=The May Fourth Movement in Shanghai: The Making of a Social Movement in Modern China |author=Joseph T.

Contrary to [[Propaganda in China|Communist propaganda]] that he was [[Capitalism|pro-capitalism]], Chiang antagonized the capitalists of Shanghai, often attacking them and confiscating their capital and assets for the use of the government.

Chiang has often been interpreted as being pro-capitalist, but this conclusion may be problematic. Shanghai capitalists did briefly support him out of fear of communism in 1927, but this support eroded in 1928 when Chiang turned his tactics of intimidation on them. The relationship between Chiang Kai-shek and Chinese capitalists remained poor throughout the period of his administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;capitalists&quot; /&gt; Chiang blocked Chinese capitalists from gaining any political power or voice within his regime. Once Chiang Kai-shek was done with his [[White Terror (mainland China)|White Terror]] on pro-communist laborers, he proceeded to turn on the capitalists. [[Green Gang|Gangster connections]] allowed Chiang to attack them in the International Settlement, successfully forcing capitalists to back him up with their assets for his military expeditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;capitalists&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9nJF_19fnZ4C&amp;pg=PA264 |title=The Shanghai capitalists and the Nationalist government, 1927–1937|author=Parks M.

===Mass deaths under Nationalist rule===
Some sources attribute Chiang Kai-shek with responsibility for millions of deaths&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saddam Hussein, Hitler, Stalin, Mao, &amp; More: 13 Deadliest Dictators (Photos)|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/saddam-hussein-hitler-stalin-mao-and-more-13-deadliest-dictators-photos|newspaper=Daily Beast|date=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History's greatest monsters|url=http://jjmccullough.com/monsters.htm|website=Adult Learn}}&lt;/ref&gt; in scattered mass death events caused by the [[Nationalist Government]] of China.

Regardless, the Nationalist government of China has been accused of mass killings by Rummel, he alleged that the Nationalist government of China was responsible for based on various claims between 6 and 18.5 million deaths.
He attributes this death toll to a few major causes, for example:&lt;ref name=Rummel&gt;{{cite web|last1=R.J.Rummel|title=CHINA'S BLOODY CENTURY|url=https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/CHINA.CHAP1.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First phase of the Chinese Civil War===

In [[Nanjing]], on April 1931, Chiang Kai-shek attended a national leadership conference with [[Zhang Xueliang]] and General [[Ma Fuxiang]], in which Chiang and Zhang dauntlessly upheld that Manchuria was part of China in the face of the Japanese invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Generalissimo: Chiang Kai-shek and the Struggle for Modern China|first=Jay|last=Taylor|volume=|edition=illustrated|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=03catqbPCmgC&amp;pg=PA93 |page=93 |isbn=978-0674033382 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] in 1931, Chiang resigned as Chairman of the National Government. He returned shortly afterwards, adopting the slogan &quot;first internal pacification, then external resistance&quot;. However, this policy of avoiding a frontal war against the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] was widely unpopular. In 1932, while Chiang was seeking first to defeat the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]], Japan launched an [[January 28 Incident|advance]] on Shanghai and bombarded [[Nanjing]]. This disrupted Chiang's [[Chinese Civil War|offensives against the Communists]] for a time, although it was the northern factions of [[Hu Hanmin]]'s [[Guangzhou|Kwangtung]] government (notably the [[19th Route Army]]) that primarily led the offensive against the Japanese during this skirmish. Brought into the [[National Revolutionary Army|Nationalist army]] immediately after the battle, the 19th Route Army's career under Chiang would be cut short after it was disbanded for demonstrating socialist tendencies.

In December 1936, Chiang flew to [[Xi'an]] to coordinate a major assault on the [[Red Army (China)|Red Army]] and the Communist Republic that had retreated into [[Yan'an]]. However, Chiang's allied commander [[Zhang Xueliang]], whose forces were used in his attack and whose homeland of [[Manchuria]] had been recently invaded by the Japanese, did not support the attack on the Communists. On 12 December, Zhang and several other Nationalist generals headed by Yang Hucheng of Shaanxi kidnapped Chiang for two weeks in what is known as the [[Xi'an Incident]]. They forced Chiang into making a &quot;[[Second United Front]]&quot; with the Communists against Japan. After releasing Chiang and returning to Nanjing with him, Zhang was placed under house arrest and the generals who had assisted him were executed. Chiang's commitment to the Second United Front was nominal at best, and it was all but broken up in 1941.

===Second Sino-Japanese War===
[[File:Liangyou 131 cover - Chiang Kai-shek.jpg|thumb|upright|After the breakout of the Second Sino-Japanese War, ''[[The Young Companion]]'' featured Chiang on its cover.]]

The [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] broke out in July 1937, and in August of that year Chiang sent {{formatnum:600000}} of his best-trained and equipped soldiers to [[Battle of Shanghai|defend Shanghai]]. With over 200,000 Chinese casualties, Chiang lost the political cream of his [[Whampoa Military Academy|Whampoa]]-trained officers. Although Chiang lost militarily, the battle dispelled Japanese claims that it could conquer China in three months and demonstrated to the Western powers that the Chinese would continue the fight. By December, the capital city of Nanjing had fallen to the Japanese resulting in the [[Nanking Massacre]]. Chiang moved the government inland, first to [[Wuhan]] and later to [[Chongqing]].

Having lost most of China's economic and industrial centers, Chiang withdrew into the hinterlands, stretching the Japanese [[Military supply-chain management|supply lines]] and bogging down Japanese soldiers in the vast Chinese interior. As part of a policy of protracted resistance, Chiang authorized the use of [[Scorched earth#Second Sino-Japanese War|scorched earth]] tactics, resulting in many civilian deaths. During the Nationalists' retreat from [[Zhengzhou]], the dams around the city were deliberately destroyed by the [[National Revolutionary Army|Nationalist army]] in order to delay the Japanese advance, killing 500,000 people in the subsequent [[1938 Yellow River flood]].

After heavy fighting, the Japanese occupied [[Wuhan]] in the fall of 1938 and the Nationalists retreated farther inland, to Chongqing. While en route to Chongqing, the Nationalist army intentionally started the [[1938 Changsha Fire|&quot;fire of Changsha&quot;]], as a part of the scorched earth policy. The fire destroyed much of the city, killed twenty thousand civilians, and left hundreds of thousands of people [[Homelessness|homeless]]. Due to an organizational error (it was claimed), the fire was begun without any warning to the residents of the city. The Nationalists eventually blamed three local commanders for the fire and executed them. Newspapers across China blamed the fire on (non-KMT) arsonists, but the blaze contributed to a nationwide loss of support for the KMT.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin, Barbara and Yu Changgen.

In 1939 [[Islam in China|Muslim]] leaders [[Isa Yusuf Alptekin]] and Ma Fuliang were sent by Chiang to several Middle Eastern countries, including [[Egypt]], [[Turkey]], and [[Syria]], to gain support for the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Chinese War against Japan]], and to express his support for Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rsLQdBUgyMUC |title=Modern China's Ethnic Frontiers: A Journey to the West|author=Hsiao-ting Lin|year=2010|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn = 978-0-415-58264-3 |page=90|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese, controlling the [[Puppet state|puppet-state]] of [[Manchukuo]] and much of China's eastern seaboard, appointed [[Wang Jingwei]] as a [[Quisling]]-ruler of the occupied Chinese territories around Nanjing. Wang named himself President of the [[Executive Yuan]] and Chairman of the [[Wang Jingwei regime|National Government]] (not the same 'National Government' as Chiang's), and led a surprisingly large{{Quantify|date=May 2010}} minority of anti-Chiang/anti-Communist Chinese against his old comrades. He died in 1944, within a year of the end of World War II.

The Hui Muslim [[Xidaotang]] sect pledged allegiance to the Kuomintang after their rise to power and Hui Muslim General [[Bai Chongxi]] acquainted Chiang Kaishek with the Xidaotang jiaozhu Ma Mingren in 1941 in [[Chongqing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lipman1998 1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Neaman Lipman|title=Familiar strangers: a history of Muslims in Northwest China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y8Nzux7z6KAC&amp;pg=PA197|date=1 July 1998|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=978-0-295-80055-4|pages=197–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942 Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek went on tour in northwestern China in [[Xinjiang]], Gansu, [[Ningxia]], Shaanxi, and [[Qinghai]], where he met both Muslim Generals [[Ma Buqing]] and [[Ma Bufang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CHINA: He Who Has Reason|newspaper=TIME|date=5 Oct 1942|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,773741,00.html|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also met the Muslim Generals [[Ma Hongbin]] and [[Ma Hongkui]] separately.

With the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the opening of the [[Pacific War]], China became one of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]]. During and after World War II, Chiang and his American-educated wife [[Soong Mei-ling]], known in the United States as &quot;Madame Chiang&quot;, held the support of the [[China Lobby]] in the United States, which saw in them the hope of a Christian and democratic China. Chiang was even named the Supreme Commander of Allied forces in the China war zone. He was appointed [[Order of the Bath|Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]] in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,777742,00.html?promoid=googlep | work=Time | title=BATTLE OF ASIA: Land of Three Rivers | date=4 May 1942 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General [[Joseph Stilwell]], an American [[Military advisor|military adviser]] to Chiang during World War II, strongly criticized Chiang and his generals for what he saw as their incompetence and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Romanus and Sunderland, Stilwell's Command Problem, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, the [[United States Army Air Corps]] commenced [[Operation Matterhorn]] in order to bomb Japan's steel industry from bases to be constructed in mainland China. This was meant to fulfill President Roosevelt's promise to Chiang Kai-shek to begin bombing operations against Japan by November 1944. However, Chiang Kai-shek's subordinates refused to take airbase construction seriously until enough capital had been delivered to permit embezzlement on a massive scale. Stilwell estimated that at least half of the $100&amp;nbsp;million spent on construction of airbases was embezzled by Nationalist party officials.&lt;ref name=&quot;wings11&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=True Airpower|series=Wings: Clash of Wings|network=[[Discovery Channel]]|number=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang played the Soviets and Americans against each other during the war. He first told the Americans that they would be welcome in talks between the Soviet Union and China, then secretly told the Soviets that the Americans were unimportant and that their opinions would not be considered. Chiang also used American support and military power in China against the ambitions of the Soviet Union to dominate the talks, stopping the Soviets from taking full advantage of the situation in China with the threat of American military action against the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url  =https://books.google.com/books?id=x8b4an0T0twC&amp;pg=PA255 |title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost |author=Jonathan Fenby |year=2005|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers |page=256 |isbn = 0-7867-1484-0 |accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== French Indochina ===
U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], through General Stilwell, privately made it clear that they preferred that the French not reacquire [[French Indochina]] (modern day [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]]) after the war was over. Roosevelt offered Chiang control of all of [[Mainland Southeast Asia|Indochina]]. It was said that Chiang replied: &quot;Under no circumstances!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v5YlBtzklvQC&amp;pg=PA235|title=The march of folly: from Troy to Vietnam |author=Barbara Wertheim Tuchman|year=1985|publisher=Random House, Inc.|page=235 |isbn =0-345-30823-9 |accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, 200,000 Chinese troops under General [[Lu Han (general)|Lu Han]] were sent by Chiang Kai-shek to northern Indochina (north of the 16th parallel) to accept the surrender of Japanese occupying forces there, and remained in Indochina until 1946, when the French returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iF3MG43x--0C&amp;pg=PA30 |title=America's war in Vietnam: a short narrative history |author=Larry H.

In February 1946 he also forced the French to surrender all of their concessions in China and to renounce their extraterritorial privileges in exchange for the Chinese withdrawing from northern Indochina and allowing French troops to reoccupy the region.

===Ryukyus===
During the [[Cairo Conference]] in 1943, Chiang said that Roosevelt asked him whether China would like to claim the [[Ryukyu Islands]] from Japan in addition to retaking Taiwan, the [[Penghu|Pescadores]], and [[Manchuria]]. Chiang claims that he said he was in favor of an international presence on the islands.&lt;ref&gt;''Foreign Relations of the United State: The Conferences at Cairo and Tehran, 1943'' [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?id=FRUS.FRUS1943CairoTehran p. 324] &quot;Chinese Summary Record&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the U.S. became the sole protector of the Ryukyus in 1945, and reverted it to the Japanese in 1972 while securing US military presence there.

====Treatment and use of Japanese soldiers====
[[File:Chiang Kai Shek and wife with Lieutenant General Stilwell.jpg|thumb|Chiang and his wife [[Soong Mei-ling]] sharing a laugh with [[Joseph Stilwell|U.S. Lieutenant General Joseph W. Stilwell]], [[Burma]], April 1942]]

In 1945, when [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|Japan surrendered]], Chiang's [[Chongqing]] government was ill-equipped and ill-prepared to reassert its authority in formerly [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese-occupied China]], and it asked the Japanese to postpone their surrender until Kuomintang (KMT) authority could arrive to take over. American troops and weapons soon bolstered KMT forces, allowing them to reclaim cities. The countryside, however, remained largely under Communist control.

For over a year after the Japanese surrender, rumors circulated throughout China that the Japanese had entered into a secret agreement with Chiang, in which the Japanese would assist the Nationalists in fighting the Communists in exchange for the protection of Japanese persons and property there. Many top nationalist generals, including Chiang, had studied and trained in Japan before the Nationalists had returned to the mainland in the 1920s, and maintained close personal friendships with top Japanese officers. The Japanese general in charge of all forces in China, General [[Yasuji Okamura]], had personally trained officers who later became generals in Chiang's staff. Reportedly, General Okamura, before surrendering command of all Japanese military forces in Nanjing, offered Chiang control of all 1.5&amp;nbsp;million Japanese military and civilian support staff then present in China. Reportedly, Chiang seriously considered accepting this offer, but declined only in the knowledge that the United States would certainly be outraged by the gesture. Even so, armed Japanese troops remained in China well into 1947, with some noncommissioned officers finding their way into the Nationalist officer corps.&lt;ref&gt;Gillin, Donald G. and Etter, Charles. &quot;Staying On: Japanese Soldiers and Civilians in China, 1945–1949.&quot; ''The Journal of Asian Studies''.

==== Conditions during the Chinese Civil War ====
[[File:重慶會談 蔣介石與毛澤東.jpg|thumb|Chiang Kai-shek and [[Mao Zedong]] in 1945]]
[[Odd Arne Westad|Westad]] says the Communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-Shek, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China. Furthermore, his party was weakened in the war against Japan. Meanwhile, the Communists told different groups, such as peasants, exactly what they wanted to hear, and cloaked themselves in the cover of Chinese Nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Odd Arne Westad, ''Restless Empire: China and the World Since 1750'' (2012) p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the war, the United States encouraged peace talks between Chiang and Communist leader Mao Zedong in Chongqing. Due to concerns about widespread and well-documented corruption in Chiang's government throughout his rule, the U.S. government limited aid to Chiang for much of the period of 1946 to 1948, in the midst of fighting against the [[People's Liberation Army]] led by [[Mao Zedong]]. Alleged infiltration of the U.S. government by Chinese Communist agents may have also played a role in the suspension of American aid.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, John Earl; Harvey Klehr, ''Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America'', New Haven: Yale University Press (2000), {{ISBN|0-300-08462-5}}, pp. 142–145&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Chiang had achieved status abroad as a world leader, his government deteriorated as the result of corruption and inflation. In his diary on June 1948, Chiang wrote that the KMT had failed, not because of external enemies but because of rot from within.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.hoover.org/research/chiang-kai-shek-and-struggle-china |title=HOOVER ARCHIVES: Chiang Kai-shek and the Struggle for China |last=Bethell |first=Tom |year=2007 |website=hoover.org |publisher=The Hoover Institution |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070730081935/http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/6731746.html
|archivedate=30 July 2007 |url-status=live |accessdate=7 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The war had severely weakened the Nationalists, while the Communists were strengthened by their popular land-reform policies,&lt;ref&gt;Ray Huang, cong dalishi jiaodu du Jiang Jieshi riji (Reading Chiang Kai-shek's dairy from a macro-history perspective), Chinatimes Publishing Press, Taipei, 1994, pp. 441–43&lt;/ref&gt; and by a rural population that supported and trusted them. The Nationalists initially had superiority in arms and men, but their lack of popularity, infiltration by Communist agents, low morale, and disorganization soon allowed the Communists to gain the upper hand in the civil war.

==== Competition with Li Zongren ====
A new [[Constitution of the Republic of China|Constitution]] was promulgated in 1947, and Chiang was elected by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] as the first term [[President of the Republic of China]] on 20 May 1948. This marked the beginning of what was termed the &quot;democratic constitutional government&quot; period by the KMT political orthodoxy, but the Communists refused to recognize the new Constitution, and its government, as legitimate. Chiang resigned as President on 21 January 1949, as KMT forces suffered terrible losses and defections to the Communists. After Chiang's resignation the vice-president of the ROC, [[Li Zongren]], became China's acting president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|script-title=zh:蔣中正日記與民國史研究|trans-title=Chiang Kai-Shek's Diaries and the Study of Republican Chinese History|language=zh-tw|date=April 2011|location=Taipei|volume=2|editor=Fang-shang Lu {{lang|zh-tw|呂芳上}}|publisher=世界大同出版有限公司|page=615|quote={{lang|zh-tw|1949年1月21日，蔣介石正式宣佈辭去中華民國總統職位，由副總統李宗仁代行總統職權。}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after Chiang's resignation the Communists halted their advances and attempted to negotiate the virtual surrender of the ROC. Li attempted to negotiate milder terms that would have ended the civil war, but without success. When it became clear that Li was unlikely to accept Mao's terms, the Communists issued an ultimatum in April 1949, warning that they would resume their attacks if Li did not agree within five days. Li refused.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Jonathan D. ''The Search for Modern China'', W.W. Norton and Company. 1999. {{ISBN|0-393-97351-4}}. p. 486&lt;/ref&gt;

Li's attempts to carry out his policies faced varying degrees of opposition from Chiang's supporters, and were generally unsuccessful. Chiang especially antagonized Li by taking possession of (and moving to Taiwan) US$200&amp;nbsp;million of gold and US dollars belonging to the central government that Li desperately needed to cover the government's soaring expenses. When the Communists captured the Nationalist capital of Nanjing in April 1949, Li refused to accompany the central government as it fled to [[Guangdong]], instead expressing his dissatisfaction with Chiang by retiring to Guangxi.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillin289&quot;&gt;Gillin, Donald G.  ''Warlord: Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi Province 1911–1949''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. 1967. p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Korea Dignitaries.jpg|thumb|250px|Chiang with South Korean President [[Syngman Rhee]] in 1949]]
The former warlord [[Yan Xishan]], who had fled to Nanjing only one month before, quickly insinuated himself within the Li-Chiang rivalry, attempting to have Li and Chiang reconcile their differences in the effort to resist the Communists. At Chiang's request Yan visited Li in order to convince Li not to withdraw from public life. Yan broke down in tears while talking of the loss of his home province of Shanxi to the Communists, and warned Li that the Nationalist cause was doomed unless Li went to Guangdong. Li agreed to return under the condition that Chiang surrender most of the gold and US dollars in his possession that belonged to the central government, and that Chiang stop overriding Li's authority. After Yan communicated these demands and Chiang agreed to comply with them, Li departed for Guangdong.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillin289&quot; /&gt;

In Guangdong, Li attempted to create a new government composed of both Chiang supporters and those opposed to Chiang. Li's first choice of premier was Chu Cheng, a veteran member of the Kuomintang who had been virtually driven into exile due to his strong opposition to Chiang. After the Legislative Yuan rejected Chu, Li was obliged to choose Yan Xishan instead. By this time Yan was well known for his adaptability and Chiang welcomed his appointment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillin289&quot; /&gt;

Conflict between Chiang and Li persisted. Although he had agreed to do so as a prerequisite of Li's return, Chiang refused to surrender more than a fraction of the wealth that he had sent to Taiwan. Without being backed by gold or foreign currency, the money issued by Li and Yan quickly declined in value until it became virtually worthless.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillin290&quot;&gt;Gillin, Donald G.  ''Warlord: Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi Province 1911–1949''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. 1967. p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he did not hold a formal executive position in the government, Chiang continued to issue orders to the army, and many officers continued to obey Chiang rather than Li. The inability of Li to coordinate KMT military forces led him to put into effect a plan of defense that he had contemplated in 1948. Instead of attempting to defend all of southern China, Li ordered what remained of the Nationalist armies to withdraw to Guangxi and Guangdong, hoping that he could concentrate all available defenses on this smaller, and more easily defensible, area. The object of Li's strategy was to maintain a foothold on the Chinese mainland in the hope that the United States would eventually be compelled to enter the war in China on the Nationalist side.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillin290&quot; /&gt;

==== Final Communist advance ====
[[File:Guèrra Civila Chinesa (1946-1950).png|thumb|Map of the [[Chinese Civil War]] (1946–1950)]]
Chiang opposed Li's plan of defense because it would have placed most of the troops still loyal to Chiang under the control of Li and Chiang's other opponents in the central government. To overcome Chiang's intransigence Li began ousting Chiang's supporters within the central government. Yan Xishan continued in his attempts to work with both sides, creating the impression among Li's supporters that he was a &quot;stooge&quot; of Chiang, while those who supported Chiang began to bitterly resent Yan for his willingness to work with Li. Because of the rivalry between Chiang and Li, Chiang refused to allow Nationalist troops loyal to him to aid in the defense of Kwangsi and Canton, with the result that Communist forces occupied Canton in October 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Gillin, Donald G. ''Warlord: Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi Province 1911–1949''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. 1967. p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

After Canton fell to the Communists, Chiang relocated the government to [[Chongqing|Chungking]], while Li effectively surrendered his powers and flew to New York for treatment of his chronic [[duodenum]] illness at the Hospital of [[Columbia University]]. Li visited the President of the United States, [[Harry S. Truman]], and denounced Chiang as a dictator and an usurper. Li vowed that he would &quot;return to crush&quot; Chiang once he returned to China. Li remained in exile, and did not return to Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;CHINA: Return of the Gimo&quot;.

In the early morning of 10 December 1949, Communist troops laid siege to [[Chengdu|Chengtu]], the last KMT-controlled city in mainland China, where Chiang Kai-shek and his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] directed the defense at the Chengtu Central Military Academy. Chiang Kai-shek, father and son, were evacuated to Taiwan on an aircraft called ''May-ling'' and arrived the same day. Chiang Kai-shek would never return to the mainland.

Chiang did not re-assume the presidency until 1 March 1950. On January 1952, Chiang commanded the [[Control Yuan]], now in Taiwan, to impeach Li in the &quot;Case of Li Zongren's Failure to carry out Duties due to Illegal Conduct&quot; (李宗仁違法失職案). Chiang relieved Li of the position as vice-president in the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] in March 1954.

==== Preparations to retake the mainland ====
Chiang moved the government to [[Taipei]], Taiwan, where he resumed his duties as [[President of the Republic of China]] on 1 March 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/2001/appendix1-1.htm#1950 ROC Chronology: Jan 1911&amp;nbsp;– Dec 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Chiang was reelected by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] to be the President of the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) on 20 May 1954, and again in 1960, 1966, and 1972. He continued to claim sovereignty over all of China, including the territories held by his government and the [[People's Republic of China|People's Republic]], as well as territory the latter ceded to foreign governments, such as [[Tuva]] and [[Outer Mongolia]]. In the context of the [[Cold War]], most of the Western world recognized this position and the ROC represented China [[China and the United Nations|in the United Nations]] and other international organizations until the 1970s.

[[File:蔣介石 岸信介 宋美齡.jpg|thumb|Chiang with Japanese politician [[Nobusuke Kishi]], in 1957]]
During his presidency on Taiwan, Chiang continued making preparations in order to take back mainland China. He developed the ROC army in order to prepare for an invasion of the mainland, and to defend Taiwan in case of an attack by the Communist forces. He also financed armed groups in mainland China, such as Muslim soldiers of the ROC Army left in Yunnan under [[Li Mi (ROC general)|Li Mi]], who continued to fight. It was not until the 1980s that these troops were finally airlifted to Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/2002/chpt25-7.htm |title = Muslims in Taiwan |publisher = Government Information Office (ROC) |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070113214755/http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/2002/chpt25-7.htm |archivedate = 13 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He promoted the Uyghur [[Yulbars Khan]] to Governor during the [[Kuomintang Islamic Insurgency in China (1950–1958)|Islamic insurgency on the mainland]] for resisting the Communists, even though the government had already evacuated to Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IAs9AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=yulbars%20calcutta%20%20taiwan |title=Warlords and Muslims in Chinese Central Asia: a political history of Republican Sinkiang 1911–1949 |author=Andrew D.

==== Regime ====
Despite the democratic constitution, the government under Chiang was a [[one-party state]], consisting almost completely of [[Mainland Chinese|mainlanders]]; the &quot;[[Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion]]&quot; greatly enhanced [[Executive (government)|executive powers]], and the goal of [[Project National Glory|retaking mainland China]] allowed the KMT to maintain a monopoly on power and the prohibition of [[Parliamentary opposition|opposition parties]]. The government's official line for these martial law provisions stemmed from the claim that emergency provisions were necessary, since the Communists and KMT were still in a state of war. Seeking to promote [[Chinese nationalism]], Chiang's government actively ignored and suppressed local cultural expression, even forbidding the use of local languages in mass media broadcasts or during class sessions. As a result of Taiwan's anti-government uprising in 1947, known as the [[February 28 incident]], the KMT-led political repression resulted in the death or disappearance of over 30,000 Taiwanese intellectuals, activists, and people suspected of opposition to the KMT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://englishnews.ftv.com.tw/read.aspx?sno=5B33122680FD5E65A32B8E335FE5727A &quot;Ceremonies held to commemorate 228 Incident victims (2014/02/28)&quot;]. ''englishnews.ftv.com.tw''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first decades after the Nationalists moved the seat of government to the province of Taiwan are associated with the organized effort to resist Communism known as the [[White Terror (Taiwan)|&quot;White Terror&quot;]], during which about 140,000 Taiwanese were imprisoned for their real or perceived opposition to the Kuomintang.&lt;ref name=TaipeiTimes20050520&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of those prosecuted were labeled by the Kuomintang as &quot;bandit spies&quot; (匪諜), meaning spies for Chinese Communists, and punished as such.

Under Chiang, the government recognized limited [[civil liberties]], [[economic freedom]]s, [[Right to property|property rights]] ([[Personal property|personal]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} and [[Intellectual property|intellectual]]) and other liberties. Despite these restrictions, free debate within the confines of the legislature was permitted. Under the pretext that new elections could not be held in Communist-occupied constituencies, the [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|National Assembly]], [[Legislative Yuan]], and [[Control Yuan]] members held their posts indefinitely. The Temporary Provisions also allowed Chiang to remain as president beyond the two-term limit in the Constitution. He was reelected by the National Assembly as president four times—doing so in 1954, 1960, 1966, and 1972.

[[File:DoubleTenDayParadeOctober101966.jpg|thumb|Chiang presiding over the 1966 [[Double Ten Day|Double Ten celebrations]]]]
Believing that corruption and a lack of morals were key reasons that the KMT lost mainland China to the Communists, Chiang attempted to purge corruption by dismissing members of the KMT accused of graft. Some major figures in the previous mainland Chinese government, such as [[H. H. Kung]] and [[T. V. Soong]], exiled themselves to the United States. Although politically authoritarian and, to some extent, dominated by government-owned industries, Chiang's new Taiwanese state also encouraged [[economic development]], especially in the export sector. A popular sweeping [[Land Reform in Taiwan|Land Reform Act]], as well as [[United States foreign aid|American foreign aid]] during the 1950s, laid the foundation for Taiwan's economic success, becoming one of the [[Four Asian Tigers]].

After Chiang's death, the next president, Chiang's son, [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], and Chiang Ching-kuo's successor, [[Lee Teng-hui]] a [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples|native Taiwanese]], would, in the 1980s and 1990s, increase native Taiwanese representation in the government and loosen the many authoritarian controls of the early era of ROC control in Taiwan.

====Relationship with Japan====
In 1971, the [[Leader of the Opposition (Australia)|Australian Opposition Leader]] [[Gough Whitlam]], who [[1972 Australian federal election|became Prime Minister in 1972]] and [[Whitlam Government#Duumvirate|swiftly relocated the Australian mission from Taipei to Beijing]], visited Japan. After meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister, [[Eisaku Sato]], Whitlam observed that the reason Japan at that time was hesitant to withdraw recognition from the Nationalist government was &quot;the presence of a treaty between the Japanese government and that of Chiang Kai-shek&quot;. Sato explained that the continued recognition of Japan towards the Nationalist government was due largely to the personal relationship that various members of the Japanese government felt towards Chiang. This relationship was rooted largely in the generous and lenient treatment of [[Japanese prisoners of war in World War II|Japanese prisoners-of-war]] by the Nationalist government in the years immediately following the Japanese surrender in 1945, and was felt especially strongly as a bond of personal obligation by the most senior members then in power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Journal1&quot;&gt;Gillin, Donald G. and Etter, Charles. &quot;Staying On: Japanese Soldiers and Civilians in China, 1945–1948&quot;. ''The Journal of Asian Studies''. Vol. 42, No. 3, May 1983. p. 516. {{jstor|2055515}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Japan recognized the People's Republic in 1972, shortly after [[Kakuei Tanaka]] succeeded Sato as Prime Minister of Japan, the memory of this relationship was strong enough to be reported by ''[[The New York Times]]'' (15 April 1978) as a significant factor inhibiting trade between Japan and the mainland. There is speculation that a clash between Communist forces and a Japanese warship in 1978 was caused by Chinese anger after Prime Minister [[Takeo Fukuda]] attended Chiang's funeral. Historically, Japanese attempts to normalize their [[China–Japan relations|relationship with the People's Republic]] were met with accusations of ingratitude in Taiwan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Journal1&quot; /&gt;

====Relationship with the United States====
[[File:Ike cks.JPG|250px|right|thumb|Generalissimo and president Chiang with U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in June 1960.]]
Chiang was suspicious that [[Central Intelligence Agency Directorate of Operations|covert operatives of the United States]] plotted a [[Coup d'état|coup]] against him. In 1950, Chiang Ching-kuo became director of the [[secret police]] ([[Bureau of Investigation and Statistics]]), which he remained until 1965. Chiang was also suspicious of politicians who were overly friendly to the United States, and considered them his enemies. In 1953, seven days after surviving an assassination attempt, [[Wu Kuo-chen]] lost his position as governor of Taiwan Province to [[Chiang Ching-kuo]]. After fleeing to United States the same year, he became a vocal critic of Chiang's family and government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter R. Moody 1977 302&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AW9yrtekFRkC&amp;pg=PA302 |title=Opposition and dissent in contemporary China |author=Peter R. Moody |year=1977 |publisher=Hoover Press |page=302 |isbn =0-8179-6771-0 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang Ching-kuo, educated in the Soviet Union, initiated [[Soviet military academies|Soviet-style military organization]] in the [[Republic of China Armed Forces|Republic of China Military]]. He reorganized and [[Sovietized]] the [[Political officer (military)|political officer corps]], and propagated [[Socialist ideology of the Kuomintang|Kuomintang ideology]] throughout the military. [[Sun Li-jen]], who was educated at the American [[Virginia Military Institute]], was opposed to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_5R2fnVZXiwC&amp;pg=PA195 |title=The Generalissimo's son: Chiang Ching-kuo and the revolutions in China and Taiwan|author=Jay Taylor |year=2000 |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=195 |isbn =0-674-00287-3 |accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang Ching-kuo orchestrated the controversial [[court-martial]] and arrest of General [[Sun Li-jen]] in August 1955, for plotting a coup d'état with the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) against his father Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang. The CIA allegedly wanted to help Sun take control of Taiwan and declare its independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter R.

===Death===

{{wikisource|Translation:Will of Chiang Kai-shek}}

In 1975, 26 years after Chiang came to Taiwan, he died in [[Taipei]] at the age of 87. He had suffered a heart attack and [[pneumonia]] in the foregoing months and died from [[renal failure]] aggravated with advanced cardiac failure on 5 April.

A month of mourning was declared. Chinese music composer [[Hwang Yau-tai]] wrote the [[Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Song]]. In mainland China, however, Chiang's death was met with little apparent mourning and Communist state-run newspapers gave the brief headline &quot;Chiang Kai-shek Has Died.&quot; Chiang's body was put in a copper coffin and temporarily interred at his favorite residence in [[Cihu Mausoleum|Cihu]], [[Daxi District|Daxi]], [[Taoyuan City|Taoyuan]]. When his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] died in 1988, he was entombed in a separate mausoleum in nearby [[Touliao Mausoleum|Touliao]] (頭寮). The hope was to have both buried at their birthplace in Fenghua if and when it was possible. In 2004, [[Chiang Fang-liang]], the widow of Chiang Ching-kuo, asked that both father and son be buried at [[Wuzhi Mountain Military Cemetery]] in [[Xizhi]], [[Taipei County]] (now New Taipei City). Chiang's ultimate funeral ceremony became a political battle between the wishes of the state and the wishes of his family.

Chiang was succeeded as President by Vice President [[Yen Chia-kan]] and as Kuomintang party ruler by his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], who retired Chiang Kai-shek's title of Director-General and instead assumed the position of Chairman. Yen's presidency was interim; Chiang Ching-kuo, who was the [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]], became President after Yen's term ended three years later.

The Kuomintang used traditional Chinese religious ceremonies, and promoted [[martyrdom in Chinese culture]]. Kuomintang ideology promoted the view that the souls of Party martyrs who died fighting for the Kuomintang, the revolution, and the party founder Dr. Sun Yat-sen were sent to heaven.

When the Northern Expedition was complete, Kuomintang Generals led by Chiang Kai-shek paid tribute to Dr. Sun's soul in heaven with a sacrificial ceremony at the Xiangshan Temple in Beijing in July 1928.

Chiang Kai-shek considered both the Han Chinese and all the minority peoples of China, the [[Five Races Under One Union]], as descendants of the [[Yellow Emperor]], the semi-mythical founder of the Chinese nation, and belonging to the Chinese Nation [[Zhonghua Minzu]] and he introduced this into Kuomintang ideology, which was propagated into the educational system of the [[Republic of China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YujNjFgTuGMC&amp;pg=PA416 |title=The Other Taiwan: 1945 to the present |author=Murray A.

Chiang's legacy has been the target of heated debates because of the different views held about him. For some, Chiang was a national hero who led the victorious [[Northern Expedition]] against the [[Beiyang government|Beiyang Warlords]] in 1927, achieving [[Chinese reunification (1928)|Chinese unification]], and who subsequently led China to ultimate victory against [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] in 1945. Some blamed him for not doing enough against the Japanese forces in the lead-up to, and during, the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], preferring to withhold his armies for the fight against the Communists, or merely waiting and hoping that the United States would get involved. Some also see him as a champion of [[anti-Communism]], being a key figure during the formative years of the [[World Anti-Communist League]]. During the [[Cold War]], he was also seen as the leader who led [[Free area of the Republic of China|Free China]] and the bulwark against a possible Communist invasion. However, Chiang presided over purges, political authoritarianism, and graft during his tenure in mainland China, and ruled throughout a period of imposed [[martial law]]. His governments were accused of being corrupt even before he even took power in 1928. He also allied with known criminals like [[Du Yuesheng]] for political and financial gains. Some opponents charge that Chiang's efforts in developing Taiwan were mostly to make the island a strong base from which to one day return to mainland China, and that Chiang had little regard for the long-term prosperity and well-being of the [[Taiwanese people]].

Today, Chiang's popularity in Taiwan is divided along political lines, enjoying greater support among Kuomintang (KMT) supporters. He is generally unpopular among [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) voters and supporters who blame him for the thousands killed during the [[February 28 Incident]] and criticise his subsequent dictatorial rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;veconomist&quot; &gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Chiang Kai-shek's former homes are open to tourists|url=https://www.economist.com/news/china/21730036-visitors-china-and-taiwan-have-very-different-views-late-dictator-chiang-kai-sheks-former|work=[[The Economist]]|date=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In sharp contrast to his son, [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], and to [[Sun Yat-sen]], his memory is rarely invoked by current political parties, including the Kuomintang.  In contrast, his image has been rehabilitated in contemporary Mainland China.  Until recently portrayed as a villain who fought against the &quot;liberation&quot; of China by the Communists, since the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], he has been portrayed by the media in a neutral or slightly positive light as a Chinese nationalist who tried to bring about national unification and resisted the Japanese invasion during World War II.  This shift is largely in response to current political landscape of Taiwan, in relation to Chiang's commitment to a [[Chinese unification|unified China]] and his stance against [[Taiwan independence movement|Taiwanese separatism]] during his rule of the island, along with the recent [[détente]] between the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Chiang's KMT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/03/assassinating-chiang-kai-shek-china-taiwan-japan-world-war-2/|title=Assassinating Chiang Kai-shek|last=Bernstein|first=Richard|date=3 September 2015|website=Foreign Policy|access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to efforts to remove his public monuments in Taiwan, his ancestral home in Fenghua, Zhejiang on the Mainland has become a commemorative museum and major tourist attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thatsmags.com/china/post/8321/retake-the-mainland-chiang-kai-shek-bronze-marches-on-zhejiang-hometown|title='Retake the Mainland': Chiang Kai-shek bronze marches on Zhejiang hometown|last=Kilpatrick|first=Ryan|date=13 January 2015|website=That's Magazine|access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States and Europe, Chiang was often perceived negatively as the one who lost China to the Communists. His constant demands for Western support and funding also earned him the nickname of &quot;General Cash-My-Check&quot;. In the West he has been criticized for his poor military skills. He had a record of issuing unrealistic orders and persistently attempting to fight unwinnable battles, leading to the loss of his best troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fenby |first=Jonathan |title=History of Modern China |page = 279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, there has been an attempt to find a more moderate interpretation of Chiang. Chiang is now increasingly perceived as a man simply overwhelmed by the events in China, having to fight simultaneously Communists, Japanese, and provincial warlords while having to reconstruct and unify the country. His sincere, albeit often unsuccessful attempts to build a more powerful nation have been noted by scholars such as [[Jonathan Fenby]] and [[Rana Mitter]]. Mitter has observed that, ironically, today's China is closer to Chiang's vision than to [[Mao Zedong]]'s. He argues that the Communists, since the 1980s, have essentially created the state envisioned by Chiang in the 1930s. Mitter concludes by writing that &quot;one can imagine Chiang Kai-shek's ghost wandering round China today nodding in approval, while Mao's ghost follows behind him, moaning at the destruction of his vision&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mitter|first=Rana|title=Modern China|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liang Shuming]] opined that Chiang Kai-shek's &quot;greatest contribution was to make the CCP successful. If he had been a bit more trustworthy, if his character was somewhat better, the CCP would have been unable to beat him&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;In an interview reported in &quot;Has Man a Future?&quot;, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Formosa Betrayed (film)|Formosa Betrayed]]'', one of the few American movies concerning the process of democratization in Taiwan, depicts Chiang Kai-shek as a brutal dictator, responsible for the execution of thousands of native Taiwanese during the days following the [[February 28 Incident]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In an [[arranged marriage]], Chiang was married to a fellow villager named [[Mao Fumei]]. While married to Mao, Chiang adopted two [[concubine]]s (concubinage was still a common practice for well-to-do, non-Christian males in China): he married Yao Yecheng (姚冶誠, 1889–1972) in 1912 and [[Chen Jieru]] (陳潔如, 1906–1971) in December 1921. While he was still living in Shanghai, Chiang and Yao adopted a son, [[Chiang Wei-kuo|Wei-kuo]]. Chen adopted a daughter in 1924, named Yaoguang (瑤光), who later adopted her mother's surname. Chen's autobiography refuted the idea that she was a concubine.&lt;ref name=&quot;CCJ93&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ch'en |first1=Chieh-ju |last2=Lee |first2=James |editor1-last=Eastman |editor1-first=Lloyd E. |date=1993 |title = Chiang Kai-shek's Secret Past: The Memoir of His Second Wife, Ch'en Chieh-ju |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IDbvAzXCBH8C&amp;printsec=frontcover |location=Boulder, Colorado |publisher=Westview Press |page= |isbn = 0-8133-1824-6 |accessdate = 10 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chen claiming that, by the time she married Chiang, he had already divorced Yao, and that Chen was therefore his wife. Chiang and Mao had a son, [[Chiang Ching-kuo|Ching-kuo]].

According to the memoirs of Chen Jieru, Chiang's second wife, she contracted [[gonorrhea]] from Chiang soon after their marriage. He told her that he acquired this disease after separating from his first wife and living with his concubine Yao Yecheng, as well as with many other women he consorted with. His doctor explained to her that Chiang had sex with her before completing his treatment for the disease. As a result, both Chiang and Ch'en Chieh-ju believed they had become sterile, which would explain why he had only one child, by his first wife; however, a purported miscarriage by Soong Mei-ling in August 1928 would, if it actually occurred, cast serious doubt on whether this was true.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Generalissimo&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Chiang Kai-shek's Secret Past''. pp. 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion and relationships with religious communities ==

Chiang personally dealt extensively with religions and power figures in China during his regime.

=== Religious views ===
Chiang Kai-shek was born and raised as a [[Buddhist]], but became a [[Methodist]] upon his marriage to his fourth wife, [[Soong Mei-ling]]. It was previously believed that this was a political move,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jay Taylor 2009 p. 2&quot;&gt;Jay Taylor. ''The Generalissimo: Chiang Kai-Shek and the Struggle for Modern China.'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press,  2009) p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; but studies of his recently opened diaries suggest that his faith was sincere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor2009p91&quot;/&gt;

=== Relationship with Muslims ===
[[File:Chiang Kaishek with Muslim General Ma Fushou.jpg|thumb|Chiang Kai-shek with the Muslim General [[Ma Fushou]]]]

Chiang developed relationships with other generals. Chiang became a [[sworn brother]] of the Chinese Muslim general [[Ma Fuxiang]] and appointed him to high ranking positions. Chiang addressed Ma Fuxiang's son [[Ma Hongkui]] as Shao Yun Shixiong&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zeSeAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA77 |title = Familiar China at war: regions of China, 1937–1945 |author1=Stephen R.

When Chiang became President of China after the [[Northern Expedition]], he carved out [[Ningxia]] and [[Qinghai]] out of Gansu province, and appointed Muslim generals as military governors of all three provinces: [[Ma Hongkui]], [[Ma Hongbin]], and [[Ma Qi]]. The three Muslim governors, known as [[Xibei San Ma]] (lit. &quot;the three [[Ma clique|Mas]] of the [[Northwestern China|Northwest]]&quot;), controlled armies composed entirely of Muslims. Chiang called on the three and their subordinates to wage war against the Soviet peoples, Tibetans, Communists, and the Japanese. Chiang continued to appoint Muslims as governors of the three provinces, including [[Ma Lin (warlord)|Ma Lin]] and [[Ma Fushou]]. Chiang's appointments, the first time that Muslims had been appointed as governors of Gansu, increased the prestige of Muslim officials in northwestern China. The armies raised by this &quot;Ma Clique&quot;, most notably their Muslim cavalry, were incorporated into the KMT army. Chiang appointed a Muslim general, [[Bai Chongxi]], as the Minister of National Defence of the Republic of China, which controlled the ROC military.

Chiang also supported the Muslim General Ma Zhongying, whom he had trained at [[Whampoa Military Academy]] during the [[Kumul Rebellion]], in a [[Jihad]] against [[Jin Shuren]], [[Sheng Shicai]], and the Soviet Union during the [[Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang]]. Chiang designated Ma's Muslim army as the [[36th Division (National Revolutionary Army)]] and gave his troops [[Kuomintang]] flags and uniforms. Chiang then supported Muslim General Ma Hushan against [[Sheng Shicai]] and the Soviet Union in the [[Xinjiang War (1937)]]. All Muslim generals commissioned by Chiang in the National Revolutionary Army swore allegiance to him. Several, like [[Ma Shaowu]] and Ma Hushan were loyal to Chiang and Kuomintang hardliners.

The [[Ili Rebellion]] and [[Pei-ta-shan Incident]] plagued relations with the Soviet Union during Chiang's rule and caused trouble with the Uyghurs. During the Ili Rebellion and Peitashan incident, Chiang deployed [[Hui people|Hui]] troops against [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] mobs in Turfan, and against Soviet Russian and Mongols at Peitashan.

During Chiang's rule, attacks on foreigners by Kuomintang forces flared up in several incidents. One of these was the [[Battle of Kashgar (1934)]] where a Muslim army loyal to the Kuomintang massacred 4,500 Uyghurs, and killed several British at the British consulate in Kashgar. The British were unable to retaliate.

[[Hu Songshan]], a Muslim Imam, backed Chiang Kai-shek's regime and gave prayers for his government. ROC flags were saluted by Muslims in Ningxia during prayer along with exhortations to nationalism during Chiang's rule. Chiang sent Muslim students abroad to study at places like [[Al-Azhar University]] and Muslim schools throughout China taught loyalty to his regime.

The Yuehua, a Chinese Muslim publication, quoted the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] to justify submitting to Chiang Kai-shek as the leader of China, and as justification for Jihad in the war against Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MJzB6wrz6Q4C |title=Intellectuals in the modern Islamic world: transmission, transformation, communication |author1=Stéphane A.

The [[Yihewani]] (Ikhwan al Muslimun a.k.a. Muslim brotherhood) was the predominant Muslim sect backed by the Chiang government during Chiang's regime. Other Muslim sects, like the [[Xidaotang]] and Sufi brotherhoods like Jahriyya and Khuffiya were also supported by his regime. The Chinese Muslim Association, a pro-Kuomintang and anti-Communist organization, was set up by Muslims working in his regime. [[Salafism]] attempted to gain a foothold in China during his regime, but the Yihewani and Hanafi Sunni [[Gedimu]] denounced the Salafis as radicals, engaged in fights against them, and declared them heretics, forcing the Salafis to form a separate sect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uHjR3yeIWzUC&amp;pg=PA127 |title = Muslim diversity: local Islam in global contexts |author = Leif O.

[[Ma Buqing]] was another Muslim General who fled to Taiwan along with Chiang. His government donated money to build the [[Taipei Grand Mosque]] on Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.taipeimosque.org.tw/index.php?categoryid=9 |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429234635/http://www.taipeimosque.org.tw/index.php?categoryid=9 |archive-date=29 April 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship with Buddhists and Christians ===
Chiang had uneasy relations with the [[Tibetans]]. He fought against them in the [[Sino-Tibetan War]], and he supported the Muslim General [[Ma Bufang]] in his war against Tibetan rebels in [[Qinghai]]. Chiang ordered Ma Bufang to prepare his Islamic army to invade [[Tibet]] several times, to deter [[Tibetan independence]], and threatened them with aerial bombardment.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} After the war, Chiang appointed Ma Bufang as ambassador to [[Saudi Arabia]].

Chiang incorporated [[Methodist]] values into the [[New Life Movement]] under the influence of his wife. Dancing and Western music were discouraged. In one incident, several youths splashed acid on people wearing Western clothing, although Chiang was not directly responsible for these incidents. Despite being a Methodist, he made reference to the [[Buddha]] in his diary, and encouraged the establishment of a Buddhist political party under Master [[Taixu]].

According to [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] some of their members travelled to [[Chonqqing]] and spoke to him personally while distributing their literature there during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/302013001#h=30:572-30:914 | title=Myanmar (Burma) — Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY}}&lt;/ref&gt;
