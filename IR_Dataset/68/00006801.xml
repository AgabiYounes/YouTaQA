A '''crew''' is a body or a class of people who work at a common activity, generally in a structured or [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] organization. A location in which a crew works is called a '''crewyard''' or a '''workyard'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essentials of Management|last=Dubrin|first=Andrew J.|publisher=South-Western publishing, Co.|year=2006|isbn=9780324321104|location=Nashville, TN|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The word has nautical resonances: the tasks involved in operating a ship, particularly a sailing ship, providing numerous specialities within a ship's crew, often organised with a [[chain of command]]. Traditional nautical usage strongly distinguishes [[Commissioned officer|officer]]s from crew, though the two groups combined form the [[ship's company]]. Members of a crew are often referred to by the title ''[[Crewman]]''.

''Crew'' also refers to the sport of [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], where teams row competitively in racing shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speedrower.com/index.htm |title=Speed Rower, Competitive Rowing |accessdate=2009-02-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609130144/http://www.speedrower.com/index.htm |archivedate=June 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
