'''Caffeine''' is a [[central nervous system]] (CNS) [[stimulant]] of the [[methylxanthine]] [[chemical classification|class]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid1356551&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nehlig A, Daval JL, Debry G | title = Caffeine and the central nervous system: mechanisms of action, biochemical, metabolic and psychostimulant effects | journal = Brain Research.

There are several known [[mechanism of action|mechanisms of action]] to explain the effects of caffeine. The most prominent is that it reversibly blocks the action of [[adenosine]] on its receptor and consequently prevents the onset of drowsiness induced by adenosine. Caffeine also stimulates certain portions of the [[autonomic nervous system]].

&lt;!--Physical and chemical properties, natural occurrence--&gt;
Caffeine is a bitter, white crystalline [[purine]], a [[methylxanthine]] [[alkaloid]], and is chemically related to the [[adenine]] and [[guanine]] [[nucleobase|bases]] of [[DNA|deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) and [[RNA|ribonucleic acid]] (RNA). It is found in the seeds, nuts, or leaves of a number of plants native to Africa, East Asia and South America,&lt;ref name=&quot;Caballero Finglas Toldra 2015&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Caballero B, Finglas P, Toldra F |title=Encyclopedia of Food and Health |publisher=Elsevier Science |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-12-384953-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O-t9BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA561 |access-date=June 17, 2018 |page=561}}&lt;/ref&gt; and helps to protect them against predator insects and to prevent germination of nearby seeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myers 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Myers |first=R.

People may drink [[beverages]] containing caffeine to relieve or prevent drowsiness and to improve cognitive performance. To make these drinks, caffeine is extracted by [[steeping]] the plant product in water, a process called [[infusion]]. Caffeine-containing drinks, such as [[coffee]], [[tea]], and [[cola]], are very popular; as of 2014, 85% of American adults consumed some form of caffeine daily, consuming 164&amp;nbsp;mg on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mitchell DC, Knight CA, Hockenberry J, Teplansky R, Hartman TJ |title=Beverage caffeine intakes in the U.S |journal=Food and Chemical Toxicology |volume=63 |pages=136–42 |date=January 2014 |pmid=24189158 |doi=10.1016/j.fct.2013.10.042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Medical uses and adverse effects--&gt;
Caffeine can have both positive and negative health effects.

&lt;!--Toxicity--&gt;
Caffeine is classified by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] as [[generally recognized as safe]] (GRAS). Toxic doses, over 10 grams per day for an adult, are much higher than the typical dose of under 500 milligrams per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01561.x| pmid = 20492310| title = Caffeine (1, 3, 7-trimethylxanthine) in Foods: A Comprehensive Review on Consumption, Functionality, Safety, and Regulatory Matters| journal = Journal of Food Science| volume = 75| issue = 3| pages = R77–R87| year = 2010| last1 = Heckman| first1 = Melanie A.| last2 = Weil| first2 = Jorge| last3 = De Mejia| first3 = Elvira Gonzalez | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; A cup of coffee contains 80–175&amp;nbsp;mg of caffeine, depending on what &quot;bean&quot; (seed) is used and how it is prepared (e.g., [[Drip brew|drip]], [[Coffee percolator|percolation]], or [[espresso]]). Thus it requires roughly 50–100 ordinary cups of coffee to reach the toxic dose.  However, pure powdered caffeine, which is available as a [[dietary supplement]], can be lethal in tablespoon-sized amounts.

====Adolescents====
[[Health Canada]] has not developed advice for adolescents because of insufficient data. However, they suggest that daily caffeine intake for this age group be no more than 2.5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg body weight. This is because the maximum adult caffeine dose may not be appropriate for light-weight adolescents or for younger adolescents who are still growing. The daily dose of 2.5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg body weight would not cause adverse health effects in the majority of adolescent caffeine consumers. This is a conservative suggestion since older and heavier weight adolescents may be able to consume adult doses of caffeine without suffering adverse effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;itsyourhealth&quot;/&gt;

Whether caffeine can result in an addictive disorder depends on how addiction is defined.  Compulsive caffeine consumption under any circumstances has not been observed, and caffeine is therefore not generally considered addictive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nestler |first1=Eric J. |last2=Hymen E. |first2=Steven E. |last3=Holtzmann |first3=David M. |last4=Malenka |first4=Robert C. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education. |edition=3rd |chapter=16 |quote=True compulsive use of caffeine has not been documented, and, consequently, these drugs are not considered addictive.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some diagnostic models, such as the {{nowrap|[[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems#ICDM-9|ICDM-9]]}} and [[ICD-10]], include a classification of caffeine addiction under a broader diagnostic model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Budney AJ, Emond JA | title = Caffeine addiction?

[[Drug withdrawal|Withdrawal]] can cause mild to clinically significant distress or impairment in daily functioning.

American Psychiatric Publishing. pp. 1–2.   Retrieved 18 November 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to this inconclusive evidence on clinical significance, the DSM-5 classifies caffeine-use disorder as a “condition for further study”.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

[[Drug tolerance|Tolerance]] to the effects of caffeine occurs for caffeine induced elevations in [[blood pressure]] and the subjective feelings of nervousness.  [[Sensitization]], the process whereby effects become more prominent with use, occurs for positive effects such as feelings of alertness and well being.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19428492&quot;/&gt; Tolerance varies for daily, regular caffeine users and high caffeine users. High doses of caffeine (750 to 1200&amp;nbsp;mg/day spread throughout the day) have been shown to produce complete tolerance to some, but not all of the effects of caffeine. Doses as low as 100&amp;nbsp;mg/day, such as a 6 oz cup of coffee or two to three 12 oz servings of caffeinated soft-drink, may continue to cause sleep disruption, among other intolerances.

===Pharmacodynamics===
{{Synapse map}}
[[File:Caffeine and adenosine.svg|thumb|250px|Caffeine's primary mechanism of action is as an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of [[adenosine]] receptors in the brain|alt=Two skeletal formulas: left&amp;nbsp;– caffeine, right&amp;nbsp;– adenosine.]]

In the absence of caffeine and when a person is awake and alert, little [[adenosine]] is present in (CNS) neurons. With a continued wakeful state, over time adenosine accumulates in the neuronal [[synapse]], in turn binding to and activating [[adenosine receptor]]s found on certain CNS neurons; when activated, these receptors produce a cellular response that ultimately increases [[drowsiness]]. When caffeine is consumed, it [[receptor antagonist|antagonizes]] adenosine receptors; in other words, caffeine prevents adenosine from activating the receptor by blocking the location on the receptor where adenosine binds to it. As a result, caffeine temporarily prevents or relieves drowsiness, and thus maintains or restores alertness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drugbank-Caffeine&quot; /&gt;

====Receptor and ion channel targets====
Caffeine is an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] at all four [[adenosine receptor]] subtypes ([[adenosine receptor A1|A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[adenosine receptor A2a|A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[adenosine receptor A2b|A&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[adenosine receptor A3|A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]), although with varying [[potency (pharmacology)|potencies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Drugbank-Caffeine&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid22886028&quot; /&gt; The [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] ([[dissociation constant|K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;]]) values of caffeine for the human adenosine receptors are 12&amp;nbsp;μM at [[adenosine A1 receptor|A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], 2.4&amp;nbsp;μM at [[adenosine A2A receptor|A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;]], 13&amp;nbsp;μM at [[adenosine A2B receptor|A&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt;]], and 80&amp;nbsp;μM at [[adenosine A3 receptor|A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid22886028&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Froestl W, Muhs A, Pfeifer A | title = Cognitive enhancers (nootropics).

[[Heart palpitation]]s are caused by blockade of the A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drugbank-Caffeine&quot; /&gt;

Because caffeine is both water- and lipid-soluble, it readily crosses the [[blood–brain barrier]] that separates the bloodstream from the interior of the brain. Once in the brain, the principal mode of action is as a nonselective [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of adenosine receptors (in other words, an agent that reduces the effects of adenosine). The caffeine molecule is structurally similar to adenosine, and is capable of binding to adenosine receptors on the surface of cells without activating them, thereby acting as a [[competitive antagonist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15095008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fisone G, Borgkvist A, Usiello A | title = Caffeine as a psychomotor stimulant: mechanism of action | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 61 | issue = 7–8 | pages = 857–72 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15095008 | doi = 10.1007/s00018-003-3269-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its activity at adenosine receptors, caffeine is an [[Inositol trisphosphate receptor|inositol trisphosphate receptor 1]] antagonist and a voltage-independent activator of the [[ryanodine receptor]]s ([[RYR1]], [[RYR2]], and [[RYR3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;IUPHAR caffeine&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Caffeine|url=http://www.iuphar-db.org/DATABASE/LigandDisplayForward?tab=biology&amp;ligandId=407|website=IUPHAR|publisher=International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology|access-date=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a competitive antagonist of the [[glycine receptor|ionotropic glycine receptor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19564396&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Duan L, Yang J, Slaughter MM | title = Caffeine inhibition of ionotropic glycine receptors | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 587 | issue = Pt 16 | pages = 4063–75 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19564396 | pmc = 2756438 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.2009.174797 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effects on striatal dopamine====
While caffeine does not directly bind to any [[dopamine receptor]]s, it influences the binding activity of [[dopamine]] at its receptors in the [[striatum]] by binding to adenosine receptors that have formed [[GPCR oligomer|GPCR heteromers]] with dopamine receptors, specifically the [[adenosine receptor A1|A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]]–[[DRD1|D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] receptor [[heterodimer]] (this is a receptor complex with 1 adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor and 1 dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor) and the [[adenosine receptor A2a|A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;]]–[[DRD2|D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] receptor [[heterotetramer]] (this is a receptor complex with 2 adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and 2 dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors).&lt;ref name=&quot;A1-DRD1 and A2a-DRD2 review&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferré S | title = Role of the central ascending neurotransmitter systems in the psychostimulant effects of caffeine | journal = Journal of Alzheimer's Disease | volume = 20 Suppl 1 | issue =  | pages = S35–49 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20182056 | doi = 10.3233/JAD-2010-1400 | quote = By targeting A1-A2A receptor heteromers in striatal glutamatergic terminals and A1 receptors in striatal dopaminergic terminals (presynaptic brake), caffeine induces glutamate-dependent and glutamate-independent release of dopamine.

===Decaffeination===
{{Main|Decaffeination}}
[[File:CaffeineCrystals Fibrous 10xDarkField.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Fibrous [[crystal]]s of purified caffeine. [[Dark-field microscopy]] image, about 7&amp;nbsp;mm × 11&amp;nbsp;mm]]

Extraction of caffeine from coffee, to produce caffeine and decaffeinated coffee, can be performed using a number of solvents. [[Benzene]], [[chloroform]], [[trichloroethylene]], and [[dichloromethane]] have all been used over the years but for reasons of safety, environmental impact, cost, and flavor, they have been superseded by the following main methods:
* '''Water extraction:''' Coffee beans are soaked in water. The water, which contains many other compounds in addition to caffeine and contributes to the flavor of coffee, is then passed through [[Activated carbon|activated charcoal]], which removes the caffeine. The water can then be put back with the beans and evaporated dry, leaving decaffeinated coffee with its original flavor. Coffee manufacturers recover the caffeine and resell it for use in soft drinks and over-the-counter caffeine tablets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Decaffeination&quot;&gt;{{cite web| vauthors = Senese F |title=How is coffee decaffeinated? |publisher=General Chemistry Online |date=20 September 2005 |url=http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/consumer/faq/decaffeinating-coffee.shtml |access-date=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction:''' [[Supercritical carbon dioxide]] is an excellent nonpolar [[solvent]] for caffeine, and is safer than the organic solvents that are otherwise used. The extraction process is simple: {{CO2}} is forced through the green coffee beans at temperatures above 31.1&amp;nbsp;°C and pressures above 73 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]. Under these conditions, {{CO2}} is in a &quot;[[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]]&quot; [[Phase (matter)|state]]: It has gaslike properties that allow it to penetrate deep into the beans but also liquid-like properties that dissolve 97–99% of the caffeine. The caffeine-laden {{CO2}} is then sprayed with high-pressure water to remove the caffeine. The caffeine can then be isolated by [[Activated carbon|charcoal]] [[adsorption]] (as above) or by [[distillation]], [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]], or [[reverse osmosis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Decaffeination&quot; /&gt;
* '''Extraction by organic solvents:''' Certain organic solvents such as [[ethyl acetate]] present much less health and environmental hazard than chlorinated and aromatic organic solvents used formerly. Another method is to use triglyceride oils obtained from spent coffee grounds.&lt;ref name=Decaffeination/&gt;

&quot;Decaffeinated&quot; coffees do in fact contain caffeine in many cases&amp;nbsp;– some commercially available decaffeinated coffee products contain considerable levels. One study found that decaffeinated coffee contained 10&amp;nbsp;mg of caffeine per cup, compared to approximately 85&amp;nbsp;mg of caffeine per cup for regular coffee.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17132260&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McCusker RR, Fuehrlein B, Goldberger BA, Gold MS, Cone EJ | title = Caffeine content of decaffeinated coffee | journal = Journal of Analytical Toxicology | volume = 30 | issue = 8 | pages = 611–3 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17132260 | doi = 10.1093/jat/30.8.611 | lay-url = http://news.ufl.edu/2006/10/10/decaf/ | laysource = University of Florida News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detection in body fluids===
Caffeine can be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to monitor therapy in neonates, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or facilitate a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma caffeine levels are usually in the range of 2–10&amp;nbsp;mg/L in coffee drinkers, 12–36&amp;nbsp;mg/L in neonates receiving treatment for apnea, and 40–400&amp;nbsp;mg/L in victims of acute overdosage. Urinary caffeine concentration is frequently measured in competitive sports programs, for which a level in excess of 15&amp;nbsp;mg/L is usually considered to represent abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors= Baselt R |title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man |edition=11th |publisher=Biomedical Publications |location=Seal Beach, CA |year=2017 |pages=335–8 |isbn=978-0-692-77499-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analogs===
Some analog substances have been created which mimic caffeine's properties with either function or structure or both. Of the latter group are the [[xanthine]]s [[DMPX]]&lt;ref name=DMPX&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seale TW, Abla KA, Shamim MT, Carney JM, Daly JW | title = 3,7-Dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine: a potent and selective in vivo antagonist of adenosine analogs | journal = Life Sciences | volume = 43 | issue = 21 | pages = 1671–84 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3193854 | doi = 10.1016/0024-3205(88)90478-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[8-chlorotheophylline]], which is an ingredient in [[Dimenhydrinate|dramamine]]. Members of a class of nitrogen substituted xanthines are often proposed as potential alternatives to caffeine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kennerly|first1=Jason | name-list-format = vanc | title=N Substituted Xanthines: A Caffeine Analog Information File|date=22 September 1995|url=https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/caffeine/caffeine_chemistry1.shtml|access-date=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=November 2015}} Many other xanthine analogues constituting the adenosine receptor antagonist class have also been elucidated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Müller | first1 = Christa E. | last2 = Jacobson | first2 = Kenneth A. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Xanthines as adenosine receptor antagonists | journal = Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology | volume = 200 | issue = 200 | pages = 151–99 | date = 19 August 2010 | pmid = 20859796 | pmc = 3882893 | doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-13443-2_6 | veditors = Fredholm BB }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other caffeine analogs:
* [[Dipropylcyclopentylxanthine]]
* [[8-Cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine]]
* [[8-Phenyltheophylline]]

=== Precipitation of tannins ===
Caffeine, as do other alkaloids such as [[cinchonine]], [[quinine]] or [[strychnine]], precipitates polyphenols and [[tannin]]s. This property can be used in a quantitation method.&lt;ref&gt;Plant Polyphenols: Synthesis, Properties, Significance. Richard W. Hemingway, Peter E. Laks, Susan J. Branham (page 263)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural occurrence==
[[File:Coffee beans2.jpg|thumb|Roasted coffee beans]]
Around sixty plant species are known to contain caffeine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/780334|title=Which Plants Contain Caffeine?|website=medscape.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common sources are the &quot;beans&quot; (seeds) of the two cultivated coffee plants, ''[[Coffea arabica]]'' and ''[[Coffea canephora]]'' (the quantity varies, but 1.3% is a typical value); in the leaves of the [[camellia sinensis|tea plant]]; and in [[kola nut]]s. Other sources include [[Ilex vomitoria|yaupon holly]] leaves, South American holly [[yerba mate]] leaves, seeds from Amazonian maple [[guarana]] berries, and Amazonian holly [[Ilex guayusa|guayusa]] leaves. Temperate climates around the world have produced unrelated caffeine-containing plants.

Caffeine in plants acts as a natural [[pesticide]]: it can paralyze and kill predator insects feeding on the plant.&lt;ref name=&quot;insecticide&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nathanson JA | title = Caffeine and related methylxanthines: possible naturally occurring pesticides | journal = Science | volume = 226 | issue = 4671 | pages = 184–7 | date = October 1984 | pmid = 6207592 | doi = 10.1126/science.6207592 | bibcode = 1984Sci...226..184N | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/771502b7e19f3f5aed12e6516f6e7fa3bd33a7ab }}&lt;/ref&gt; High caffeine levels are found in coffee seedlings when they are developing foliage and lack mechanical protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Frischknecht PM, Ulmer-Dufek J, Baumann TW |title=Purine alkaloid formation in buds and developing leaflets of Coffea arabica: Expression of an optimal defence strategy? |journal=Phytochemistry |volume=25 |pages=613–6 |year=1986 |doi=10.1016/0031-9422(86)88009-8 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, high caffeine levels are found in the surrounding soil of coffee seedlings, which inhibits seed germination of nearby coffee seedlings, thus giving seedlings with the highest caffeine levels fewer competitors for existing resources for survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baumann TW |title=Metabolism and excretion of caffeine during germination of Coffea arabica L |journal=Plant and Cell Physiology |volume=25 |issue=8 |pages=1431–6 |year=1984 |url=http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/8/1431.abstract|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a076854 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caffeine is stored in tea leaves in two places. Firstly, in the cell [[vacuole]]s where it is complexed with [[polyphenol]]s. This caffeine probably is released into the mouth parts of insects, to discourage herbivory. Secondly, around the vascular bundles, where it probably inhibits pathogenic fungi from entering and colonizing the vascular bundles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Breda SV, van der Merwe CF, Robbertse H, Apostolides Z | title = Immunohistochemical localization of caffeine in young Camellia sinensis (L.)

The differing perceptions in the effects of ingesting beverages made from various plants containing caffeine could be explained by the fact that these beverages also contain varying mixtures of other [[methylxanthine]] [[alkaloid]]s, including the [[cardiac]] stimulants [[theophylline]] and [[theobromine]], and polyphenols that can form insoluble complexes with caffeine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref-1&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Balentine DA, Harbowy ME, Graham HN | chapter = Tea: the Plant and its Manufacture; Chemistry and Consumption of the Beverage | title = Caffeine Consumption |year=1998 | veditors = Spiller GA | isbn = 978-0-429-12678-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beverages===

====Coffee====
The world's primary source of caffeine is the coffee &quot;bean&quot; (the seed of the [[coffea|coffee plant]]), from which coffee is brewed. Caffeine content in coffee varies widely depending on the type of [[coffee bean]] and the method of preparation used;&lt;ref name=&quot;ICO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Caffeine |publisher=International Coffee Organization |url=http://www.ico.org/caffeine.asp |access-date=1 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327113321/http://www.ico.org/caffeine.asp |archive-date=27 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; even beans within a given bush can show variations in concentration. In general, one serving of coffee ranges from 80 to 100 milligrams, for a single shot (30 milliliters) of arabica-variety [[espresso]], to approximately 100–125 milligrams for a cup (120 milliliters) of [[drip coffee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;caffaq_roast&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Coffee and Caffeine FAQ: Does dark roast coffee have less caffeine than light roast? |url=http://coffeefaq.com/site/node/15 |access-date=2 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jeremiahspick&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=All About Coffee: Caffeine Level |publisher=Jeremiah's Pick Coffee Co |url=http://www.jeremiahspick.com/caffeine-e-13.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318102343/http://www.jeremiahspick.com/caffeine-e-13.html |archive-date=18 March 2008 |access-date=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[coffea arabica|Arabica]]'' coffee typically contains half the caffeine of the ''[[coffea canephora|robusta]]'' variety.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICO&quot; /&gt;
In general, dark-roast coffee has very slightly less caffeine than lighter roasts because the roasting process reduces caffeine content of the bean by a small amount.&lt;ref name=&quot;caffaq_roast&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jeremiahspick&quot; /&gt;

====Tea====
Tea contains more caffeine than coffee by dry weight. A typical serving, however, contains much less, since less of the product is used as compared to an equivalent serving of coffee. Also contributing to caffeine content are growing conditions, processing techniques, and other variables. Thus, teas contain varying amounts of caffeine.&lt;ref name=&quot;FRI&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hicks MB, Hsieh YH, Bell LN |title=Tea preparation and its influence on methylxanthine concentration |journal=Food Research International |year=1996 |volume=29 |pages=325–330 |doi=10.1016/0963-9969(96)00038-5 |issue=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tea contains small amounts of [[theobromine]] and slightly higher levels of [[theophylline]] than coffee. Preparation and many other factors have a significant impact on tea, and color is a very poor indicator of caffeine content. Teas like the pale Japanese [[green tea]], ''[[gyokuro]]'', for example, contain far more caffeine than much darker teas like ''[[lapsang souchong]]'', which has very little.&lt;ref name=&quot;FRI&quot; /&gt;

====Soft drinks and energy drinks====
Caffeine is also a common ingredient of [[soft drink]]s, such as [[cola]], originally prepared from [[kola nut]]s. Soft drinks typically contain 0 to 55 milligrams of caffeine per 12 ounce serving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutrition and healthy eating|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/caffeine/art-20049372?pg=2|website=Mayo Clinic|access-date=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, [[energy drink]]s, such as [[Red Bull]], can start at 80 milligrams of caffeine per serving. The caffeine in these drinks either originates from the ingredients used or is an additive derived from the product of [[decaffeination]] or from chemical synthesis. Guarana, a prime ingredient of energy drinks, contains large amounts of caffeine with small amounts of theobromine and theophylline in a naturally occurring [[slow-release]] [[excipient]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bempong DK, Houghton PJ, Steadman K |year=1993 |title=The xanthine content of guarana and its preparations |journal=Int J Pharmacog |issn=0925-1618 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=175–181 |doi=10.3109/13880209309082937|url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:7058c79/Steadman1993xanthine.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Mate (beverage)|Mate]] is a drink popular in many parts of South America. Its preparation consists of filling a gourd with the leaves of the South American holly [[yerba mate]], pouring hot but not boiling water over the leaves, and drinking with a straw, the bombilla, which acts as a filter so as to draw only the liquid and not the yerba leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20120405-drinking-mate-in-buenos-aires|title=Drinking mate in Buenos Aires|last=Martinez-Carter|first=Karina|date=9 April 2012|website=BBC|access-date=23 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chocolate===
[[Chocolate]] derived from cocoa beans contains a small amount of caffeine. The weak stimulant effect of chocolate may be due to a combination of theobromine and theophylline, as well as caffeine.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15549276&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smit HJ, Gaffan EA, Rogers PJ | title = Methylxanthines are the psycho-pharmacologically active constituents of chocolate | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 176 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 412–9 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15549276 | doi = 10.1007/s00213-004-1898-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical 28-gram serving of a milk [[chocolate bar]] has about as much caffeine as a cup of decaffeinated coffee. By weight, [[dark chocolate]] has one to two times the amount of caffeine as coffee: 80–160&amp;nbsp;mg per 100&amp;nbsp;g. Higher percentages of cocoa such as 90% amount to 200&amp;nbsp;mg per 100&amp;nbsp;g approximately and thus, a 100-gram 85% cocoa chocolate bar contains about 195&amp;nbsp;mg caffeine.&lt;ref name=Erowid/&gt;

===Tablets===
[[File:No-Doz.jpg|thumb|right|No-Doz 100 mg caffeine tablets]]
Tablets offer several advantages over coffee, tea, and other caffeinated beverages, including convenience, known dosage, and avoidance of concomitant intake of sugar, acids, and fluids. Manufacturers of caffeine tablets claim that using caffeine of pharmaceutical quality improves mental alertness.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}  These tablets are commonly used by students studying for their exams and by people who work or drive for long hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=YdpL2YCGLVYC |page=195 }} |page=195 |title=The World of caffeine: The Science and Culture of the World's Most Popular Drug |first1=Bennett Alan |last1=Weinberg |first2=Bonnie K. |last2=Bealer |name-list-format=vanc |publisher=Routledge |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-415-92723-9 |access-date=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inhalants===
There are several products being marketed that offer inhalers that deliver proprietary blends of supplements, with caffeine being a key ingredient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eagle.energy/pages/faq#|title=Some Common Questions|website=Eagle Energy|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the FDA sent a warning letter to one of the companies marketing these inhalers, expressing concerns for the lack of safety information available about inhaled caffeine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2012/ucm294774.htm|title=2012 – Breathable Foods, Inc. 3/5/12|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combinations with other drugs===
* Some beverages combine [[ethanol|alcohol]] with caffeine to create a [[caffeinated alcoholic drink]].  The stimulant effects of caffeine may mask the [[depressant]] effects of alcohol, potentially reducing the user's awareness of their level of [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxication]].  Such beverages have been the subject of [[Ban on caffeinated alcoholic beverages|bans]] due to safety concerns.  In particular, the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] has classified caffeine added to malt liquor beverages as an &quot;unsafe food additive&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/FoodAdditivesIngredients/ucm190366.htm|title=Food Additives &amp; Ingredients &gt; Caffeinated Alcoholic Beverages|date=17 November 2010|website=fda.gov|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|access-date=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kola nut]] use appears to have ancient origins. It is chewed in many [[West Africa]]n cultures, in both private and social settings, to restore vitality and ease hunger pangs.

The earliest evidence of [[cocoa bean]] use comes from residue found in an [[Maya civilization|ancient Mayan]] pot dated to 600 BCE. Also, [[chocolate]] was consumed in a bitter and spicy drink called ''xocolatl'', often seasoned with [[vanilla]], [[chile pepper]], and [[achiote]]. ''Xocolatl'' was believed to fight fatigue, a belief probably attributable to the theobromine and caffeine content. Chocolate was an important luxury good throughout [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]], and cocoa beans were often used as currency.{{citation needed |date=October 2011}}

''Xocolatl'' was introduced to [[Europe]] by the [[Spanish people|Spaniards]], and became a popular beverage by 1700. The Spaniards also introduced the [[Theobroma cacao|cacao tree]] into the [[West Indies]] and the [[Philippines]]. It was used in [[alchemy|alchemical]] processes, where it was known as &quot;black bean&quot;.{{citation needed |date=October 2011}}

===Chemical identification, isolation, and synthesis===
[[File:Pierre Joseph Pelletier.jpg|thumb|upright|Pierre Joseph Pelletier]]
In 1819, the German chemist [[Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge]] isolated relatively pure caffeine for the first time; he called it ''&quot;Kaffebase&quot;'' (i.e., a [[base (chemistry)|base]] that exists in coffee).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Runge |first=Friedlieb Ferdinand | name-list-format = vanc |title=Neueste phytochemische Entdeckungen zur Begründung einer wissenschaftlichen Phytochemie |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=KLg5AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=P146}} |year=1820 |publisher=G. Reimer |location=Berlin |pages=144–159 |trans-title=Latest phytochemical discoveries for the founding of a scientific phytochemistry |access-date=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Runge, he did this at the behest of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].{{efn|In 1819, Runge was invited to show Goethe how belladonna caused dilation of the pupil, which Runge did, using a cat as an experimental subject. Goethe was so impressed with the demonstration that: {{quote|Nachdem Goethe mir seine größte Zufriedenheit sowol über die Erzählung des durch scheinbaren schwarzen Staar Geretteten, wie auch über das andere ausgesprochen, übergab er mir noch eine Schachtel mit Kaffeebohnen, die ein Grieche ihm als etwas Vorzügliches gesandt. &quot;Auch diese können Sie zu Ihren Untersuchungen brauchen,&quot; sagte Goethe.  Er hatte recht; denn bald darauf entdeckte ich darin das, wegen seines großen Stickstoffgehaltes so berühmt gewordene Coffein.}} (&quot;After Goethe had expressed to me his greatest satisfaction regarding the account of the man [whom I'd] rescued [from serving in Napoleon's army] by apparent &quot;black star&quot; [i.e., amaurosis, blindness] as well as the other, he handed me a carton of coffee beans, which a Greek had sent him as a delicacy.  'You can also use these in your investigations,' said Goethe. He was right; for soon thereafter I discovered therein caffeine, which became so famous on account of its high nitrogen content.&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;This account appeared in Runge's book ''Hauswirtschaftlichen Briefen'' (Domestic Letters [i.e., personal correspondence]) of 1866. It was reprinted in: Johann Wolfgang von Goethe with F.W. von Biedermann, ed., ''Goethes Gespräche'', vol. 10:  ''Nachträge, 1755–1832'' (Leipzig, (Germany):  F.W. v.

Furthermore, Berzelius stated that the French chemists had made their discoveries independently of any knowledge of Runge's or each other's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1825 |title=Jahres-Bericht über die Fortschritte der physischen Wissenschaften von Jacob Berzelius |volume=4 |page=180 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XJI8AAAAIAAJ|page=1}} |language=German |trans-title=Annual report on the progress of the physical sciences by Jacob Berzelius |last=Berzelius |first=Jöns Jakob}}  From page 180:  ''&quot;Caféin ist eine Materie im Kaffee, die zu gleicher Zeit, 1821, von Robiquet und Pelletier und Caventou entdekt wurde, von denen aber keine etwas darüber im Drucke bekannt machte.&quot;''  (Caffeine is a material in coffee, which was discovered at the same time, 1821, by Robiquet and [by] Pelletier and Caventou, by whom however nothing was made known about it in the press.)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Berzelius later acknowledged Runge's priority in the extraction of caffeine, stating:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jahres-Bericht über die Fortschritte der physischen Wissenschaften von Jacob Berzelius |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=iGs1AAAAcAAJ&amp;pag|=270}} |volume=7 |year=1828 |trans-title=Annual Report on the Progress of the Physical Sciences by Jacob Berzelius |language=German |page=270 | vauthors = Berzelius JJ}} From p. 270: {{quote|Es darf indessen hierbei nicht unerwähnt bleiben, dass Runge (in seinen phytochemischen Entdeckungen 1820, p. 146-7.) dieselbe Methode angegeben, und das Caffein unter dem Namen ''Caffeebase'' ein Jahr eher beschrieben hat, als Robiquet, dem die Entdeckung dieser Substanz gewöhnlich zugeschrieben wird, in einer Zusammenkunft der Societé de Pharmacie in Paris die erste mündliche Mittheilung darüber gab.}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;However, at this point, it should not remain unmentioned that Runge (in his ''Phytochemical Discoveries'', 1820, pages 146–147) specified the same method and described caffeine under the name ''Caffeebase'' a year earlier than Robiquet, to whom the discovery of this substance is usually attributed, having made the first oral announcement about it at a meeting of the Pharmacy Society in Paris.&quot;

Pelletier's article on caffeine was the first to use the term in print (in the French form ''Caféine'' from the French word for coffee: ''café'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Pelletier |first=Pierre Joseph |authorlink=Pierre Joseph Pelletier |encyclopedia=Dictionnaire de Médecine |title=Cafeine |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=rFw_AAAAcAAJ|page=35}} |access-date=3 March 2011 |language=French |year=1822 |publisher=Béchet Jeune |volume=4 |location=Paris |pages=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; It corroborates Berzelius's account:

Pelletier and Caventou obtained caffeine; but because their research had a different goal and because their research had not been finished, they left priority on this subject to Mr. Robiquet.

In 1895 he synthesized caffeine, but only in 1897 did he finally fully determine its molecular structure.

In 1911, caffeine became the focus of one of the earliest documented health scares, when the US government seized 40 barrels and 20 kegs of [[Coca-Cola]] syrup in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], alleging the caffeine in its drink was &quot;injurious to health&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid2010614&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Benjamin LT, Rogers AM, Rosenbaum A | title = Coca-Cola, caffeine, and mental deficiency: Harry Hollingworth and the Chattanooga trial of 1911 | journal = Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 42–55 | date = January 1991 | pmid = 2010614 | doi = 10.1002/1520-6696(199101)27:1&lt;42::AID-JHBS2300270105&gt;3.0.CO;2-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the judge ruled in favor of Coca-Cola, two bills were introduced to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in 1912 to amend the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]], adding caffeine to the list of &quot;habit-forming&quot; and &quot;deleterious&quot; substances, which must be listed on a product's label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/jarvis/jarvis17.html |title=The Rise and Fall of Cocaine Cola |website=Lewrockwell.com |access-date=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Regulations===
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States currently allows only beverages containing less than 0.02% caffeine;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CFR – Code of Federal Regulations Title 21|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=182.1180&amp;SearchTerm=caffeine|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|access-date=23 November 2015|date=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but caffeine powder, which is sold as a dietary supplement, is unregulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanner|first1=Ann | name-list-format = vanc |title=Sudden death of Ohio teen highlights dangers of caffeine powder|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/sudden-death-of-ohio-teen-highlights-dangers-of-caffeine-powder/article19683210/|access-date=23 November 2015|work=The Globe and Mail|agency=The Associated Press|publisher=Phillip Crawley|date=19 July 2014|location=Columbus, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a regulatory requirement that the label of most prepackaged foods must declare a list of ingredients, including food additives such as caffeine, in descending order of proportion. However, there is no regulatory provision for mandatory quantitative labeling of caffeine, (e.g., milligrams caffeine per stated serving size). There are a number of food ingredients that naturally contain caffeine. These ingredients must appear in food ingredient lists. However, as is the case for &quot;food additive caffeine&quot;, there is no requirement to identify the quantitative amount of caffeine in composite foods containing ingredients that are natural sources of caffeine. While coffee or chocolate are broadly recognized as caffeine sources, some ingredients (e.g., [[guarana]], [[yerba maté]]) are likely less recognized as caffeine sources. For these natural sources of caffeine, there is no regulatory provision requiring that a food label identify the presence of caffeine nor state the amount of caffeine present in the food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reissig CJ, Strain EC, Griffiths RR | title = Caffeinated energy drinks – a growing problem | journal = Drug and Alcohol Dependence | volume = 99 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 1–10 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 18809264 | pmc = 2735818 | doi = 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2008.08.001 | lay-url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/09/080924075307.htm | laydate = 25 September 2008 | laysource = ScienceDaily }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumption===
Global consumption of caffeine has been estimated at 120,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes per year, making it the world's most popular psychoactive substance.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc.net&quot; /&gt; This amounts to one serving of a caffeinated beverage for every person every day.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc.net&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=What's your poison: caffeine |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |year=1997 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/quantum/poison/caffeine/caffeine.htm |access-date=15 January 2014 | first = Geoffrey | last = Burchfield |editor-first = Meredith | editor-last = Hopes |name-list-format=vanc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726194701/http://www.abc.net.au/quantum/poison/caffeine/caffeine.htm |archive-date=26 July 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The consumption of caffeine has remained stable between 1997 and 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;Verster2018&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Verster |first1=JC |last2=Koenig |first2=J |title=Caffeine intake and its sources: A review of national representative studies. |journal=Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition |date=24 May 2018 |volume=58 |issue=8 |pages=1250–1259 |doi=10.1080/10408398.2016.1247252 |pmid=28605236 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coffee, tea and soft drinks are the most important caffeine sources, with energy drinks contributing little to the total caffeine intake across all age groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Verster2018&quot; /&gt;

===Religions===
Some [[Church of God (Restoration)]] adherents and [[Christian Scientists]] do not consume caffeine.{{citation needed |date=December 2011}} Until recently, the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] asked for its members to &quot;abstain from caffeinated drinks&quot;, but has removed this from [[baptismal vows]] (while still recommending abstention as policy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The War on Coffee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=32JbDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22| vauthors = Robinette GW |volume=1|isbn=978-0-9820787-6-1|page=22|via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some from these religions believe that one is not supposed to consume a non-medical, psychoactive substance, or believe that one is not supposed to consume a substance that is addictive. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has said the following with regard to caffeinated beverages: &quot; . . . the Church revelation spelling out health practices (Doctrine and Covenants 89) does not mention the use of caffeine.  The Church's health guidelines prohibit alcoholic drinks, smoking or chewing of tobacco, and 'hot drinks' – taught by Church leaders to refer specifically to tea and coffee.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mormonism in the News: Getting It Right August 29|publisher= The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints|year=2012|url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/mormonism-news--getting-it-right-august-29|access-date=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnavas]] generally also abstain from caffeine, because they believe it clouds the mind and over-stimulates the senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dandavats.com/?p=2766|title=If Krishna does not accept my Chocolates, Who should I offer them to?|work=Dandavats.com|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be initiated under a guru, one must have had no caffeine, alcohol, nicotine or other drugs, for at least a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buxton|first1=Julia | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Politics of Narcotic Drugs: A Survey|date=17 December 2010|isbn=978-1857437591|pages=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caffeinated beverages are widely consumed by [[Muslims]] today. In the 16th century, some Muslim authorities made unsuccessful attempts to ban them as forbidden &quot;intoxicating beverages&quot; under [[Islamic dietary laws]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Campo2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book| first = Juan Eduardo | last = Campo |name-list-format=vanc |title=Encyclopedia of Islam |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC|page=154}} |access-date=1 November 2012 |date=1 January 2009 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=978-1-4381-2696-8 |page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book| first = Daniel W. | last = Brown |name-list-format=vanc |title=A New Introduction to Islam |date=24 August 2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-4443-5772-1 |page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;
