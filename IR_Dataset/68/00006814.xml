{{Ecclesiastical polity}}
'''Congregationalist polity''', or '''congregational polity''', often known as '''congregationalism''', is a system of [[ecclesiastical polity]] in which every [[local church]] congregation is independent, ecclesiastically sovereign, or &quot;[[autonomy|autonomous]]&quot;. Its first articulation in writing is the [[Cambridge Platform]] of 1648 in [[New England]]. Among those major [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Christian traditions that employ congregationalism are those [[Congregational churches]] known by the ''Congregationalist'' name that descended from the [[Independent (religion)|Independent]] Reformed wing of the Anglo-American [[Puritan]] movement of the 17th century, [[Quakerism]], the [[Baptists|Baptist]] churches, as well as the [[Congregational Methodist Church]]. More recent generations have witnessed also a growing number of [[Nondenominational Christianity|nondenominational]] churches, which are most often congregationalist in their governance.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Congregationalism is distinguished  from [[episcopal polity]]{{sfn|Doe|2013|p=118}} which is governance by a hierarchy of [[bishop]]s, and is distinct from [[presbyterian polity]]{{sfn|Doe|2013|p=118}} in which higher assemblies of congregational representatives can exercise considerable authority over individual congregations.

Congregationalism is not limited only to organization of Christian church congregations. The principles of congregationalism have been inherited by the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] and the [[Canadian Unitarian Council]]. Most [[Jewish]] [[synagogue]]s, many [[Sikh]] [[Gurdwaras]] and most [[Islam]]ic [[mosque]]s in the US operate under congregational government, with no hierarchies.

==Basic form==
The term ''congregationalist polity'' describes a form of church governance that is based on the local congregation.  Each local congregation is independent and self-supporting, governed by its own members.{{sfn|Berry|2003|p=49}} Some band into loose voluntary associations with other congregations that share similar beliefs (e.g., the [[Willow Creek Association]] and the [[American Unitarian Association]]).{{sfn|Berry|2003|p=49}}  Others join &quot;conventions&quot;, such as the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], the [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention]] or the [[American Baptist Churches USA]] (formerly the Northern Baptist Convention).{{sfn|Berry|2003|p=49}} In Quaker Congregationalism, [[monthly meetings]], which are the most basic unit of administration, may be organized into larger Quarterly meetings or [[Yearly Meetings]]. Monthly, quarterly, or yearly meetings may also be associated with large &quot;umbrella&quot; associations such as [[Friends General Conference]] or [[Friends United Meeting]]. These conventions generally provide stronger ties between congregations, including some doctrinal direction and pooling of financial resources.{{sfn|Berry|2003|p=49}} Congregations that belong to associations and conventions are still independently governed.{{sfn|Berry|2003|p=49}} Most [[Non-denominational Christianity|non-denominational churches]] are organized along congregationalist lines.{{sfn|Berry|2003|p=49}} Many do not see these voluntary associations as &quot;[[Christian denomination|denominations]]&quot;, because they &quot;believe that there is no church other than the local church, and denominations are in variance to Scripture.&quot;{{sfn|Berry|2003|p=49}}

==Congregational church==
{{see also|Congregational church}}
{{refimprove section|date=December 2009}}
The earmarks of Congregationalism can be traced back to the Pilgrim societies of the United States in the early 17th century. Congregationalism expressed the viewpoint that (1) every local church is a full realization in miniature of the [[One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church|entire Church]] of [[Jesus Christ]]; and (2) the Church, while on earth, besides the local church, can '''only''' be invisible and ideal. While other theories may insist on the truth of the former, the latter precept of congregationalism gives the entire theory a unique character among plans of church government. There is no other reference than the local congregation for the &quot;visible church&quot; in Congregationalism. And yet, the connection of all Christians is also asserted, albeit in a way that defenders of this view usually decline, often intentionally, to elaborate more clearly or consistently. This first, foundational principle by which congregationalism is guided results in confining it to operate with the consent of each gathering of believers.

Although &quot;congregational rule&quot; may seem to suggest that [[direct democracy|pure democracy]] reigns in congregational churches, this is seldom the case. It is granted, with few exceptions (namely in some Anabaptist churches), that [[God]] has given the government of the Church into the hands of an [[ordination|ordained]] ministry. What makes congregationalism unique is its system of checks and balances, which constrains the authority of the clergy, the lay officers, and the members.

Most importantly, the boundaries of the powers of the ministers and church officers are set by clear and constant reminders of the freedoms guaranteed by the [[Gospel]] to the laity, collectively and individually. With that freedom comes the responsibility upon each member to govern himself or herself under Christ. This requires lay people to exercise great charity and patience in debating issues with one another and to seek the glory and service of God as the foremost consideration in all of their decisions.

The authority of all of the people, including the officers, is limited in the local congregation by a definition of union, or a covenant, by which the terms of their cooperation together are spelled out and agreed to. This might be something as minimal as a charter specifying a handful of [[doctrine]]s and behavioral expectations, or even a statement only guaranteeing specific freedoms. Or, it may be a [[constitution]] describing a comprehensive doctrinal system and specifying terms under which the local church is connected to other local churches, to which participating congregations give their assent. In congregationalism, rather uniquely, the church is understood to be a truly voluntary association.

Finally, the congregational theory strictly forbids ministers from ruling their local churches by themselves. Not only does the minister serve by the approval of the congregation, but committees further constrain the pastor from exercising power without consent by either the particular committee, or the entire congregation. It is a contradiction of the congregational principle if a minister makes decisions concerning the congregation without the vote of these other officers.

The other officers may be called ''deacons'', ''elder'' or ''session'' (borrowing [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] terminology), or even ''[[vestry]]'' (borrowing the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] term)&amp;nbsp;â€“ it is not their label that is important to the theory, but rather their lay status and their equal vote, together with the pastor, in deciding the issues of the church. While other forms of church government are more likely to define ''tyranny'' as &quot;the imposition of unjust rule&quot;, a congregationally governed church would more likely define ''tyranny'' as &quot;transgression of liberty&quot; or equivalently, &quot;rule by one man&quot;. To a congregationalist, no abuse of authority is worse than the concentration of all decisive power in the hands of one ruling body, or one person.

Following this sentiment, congregationalism has evolved over time to include even more participation of the congregation, more kinds of lay committees to whom various tasks are apportioned, and more decisions subject to the vote of the entire membership.

One of the most notable characteristics of New England (or British)-heritage Congregationalism has been its consistent leadership role in the formation of &quot;unions&quot; with other churches. Such sentiments especially grew strong in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when ecumenism evolved out of a liberal, non-sectarian perspective on relations to other Christian groups that accompanied the relaxation of [[Calvinist]] stringencies held by earlier generations. The congregationalist theory of independence within a union has been a cornerstone of most ecumenical movements since the 18th century.

==Baptist churches==

Most [[Baptists]] hold that no denominational or ecclesiastical organization has inherent authority over an individual Baptist church. Churches can properly relate to each other under this polity only through voluntary cooperation, never by any sort of coercion. Furthermore, this Baptist polity calls for freedom from governmental control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pinson |first=William M., Jr. |year=2005 |title=Trends in Baptist Polity |url=http://www.baptisthistory.org/contissues/pinson.htm |url-status=dead |publisher=Baptist History and Heritage Society |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013130242/http://baptisthistory.org/contissues/pinson.htm |archive-date=13 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions to this local form of local governance include the [[Episcopal Baptist]]s that have an [[episcopal polity|episcopal system]].

[[Independent Baptist]] churches have no formal organizational structure above the level of the local congregation. More generally among [[Baptists]], a variety of [[Parachurch organization|parachurch]] agencies and [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] educational institutions may be supported generously or not at all, depending entirely upon the local congregation's customs and predilections. Usually doctrinal conformity is held as a first consideration when a church makes a decision to grant or decline financial contributions to such agencies, which are legally external and separate from the congregations they serve. These practices also find currency among non-denominational fundamentalist or [[Charismatic (Christians)|charismatic]] fellowships, many of which derive from Baptist origins, culturally if not theologically.

Most [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] and [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist]] congregations, by contrast, generally relate more closely to external groups such as mission agencies and educational institutions than do those of independent persuasion. However, they adhere to a very similar [[ecclesiology]], refusing to permit outside control or oversight of the affairs of the local church.

==Churches of Christ==
{{see also|Sponsoring church (Churches of Christ)}}
Ecclesiastical government is congregational rather than denominational. [[Churches of Christ]] purposefully have no central headquarters, councils, or other organizational structure above the local church level.{{efn|According to ''The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement'':
{{quote|Churches of Christ from the beginning have maintained no formal organization structures larger than the local congregations and no official journals or vehicles declaring sanctioned positions. Consensus views do, however, often emerge through the influence of opinion leaders who express themselves in journals, at lectureships, or at area preacher meetings and other gatherings.{{sfn|Foster|Blowers|Dunnavant|Williams|2004a|p=213}}}}}}{{sfnm |1a1=Foster |1a2=Blowers |1a3=Dunnavant |1a4=Williams |1y=2004a |1p=213 |2a1=Hughes |2y=2005 |2p=214 |3a1=Magida |3a2=Matlins |3y=1999 |3p=103 |4a1=Rhodes |4y=2005 |4p=124}} Rather, the independent congregations are a network with each congregation participating at its own discretion in various means of service and fellowship with other congregations.{{efn|[[Everett Ferguson]] wrote, &quot;Churches of Christ adhere to a strict congregationalism that cooperates in various projects overseen by one congregation or organized as parachurch enterprises, but many congregations hold themselves apart from such cooperative projects.&quot;{{sfn|Ferguson|2004|p=206}}}}{{sfnm |1a1=Ferguson |1y=2004 |1p=206 |2a1=Rhodes |2y=2005 |2p=124 |3a1=Garrett |3y=2002 |3p=449}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Who Are the churches of Christ&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Baxter |first=Batsell Barrett |author-link=Batsell Barrett Baxter |title=Who Are the Churches of Christ and What Do They Believe in? |url=http://woodsonchapel.com/coc.cfm |location=Nashville, Tennessee |publisher=Woodson Chapel Church of Christ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616071601/http://woodsonchapel.com/coc.cfm |archive-date=16 June 2006 |access-date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Churches of Christ are linked by their shared commitment to restoration principles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Who Are the churches of Christ&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Magida|Matlins|1999|p=106}}

Congregations are generally overseen by a [[plurality (church governance)|plurality]] of [[elder (religious)|elder]]s (also known in some congregations as shepherds, bishops, or pastors) who are sometimes assisted in the administration of various works by [[deacon]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Who Are the churches of Christ&quot;/&gt;{{sfnm |1a1=Howard |1y=1971 |1pp=47, 54â€“55 |2a1=Rhodes |2y=2005 |2p=124}} Elders are generally seen as responsible for the spiritual welfare of the congregation, while deacons are seen as responsible for the non-spiritual needs of the church.{{sfn|Foster|Blowers|Dunnavant|Williams|2004b|p=531}} Deacons serve under the supervision of the elders, and are often assigned to direct specific ministries.{{sfn|Foster|Blowers|Dunnavant|Williams|2004b|p=531}} Successful service as a deacon is often seen as preparation for the eldership.{{sfn|Foster|Blowers|Dunnavant|Williams|2004b|p=531}} Elders and deacons are chosen by the congregation based on the qualifications found in Timothy 3 and Titus 1.{{sfnm |1a1=Ferguson |1y=1975 |2a1=Ferguson |2y=1996 |2pp=323, 335 |3a1=Howard |3y=1971 |3pp=48â€“53}} Congregations look for elders who have a mature enough understanding of scripture to enable them to supervise the minister and to teach, as well as to perform governance functions.{{sfn|Morgan|2004|p=298}} In lieu of willing men who meet these qualifications, congregations are sometimes overseen by an unelected committee of the congregation's men.{{sfn|Foster|Blowers|Dunnavant|Williams|2004b|p=531}}

While the early [[Restoration Movement]] had a tradition of itinerant [[preacher]]s rather than &quot;located Preachers&quot;, during the 20th century a long-term, formally trained congregational [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] became the norm among Churches of Christ.{{sfn|Foster|Blowers|Dunnavant|Williams|2004b|p=532}} Ministers are understood to serve under the oversight of the elders.{{sfn|Morgan|2004|p=298}} While the presence of a long-term professional minister has sometimes created &quot;significant ''de facto'' ministerial authority&quot; and led to conflict between the minister and the elders, the eldership has remained the &quot;ultimate locus of authority in the congregation&quot;.{{sfn|Foster|Blowers|Dunnavant|Williams|2004b|p=531}}  There is a small group within the Churches of Christ which oppose a single preacher and, instead, rotate preaching duties among qualified elders (this group tends to overlap with groups which oppose Sunday School and also have only one cup to serve the Lord's Supper).

Churches of Christ hold to the [[priesthood of all believers]].{{sfn|Roberts|1979|pp=53â€“56}} No special titles are used for preachers or ministers that would identify them as [[clergy]].{{sfnm |1a1=Magida |1a2=Matlins |1y=1999 |1p=106 |2a1=Wharton |2y=1997 |2pp=112â€“113}} Churches of Christ emphasize that there is no distinction between &quot;clergy&quot; and &quot;[[laity]]&quot; and that every member has a gift and a role to play in accomplishing the work of the church.{{sfn|Sweet|2003|pp=38â€“40}}

==Congregational Methodist Church==
[[Methodist]]s who disagreed with the [[episcopal polity]] of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South]] (MECS) left their mother church to form the [[Congregational Methodist Church]], which retains [[Wesleyan-Arminian]] theology but adopts congregationalist polity as a distinctive.{{sfn|Matthews|2007|p=95}}
