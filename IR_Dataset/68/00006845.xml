'''Corinth''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|r|ɪ|n|θ}}; Modern {{lang-el|Κόρινθος}}, ''Kórinthos'', {{IPA-el|ˈkorinθos|pron|Ell-Korinthos.ogg}} is the successor to an ancient city, and is a former [[municipality]] in [[Corinthia]], [[Peloponnese (region)|Peloponnese]], which is located in south-central [[Greece]]. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the [[Corinth (municipality)|municipality of Corinth]], of which it is the seat and a municipal unit.&lt;ref name=Kallikratis&gt;[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior {{in lang|el}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the capital of Corinthia.

It was founded as '''Nea Korinthos''' or '''New Corinth''' (Νέα Κόρινθος) in 1858 after an earthquake destroyed the existing settlement of Corinth, which had developed in and around the site of [[ancient Corinth]].

== Geography ==
[[File:View of the Gulf of Corinth and the modern city of Corinth from the Castle of Acrocorinth.jpg|thumb|View of the Gulf of Corinth and modern Corinth from the Castle of Acrocorinth]]

Located about {{convert|78|km|mi|0}} west of [[Athens]], Corinth is surrounded by the coastal townlets of (clockwise) [[Lechaio]], [[Isthmia, Corinthia|Isthmia]], [[Kechries]], and the inland townlets of [[Examilia]] and the archaeological site and village of ancient Corinth. Natural features around the city include the narrow coastal plain of [[Vocha (plain of)|Vocha]], the [[Gulf of Corinth|Corinthian Gulf]], the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] cut by its [[Corinth Canal|canal]], the [[Saronic Gulf]], the [[Oneia Mountains]], and the monolithic rock of [[Acrocorinth]], where the medieval [[acropolis]] was built.

== History ==
{{Further|Ancient Corinth}}
[[File:Sack of Corinth by Thomas Allom 1870.jpg|thumb|left|260px|The Roman sack of Corinth in 146 BCE (Thomas Allom, 1870)]]
Corinth derives its name from [[Ancient Corinth]], a [[city-state]] of antiquity. The site was occupied from before 3000 BC. But historical sources about the city concerns the early 8th century BC, when Corinth began to develop as a commercial center. Between the 8th and 7th centuries, the Bacchiad family ruled Corinth. [[Cypselus]] overthrew the [[Bacchiad]] family, and between 657 and 550 BC, he and his son [[Periander]] ruled Corinth as the Tyrants. 

In about 550 BC, an oligarchical government seized power. This government allied with [[Sparta]] within the [[Peloponnesian League]], and Corinth participated in the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian Wars]] and [[Peloponnesian War]] as an ally of Sparta. After Sparta's victory in the Peloponnesian war, the two allies fell out with one another, and Corinth pursued an independent policy in the various wars of the early 4th century BC. After the Macedonian conquest of Greece, the [[Acrocorinth]] was the seat of a Macedonian garrison until 243 BC, when the city was liberated and joined the [[Achaean League]]. Nearly a century later, in 146 BC, Corinth was captured and was completely destroyed by the Roman army.

As a newly rebuilt Roman colony in 44 BC, Corinth flourished and became the administrative capital of the Roman province of [[Achaea]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/place/Corinth-Greece&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1858, the old city, now known as [[Ancient Corinth]] (Αρχαία Κόρινθος, ''Archaia Korinthos''), located {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=off}} south-west of the modern city, was totally destroyed by a magnitude 6.5 earthquake. '''New Corinth''' (''Nea Korinthos'') was then built to the north-east of it, on the coast of the Gulf of Corinth. In 1928 a magnitude 6.3 earthquake devastated the new city, which was then rebuilt on the same site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsapanos|first1=Theodoros M.|title=Deterministic seismic hazard analysis for the city of Corinth, central Greece|journal=Journal of the Balkan Geophysical Society|date=March 2011|volume=14|issue=1|pages=1–14|url=http://www.balkangeophysoc.gr/online-journal/2011_V14/No1_March2011/JBGS_Vol_14_No1_March_2011_p00-14_Tsapanos_et_al.pdf|accessdate=21 July 2015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933 there was a great fire, and the new city was rebuilt again.

The Municipality of Corinth (Δήμος Κορινθίων) had a population of 58,192 according to the 2011 census, the second most populous municipality in the [[Peloponnese Region]] after [[Kalamata]].&lt;ref name=census11 /&gt; The municipal unit of Corinth had 38,132 inhabitants, of which Corinth itself had 30,176 inhabitants, placing it in third place behind Kalamata and [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]] among the cities of the Peloponnese Region.&lt;ref name=census11 /&gt;

The municipal unit of Corinth (Δημοτική ενότητα Κορινθίων) includes apart from Corinth proper the town of [[Archaia Korinthos]] (2,198 inhabitants in 2011), the town of [[Examilia]] (2,905 inhabitants), and the smaller settlements of [[Xylokeriza]] (1,316 inhabitants) and [[Solomos, Corinthia|Solomos]] (817 inhabitants).&lt;ref name=census11 /&gt; The municipal unit has an area of 102.187&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=stat01&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dlib.statistics.gr/Book/GRESYE_02_0101_00098%20.pdf |publisher=National Statistical Service of Greece |title=Population &amp; housing census 2001 (incl. area and average elevation) |language=el |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921212047/http://dlib.statistics.gr/Book/GRESYE_02_0101_00098%20.pdf |archivedate=21 September 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
=== Industry ===
Corinth is a major industrial hub at a national level. The [[Corinth Refinery]] is one of the largest [[oil refining]] industrial complexes in [[Europe]]. Ceramic tiles, copper cables, gums, gypsum, marble, meat products (including leather), medical equipment, mineral water and beverages, petroleum products, and salt are produced nearby. {{As of|2005}}, a period of [[deindustrialization]] commenced as a large pipework complex, a textile factory and a meat packing facility diminished their operations.

== Transport ==
[[File:Corinth Isthmus rail road bridge.jpg|thumb|The rail road bridge over the Isthmus of Corinth.]]

=== Roads ===
Corinth is a major road hub. The [[Moreas Motorway|A7]] [[toll road|toll]] motorway for [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]] and [[Kalamata]], (and Sparta via [[Moreas Motorway|A71]] [[toll road|toll]]), branches off the [[Motorway 8 (Greece)|A8]]/[[European route E94]] [[toll road|toll]] motorway from Athens at Corinth. Corinth is the main entry point to the Peloponnesian peninsula, the southernmost area of continental Greece.

=== Bus ===
[[KTEL (Greece)|KTEL]] [http://www.ktelkorinthias.gr/en/ Korinthias] provides intercity bus service in the peninsula and to Athens via the Isthmos station southeast of the city center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corinth – Map and travel Information|url=http://www.visit-ancient-greece.com/corinth-greece.html|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local bus service is also available.

=== Railways ===
In 2005, the city was connected to the [[Proastiakos]], the Athens suburban rail network, following the completion of the new [[Corinth railway station]].

=== Port ===
The port of Corinth, located north of the city centre and close to the northwest entrance of the [[Corinth Canal]], at 37 56.0’ N / 22 56.0’ E, serves the local needs of industry and agriculture. It is mainly a cargo exporting facility.

It is an artificial harbour (depth approximately {{convert|9|m|ft}}, protected by a concrete [[mole (architecture)|mole]] (length approximately 930 metres, width 100 metres, mole surface 93,000 m2). A new pier finished in the late 1980s doubled the capacity of the port. The reinforced mole protects anchored vessels from strong northern winds.

Within the port operates a [[customs]] office facility and a [[Hellenic Coast Guard]] post. Sea traffic is limited to trade in the export of local produce, mainly citrus fruits, grapes, marble, aggregates and some domestic imports. The port operates as a contingency facility for general cargo ships, [[bulk carrier]]s and [[RORO]]s, in case of [[strike action|strikes]] at [[Piraeus]] port.

==== Ferries ====
There was formerly a [[ferry]] link to [[Catania]], [[Sicily]] and [[Genoa]]  in [[Italy]].

=== Canal ===
{{Main|Corinth Canal}}
[[File:Corinth Canal by Frank van Mierlo.jpg|thumb|View of the Corinth Canal.]]
The [[Corinth Canal]], carrying ship traffic between the western [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Aegean Sea]], is about {{convert|4|km}} east of the city, cutting through the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] that connects the Peloponnesian peninsula to the Greek mainland, thus effectively making the former an island. The builders dug the canal through the Isthmus at sea level; no locks are employed. It is {{convert|6.4|km}} in length and only {{convert|21.3|m}} wide at its base, making it impassable for most modern ships. It now has little economic importance.

The canal was mooted in classical times and an abortive effort was made to build it in the 1st century AD. [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Caligula]] both considered digging the canal but died before starting the construction.&lt;ref&gt;https://theculturetrip.com/europe/greece/articles/a-brief-history-of-the-corinth-canal/&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor [[Nero]] was the first to attempt to construct the canal. The Roman workforce responsible for the initial digging consisted of 6,000 Jewish [[prisoners of war]]. Modern construction started in 1882, after Greece gained independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]], but was hampered by geological and financial problems that bankrupted the original builders. It was completed in 1893, but due to the canal's narrowness, navigational problems and periodic closures to repair landslips from its steep walls, it failed to attract the level of traffic anticipated by its operators. It is now used mainly for tourist traffic.

== Sport ==
The city's [[association football]] team is [[Korinthos F.C.]] (''Π.Α.E. Κόρινθος''), established in 1999 after the merger of Pankorinthian Football Club (''Παγκορινθιακός'') and Corinth Football Club (''Κόρινθος''). During the 2006–2007 season, the team played in the Greek Fourth Division's Regional Group 7. The team went undefeated that season and it earned the top spot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paskorinthos.gr/2006-2007.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723000059/http://www.paskorinthos.gr/2006-2007.html |date=23 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This granted the team a promotion to the [[Gamma Ethniki|Gamma Ethnikí (Third Division)]] for the 2007–2008 season. For the 2008–2009 season, Korinthos F.C. competed in the Gamma Ethniki (Third Division) southern grouping.
