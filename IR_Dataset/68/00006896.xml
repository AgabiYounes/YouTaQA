The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to chemistry:

'''[[Chemistry]]''' is the [[science]] of atomic [[matter]] (matter that is composed of [[chemical element]]s), especially its [[chemical reaction]]s, but also including its properties, structure, composition, behavior, and changes as they relate to the chemical reactions.&lt;ref name=definition&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chemweb.ucc.ie/what_is_chemistry.htm |title=What is Chemistry? |publisher=Chemweb.ucc.ie |date= |accessdate=2011-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Chemistry Chemistry]. (n.d.). Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary. Retrieved August 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Chemistry is centrally concerned with atoms and their interactions with other atoms, and particularly with the properties of [[chemical bond]]s.

== Summary of chemistry ==
Chemistry can be described as all of the following:
* An [[academic discipline]]  &amp;ndash; one with academic departments, curricula and degrees; national and international societies; and specialized journals.
* A scientific field (a branch of [[science]]) &amp;ndash; widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature. Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published. There are several geophysics-related scientific journals.
** A [[natural science]] &amp;ndash; one that seeks to elucidate the rules that govern the [[nature|natural]] world using [[Empirical method|empirical]] and [[scientific method]].
*** A [[physical science]] &amp;ndash; one that studies non-living systems.

==Branches of chemistry==
* [[Physical chemistry]] &amp;ndash; study of the physical and fundamental basis of chemical systems and processes. In particular, the energetics and dynamics of such systems and processes are of interest to physical chemists. Important areas of study include [[chemical thermodynamics]], [[chemical kinetics]], [[electrochemistry]], [[statistical mechanics]], [[spectroscopy]], and more recently, [[astrochemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Herbst, Eric | title = Chemistry of Star-Forming Regions | journal = Journal of Physical Chemistry A | date = May 12, 2005 | volume = 109 | pages = 4017–4029 | issue = 18 | doi = 10.1021/jp050461c | pmid = 16833724| bibcode = 2005JPCA..109.4017H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical chemistry has large overlap with [[molecular physics]].
