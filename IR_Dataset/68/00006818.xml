In addition, the cycle provides [[precursor (chemistry)|precursors]] of certain amino acids, as well as the [[reducing agent]] [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]], that are used in numerous other reactions. Its central importance to many biochemical pathways suggests that it was one of the earliest established components of cellular [[metabolism]] and may have originated [[abiogenesis|abiogenically]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wagner|first1=Andreas|title=Arrival of the Fittest|date=2014|publisher=PenguinYork|isbn=9781591846468|page=100|edition=first}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-393-06596-0&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Lane, Nick | title = Life Ascending: The Ten Great Inventions of Evolution | url = https://archive.org/details/lifeascendingten0000lane | url-access = registration | publisher = W.

The name of this metabolic pathway is derived from the [[citric acid]] (a type of [[tricarboxylic acid]], often called citrate, as the ionized form predominates at biological pH&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;) that is consumed and then regenerated by this sequence of reactions to complete the cycle. The cycle consumes acetate (in the form of [[acetyl-CoA]]) and [[water]], reduces [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] to NADH, and produces carbon dioxide as a waste byproduct. The NADH generated by the citric acid cycle is fed into the [[oxidative phosphorylation]] (electron transport) pathway. The net result of these two closely linked pathways is the oxidation of nutrients to produce usable chemical energy in the form of ATP.

In [[eukaryotic]] cells, the citric acid cycle occurs in the matrix of the mitochondrion. In [[prokaryotic]] cells, such as bacteria, which lack mitochondria, the citric acid cycle reaction sequence is performed in the cytosol with the proton gradient for ATP production being across the cell's surface (plasma membrane) rather than the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. The overall yield of energy-containing compounds from the TCA cycle is three NADH, one [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], and one [[guanosine triphosphate|GTP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marks' basic medical biochemistry : a clinical approach|last=Lieberman |first=Michael |date=2013|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|others=Marks, Allan D., Peet, Alisa.|isbn=9781608315727|edition=Fourth|location=Philadelphia|oclc=769803483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==
Several of the components and reactions of the citric acid cycle were established in the 1930s by the research of [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]], who received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1937 specifically for his discoveries pertaining to [[fumaric acid]], a key component of the cycle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nobel_Prize_1937&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1937/ | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1937 | access-date = 2011-10-26 | publisher = The Nobel Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was able to make this discovery successful with the help of pigeon breast muscle. Because this tissue maintains its oxidative capacity well after breaking down in the &quot;Latapie&quot; mill and releasing in aqueous solutions, breast muscle of the pigeon was very well qualified for the study of oxidative reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Chandramana, Sudeep. (2014). Inclusive Growth And Youth Empowerment: Adevelopment Model For Aspirational India. Journal of Science, Technology and Management. 7. 52–62. &lt;/ref&gt; The citric acid cycle itself was finally identified in 1937 by [[Hans Adolf Krebs]] and William Arthur Johnson while at the [[University of Sheffield]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krebs HA, Johnson WA | title = Metabolism of ketonic acids in animal tissues | journal = The Biochemical Journal | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 645–60 | date = April 1937 | pmid = 16746382 | pmc = 1266984 | doi = 10.1042/bj0310645 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for which the former received the [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] in 1953, and for whom the cycle is sometimes named (Krebs cycle).&lt;ref name=&quot;Nobel_Prize_1953&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1953/ | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1953 | access-date = 2011-10-26 | publisher = The Nobel Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Acetyl-CoA-2D_colored.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Structural diagram of [[acetyl-CoA]]: The portion in blue, on the left, is the [[Acetyl|acetyl group]]; the portion in black is [[coenzyme A]].]]
The citric acid cycle is a key metabolic pathway that connects carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. The reactions of the cycle are carried out by eight enzymes that completely oxidize acetate (a two carbon molecule), in the form of acetyl-CoA, into two molecules each of carbon dioxide and water. Through [[catabolism]] of sugars, fats, and proteins, the two-carbon organic product acetyl-CoA (a form of acetate) is produced which enters the citric acid cycle. The reactions of the cycle also convert three equivalents of [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) into three equivalents of reduced NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (NADH), one equivalent of [[flavin adenine dinucleotide]] (FAD) into one equivalent of FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and one equivalent each of [[guanosine diphosphate]] (GDP) and inorganic [[phosphate]] (P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) into one equivalent of [[guanosine triphosphate]] (GTP). The NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generated by the citric acid cycle are, in turn, used by the [[oxidative phosphorylation]] pathway to generate energy-rich ATP.

One of the primary sources of acetyl-CoA is from the breakdown of sugars by [[glycolysis]] which yield [[pyruvic acid|pyruvate]] that in turn is decarboxylated by the [[pyruvate dehydrogenase complex]] generating acetyl-CoA according to the following reaction scheme:

: [[pyruvic acid|{{underset|pyruvate|2=CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C(=O)C(=O)O&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;}}]] + [[Coenzyme A|HSCoA]] + [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] → [[acetyl-CoA|{{underset|acetyl-CoA|2=CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C(=O)SCoA}}]] + NADH + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The product of this reaction, acetyl-CoA, is the starting point for the citric acid cycle. Acetyl-CoA may also be obtained from the oxidation of fatty acids. Below is a schematic outline of the cycle:
* The [[citric acid]] cycle begins with the transfer of a two-carbon [[acetyl]] group from acetyl-CoA to the four-carbon acceptor compound (oxaloacetate) to form a six-carbon compound (citrate).
* The citrate then goes through a series of chemical transformations, losing two [[carboxyl]] groups as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The carbons lost as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; originate from what was oxaloacetate, not directly from acetyl-CoA. The carbons donated by acetyl-CoA become part of the oxaloacetate carbon backbone after the first turn of the citric acid cycle. Loss of the acetyl-CoA-donated carbons as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; requires several turns of the citric acid cycle. However, because of the role of the citric acid cycle in [[anabolic|anabolism]], they might not be lost, since many citric acid cycle intermediates are also used as precursors for the biosynthesis of other molecules.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid2106256&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolfe RR, Jahoor F | title = Recovery of labeled CO2 during the infusion of C-1- vs C-2-labeled acetate: implications for tracer studies of substrate oxidation | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 248–52 | date = February 1990 | pmid = 2106256 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/51.2.248 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Most of the energy made available by the oxidative steps of the cycle is transferred as energy-rich [[electrons]] to NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, forming NADH. For each acetyl group that enters the citric acid cycle, three molecules of NADH are produced. The citric acid cycle includes a series of oxidation reduction reaction in mitochondria .{{Clarification needed|date=September 2019}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Jeremy M.|last2=Tymoczko|first2=John L.|last3=Stryer|first3=Lubert|date=2002|title=The Citric Acid Cycle|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21163/|journal=Biochemistry. 5th edition|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In addition, electrons from the succinate oxidation step are transferred first to the [[FAD]] cofactor of succinate dehydrogenase, reducing it to FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and eventually to [[ubiquinone]] (Q) in the mitochondrial membrane, reducing it to ubiquinol (QH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) which is a substrate of the electron transfer chain at the level of [[Complex III]].
* For every NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that are produced in the citric acid cycle, 2.5 and 1.5 ATP molecules are generated in oxidative phosphorylation, respectively.
* At the end of each cycle, the four-carbon oxaloacetate has been regenerated, and the cycle continues.

== Steps ==
There are ten basic steps in the citric acid cycle, as outlined below. The cycle is continuously supplied with new carbon in the form of acetyl-CoA, entering at step 0 in the table.&lt;ref name = Biochemistryofplants/&gt;

Two [[carbon]] atoms are [[oxidation|oxidized]] to [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], the energy from these reactions is transferred to other metabolic processes through [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] (or ATP), and as electrons in [[NADH]] and [[Ubiquinol|QH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The NADH generated in the citric acid cycle may later be oxidized (donate its electrons) to drive ATP synthesis in a type of process called [[oxidative phosphorylation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] is covalently attached to [[succinate dehydrogenase]], an enzyme which functions both in the CAC and the mitochondrial [[electron transport chain]] in oxidative phosphorylation. FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, therefore, facilitates transfer of electrons to [[coenzyme Q]], which is the final electron acceptor of the reaction catalyzed by the succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex, also acting as an intermediate in the electron transport chain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stryer&quot;&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Stryer L, Berg J, Tymoczko JL | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W.

== Products ==

Because two acetyl-CoA [[molecules]] are produced from each [[glucose]] molecule, two cycles are required per glucose molecule. Therefore, at the end of two cycles, the products are: two GTP, six NADH, two QH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and four CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The total number of ATP molecules obtained after complete oxidation of one glucose in glycolysis, citric acid cycle, and [[oxidative phosphorylation]] is estimated to be between 30 and 38.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid7654171&quot;/&gt;

== Efficiency ==
The theoretical maximum yield of ATP through oxidation of one molecule of glucose in glycolysis, citric acid cycle, and [[oxidative phosphorylation]] is 38 (assuming 3 [[molar equivalent]]s of ATP per equivalent NADH and 2 ATP per UQH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). In eukaryotes, two equivalents of NADH and four equivalents of ATP are generated in [[glycolysis]], which takes place in the cytoplasm. Transport of two of these equivalents of NADH into the mitochondria consumes two equivalents of ATP, thus reducing the net production of ATP to 36. Furthermore, inefficiencies in [[oxidative phosphorylation]] due to leakage of protons across the mitochondrial membrane and slippage of the [[ATP synthase]]/proton pump commonly reduces the ATP yield from NADH and UQH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to less than the theoretical maximum yield.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid7654171&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Porter RK, Brand MD | title = Mitochondrial proton conductance and H+/O ratio are independent of electron transport rate in isolated hepatocytes | journal = The Biochemical Journal | volume = 310 | issue = 2 | pages = 379–82 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 7654171 | pmc = 1135905 | doi = 10.1042/bj3100379 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The observed yields are, therefore, closer to ~2.5 ATP per NADH and ~1.5 ATP per UQH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, further reducing the total net production of ATP to approximately 30.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-7167-4684-0&quot;&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Stryer L, Berg JM, Tymoczko JL | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W.

== Variation ==

While the citric acid cycle is in general highly conserved, there is significant variability in the enzymes found in different taxa&lt;ref name=&quot;Citric acid cycle variants at MetaCyc&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Citric acid cycle variants at MetaCyc | url = http://www.biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&amp;object=TCA-VARIANTS}}&lt;/ref&gt; (note that the diagrams on this page are specific to the mammalian pathway variant).

Some differences exist between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The conversion of D-''threo''-isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate is catalyzed in eukaryotes by the NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent [http://www.enzyme-database.org/query.php?ec=1.1.1.41 EC 1.1.1.41], while prokaryotes employ the NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent [http://www.enzyme-database.org/query.php?ec=1.1.1.42 EC 1.1.1.42].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12005040&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sahara T, Takada Y, Takeuchi Y, Yamaoka N, Fukunaga N | title = Cloning, sequencing, and expression of a gene encoding the monomeric isocitrate dehydrogenase of the nitrogen-fixing bacterium, Azotobacter vinelandii | journal = Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry | volume = 66 | issue = 3 | pages = 489–500 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 12005040 | doi = 10.1271/bbb.66.489 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bce94fd4fa8799ebd1e73cf2cccc5b70ff6eba70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the conversion of (''S'')-malate to oxaloacetate is catalyzed in eukaryotes by the NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent [http://www.enzyme-database.org/query.php?ec=1.1.1.37 EC 1.1.1.37], while most prokaryotes utilize a quinone-dependent enzyme, [http://www.enzyme-database.org/query.php?ec=1.1.5.4 EC 1.1.5.4].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11092847&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van der Rest ME, Frank C, Molenaar D | title = Functions of the membrane-associated and cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenases in the citric acid cycle of Escherichia coli | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 182 | issue = 24 | pages = 6892–9 | date = December 2000 | pmid = 11092847 | pmc = 94812 | doi = 10.1128/jb.182.24.6892-6899.2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A step with significant variability is the conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate. Most organisms utilize [http://www.enzyme-database.org/query.php?ec=6.2.1.5 EC 6.2.1.5], succinate–CoA ligase (ADP-forming) (despite its name, the enzyme operates in the pathway in the direction of ATP formation). In mammals a GTP-forming enzyme, succinate–CoA ligase (GDP-forming) ([http://www.enzyme-database.org/query.php?ec=6.2.1.4 EC 6.2.1.4]) also operates. The level of utilization of each isoform is tissue dependent.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15234968&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lambeth DO, Tews KN, Adkins S, Frohlich D, Milavetz BI | title = Expression of two succinyl-CoA synthetases with different nucleotide specificities in mammalian tissues | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 279 | issue = 35 | pages = 36621–4 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15234968 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M406884200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some acetate-producing bacteria, such as ''Acetobacter aceti'', an entirely different enzyme catalyzes this conversion&amp;nbsp;– [http://www.enzyme-database.org/query.php?ec=2.8.3.18 EC 2.8.3.18], succinyl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase.

Some variability also exists at the previous step&amp;nbsp;– the conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA. While most organisms utilize the ubiquitous NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, some bacteria utilize a ferredoxin-dependent 2-oxoglutarate synthase ([http://www.enzyme-database.org/query.php?ec=1.2.7.3 EC 1.2.7.3]).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19936047&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baughn AD, Garforth SJ, Vilchèze C, Jacobs WR | title = An anaerobic-type alpha-ketoglutarate ferredoxin oxidoreductase completes the oxidative tricarboxylic acid cycle of Mycobacterium tuberculosis | journal = PLoS Pathogens | volume = 5 | issue = 11 | pages = e1000662 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19936047 | pmc = 2773412 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000662 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation ==
'''Allosteric regulation by metabolites'''. The regulation of the citric acid cycle is largely determined by product inhibition and substrate availability. If the cycle were permitted to run unchecked, large amounts of metabolic energy could be wasted in overproduction of reduced coenzyme such as NADH and ATP. The major eventual substrate of the cycle is ADP which gets converted to ATP. A reduced amount of ADP causes accumulation of precursor NADH which in turn can inhibit a number of enzymes. NADH, a product of all dehydrogenases in the citric acid cycle with the exception of [[succinate dehydrogenase]], inhibits [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]], [[isocitrate dehydrogenase]], [[Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase|α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase]], and also [[citrate synthase]]. [[Acetyl-coA]] inhibits [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]], while [[succinyl-CoA]] inhibits alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and [[citrate synthase]]. When tested in vitro with TCA enzymes, '''ATP''' inhibits [[citrate synthase]] and [[Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase|α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase]]; however, ATP levels do not change more than 10% in vivo between rest and vigorous exercise. There is no known [[allosteric]] mechanism that can account for large changes in reaction rate from an [[allosteric]] effector whose concentration changes less than 10%.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Voet D, Voet JG | year = 2004 | title = Biochemistry | edition = 3rd | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. | location = New York | page = 615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Citrate''' is used for feedback inhibition, as it inhibits [[phosphofructokinase]], an enzyme involved in [[glycolysis]] that catalyses formation of [[fructose 1,6-bisphosphate]], a precursor of pyruvate. This prevents a constant high rate of flux when there is an accumulation of citrate and a decrease in substrate for the enzyme.

'''Regulation by calcium'''. Calcium is also used as a regulator in the citric acid cycle. Calcium levels in the mitochondrial matrix can reach up to the tens of micromolar levels during cellular activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ivannikov MV, Macleod GT | title = Mitochondrial free Ca²⁺ levels and their effects on energy metabolism in Drosophila motor nerve terminals | journal = Biophysical Journal | volume = 104 | issue = 11 | pages = 2353–61 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23746507 | pmc = 3672877 | doi = 10.1016/j.bpj.2013.03.064 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It activates [[pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase]] which in turn activates the [[pyruvate dehydrogenase complex]]. Calcium also activates [[isocitrate dehydrogenase]] and [[Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase|α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid171557&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Denton RM, Randle PJ, Bridges BJ, Cooper RH, Kerbey AL, Pask HT, Severson DL, Stansbie D, Whitehouse S | display-authors = 6 | title = Regulation of mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–53 | date = October 1975 | pmid = 171557 | doi = 10.1007/BF01731731 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This increases the reaction rate of many of the steps in the cycle, and therefore increases flux throughout the pathway.

'''Transcriptional regulation'''. Recent work has demonstrated an important link between intermediates of the citric acid cycle and the regulation of [[hypoxia-inducible factors]] ([[HIF1A|HIF]]). HIF plays a role in the regulation of oxygen homeostasis, and is a transcription factor that targets angiogenesis, vascular remodeling, glucose utilization, iron transport and apoptosis. HIF is synthesized constitutively, and hydroxylation of at least one of two critical proline residues mediates their interaction with the von Hippel Lindau [[E3 ubiquitin ligase]] complex, which targets them for rapid degradation. This reaction is catalysed by [[prolyl hydroxylase|prolyl 4-hydroxylases]]. Fumarate and succinate have been identified as potent inhibitors of prolyl hydroxylases, thus leading to the stabilisation of HIF.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17182618&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koivunen P, Hirsilä M, Remes AM, Hassinen IE, Kivirikko KI, Myllyharju J | title = Inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) hydroxylases by citric acid cycle intermediates: possible links between cell metabolism and stabilization of HIF | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 282 | issue = 7 | pages = 4524–32 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17182618 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M610415200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major metabolic pathways converging on the citric acid cycle ==
Several [[catabolic]] pathways converge on the citric acid cycle. Most of these reactions add intermediates to the citric acid cycle, and are therefore known as [[anaplerotic reactions]], from the Greek meaning to &quot;fill up&quot;. These increase the amount of acetyl CoA that the cycle is able to carry, increasing the mitochondrion's capability to carry out respiration if this is otherwise a limiting factor. Processes that remove intermediates from the cycle are termed &quot;cataplerotic&quot; reactions.

In this section and in the next, the citric acid cycle intermediates are indicated in ''italics'' to distinguish them from other substrates and end-products.

[[Pyruvate]] molecules produced by [[glycolysis]] are [[active transport|actively transported]] across the inner [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] membrane, and into the matrix. Here they can be [[Redox|oxidized]] and combined with [[coenzyme A]] to form CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''[[acetyl-CoA]]'', and [[NADH]], as in the normal cycle.&lt;ref name=Voet&gt;{{cite book |last=Voet |first=Donald |author2=Judith G. Voet |author3=Charlotte W. Pratt |title=Fundamentals of Biochemistry, 2nd Edition |publisher=John Wiley and Sons, Inc. |year=2006 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/fundamentalsofbi00voet_0/page/547 547, 556] |isbn=978-0-471-21495-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/fundamentalsofbi00voet_0/page/547 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is also possible for pyruvate to be [[carboxylated]] by [[pyruvate carboxylase]] to form ''oxaloacetate''. This latter reaction &quot;fills up&quot; the amount of ''oxaloacetate'' in the citric acid cycle, and is therefore an anaplerotic reaction, increasing the cycle’s capacity to metabolize ''acetyl-CoA'' when the tissue's energy needs (e.g. in [[striated muscle tissue|muscle]]) are suddenly increased by activity.&lt;ref name=stryer&gt;{{cite book |last1= Stryer |first1= Lubert | title=In: Biochemistry. |chapter= Citric acid cycle |edition= Fourth |location= New York |publisher= W. H. Freeman and Company|date= 1995 |pages= 509–527, 569–579, 614–616, 638–641, 732–735, 739–748, 770–773 |isbn=978-0-7167-2009-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the citric acid cycle all the intermediates (e.g. ''citrate'', ''iso-citrate'', ''alpha-ketoglutarate'', ''succinate'', ''fumarate'', ''malate'', and ''oxaloacetate'') are regenerated during each turn of the cycle. Adding more of any of these intermediates to the mitochondrion therefore means that that additional amount is retained within the cycle, increasing all the other intermediates as one is converted into the other. Hence the addition of any one of them to the cycle has an anaplerotic effect, and its removal has a cataplerotic effect. These anaplerotic and cataplerotic reactions will, during the course of the cycle, increase or decrease the amount of ''oxaloacetate'' available to combine with ''acetyl-CoA'' to form ''citric acid''. This in turn increases or decreases the rate of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] production by the mitochondrion, and thus the availability of ATP to the cell.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;

''Acetyl-CoA'', on the other hand, derived from pyruvate oxidation, or from the [[beta-oxidation]] of [[fatty acids]], is the only fuel to enter the citric acid cycle. With each turn of the cycle one molecule of ''acetyl-CoA'' is consumed for every molecule of ''oxaloacetate'' present in the mitochondrial matrix, and is never regenerated. It is the oxidation of the acetate portion of ''acetyl-CoA'' that produces CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water, with the energy thus released captured in the form of ATP.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt; The three steps of beta-oxidation resemble the steps that occur in the production of oxaloacetate from succinate in the TCA cycle. Acyl-CoA is oxidized to trans-Enoyl-CoA while FAD is reduced to FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is similar to the oxidation of succinate to fumarate. Following, trans-Enoyl-CoA is hydrated across the double bond to beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA, just like fumarate is hydrated to malate. Lastly, beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA is oxidized to beta-ketoacyl-CoA while NAD+ is reduced to NADH, which follows the same process as the oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Biochemistry |last=Garrett |first=Reginald H. |date=2013 |publisher=Brooks/Cole, Cengage Learning |last2=Grisham |first2=Charles M. |isbn=9781133106296 |edition=5th |location=Belmont, CA |pages=623–625, 771–773 |oclc=777722371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the liver, the carboxylation of [[cytosol]]ic pyruvate into intra-mitochondrial ''oxaloacetate'' is an early step in the [[gluconeogenesis|gluconeogenic]] pathway which converts [[lactic acid|lactate]] and de-aminated [[alanine]] into glucose,&lt;ref name=Voet /&gt;&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt; under the influence of high levels of [[glucagon]] and/or [[epinephrine]] in the blood.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt; Here the addition of ''oxaloacetate'' to the mitochondrion does not have a net anaplerotic effect, as another citric acid cycle intermediate (''malate'') is immediately removed from the mitochondrion to be converted into cytosolic oxaloacetate, which is ultimately converted into glucose, in a process that is almost the reverse of [[glycolysis]].&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;

In [[protein catabolism]], [[protein]]s are broken down by [[protease]]s into their constituent amino acids. Their carbon skeletons (i.e. the de-aminated amino acids) may either enter the citric acid cycle as intermediates (e.g. ''alpha-ketoglutarate'' derived from glutamate or glutamine), having an anaplerotic effect on the cycle, or, in the case of leucine, isoleucine, lysine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine, they are converted into ''acetyl-CoA'' which can be burned to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water, or used to form [[ketone bodies]], which too can only be burned in tissues other than the liver where they are formed, or excreted via the urine or breath.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt; These latter amino acids are therefore termed &quot;ketogenic&quot; amino acids, whereas those that enter the citric acid cycle as intermediates can only be cataplerotically removed by entering the gluconeogenic pathway via ''malate'' which is transported out of the mitochondrion to be converted into cytosolic oxaloacetate and ultimately into [[glucose]]. These are the so-called &quot;glucogenic&quot; amino acids. De-aminated alanine, cysteine, glycine, serine, and threonine are converted to pyruvate and can consequently either enter the citric acid cycle as ''oxaloacetate'' (an anaplerotic reaction) or as ''acetyl-CoA'' to be disposed of as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;

In [[fat catabolism]], [[triglyceride]]s are [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] to break them into [[fatty acid]]s and [[glycerol]]. In the liver the glycerol can be converted into glucose via [[dihydroxyacetone phosphate]] and [[glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate]] by way of gluconeogenesis. In many tissues, especially heart and skeletal muscle tissue, fatty acids are broken down through a process known as [[beta oxidation]], which results in the production of mitochondrial ''acetyl-CoA'', which can be used in the citric acid cycle. Beta oxidation of fatty acids with an odd number of [[methylene bridge]]s produces [[propionyl-CoA]], which is then converted into ''[[succinyl-CoA]]'' and fed into the citric acid cycle as an anaplerotic intermediate.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid2647392&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Halarnkar PP, Blomquist GJ | title = Comparative aspects of propionate metabolism | journal = Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology. B, Comparative Biochemistry | volume = 92 | issue = 2 | pages = 227–31 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2647392 | doi = 10.1016/0305-0491(89)90270-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total energy gained from the complete breakdown of one (six-carbon) molecule of glucose by [[glycolysis]], the formation of 2 ''acetyl-CoA'' molecules, their catabolism in the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation equals about 30 ATP molecules, in eukaryotes. The number of ATP molecules derived from the beta oxidation of a 6 carbon segment of a fatty acid chain, and the subsequent oxidation of the resulting 3 molecules of ''acetyl-CoA'' is 40.

== Citric acid cycle intermediates serve as substrates for biosynthetic processes ==
In this subheading, as in the previous one, the TCA intermediates are identified by ''italics''.

Several of the citric acid cycle intermediates are used for the synthesis of important compounds, which will have significant cataplerotic effects on the cycle.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;
''Acetyl-CoA'' cannot be transported out of the mitochondrion. To obtain cytosolic acetyl-CoA, ''citrate'' is removed from the citric acid cycle and carried across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol. There it is cleaved by [[ATP citrate lyase]] into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. The oxaloacetate is returned to mitochondrion as ''malate'' (and then converted back into ''oxaloacetate'' to transfer more ''acetyl-CoA'' out of the mitochondrion).&lt;ref name= ferre&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferré P, Foufelle F | title = SREBP-1c transcription factor and lipid homeostasis: clinical perspective | journal = Hormone Research | volume = 68 | issue = 2 | pages = 72–82 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17344645 | doi = 10.1159/000100426 | quote = this process is outlined graphically in page 73 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cytosolic acetyl-CoA is used for [[fatty acid synthesis]] and the [[Mevalonate pathway|production of cholesterol]]. Cholesterol can, in turn, be used to synthesize the [[Steroid#Steroidogenesis|steroid hormones]], [[Bile acids|bile salts]], and [[vitamin D]].&lt;ref name=Voet /&gt;&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;

The carbon skeletons of many [[Essential amino acid|non-essential amino acids]] are made from citric acid cycle intermediates. To turn them into amino acids the [[Keto acid|alpha keto-acids]] formed from the citric acid cycle intermediates have to acquire their amino groups from [[glutamate]] in a [[transamination]] reaction, in which [[Pyridoxine|pyridoxal phosphate]] is a cofactor. In this reaction the glutamate is converted into [[alpha-Ketoglutaric acid|''alpha-ketoglutarate'']], which is a citric acid cycle intermediate. The intermediates that can provide the carbon skeletons for amino acid synthesis are ''oxaloacetate'' which forms [[aspartate]] and [[asparagine]]; and ''alpha-ketoglutarate'' which forms [[glutamine]], [[proline]], and [[arginine]].&lt;ref name=Voet /&gt;&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;

Of these amino acids, aspartate and glutamine are used, together with carbon and nitrogen atoms from other sources, to form the [[purines]] that are used as the bases in [[DNA]] and [[RNA]], as well as in [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[Adenosine monophosphate|AMP]], [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]], [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]], [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FAD]] and [[Coenzyme A|CoA]].&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;

The [[pyrimidines]] are partly assembled from aspartate (derived from ''oxaloacetate''). The pyrimidines, [[thymine]], [[cytosine]] and [[uracil]], form the complementary bases to the purine bases in DNA and RNA, and are also components of [[Cytidine triphosphate|CTP]], [[Uridine monophosphate|UMP]], [[Uridine diphosphate|UDP]] and [[Uridine triphosphate|UTP]].&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;

The majority of the carbon atoms in the [[porphyrin]]s come from the citric acid cycle intermediate, ''[[succinyl-CoA]]''. These molecules are an important component of the [[hemoprotein]]s, such as [[hemoglobin]], [[myoglobin]] and various [[cytochrome]]s.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;

During gluconeogenesis [[Gluconeogenesis#Pathway|mitochondrial ''oxaloacetate'' is reduced to ''malate'']] which is then transported out of the mitochondrion, to be oxidized back to oxaloacetate in the cytosol. Cytosolic oxaloacetate is then decarboxylated to [[phosphoenolpyruvate]] by [[phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase]], which is the rate limiting step in the conversion of nearly all the gluconeogenic precursors (such as the glucogenic amino acids and lactate) into glucose by the liver and kidney.&lt;ref name=Voet /&gt;&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;

Because the citric acid cycle is involved in both [[catabolic]] and [[anabolic]] processes, it is known as an [[amphibolic]] pathway.

== Glucose feeds the TCA cycle via circulating lactate ==
The metabolic role of [[Lactic acid|lactate]] is well recognized as a fuel for [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]s and [[Neoplasm|tumor]]s. In the classical [[Cori cycle]], muscles produce lactate which is then taken up by the [[liver]] for [[gluconeogenesis]]. New studies suggest that lactate can be used as a source of [[carbon]] for the TCA cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hui S, Ghergurovich JM, Morscher RJ, Jang C, Teng X, Lu W, Esparza LA, Reya T, Yanxiang Guo J, White E, Rabinowitz JD | display-authors = 6 | title = Glucose feeds the TCA cycle via circulating lactate | journal = Nature | volume = 551 | issue = 7678 | pages = 115–118 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 29045397 | pmc = 5898814 | doi = 10.1038/nature24057 | authorlink8 = Tannishtha Reya }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution ==
It is believed that components of the citric acid cycle were derived from [[anaerobic bacteria]], and that the TCA cycle itself may have evolved more than once.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid3332996&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gest H | title = Evolutionary roots of the citric acid cycle in prokaryotes | journal = Biochemical Society Symposium | volume = 54 | issue =  | pages = 3–16 | year = 1987 | pmid = 3332996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically, several alternatives to the TCA cycle exist; however, the TCA cycle appears to be the most efficient.
