'''Cavalry''' (from the French ''cavalerie'', cf. ''cheval'' 'horse') or '''horsemen''' are [[soldier]]s or [[warrior]]s who [[Horses in warfare|fight mounted]] on [[horseback]]. Cavalry were historically the most mobile of the [[combat arms]]. An individual soldier in the cavalry is known by a number of designations such as '''cavalryman''', '''horseman''', '''[[dragoon]]''', or '''[[trooper (rank)|trooper]]'''. The designation of cavalry was not usually given to any [[Military animal|military forces that used other animals]], such as [[Camel cavalry|camels]], mules or [[War elephant|elephants]]. [[Infantry]] who moved on horseback, but dismounted to fight on foot, were known in the 17th and early 18th centuries as [[dragoon]]s, a class of [[mounted infantry]] which later evolved into cavalry proper while retaining their historic title.

Cavalry had the advantage of improved mobility, and a man fighting from horseback also had the advantages of greater height, speed, and [[inertial mass]] over an opponent on foot. Another element of horse mounted warfare is the psychological impact a mounted soldier can inflict on an opponent.

The speed, mobility, and shock value of cavalry was greatly appreciated and exploited in armed forces in the [[Ancient era|Ancient]] and [[Horses in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]]; some forces were mostly cavalry, particularly in [[eurasian nomads|nomadic societies of Asia]], notably the [[Huns]] of [[Attila]] and the later [[Mongol Army|Mongol armies]].&lt;ref&gt;
John Keegan, pages 188-189, ''[[A History of Warfare]],'' {{ISBN|0-09-174527-6}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe cavalry became increasingly [[Heavy cavalry|armoured (heavy)]], and eventually evolving into the mounted [[knight]]s of the medieval period. During the 17th century cavalry in Europe lost most of its armor, ineffective against the muskets and cannon which were coming into use, and by the mid-19th century armor had mainly fallen into disuse, although some regiments retained a small thickened [[cuirass]] that offered protection against lances and sabres and some protection against shot.

In [[Interwar period|the period]] between the [[World Wars]], many cavalry units were converted into [[motorized infantry]] and [[mechanized infantry]] units, or reformed as tank troops. However, some cavalry still served during [[World War II]], notably in the [[Red Army]], the [[Mongolian People's Army]], the [[Royal Italian Army]], the [[Romania in World War II|Romanian Army]], the [[Polish Land Forces]], and light reconnaissance units within the [[Waffen SS]]. Most cavalry units that are horse-mounted in modern armies serve in purely ceremonial roles, or as mounted infantry in difficult terrain such as mountains or heavily forested areas. Modern usage of the term generally refers to units performing the role of reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA).

In many modern armies, the term ''cavalry'' is still often used to refer to units that are a [[Combat Arms|combat arm]] of the [[armed forces]] which in the past filled the traditional horse-borne land combat [[light cavalry]] roles. These include [[reconnaissance|scouting]], [[skirmishing]] with enemy reconnaissance elements to deny them knowledge of the disposition of the main body of troops, forward security, offensive [[Reconnaissance#Reconnaissance-in-force|reconnaissance by combat]], defensive screening of friendly forces during retrograde movement, [[retreat (military)|retreat]], restoration of command and control, deception, battle handover and passage of lines, [[relief in place]], linkup, [[Breakout (military)|breakout]] operations, and [[Raid (military)|raiding]]. The [[shock attack|shock]] role, traditionally filled by [[heavy cavalry]], is generally filled by [[Military unit|unit]]s with the &quot;[[Armoured warfare|armored]]&quot; designation.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==History==

===Origins===

[[File:Assyriancavalry.JPG|thumb|left|[[Assyrian cavalry]]]]
Before the [[Iron Age]], the role of cavalry on the battlefield was largely performed by light [[chariot]]s. The chariot originated with the [[Sintashta-Petrovka]] culture in [[Central Asia]] and spread by [[nomad]]ic or semi-nomadic [[Indo-Iranians]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 1, Menon&lt;/ref&gt; The chariot was quickly adopted by settled peoples both as a military technology and an object of ceremonial status, especially by the [[pharaoh]]s of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] from 1550 BC as well as the [[Assyrian army]] and [[Babylonia]]n royalty.&lt;ref&gt;Terrence Wise, p. 18, &quot;Ancient Armies of the Middle East&quot;, Osprey Publishing Ltd 1981 {{ISBN|0-85045-384-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power of mobility given by mounted units was recognized early on, but was offset by the difficulty of raising large forces and by the inability of [[horse]]s (then mostly small) to carry heavy [[armor]]. Nonetheless, there are indications that, from the 15th century BC onwards, horseback riding was practiced amongst the military elites of the great states of the ancient Near East, most notably those in [[Egypt]], [[Assyria]], the [[Hittite Empire]], and [[Mycenaean Greece]] &lt;ref&gt; https://www.academia.edu/1532320/Horseback_riding_and_Cavalry_in_Mycenaean_Greece&lt;/ref&gt;.

Cavalry techniques, and the rise of true cavalry, were an innovation of [[equestrian nomad]]s of the Central Asian and [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] steppe and [[pastoral farming|pastoralist]] [[tribe]]s such as the [[Persian people|Iranic]] [[Parthia]]ns and [[Sarmatians]].
[[File:ParthianHorseman.jpg|thumb|upright|Parthian horseman, now on display at the [[Palazzo Madama, Turin]].]]

The photograph above left shows Assyrian cavalry from reliefs of 865–860 BC. At this time, the men had no [[spur]]s, [[saddle]]s, [[saddle cloth]]s, or [[stirrup]]s. Fighting from the back of a horse was much more difficult than mere riding. The cavalry acted in pairs; the reins of the [[mounted archer]] were controlled by his neighbour's hand. Even at this early time, cavalry used swords, shields, and bows. The sculpture implies two types of cavalry, but this might be a simplification by the artist. Later images of Assyrian cavalry show saddle cloths as primitive saddles, allowing each archer to control his own horse.&lt;ref&gt;Terrence Wise, plate H, &quot;Ancient Armies of the Middle East&quot;, Osprey Publishing Ltd 1981 {{ISBN|0-85045-384-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 490 BC a [[Nisean horse|breed of large horses]] was bred in the [[Nisaean plain]] in Media to carry [[Cataphract|men with increasing amounts of armour]] (Herodotus 7,40 &amp; 9,20), but large horses were still very exceptional at this time. By the fourth century BC the Chinese during the [[Warring States period]] (403&amp;ndash;221 BC) began to use cavalry against rival states,&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey 29 30&quot;&gt;Ebrey and others, ''Pre-Modern East Asia'', pp. 29&amp;ndash;30.&lt;/ref&gt; and by 331 BC when [[Alexander the Great]] defeated the Persians the use of chariots in battle was obsolete in most nations; despite a few ineffective attempts to revive [[scythed chariot]]s. The last recorded use of chariots as a shock force in continental Europe was during the [[Battle of Telamon]] in 225 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Warry|page=164|title=Warfare in the Classical World|ISBN=0-86101-034-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, chariots remained in use for ceremonial purposes such as carrying the victorious general in a [[Roman triumph]], or for racing.

Outside of mainland Europe, the southern [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] met [[Julius Caesar]] with chariots in [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|55 and 54 BC]], but by the time of the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] a century later chariots were obsolete, even in Britannia. The last mention of chariot use in Britain was by the [[Caledonia]]ns at the [[Battle of Mons Graupius|Mons Graupius]], in 84 AD.

===Ancient Greece: city-states, Thebes, Thessaly and Macedonia===

{{main|hippeis|companion cavalry}}

During the classical Greek period cavalry were usually limited to those citizens who could afford expensive war-horses. Three types of cavalry became common: light cavalry, whose riders, armed with [[javelin]]s, could harass and skirmish; heavy cavalry, whose troopers, using [[lance]]s, had the ability to close in on their opponents; and finally those whose equipment allowed them to fight either on horseback or foot. The role of horsemen did however remain secondary to that of the [[hoplites]] or heavy infantry who comprised the main strength of the citizen levies of the various city states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Warry|page=37|title=Warfare in the Classical World|ISBN=0-86101-034-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cavalry played a relatively minor role in [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[city-states]], with conflicts decided by massed armored infantry. However, [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] produced [[Pelopidas]], her first great cavalry commander, whose tactics and skills were absorbed by [[Phillip II of Macedon]] when Phillip was a guest-hostage in Thebes. [[Thessaly]] was widely known for producing competent cavalrymen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|page=18|title=The Army of Alexander the Great|ISBN=0-85045-539-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later experiences in wars both with and against the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]]s taught the [[Greeks]] the value of cavalry in skirmishing and pursuit. The [[Athens|Athenian]] author and soldier [[Xenophon]] in particular advocated the creation of a small but well-trained cavalry force; to that end, he wrote several manuals on horsemanship and cavalry operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Warry|page=54|title=Warfare in the Classical World|ISBN=0-86101-034-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Macedon]]ian Kingdom in the north, on the other hand, developed a strong cavalry force that culminated in the ''hetairoi'' ([[Companion cavalry]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|page=17|title=The Army of Alexander the Great|ISBN=0-85045-539-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Philip II of Macedon and [[Alexander the Great]]. In addition to these heavy cavalry, the Macedonian army also employed lighter horsemen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nicholas|last=Sekunda|page=42|title=Macedonian Armies after Alexander 323-168 BC|ISBN=978-1-84908-714-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; called [[prodromoi]] for scouting and screening, as well as the [[Macedonian phalanx|Macedonian pike phalanx]] and various kinds of [[light infantry]]. There were also the ''Ippiko'' (or &quot;Horserider&quot;), Greek &quot;heavy&quot; cavalry, armed with [[Kontos (weapon)|kontos]] (or cavalry lance), and sword. These wore leather armour or mail plus a helmet. They were medium rather than heavy cavalry, meaning that they were better suited to be scouts, skirmishers, and pursuers rather than front line fighters. The effectiveness of this combination of cavalry and infantry helped to break enemy lines and was most dramatically demonstrated in Alexander's conquests of [[Persia]], [[Bactria]], and northwestern India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|pages=14–22|title=The Army of Alexander the Great|ISBN=0-85045-539-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Republic and Early Empire===

[[File:Köln Reitergrabmal.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Tombstone of a Roman [[auxilia]]ry trooper from [[History of Cologne|Cologne]], Germany. Second half of the first century AD]]
The cavalry in the early [[Roman Republic]] remained the preserve of the wealthy [[landed class]] known as the ''[[equites]]''—men who could afford the expense of maintaining a horse in addition to arms and armor heavier than those of the common [[Roman legion|legion]]s. Horses were provided by the Republic and could be withdrawn if neglected or misused, together with the status of being a cavalryman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|page=36|title=Republican Roman Army 200-104 BC|ISBN=1-85532-598-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the class grew to be more of a social elite instead of a functional property-based military grouping, the Romans began to employ Italian [[socii]] for filling the ranks of their cavalry. The weakness of Roman cavalry was demonstrated by Hannibal Barca during the [[Second Punic War]] where he used his superior mounted forces to win several battles. The most notable of these was the [[Battle of Cannae]], where he inflicted a catastrophic defeat on the Romans. At about the same time the Romans began to recruit foreign auxiliary cavalry from among [[Gauls]], [[Iberians]], and [[Numidians]], the last being highly valued as mounted skirmishers and scouts (see [[Numidian cavalry]]). [[Julius Caesar]] had a high opinion of his escort of Germanic mixed cavalry, giving rise to the ''[[cohors equitata|Cohortes Equitatae]]''. Early emperors maintained an [[Ala (Roman cavalry unit)|ala]] of [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]]an cavalry as their [[Germanic bodyguard|personal bodyguards]] until the unit was dismissed by [[Galba]] after the [[Batavian Rebellion]].

For the most part, Roman cavalry during the early Republic functioned as an adjunct to the legionary infantry and formed only one-fifth of the standing force comprising a consular army. Except in times of major mobilisation about 1,800 horsemen were maintained, with three hundred attached to each legion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|pages=36–37|title=Republican Roman Army 200-104 BC|ISBN=1-85532-598-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The relatively low ratio of horsemen to infantry does not mean that the utility of cavalry should be underestimated, as its strategic role in scouting, skirmishing, and outpost duties was crucial to the Romans' capability to conduct operations over long distances in hostile or unfamiliar territory. On some occasions Roman cavalry also proved its ability to strike a decisive tactical blow against a weakened or unprepared enemy, such as the final charge at the [[Battle of Aquilonia]].

After defeats such as the [[Battle of Carrhae]], the Romans learned the importance of large cavalry formations from the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Negin|page=6|title=Roman heavy Cavalry (1) Cataphractarii &amp; Clibanarii, 1st Century BC-5th Century AD.|ISBN=978-1-4728-3004-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
At the same time heavy spears and shields modelled on those favoured by the horsemen of the Greek city-states were adopted to replace the lighter weaponry of early Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|page=38|title=Republican Roman Army 200-104 BC|ISBN=1-85532-598-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
These improvements in tactics and equipment reflected those of a thousand years earlier when the first Iranians to reach the [[Iranian Plateau]] forced the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] to undertake similar reform. Nonetheless, the Romans would continue to rely mainly on their [[heavy infantry]] supported by auxiliary cavalry.

===Late Roman Empire and the Migration Period===
In the army of the late [[Roman Empire]], cavalry played an increasingly important role. The [[Spatha]], the classical sword throughout most of the 1st millennium was adopted as the standard model for the Empire's cavalry forces.

The most widespread employment of heavy cavalry at this time was found in the forces of the Iranian empires, the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]]s and their [[Persians|Persian]] [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] successors. Both, but especially the former, were famed for the [[cataphract]] (fully armored cavalry armed with lances) even though the majority of their forces consisted of lighter [[horse archer]]s. The West first encountered this eastern heavy cavalry during the [[Hellenistic period]] with further intensive contacts during the eight centuries of the [[Roman–Persian Wars]]. At first the Parthians' mobility greatly confounded the Romans, whose armoured close-order infantry proved unable to match the speed of the Parthians. However, later the Romans would successfully adapt such heavy armor and cavalry tactics by creating their own units of cataphracts and ''clibanarii''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/mhq/blromespersianmirage/ |title=Roman-Persian Wars |work=Historynet.com |accessdate=November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline of the Roman infrastructure made it more difficult to field large infantry forces, and during the 4th and 5th centuries cavalry began to take a more dominant role on the European battlefield, also in part made possible by the appearance of new, larger breeds of horses. The replacement of the Roman [[horse tack|saddle]] by variants on the Scythian model, with [[pommel (saddle)|pommel]] and cantle,&lt;ref&gt;The raised rear part of a saddle&lt;/ref&gt; was also a significant factor as was the adoption of [[stirrup]]s and the concomitant increase in stability of the rider's seat. Armored cataphracts began to be deployed in eastern Europe and the Near East, following the precedents established by [[History of Iran|Persia]]n forces, as the main striking force of the armies in contrast to the earlier roles of cavalry as scouts, raiders, and outflankers.

The late-Roman cavalry tradition of organized units in a standing army differed fundamentally from the nobility of the Germanic invaders—individual warriors who could afford to provide their own horses and equipment. While there was no direct linkage with these predecessors the early medieval knight also developed as a member of a social and martial elite, able to meet the considerable expenses required by his role from grants of land and other incomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter |last=Newark|pages=23–24|title=Sabre &amp; Lance.

[[Xiongnu]], [[Tujue]], [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Kipchaks]], [[Mongol]]s, [[Don Cossack]]s and the various [[Turkic peoples]] are also examples of the horse-mounted groups that managed to gain substantial successes in military conflicts with settled agrarian and urban societies, due to their strategic and tactical mobility. As European states began to assume the character of bureaucratic [[nation-states]] supporting professional standing armies, recruitment of these mounted warriors was undertaken in order to fill the strategic roles of scouts and raiders.
[[File:DiezAlbumsArmedRiders II.jpg|thumb|Mongols at war 14th century]]

The best known instance of the continued employment of mounted tribal auxiliaries were the Cossack cavalry regiments of the [[Russian Empire]]. In eastern Europe, Russia, and out onto the [[steppes]], cavalry remained important much longer and dominated the scene of warfare until the early 17th century and even beyond, as the strategic mobility of cavalry was crucial for the semi-nomadic [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] lives that many steppe cultures led.&lt;!-- This needs a re-write as the chronology is all over the place --&gt; [[Tibet]]ans also had a tradition of cavalry warfare, in several military engagements with the Chinese [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907 AD).

Further east, the [[Military history of China (pre-1911)|military history of China]], specifically [[North China|northern China]], held a long tradition of intense military exchange between [[Han Chinese]] infantry forces of the settled dynastic empires and the mounted [[nomads]] or &quot;barbarians&quot; of the north. The [[naval history of China]] was centered more to the south, where mountains, rivers, and large lakes necessitated the employment of a large and well-kept [[Naval warfare|navy]].

In 307 BC, [[King Wuling of Zhao]], the ancient Chinese ruler of the former [[Jin (Chinese state)|State of Jin]] territory, ordered his military commanders and troops to adopt the [[trousers]] of the [[nomad]]s as well as practice the nomads' form of mounted archery to hone their new cavalry skills.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey 29 30&quot; /&gt;

The adoption of massed cavalry in China also broke the tradition of the [[Chariot (Ancient China)|chariot]]-riding [[Four occupations|Chinese aristocracy]] in battle, which had been in use since the ancient [[Shang Dynasty]] (c 1600–1050 BC).&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey 29&quot;&gt;Ebrey, 29.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time large Chinese infantry-based armies of 100,000 to 200,000 troops were now buttressed with several hundred thousand mounted cavalry in support or as an effective striking force.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey 30&quot;&gt;Ebrey, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The handheld pistol-and-trigger [[crossbow]] was invented in China in the fourth century BC;&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey cambridge 41&quot;&gt;Ebrey, ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 41.&lt;/ref&gt; it was written by the [[Song dynasty]] scholars Zeng Gongliang, Ding Du, and Yang Weide in their book ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' (1044 AD) that massed missile fire by crossbowmen was the most effective defense against enemy cavalry charges.&lt;ref name=&quot;peers 130&quot;&gt;Peers, 130. we can right anything&lt;/ref&gt;

On many occasions the Chinese studied nomadic cavalry tactics and applied the lessons in creating their own potent cavalry forces, while in others they simply recruited the tribal horsemen wholesale into their armies; and in yet other cases nomadic empires proved eager to enlist Chinese infantry and engineering, as in the case of the [[Mongol Empire]] and its sinicized part, the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1279–1368). The Chinese recognized early on during the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC – 220 AD) that they were at a disadvantage in lacking the number of horses the northern nomadic peoples mustered in their armies. [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r 141–87 BC) went to war with the [[Dayuan]] for this reason, since the Dayuan were hoarding a massive amount of tall, strong, Central Asian bred horses in the [[Hellenized]]–[[Greeks|Greek]] region of [[Fergana]] (established slightly earlier by [[Alexander the Great]]). Although experiencing some defeats early on in the campaign, Emperor Wu's war from 104 BC to 102 BC succeeded in gathering the prized tribute of horses from Fergana.

Cavalry tactics in China were enhanced by the invention of the saddle-attached [[stirrup]] by at least the 4th century, as the oldest reliable depiction of a rider with paired stirrups was found in a [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]] tomb of the year 322 AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dien&quot;&gt;[http://www.silk-road.com/artl/stirrup.shtml Dien, Albert. &quot;THE STIRRUP AND ITS EFFECT ON CHINESE MILITARY HISTORY&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071013231319/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_1988_Oct/ai_6955868 &quot;The stirrup – history of Chinese science&quot;.

The horse warfare of [[History of Korea|Korea]] was first started during the ancient Korean kingdom [[Gojoseon]]. Since at least the 3rd century BC, there was influence of northern [[nomad]]ic peoples and [[Yemaek]] peoples on Korean warfare. By roughly the first century BC, the ancient kingdom of [[Buyeo Kingdom|Buyeo]] also had mounted warriors.&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey, 120.&lt;/ref&gt; The cavalry of [[Goguryeo]], one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], were called ''Gaemamusa'' (개마무사, 鎧馬武士), and were renowned as a fearsome heavy cavalry force. [[Gwanggaeto the Great of Goguryeo|King Gwanggaeto the Great]] often led expeditions into the [[Baekje]], [[Gaya confederacy]], [[Buyeo Kingdom|Buyeo]], [[Later Yan]] and against [[Yamato period|Japanese]] invaders with his cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Peter H &amp; Wm. Theodore De Bary. Sources of Korean Tradition, pp. 24–26. Columbia University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 12th century, [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] tribes began to violate the Goryeo–Jurchen borders, and eventually invaded [[Goryeo]] Korea. After experiencing the invasion by the Jurchen, Korean general [[Yun Gwan]] realized that Goryeo lacked efficient cavalry units. He reorganized the Goryeo military into a professional army that would contain decent and well-trained cavalry units. In 1107, the Jurchen were ultimately defeated, and surrendered to Yun Gwan. To mark the victory, General Yun built nine fortresses to the northeast of the Goryeo–Jurchen borders (동북 9성, 東北 九城).[[File:Samurai on horseback.png|thumb|upright|A mounted [[samurai]] with bow and arrows, wearing a horned helmet.

The [[History of Japan|ancient Japanese]] of the [[Kofun period]] also adopted [[Kofun period#Introduction of equine culture to Japan|cavalry and equine culture]] by the 5th century AD. The emergence of the [[samurai]] aristocracy led to the development of armoured horse archers, themselves to develop into charging [[lancer]] cavalry as gunpowder weapons rendered bows obsolete.

An example is Yabusame (流鏑馬?), a type of mounted archery in traditional Japanese archery. An archer on a running horse shoots three special &quot;turnip-headed&quot; arrows successively at three wooden targets.

This style of archery has its origins at the beginning of the Kamakura period. Minamoto no Yoritomo became alarmed at the lack of archery skills his samurai had. He organized yabusame as a form of practice.
Currently, the best places to see yabusame performed are at the Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū in Kamakura and Shimogamo Shrine in Kyoto (during Aoi Matsuri in early May). It is also performed in Samukawa and on the beach at Zushi, as well as other locations.

Kasagake or Kasakake (笠懸, かさがけ lit. &quot;hat shooting&quot;) is a type of Japanese mounted archery. In contrast to yabusame, the types of targets are various and the archer shoots without stopping the horse. While yabusame has been played as a part of formal ceremonies, kasagake has developed as a game or practice of martial arts, focusing on technical elements of horse archery.

====South Asia====
In the Indian subcontinent, cavalry played a major role from the [[Gupta Dynasty]] (320–600) period onwards. India has also the oldest evidence for the introduction of toe-[[stirrup]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/invention-of-the-stirrup-195161|title=Invention of the Stirrup|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian literature contains numerous references to the cavalry forces of the [[Central Asia]]n horse nomads like the [[Saka]]s, [[Kambojas]], [[Yona|Yavanas]], [[The Pahlavas|Pahlavas]] and [[Paradas]]. Numerous [[Puranas|Puranic]] texts refer to a conflict in ancient India (16th century BC)&lt;ref&gt;pp. 182–183, Pargiter.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the cavalry forces of five nations, called five hordes (''pañca.ganan'') or [[Kshatriya|Kṣatriya]] hordes (''Kṣatriya ganah''), attacked and captured the throne of Ayudhya by dethroning its [[Vedic period|Vedic]] King Bahu&lt;ref&gt;Harivamsa 14.1–19; Vayu Purana 88.127–43; Brahma Purana (8.35–51); Brahamanda Purana (3.63.123–141); Shiva Purana (7.61.23); Vishnu Purana (5.3.15–21), Padama Purana (6.21.16–33) etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kurukshetra.jpg|thumb|left|Manuscript illustration of the Battle of Kurukshetra]]

The [[Mahabharata]], [[Ramayana]], numerous [[Puranas]] and some foreign sources numerously attest that Kamboja cavalry was frequently requisitioned in ancient wars. V. R. Ramachandra Dikshitar writes: &quot;Both the Puranas and the epics agree that the horses of the Sindhu and Kamboja regions were of the finest breed, and that the services of the Kambojas as cavalry troopers were requisitioned in ancient wars&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;War in Ancient India, 1944, p. 178, V.

Mahabharata (c 950 BC)&lt;ref&gt;p. 182, Pargiter&lt;/ref&gt; speaks of the esteemed cavalry of the Kambojas, Sakas, Yavanas and [[Tusharas]], all of whom had participated in the [[Kurukshetra War and the Kambojas|Kurukshetra war]] under the supreme command of [[Kamboja Kingdom|Kamboja]] ruler [[Sudakshina Kamboja|Sudakshin Kamboj]].&lt;ref&gt;MBH 1.185.13; Felicitation Volume Presented to Professor Sripad Krishna Belvalkar, 1957, p. 260, Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Shripad Krishna Belvalkar.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahabharata and Vishnudharmottara Purana especially styles the Kambojas, Yavansa, Gandharas etc. as &quot;Ashva.yuddha.kushalah&quot; (expert cavalrymen).&lt;ref&gt;Ashva.yuddha.kushalah: Mahabharata 7.7.14; See also: Vishnudharmottara Purana, Part II, Chapter 118; Post Gupta Polity (500–700 AD): A Study of the Growth of Feudal Elements and Rural Administration 1972, p. 136, Ganesh Prasad Sinha; Wisdom in the Puranas 1969, p. 64, professor Sen Sarma etc.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Mahabharata war, the Kamboja cavalry along with that of the Sakas, Yavanas is reported to have been enlisted by the [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]] king [[Duryodhana]] of [[Hastinapur]]a.&lt;ref&gt;Some Kṣatriya Tribes of Ancient India, 1924, p. 238, Dr B.

[[Herodotus]] (c 484 – c 425 BC) attests that the [[Gandhara|Gandarian]] mercenaries (i.e. ''Gandharans/Kambojans'' of Gandari Strapy of [[Achaemenids]]) from the 20th strapy of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]]s were recruited in the army of emperor [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes I]] (486–465 BC), which he led against the [[Greeks|Hellas]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, Book VII 65, 70, 86, 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the ''men of the Mountain Land '' from north of [[Kabul|Kabol]]-River equivalent to medieval [[Kohistan District, North West Frontier Province|Kohistan]] (Pakistan), figure in the army of [[Darius III]] against [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] at [[Battle of Gaugamela|Arbela]] with a cavalry and 15 elephants.&lt;ref&gt;History of Persian Empire, p. 232, Dr A.

The [[Sanskrit]] drama ''Mudra-rakashas'' by ''Visakha Dutta'' and the [[Jainism|Jaina]] work ''[[Parishishtaparvan]]'' refer to [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]]'s (c 320 BC – c 298 BC) alliance with [[Himalaya]]n king ''Parvataka''. The [[Himalaya]]n alliance gave Chandragupta a formidable composite army made up of the cavalry forces of the Shakas, Yavanas, Kambojas, Kiratas, Parasikas and Bahlikas as attested by Mudra-Rakashas (Mudra-Rakshasa 2).&lt;ref&gt;In Sanskrit:
:''asti tava Shaka-Yavana-Kirata-Kamboja-Parasika-Bahlika parbhutibhih''
:''Chankyamatipragrahittaishcha Chandergupta Parvateshvara''
:''balairudidhibhiriva parchalitsalilaih samantaad uprudham Kusumpurama''
: (Mudra-Rakshasa 2).&lt;/ref&gt; These hordes had helped [[Chandragupta Maurya]] defeat the ruler of [[Magadha]] and placed Chandragupta on the throne, thus laying the foundations of [[Mauryan Dynasty]] in Northern India.

The cavalry of [[Hunas]] and the Kambojas is also attested in the [[Raghuvaṃśa|Raghu Vamsa]] epic poem of Sanskrit poet [[Kalidasa]].&lt;ref&gt;Kālidāsa, 1960, p. 141, Raghunath Damodar Karmarkar.&lt;/ref&gt; Raghu of Kalidasa is believed to be [[Chandragupta II]] (''Vikaramaditya'') (375–413/15 AD), of the well-known [[Gupta Dynasty]].

As late as mediaeval era, the Kamboja cavalry had also formed part of the Gurjara-Pratihara armed forces from the eighth to the 10th centuries AD. They had come to [[Bengal]] with the [[Pratihara]]s when the latter conquered part of the province.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Historical Quarterly, XV-4, December 1939, p. 511 Dr H. C. Ray.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;History of Ancient Bengal, 1971, pp. 182–83, Dr [[R. C. Majumdar]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Indian Historical Quarterly, 1963, p. 625.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dynastic History of Magadha, 1977, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epigraphia Indiaca, XVIII, p. 304ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Kambojas were constituted into military ''Sanghas'' and Srenis (Corporations) to manage their political and military affairs, as [[Arthashastra]] of [[Kautiliya]] as well as the [[Mahabharata]] amply attest for us. They are attested to be living as ''Ayuddha-jivi'' or ''Shastr-opajivis'' (Nation-in-arms), which also means that the Kamboja cavalry offered its [[military]] services to other nations as well. There are numerous references to Kambojas having been requisitioned as cavalry [[trooper (rank)|trooper]]s in ancient wars by outside [[nation]]s.

===European Middle Ages===

[[File:Bayeux Tapestry scene51 Battle of Hastings Norman knights and archers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Horse-mounted [[Normans]] charging in the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], 11th century.]]
As the quality and availability of [[heavy infantry]] declined in Europe with the fall of the Roman Empire, [[heavy cavalry]] became more effective. Infantry that lack the cohesion and discipline of tight formations are more susceptible to being broken and scattered by [[shock combat]]—the main role of heavy cavalry, which rose to become the dominant force on the European battlefield.

As heavy cavalry increased in importance, it became the main focus of military development. The arms and armour for heavy cavalry increased, the high-backed [[saddle]] developed, and [[stirrup]]s and [[spur]]s were added, increasing the advantage of heavy cavalry even more.

This shift in military importance was reflected in society as well; [[knight]]s took centre stage both on and off the battlefield. These are considered the &quot;ultimate&quot; in heavy cavalry: well-equipped with the best weapons, state-of-the-art armour from head to foot, leading with the [[lance]] in battle in a full-gallop, close-formation &quot;knightly charge&quot; that might prove irresistible, winning the battle almost as soon as it begun.

[[File:Husitsky bojovy vuz replika.jpg|thumb|right|A Hussite war wagon: it enabled peasants to defeat knights]]
But knights remained the minority of total available combat forces; the expense of arms, armour, and horses was only affordable to a select few. While mounted men-at-arms focused on a narrow combat role of shock combat, medieval armies relied on a large variety of foot troops to fulfill all the rest ([[skirmishing]], flank guards, scouting, holding ground, etc.). Medieval chroniclers tended to pay undue attention to the knights at the expense of the common soldiers, which led early students of military history to suppose that heavy cavalry was the only force that mattered on medieval European battlefields. But well-trained and disciplined infantry could defeat knights.

Massed [[English longbow]]men triumphed over French cavalry at [[Battle of Crécy|Crécy]], [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers]] and [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]], while at [[Battle of Gisors|Gisors]] (1188), [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]] (1314), and [[Battle of Laupen|Laupen]] (1339),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=H.W.|last=Koch|page=[https://archive.org/details/medievalwarfare00koch/page/189 189]|title=Medieval Warfare|ISBN=0-86124-008-1|url=https://archive.org/details/medievalwarfare00koch/page/189}}&lt;/ref&gt; foot-soldiers proved they could resist cavalry charges as long as they held their formation. Once the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] developed their [[pike square]]s for offensive as well as defensive use, infantry started to become the principal arm. This aggressive new doctrine gave the Swiss victory over a range of adversaries, and their enemies found that the only reliable way to defeat them was by the use of an even more comprehensive [[combined arms]] doctrine, as evidenced in the [[Battle of Marignano]]. The introduction of missile weapons that required less skill than the longbow, such as the [[crossbow]] and [[hand cannon]], also helped remove the focus somewhat from cavalry elites to masses of cheap infantry equipped with easy-to-learn weapons. These missile weapons were very successfully used in the [[Hussite Wars]], in combination with [[Wagenburg]] tactics.

This gradual rise in the dominance of infantry led to the adoption of dismounted tactics. From the earliest times knights and mounted men-at-arms had frequently dismounted to handle enemies they could not overcome on horseback, such as in the [[Battle of the Dyle]] (891) and the [[Battle of Bremule]] (1119), but after the 1350s this trend became more marked with the dismounted men-at-arms fighting as super-heavy infantry with two-handed [[sword]]s and [[poleaxe]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In any case, warfare in the Middle Ages tended to be dominated by raids and sieges rather than pitched battles, and mounted men-at-arms rarely had any choice other than dismounting when faced with the prospect of assaulting a fortified position.

([https://web.archive.org/web/20110728084550/http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/SM_tsn/ch6s1.html online])&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Expedition of Zaid ibn Haritha (Al-Is)|expedition of Zaid ibn Haritha in al-Is]] which took place in September, 627 AD, fifth month of 6 AH of the [[Islamic calendar]].&lt;ref name=hawarey&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawarey|first=[http://mosab.hawarey.org/ Dr. Mosab]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vJVqNwAACAAJ&amp;dq=9789957051648|isbn=9789957051648|title=The Journey of Prophecy; Days of Peace and War (Arabic)|publisher=Islamic Book Trust |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early organized Arab mounted forces under the [[Rashidun]] [[caliphate]] comprised a [[light cavalry]] armed with [[lance]] and [[sword]]. Its main role was to attack the enemy flanks and rear. These relatively lightly armored horsemen formed the most effective element of the Muslim armies during the later stages of the Islamic conquest of the Levant. The best use of this lightly armed fast moving cavalry was revealed at the '''[[Battle of Yarmouk]]''' (636 AD) in which [[Khalid ibn Walid]], knowing the skills of his horsemen, used them to turn the tables at every critical instance of the battle with their ability to engage, disengage, then turn back and attack again from the flank or rear. A strong cavalry regiment was formed by Khalid ibn Walid which included the veterans of the campaign of Iraq and Syria. Early Muslim historians have given it the name ''Mutaharrik tulai'a''( متحرك طليعة ), or the [[Mobile guard]]. This was used as an advance guard and a strong striking force to route the opposing armies with its greater mobility that give it an upper hand when maneuvering against any [[Byzantine]] army. With this mobile striking force, the conquest of Syria was made easy.&lt;ref&gt;p. 239, Muir&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Battle of Talas]] in 751 AD was a conflict between the Arab [[Abbasid]] Caliphate and the [[China|Chinese]] [[Tang dynasty]] over the control of [[Central Asia]]. Chinese infantry were routed by [[Arab]] cavalry near the bank of the River Talas.

Later [[Mamluk]]s were trained as cavalry soldiers. Mamluks were to follow the dictates of [[Furusiyya|al-furusiyya]],&lt;ref&gt;tradition of al-furusiyya is defined by principles of horsemanship, chivalry, and the mutual dependence of the rider and the horse&lt;/ref&gt; a code of conduct that included values like courage and generosity but also doctrine of cavalry tactics, horsemanship, archery and treatment of wounds.

The Islamic Berber states of North Africa employed elite horse mounted cavalry armed with spears and following the model of the original Arab occupiers of the region. Horse-harness and weapons were manufactured locally and the six-monthly stipends for horsemen were double those of their infantry counterparts. During the 8th century Islamic conquest of Iberia large numbers of horses and riders were shipped from North Africa, to specialise in raiding and the provision of support for the massed Berber footmen of the main armies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Dr. David|last=Nicole|page=17|title=The Moors.

The Mughal armies (''lashkar'') were primarily a cavalry force. The elite corps were the ''ahadi'' who provided direct service to the Emperor and acted as guard cavalry. Supplementary cavalry or ''dakhilis'' were recruited, equipped and paid by the central state. This was in contrast to the ''tabinan'' horsemen who were the followers of individual noblemen. Their training and equipment varied widely but they made up the backbone of the Mughal cavalry. Finally there were tribal irregulars led by and loyal to tributary chiefs. These included Hindus, Afghans and Turks summoned for military service when their autonomous leaders were called on by the Imperial government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Dr. David|last=Nicolle|pages=10–11|title=Mughul India 1504–1761|ISBN=1-85532-344-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Retable de l'Agneau mystique (8).jpg|thumb|left|upright=.9|Knighted cavalry and noblemen, painting by [[Jan van Eyck]] (c. 1390–1441).]]
Ironically, the rise of infantry in the early 16th century coincided with the &quot;golden age&quot; of heavy cavalry; a French or Spanish army at the beginning of the century could have up to half its numbers made up of various kinds of light and heavy cavalry, whereas in earlier medieval and later 17th-century armies the proportion of cavalry was seldom more than a quarter.

Knighthood largely lost its military functions and became more closely tied to social and economic prestige in an increasingly capitalistic Western society. With the rise of drilled and trained infantry, the mounted men-at-arms, now sometimes called ''[[gendarme (historical)|gendarmes]]'' and often part of the standing army themselves, adopted the same role as in the Hellenistic age, that of delivering a decisive blow once the battle was already engaged, either by charging the enemy in the flank or attacking their commander-in-chief.

[[File:Husarz, Józef Brandt, 1890.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Polish hussars|Husarz]]'' (Polish Hussar) by [[Józef Brandt]].]]

From the 1550s onwards, the use of [[Gunpowder warfare|gunpowder weapons]] solidified infantry's dominance of the battlefield and began to allow true mass armies to develop. This is closely related to the increase in the size of armies throughout the early modern period; heavily armored cavalrymen were expensive to raise and maintain and it took years to replace a skilled horseman or a trained horse, while [[arquebusier]]s and later [[musketeer]]s could be trained and kept in the field at much lower cost, and were much easier to replace.

The Spanish [[tercio]] and later formations relegated cavalry to a supporting role. The [[pistol]] was specifically developed to try to bring cavalry back into the conflict, together with manoeuvres such as the [[caracole]]. The caracole was not particularly successful, however, and the charge (whether with sword, pistol, or lance) remained as the primary mode of employment for many types of European cavalry, although by this time it was delivered in much deeper formations and with greater discipline than before. The [[demi-lancer]]s and the heavily armored sword-and-pistol [[reiter]]s were among the types of cavalry whose heyday was in the 16th and 17th centuries, as for the [[Polish Hussars|Polish winged hussars]], a heavy cavalry force that achieved great success against [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]], [[Tsardom of Russia|Russians]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]].

===18th-century Europe and Napoleonic Wars===
[[File:Battle of Eylau 1807 by Jean-Antoine-Siméon.jpg|thumb|left|Cavalry charge at [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]], painted by [[Jean-Antoine-Siméon Fort]].]]

Cavalry retained an important role in this age of regularization and standardization across European armies. First and foremost they remained the primary choice for confronting enemy cavalry. Attacking an unbroken infantry force head-on usually resulted in failure, but extended linear infantry formations were vulnerable to flank or rear attacks. Cavalry was important at [[Battle of Blenheim|Blenheim]] (1704), [[Battle of Rossbach|Rossbach]] (1757), [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]] and [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]] (1807), remaining significant throughout the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

Even with the increasing prominence of infantry, cavalry still had an important place in armies.  They often patrolled the fringes of army encampments or provided [[Picket (military)|outpost pickets]] in advance of the main body. During battle they might charge and override artillery cannon,  plugging the touchholes with iron spikes.  They also pursued enemy infantrymen who had broken from formation, as well as snipers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Great Big Book of Horrible Things]]|last=White|first=Matthew|authorlink=Matthew White (atrocitologist)|publisher=[[W. W. Norton]]|year=2012|page=363|isbn=9780393081923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest cavalry charge of modern history was at the 1807 [[battle of Eylau]], when the entire 11,000-strong French cavalry reserve, led by Maréchal Murat, launched a huge charge on and through the Russian infantry lines. However, in 1815 at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], repeated [[Battle of Waterloo#The French cavalry attack|charges by up to 9,000 French cavalrymen]] failed to break the line of the British and German infantry, who had formed [[Infantry square|square]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/battle_waterloo_01.shtml#five BBC History: The Battle of Waterloo]&lt;/ref&gt;

Massed infantry was deadly to cavalry, but offered an excellent target for [[artillery]]. Once the bombardment had disordered the infantry formation, cavalry were able to [[rout]] and pursue the scattered foot soldiers. It was not until individual firearms gained accuracy and improved rates of fire that cavalry was diminished in this role as well. Even then light cavalry remained an indispensable tool for scouting, screening the army's movements, and harassing the enemy's supply lines until military aircraft supplanted them in this role in the early stages of [[World War I]].

===19th century===

====Europe====
By the 19th century, European cavalry fell into four main categories:

* [[Cuirassier]]s, heavy cavalry
* [[Dragoon]]s, originally mounted infantry but later regarded as medium cavalry
* [[Hussar]]s, light cavalry
* [[Lancer]]s or [[Uhlan]]s, light cavalry armed with [[lance]]s

There were cavalry variations for individual nations as well: France had the ''chasseurs à cheval''; Prussia had the ''Jäger zu Pferd''; Bavaria, Saxony and Austria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Knotel|pages=24, 182 &amp; 230|title=Uniforms of the World. A Compendium of Army, Navy, and Air Force Uniforms 1700-1937|ISBN=0-684-16304-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; had the ''Chevaulegers''; and Russia had Cossacks. Britain, from the mid-18th century, had Light Dragoons as light cavalry and Dragoons, Dragoon Guards and [[Household Cavalry]] as heavy cavalry. Only after the end of the Napoleonic wars were the Household Cavalry equipped with cuirasses, and some other regiments were converted to lancers. In the [[United States Army]] the cavalry were almost always dragoons. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] had its cavalry uniformed as [[hussar]]s, but they fought as dragoons.

In the [[Crimean War]], the [[Charge of the Light Brigade]] and the [[The Thin Red Line (Battle of Balaclava)|Thin Red Line]] at the [[Battle of Balaclava]] showed the vulnerability of cavalry, when deployed without effective support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UreS--MoD0C&amp;pg=PA40 |first=Guy |last=Arnold |title=Historical Dictionary of the Crimean War |publisher=Scarecrow Press Inc |year=2002 |isbn=0-8108-4276-9 |pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
[[File:Union cavalry charge culpepper.jpg|right|thumb|[[Union Cavalry]] capture [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] guns at [[Culpeper, Virginia|Culpepper]].]]

In the early [[American Civil War]] the regular United States Army mounted rifle, dragoon, and two existing cavalry regiments were reorganized and renamed cavalry regiments, of which there were six.&lt;ref&gt;Gervase Phillips, &quot;Writing Horses into American Civil War History&quot;. ''War in History'' 20.2 (2013): 160-181.&lt;/ref&gt; Over a hundred other federal and state cavalry regiments were organized, but the infantry played a much larger role in many battles due to its larger numbers, lower cost per rifle fielded, and much easier recruitment. However, cavalry saw a role as part of screening forces and in foraging and scouting. The later phases of the war saw the [[Union Army|Federal army]] developing a truly effective cavalry force fighting as [[Reconnaissance|scouts]], raiders, and, with repeating rifles, as [[mounted infantry]]. The distinguished 1st Virginia Cavalry ranks as one of the most effectual and successful cavalry units on the Confederate side. Noted cavalry commanders included Confederate general [[J.E.B. Stuart]], [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]], and [[John Singleton Mosby]] (a.k.a. &quot;The Grey Ghost&quot;) and on the Union side, [[Philip Sheridan]] and [[George Armstrong Custer]].&lt;ref&gt;Starr Stephen Z. ''The Union Cavalry in the Civil War, '' (3 vols. LSU Press, 1979–81)&lt;/ref&gt;
Post Civil War, as the volunteer armies disbanded, the regular army cavalry regiments increased in number from six to ten, among them Custer's [[U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment]] of [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|Little Bighorn]] fame, and the [[African-American]] [[U.S. 9th Cavalry Regiment]] and [[U.S. 10th Cavalry Regiment]]. The black units, along with others (both cavalry and infantry), collectively became known as the [[Buffalo Soldier]]s. According to [[Robert M. Utley]]: 
:the frontier army was a conventional military force trying to control, by conventional military methods, a people that did not behave like conventional enemies and, indeed, quite often were not enemies at all. This is the most difficult of all military assignments, whether in Africa, Asia, or the American West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert M. Utley, &quot;The Contribution of the Frontier to the American Military Tradition&quot;|title=The Harmon Memorial Lectures in Military History, 1959–1987|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K4w69q1_IAYC&amp;pg=PA531|publisher=DIANE Publishing|pages=525–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These regiments, which rarely took the field as complete organizations, served throughout the [[American Indian Wars]] through the close of the frontier in the 1890s. Volunteer cavalry regiments like the [[Rough Riders]] consisted of horsemen such as [[cowboy]]s, [[rancher]]s and other outdoorsmen, that served as a cavalry in the United States Military.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Mathingham Hutton, &quot;T.R. takes charge&quot;, ''American History'' 33.n3 (August 1998), 30(11).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Franco-Prussian War====
[[File:Valladolid - Academia de Caballeria 3.jpg|thumb|upright|''Monument to the Spanish Regiment of light cavalry of Alcántara'']]
During the [[Franco-Prussian War]], at the [[Battle of Mars-la-Tour]] in 1870, a Prussian cavalry brigade decisively smashed the centre of the French battle line, after skilfully concealing their approach. This event became known as '''Von Bredow's Death Ride''' after the brigade commander [[Adalbert von Bredow]]; it would be used in the following decades to argue that massed cavalry charges still had a place on the modern battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Franco_Prussian_War.html?id=h2wEeRuei6AC |title=The Franco-Prussian War: The German Invasion of France, 1870–1871 |first1=Michael |last1=Howard |first2=Michael Eliot |last2=Howard |publisher=Routledge |year=2001 |isbn=0-415-26671-8 |page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Imperial expansion====
Cavalry found a new role in colonial campaigns ([[irregular military|irregular warfare]]), where modern weapons were lacking and the slow moving infantry-artillery train or fixed fortifications were often ineffective against indigenous insurgents (unless the latter offered a fight on an equal footing, as at [[Battle of Tel el-Kebir|Tel-el-Kebir]], [[Battle of Omdurman|Omdurman]], etc.). Cavalry &quot;[[flying column]]s&quot; proved effective, or at least cost-effective, in many campaigns—although an astute native commander (like [[Samori]] in western Africa, [[Imam Shamil|Shamil]] in the [[Caucasus]], or any of the better [[Boer]] commanders) could turn the tables and use the greater mobility of their cavalry to offset their relative lack of firepower compared with European forces.

In 1903 the [[British Indian Army]] maintained forty regiments of cavalry, numbering about 25,000 Indian [[sowars]] (cavalrymen), with British and Indian officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Chandler|page=379|title=The Oxford History of the British Army|ISBN=0-19-285333-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 Among the more famous regiments in the lineages of the modern Indian and Pakistani armies are:[[File:21lancers.JPG|thumb|right|The charge of the 21st Lancers at [[Battle of Omdurman|Omdurman]]]]
* [[Governor General's Bodyguard]] (now [[President's Bodyguard (India)|President's Bodyguard]])
* Skinner's Horse (now India's [[1st Horse (Skinner's Horse)]])
* Gardner's Lancers (now India's [[2nd Lancers (Gardner's Horse)]])
* Hodson's Horse (now India's [[Hodson's Horse|3rd Horse (Hodson's)]]) of the Bengal Lancers fame
* [[6th Bengal Cavalry]] (later amalgamated with [[7th Hariana Lancers]] to form [[18th King Edward's Own Cavalry]]) now [[18th Cavalry]] of the [[Indian Army]]
* Probyn's Horse (now 5 Horse, Pakistan)
* Royal Deccan Horse (now India's [[Deccan Horse|The Deccan Horse]])
* Poona Horse (now India's [[The Poona Horse]])
* Scinde Horse (now India's [[Scinde Horse|The Scinde Horse]])
* [[Guides Cavalry|Queen's Own Guides Cavalry]] (now Pakistan).
* [[11th Prince Albert Victor's Own Cavalry (Frontier Force)]] (now 11 Cavalry (Frontier Force), Pakistan)

Several of these formations are still active, though they now are armoured formations, for example the Guides Cavalry in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://defencejournal.com/jun99/guides-cavalry.htm The Guides Cavalry (10th Queen Victoria's Own Frontier Force)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Army maintained substantial cavalry forces in Algeria and Morocco from 1830 until the end of the [[Second World War]]. Much of the Mediterranean coastal terrain was suitable for mounted action and there was a long established culture of horsemanship amongst the Arab and Berber inhabitants. The French forces included [[Spahi]]s, [[Chasseurs d' Afrique]], [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]] cavalry and mounted [[Goumier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;L'Armee d'Afrique 1830–1962, General R. Hure, Paris-Limogues 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Both Spain and Italy raised cavalry regiments from amongst the indigenous horsemen of their North African territories (see [[regulares]], [[Italian Spahis]]&lt;ref&gt;Plates I &amp; IV, &quot;Under Italian Libya's Burning Sun&quot;, The National Geographic Magazine August 1925&lt;/ref&gt; and [[savari]] respectively).

Imperial Germany employed mounted formations in South West Africa as part of the [[Schutztruppen]] (colonial army) garrisoning the territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles|last=Woolley|page=94|title=Uniforms of the German Colonial Troops|ISBN=978-0-7643-3357-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First World War===

====Pre-war developments====
[[File:Italian cavalry drill.jpg|thumb|Italian cavalry officers practice their horsemanship in 1904 outside Rome.]]
At the beginning of the 20th century all armies still maintained substantial cavalry forces, although there was contention over whether their role should revert to that of mounted infantry (the historic dragoon function). Following the experience of the [[Second Boer War|South African War]] of 1899–1902 (where mounted Boer citizen commandos fighting on foot from cover proved more effective than regular cavalry) the British Army withdrew lances for all but ceremonial purposes and placed a new emphasis on training for dismounted action. In 1908 however the six British lancer regiments in existence resumed use of this impressive but obsolete weapon for active service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Chandler|page=209|title=The Oxford History of the British Army|ISBN=0-19-285333-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882 the Imperial Russian Army converted all its line hussar and lancer regiments to dragoons, with an emphasis on mounted infantry training. In 1910 these regiments reverted to their historic roles, designations and uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Boris|last=Mollo|page=[https://archive.org/details/uniformsofimperi00moll/page/48 48]|title=Uniforms of the Imperial Russian Army|ISBN=0-7137-0920-0|url=https://archive.org/details/uniformsofimperi00moll/page/48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1909 official regulations dictating the role of the Imperial German cavalry had been revised to indicate an increasing realization of the realities of modern warfare. The massive cavalry charge in three waves which had previously marked the end of annual maneuvers was discontinued and a new emphasis was placed in training on scouting, raiding and pursuit; rather than main battle involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Prit|last=Buttar|page=39|title=Collusion of Empires|ISBN=978-1-78200-648-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of significant experience in mounted warfare in Morocco during 1908-14, the French cavalry remained a highly conservative institution.&lt;ref&gt;David Woodward, p. 47 &quot;Armies of the World 1854–1914&quot;,SBN=399-12252-4&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional tactical distinctions between heavy, medium and light cavalry branches were retained.&lt;ref&gt;p. 570, Volume 5, Encyclopædia Britannica – eleventh edition&lt;/ref&gt; French cuirassiers wore breastplates and plumed helmets unchanged from the Napoleonic period, during the early months of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Delperier, pp. 60-70 &quot;Les Cuirassiers 1845–1918&quot;, Argout-Editions Paris 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Dragoons were similarly equipped, though they did not wear cuirasses and did carry lances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Andre|last=Jouineau|pages=24–25|title=The French Army 1914|ISBN=978-2-35250-104-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Light cavalry were described as being &quot;a blaze of colour&quot;. French cavalry of all branches were well mounted and were trained to change position and charge at full gallop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Terraine|page=57|title=Mons Retreat to Victory|ISBN=1-84022-243-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opening stages====
[[File:KuK Kavallerie 1898.jpg|thumb|right|[[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austro-Hungarian]] cavalry, 1898.]]
[[File:Kavallerie Wk I.jpg|thumb|right|German cavalryman in September 1914, [[German South-West Africa]].]]

In August 1914 all combatant armies still retained substantial numbers of cavalry and the mobile nature of the opening battles on both [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern]] and [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]s provided a number of instances of traditional cavalry actions, though on a smaller and more scattered scale than those of previous wars. The Imperial German cavalry, while as colourful and traditional as any in peacetime appearance, had adopted a practice of falling back on infantry support when any substantial opposition was encountered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Terraine |page=50 |title=Mons: Retreat to Victory |isbn=1-84022-243-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cautious tactics aroused derision amongst their more conservative French and Russian opponents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Terraine|page=14|title=The First World War 1914–18|ISBN=0-333-37913-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but proved appropriate to the new nature of warfare. A single attempt by the German army, on 12 August 1914, to use six regiments of massed cavalry to cut off the Belgian field army from [[Antwerp]] foundered when they were driven back in disorder by rifle fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=R. |last=Pawly |pages=10–11 |title=The Belgian Army in World War I |isbn=978-1-84603-448-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two German cavalry brigades involved lost 492 men and 843 horses in repeated charges against dismounted Belgian lancers and infantry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Joe |last1=Robinson |first2=Francis |last2=Hendriks |first3=Janet |last3=Robinson |title=The Last Great Cavalry Charge – The Battle of the Silver Helmets Halen 12 August 1914 |isbn=978-1-78155-183-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the front lines stabilised on the Western Front, a combination of barbed wire, machine guns and rapid fire rifles proved deadly to horse mounted troops.

On the Eastern Front a more fluid form of warfare arose from flat open terrain favorable to mounted warfare. On the outbreak of war in 1914 the bulk of the Russian cavalry was deployed at full strength in frontier garrisons and during the period that the main armies were mobilizing scouting and raiding into East Prussia and Austrian Galacia was undertaken by mounted troops trained to fight with sabre and lance in the traditional style.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir A. Emmanuel, p. 10, ''The Russian Imperial Cavalry in 1914'', {{ISBN|978-0-9889532-1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 August 1914 the 4th Austro-Hungarian ''Kavalleriedivison'' fought a major mounted engagement at Jaroslavic with the Russian 10th Cavalry Division,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Prit|last=Buttar|page=209|title=Collusion of Empires|ISBN=978-1-78200-648-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; in what was arguably the final historic battle to involve thousands of horsemen on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Jung, pages 10–11, ''The Austro-Hungarian Forces in World War I (1) '', {{ISBN|1-84176-594-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this was the last massed cavalry encounter on the Eastern Front, the absence of good roads limited the use of mechanized transport and even the technologically advanced Imperial German Army continued to deploy up to twenty-four horse-mounted divisions in the East, as late as 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Littauer, p. 6, ''Russian Hussar'', {{ISBN|1-59048-256-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Europe 1915–18====
[[File:The British Army on the Home Front, 1914-1918 Q30432.jpg|thumb|right|A British cavalry trooper in marching order (1914–1918)]]
For the remainder of the War on the Western Front cavalry had virtually no role to play. The British and French armies dismounted many of their cavalry regiments and used them in infantry and other roles: the [[Life Guards (British Army)|Life Guards]] for example spent the last months of the War as a machine gun corps; and the [[Australian Light Horse]] served as light infantry during the Gallipoli campaign. In September 1914 cavalry comprised 9.28% of the total manpower of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] in France—by July 1918 this proportion had fallen to 1.65%.&lt;ref&gt;p. 212, ''The Oxford History of the British Army'', {{ISBN|0-19-285333-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the first winter of the war most French cavalry regiments had dismounted a squadron each, for service in the trenches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ian|last=Sumner|page=12|title=French Poilu 1914–18|ISBN=978-1-84603-332-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French cavalry numbered 102,000 in May 1915 but had been reduced to 63,000 by October 1918.&lt;ref&gt;p. 216, Vol. XXX, Encyclopædia Britannica, 12th Edition, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;
The German Army dismounted nearly all their cavalry in the West, maintaining only one mounted division on that front by January 1917.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R42025, Warschau, Einmarsch deutscher Kavallerie.jpg|thumb|right|German [[Uhlan]]s after the capture of Warsaw, August 1915]]
Italy entered the war in 1915 with thirty regiments of line cavalry, lancers and light horse. While employed effectively against their Austro-Hungarian counterparts during the initial offensives across the [[Isonzo River]], the Italian mounted forces ceased to have a significant role as the front shifted into mountainous terrain. By 1916 all cavalry machine-gun sections and two complete cavalry divisions had been dismounted and seconded to the infantry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Nicolle|pages=34–35|title=The Italian Army of World War I|ISBN=1-84176-398-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cavalry were retained as mounted troops behind the lines in anticipation of a penetration of the opposing trenches that it seemed would never come. [[Tank]]s, introduced on the Western Front by the British in September 1916, had the capacity to achieve such breakthroughs but did not have the reliable range to exploit them. In their first major use at the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)]], the plan was for a cavalry division to follow behind the tanks, however they were not able to cross a canal because a tank had broken the only bridge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/battle_of_cambrai.htm History Learning Site: Battle of Cambrai]&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the German Army had been forced to retreat in the [[Hundred Days Offensive]] of 1918, that cavalry were again able to operate in their intended role. There was a successful charge by the British [[7th Dragoon Guards]] on the last day of the war.&lt;ref&gt;p. 45 &quot;The Royal Dragoon Guards 1685–1988&quot;, Regiment Issue Thirty Four&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wider spaces of the Eastern Front a more fluid form of warfare continued and there was still a use for mounted troops. Some wide-ranging actions were fought, again mostly in the early months of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmott&quot;&gt;''First World War'', Willmott, H. P., Dorling Kindersley, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; However, even here the value of cavalry was overrated and the maintenance of large mounted formations at the front by the [[Military history of the Russian Empire|Russian Army]] put a major strain on the railway system, to little strategic advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Norman|last=Stone|page=220|title=The Eastern Front 1914–17|ISBN=0-684-14492-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1917 the Russian regular cavalry (exclusive of Cossacks) was reduced by nearly a third from its peak number of 200,000, as two squadrons of each regiment were dismounted and incorporated into additional infantry battalions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Vladimir|last=Littauer|page=220|title=Russian Hussar|ISBN=1-59048-256-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their Austro-Hungarian opponents, plagued by a shortage of trained infantry, had been obliged to progressively convert most horse cavalry regiments to dismounted rifle units starting in late 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=James|last=Lucas|page=99|title=Fighting Troops of the Austro-Hungarian Army 1868–1914|ISBN=0-946771-04-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Middle East====
In the Middle East, during the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]] mounted forces (British, Indian, Ottoman, Australian, Arab and New Zealand) retained an important strategic role both as mounted infantry and cavalry.

In Egypt the [[mounted infantry]] formations like the [[New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade]] and [[Australian Light Horse]] of [[ANZAC Mounted Division]], operating as mounted infantry, drove German and Ottoman forces back from [[Battle of Romani|Romani]] to [[Battle of Magdhaba|Magdhaba]] and [[Battle of Rafa|Rafa]] and out of the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula in 1916.

After a stalemate on the Gaza—Beersheba line between March and October 1917, [[Beersheba]] was captured by the [[Australian Mounted Division]]'s 4th Light Horse Brigade. Their mounted charge succeeded after a [[Battle of Beersheba (1917)|coordinated attack]] by the British Infantry and Yeomanry cavalry and the Australian and New Zealand Light Horse and Mounted Rifles brigades. A series of coordinated attacks by these [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] infantry and mounted troops were also successful at the [[Battle of Mughar Ridge]], during which the British infantry divisions and the Desert Mounted Corps drove two Ottoman armies back to the Jaffa—Jerusalem line. The infantry with mainly dismounted cavalry and mounted infantry fought in the [[Judean Hills]] to eventually almost encircle [[Battle of Jerusalem (1917)|Jerusalem]] which was occupied shortly after.

During a pause in operations necessitated by the [[Spring Offensive]] in 1918 on the Western Front joint infantry and mounted infantry attacks towards [[First Transjordan attack on Amman|Amman]] and [[Second Transjordan attack on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt|Es Salt]] resulted in retreats back to the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] which continued to be occupied by mounted divisions during the summer of 1918.

The Australian Mounted Division was armed with swords and in September, after the successful [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|breaching]] of the Ottoman line on the Mediterranean coast by [[Battle of Sharon (1918)|the British Empire infantry]] XXI Corps was followed by cavalry attacks by the [[Capture of Afulah and Beisan|4th Cavalry Division]], [[Battle of Nazareth (1918)|5th Cavalry Division]] and [[Capture of Jenin (1918)|Australian Mounted Division]]s which almost encircled two Ottoman armies in the Judean Hills [[Battle of Samakh (1918)|forcing their retreat]]. Meanwhile, [[Chaytor's Force]] of infantry and mounted infantry in ANZAC Mounted Division [[Occupation of the Jordan Valley (1918)|held the Jordan Valley]], covering the right flank to later advance eastwards to [[Third Transjordan attack|capture Es Salt and Amman]] and half of a third Ottoman army. A subsequent pursuit by the [[Charge at Irbid|4th Cavalry Division]] and the [[Battle of Jisr Benat Yakub|Australian Mounted Division]] followed by the [[Charge at Kiswe|5th Cavalry Division]] to [[Damascus]]. Armoured cars and 5th Cavalry Division lancers were continuing the pursuit of Ottoman units north of [[Aleppo]] when the [[Armistice of Mudros]] was signed by the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Post–World War I===
A combination of military conservatism in almost all armies and post-war financial constraints prevented the lessons of 1914–1918 being acted on immediately. There was a general reduction in the number of cavalry regiments in the British, French, Italian and other Western armies but it was still argued with conviction (for example in the 1922 edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'') that mounted troops had a major role to play in future warfare. The 1920s saw an interim period during which cavalry remained as a proud and conspicuous element of all major armies, though much less so than prior to 1914.

Cavalry was extensively used in the [[Russian Civil War]] and the [[Soviet-Polish War]]. The last major cavalry battle was the [[Battle of Komarów]] in 1920, between Poland and the Russian Bolsheviks. Colonial warfare in Morocco, Syria, the Middle East and the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North West Frontier]] of India provided some opportunities for mounted action against enemies lacking advanced weaponry.
[[File:Lietuvos kavalerija.Lithuanian cavalry.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Lithuania]]n lancers training in the 1930s]]
The post-war German Army ([[Reichsheer]]) was permitted a large proportion of cavalry (18 regiments or 16.4% of total manpower) under the conditions of the [[Treaty of Versailles]].

The [[British Army]] mechanised all cavalry regiments between 1929 and 1941, redefining their role from horse to armoured vehicles to form the [[Royal Armoured Corps]] together with the [[Royal Tank Regiment]]. The U.S. Cavalry abandoned its sabres in 1934 and commenced the conversion of its horsed regiments to mechanized cavalry, starting with the First Regiment of Cavalry in January 1933.

During the 1930s the French Army experimented with integrating mounted and mechanised cavalry units into larger formations. Dragoon regiments were converted to motorised infantry (trucks and motor cycles), and cuirassiers to armoured units; while light cavalry (Chasseurs a' Cheval, Hussars and Spahis) remained as mounted sabre squadrons. The theory was that mixed forces comprising these diverse units could utilise the strengths of each according to circumstances. In practice mounted troops proved unable to keep up with fast moving mechanised units over any distance.

The thirty-nine cavalry regiments of the [[British Indian Army]] were reduced to twenty-one as the result of a series of amalgamations immediately following World War I. The new establishment remained unchanged until 1936 when three regiments were redesignated as permanent training units, each with six, still mounted, regiments linked to them. In 1938 the process of mechanization began with the conversion of a full cavalry brigade (two Indian regiments and one British) to armoured car and tank units. By the end of 1940 all of the Indian cavalry had been mechanized initially, in the majority of cases, to motorized infantry transported in 15cwt trucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Chandler|page=382|title=The Oxford History of the British Army|ISBN=0-19-285333-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last horsed regiment of the British Indian Army (other than the Viceregal Bodyguard and some Indian States Forces regiments) was the 19th King George's Own Lancers which had its final mounted parade at Rawalpindi on 28 October 1939. This unit still exists in the Pakistan Army as an armored regiment.

===World War II===
While most armies still maintained cavalry units at the outbreak of World War II in 1939, significant mounted action was largely restricted to the Polish, Balkan and Soviet campaigns. Rather than charge their mounts into battle, cavalry units were either used as mounted infantry (using horses to move into position and then dismounting for combat) or as reconnaissance units (especially in areas not suited to tracked or wheeled vehicles).

====Polish====
[[File:Polski ułan z karabinem przeciwpancernym UR.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|Polish [[uhlan]] with [[wz. 35 anti-tank rifle]]. Military instruction published in [[Warsaw]] in 1938.]]
A popular myth is that [[Polish cavalry]] armed with lances charged German tanks during the September 1939 campaign. This arose from misreporting of a single clash on 1 September near Krojanty, when two squadrons of the Polish 18th Lancers armed with sabres scattered German infantry before being caught in the open by German armoured cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two examples illustrate how the myth developed. First, because motorised vehicles were in short supply, the Poles used horses to pull anti-tank weapons into position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Time Staff|date=April 22, 1940|number= |title= The New Pictures|journal= Time|volume= |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,763905-1,00.html |accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, there were a few incidents when Polish cavalry was trapped by German tanks, and attempted to fight free. However, this did not mean that the Polish army chose to attack tanks with horse cavalry.&lt;ref name=Davies324&gt;Davies ''God's Playground Volume II'' pp. 324–325&lt;/ref&gt; Later, on the Eastern Front, the [[Red Army]] did deploy cavalry units effectively against the Germans.&lt;ref name=Davies325&gt;Davies ''God's Playground Volume II'' p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-054-1525-26, Frankreich, Kavallerie am Ausgang eines Dorfes.jpg|thumb|left|A German cavalry patrol in May 1940, during the [[Battle of France]].]]
A more correct term would be &quot;mounted infantry&quot; instead of &quot;cavalry&quot;, as horses were primarily used as a means of transportation, for which they were very suitable in view of the very poor road conditions in pre-war Poland. Another myth describes Polish cavalry as being armed with both sabres and lances; lances were used for peacetime ceremonial purposes only and the primary weapon of the Polish cavalryman in 1939 was a rifle. Individual equipment did include a sabre, probably because of well-established tradition, and in the case of a melee combat this secondary weapon would probably be more effective than a rifle and bayonet. Moreover, the [[Polish cavalry brigade order of battle in 1939]] included, apart from the mounted soldiers themselves, light and heavy machine guns (wheeled), the [[Anti-tank rifle, model 35]], anti-aircraft weapons, anti tank artillery such as the [[Bofors 37 mm]], also light and scout tanks, etc. The last cavalry vs. cavalry mutual charge in Europe took place in Poland during the [[Battle of Krasnobród]], when Polish and German cavalry units clashed with each other.

The last classical cavalry charge of the war took place on March 1, 1945 during the [[Battle of Schoenfeld]] by the 1st &quot;Warsaw&quot; Independent Cavalry Brigade. Infantry and tanks had been employed to little effect against the German position, both of which floundered in the open wetlands only to be dominated by infantry and antitank fire from the German fortifications on the forward slope of Hill 157, overlooking the wetlands. The Germans had not taken cavalry into consideration when fortifying their position which, combined with the &quot;Warsaw&quot;s swift assault, overran the German anti-tank guns and consolidated into an attack into the village itself, now supported by infantry and tanks.

====Greek====
The [[Italian invasion of Greece]] in October 1940 saw mounted cavalry used effectively by the Greek defenders along the mountainous frontier with Albania. Three Greek cavalry regiments (two mounted and one partially mechanized) played an important role in the Italian defeat in this difficult terrain.&lt;ref&gt;''The Armed Forces of World War II 1914–1945'', Andrew Mollo, {{ISBN|0-85613-296-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Soviet====
By the final stages of the war only the Soviet Union was still fielding mounted units in substantial numbers, some in combined mechanized and horse units. The advantage of this approach was that in exploitation mounted infantry could keep pace with advancing tanks. Other factors favouring the retention of mounted forces included the high quality of Russian [[Cossacks]] and other horse cavalry; and the relative lack of roads suitable for wheeled vehicles in many parts of the Eastern Front. Another consideration was that the logistic capacity required to support very large motorised forces exceeded that necessary for mounted troops. The main usage of Soviet cavalry involved infiltration through front lines with subsequent deep raids, which disorganised German supply lines. Another role was the pursuit of retreating enemy forces during major frontline operations and breakthroughs.

====Italian====
The last mounted sabre charge by Italian cavalry occurred on August 24, 1942 at [[Isbuscenskij Charge|Isbuscenski]] (Russia), when a squadron of the Savoia Cavalry Regiment charged the 812th Siberian Infantry Regiment. The remainder of the regiment, together with the Novara Lancers made a dismounted attack in an action that ended with the retreat of the Russians after heavy losses on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey T. Fowler, p. 45 &quot;Axis Cavalry in World War II, {{ISBN|1-84176-323-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final Italian cavalry action occurred on October 17, 1942 in Poloj (now Croatia) by a squadron of the Alexandria Cavalry Regiment against a large group of Yugoslav partisans.

====Other Axis====
Romanian, Hungarian and Italian cavalry were dispersed or disbanded following the retreat of the Axis forces from Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey T. Fowler, pages 35-38 &quot;Axis Cavalry in World War II, {{ISBN|1-84176-323-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany still maintained some mounted (mixed with bicycles) SS and Cossack units until the last days of the War.

====Finnish====
Finland used mounted troops against Russian forces effectively in forested terrain during the [[Continuation War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=P.Kilkki|last2=H.Pohjanpää|title=Suomen Ratsuväen Historia II. Ratsuväki Suomen Sodissa 1939–1944}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last Finnish cavalry unit was not disbanded until 1947.

====United States====
The U.S. Army's last horse cavalry actions were fought during World War II: a) by the [[26th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|26th Cavalry Regiment]]—a small mounted regiment of [[Philippine Scouts]] which fought the Japanese during the retreat down the Bataan peninsula, until it was effectively destroyed by January 1942; and b) on captured German horses by the mounted reconnaissance section of the U.S. 10th Mountain Division in a spearhead pursuit of the German Army across the Po Valley in Italy in April 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Personal memoirs of Colonel Ernest Neal Cory, Jr., Esquire&lt;/ref&gt; The last horsed U.S. Cavalry (the [[2nd Cavalry Division (United States)|Second Cavalry Division]]) were dismounted in March 1944.

====British Empire====
All British Army cavalry regiments had been mechanised since 1 March 1942 when the [[Queen's Own Yorkshire Dragoons]] ([[Yeomanry]]) was converted to a motorised role, following mounted service against the Vichy French in Syria the previous year. The final cavalry charge by British Empire forces occurred on 21 March 1942 when a 60 strong patrol of the Burma Frontier Force encountered Japanese infantry near [[Toungoo]] airfield in central [[Myanmar]]. The [[Sikh]] [[sowar]]s of the Frontier Force cavalry, led by Captain Arthur Sandeman of [[The Central India Horse (21st King George V's Own Horse)]], charged in the old style with sabres and most were killed.

====Mongolia====
[[File:Battle of Khalkhin Gol-Mongolian cavalry.jpg|right|thumb|Mongolian cavalry in the Khalkhin Gol (1939)]]

In the early stages of World War II, mounted units of the Mongolian People's Army were involved in the [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]] against invading Japanese forces. Soviet forces under the command of Georgy Zhukov, together with Mongolian forces, defeated the Japanese Sixth army and effectively ended the Soviet–Japanese Border Wars. After the [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact]] of 1941, Mongolia remained neutral throughout most of the war, but its geographical situation meant that the country served as a buffer between Japanese forces and the Soviet Union. In addition to keeping around 10% of the population under arms, Mongolia provided half a million trained horses for use by the Soviet Army. In 1945 a partially mounted Soviet-Mongolian [[Cavalry Mechanized Group]] played a supporting role on the western flank of the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]]. The last active service seen by cavalry units of the Mongolian Army occurred in 1946–1948, during border clashes between Mongolia and the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]].

===Post–World War II to present day===

[[File:US soldiers on horseback 1991 Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|left|[[United States Army Special Forces|U.S. Special Forces]] and [[Combat Controller]]s on horseback with the [[Afghan Northern Alliance|Northern Alliance]] of [[Afghanistan]], which frequently used horses as military transport.]]
While most modern &quot;cavalry&quot; units have some historic connection with formerly mounted troops this is not always the case. The modern Irish Defence Force (DF) includes a &quot;Cavalry Corps&quot; equipped with armoured cars and [[FV101 Scorpion|Scorpion tracked combat reconnaissance vehicles]]. The DF has never included horse cavalry since its establishment in 1922 (other than a small mounted escort of [[Blue Hussars]] drawn from the Artillery Corps when required for ceremonial occasions). However, the mystique of the cavalry is such that the name has been introduced for what was always a mechanised force.

Some engagements in late 20th and early 21st century [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] wars involved mounted troops, particularly against partisan or guerrilla fighters in areas with poor transport infrastructure. Such units were not used as cavalry but rather as mounted infantry. Examples occurred in Afghanistan, [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|Portuguese Africa]] and [[Rhodesia]]. The French Army used existing mounted squadrons of [[Spahi]]s to a limited extent for patrol work during the Algerian War (1954–62). The [[Swiss Armed Forces|Swiss Army]] maintained a mounted dragoon regiment for combat purposes until 1973. The [[Portuguese Army]] used horse mounted cavalry with some success in the [[Portuguese Colonial War|wars of independence in Angola and Mozambique]] in the 1960s and 1970s. During the 1964–79 [[Rhodesian Bush War]] the [[Rhodesian Army]] created an elite mounted infantry unit called [[Grey's Scouts]] to fight unconventional actions against the rebel forces of [[Robert Mugabe]] and [[Joshua Nkomo]]. The horse mounted infantry of the Scouts were effective and reportedly feared by their opponents in the rebel African forces. In the 1978 to present [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|Afghan Civil War]] period there have been several instances of horse mounted combat.

Central and South American armies maintained mounted cavalry for longer than those of Asia, Europe, or North America. The Mexican Army included a number of horse mounted cavalry regiments as late as the mid-1990s and the Chilean Army had five such regiments in 1983 as mounted mountain troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=English|first=Adrian J.|date=May 1985 |title=Armed Forces of Latin America:Their Histories, Development, Present Strength and Military Potential|url= |location= |publisher=[[Jane's Information Group]]|page= |isbn=978-0710603210 |access-date= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soviet Army]] retained horse cavalry divisions until 1955, and even at the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, there was an independent horse mounted cavalry squadron in [[Kyrgyzstan]].&lt;ref&gt;Carey Schofield, Inside the Soviet Army, Headline, 1991, pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt;

====Operational horse cavalry====
Today the [[Indian Army]]'s [[61st Cavalry (India)|61st Cavalry]] is reported to be the largest existing horse-mounted cavalry unit still having operational potential.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiapolo.com/Polopedia/Genesis/Indian_Army/61st_Cavalry/61st_cavalry.html India Polo Magazine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703113133/http://www.indiapolo.com/Polopedia/Genesis/Indian_Army/61st_Cavalry/61st_cavalry.html |date=July 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was raised in 1951 from the amalgamated [[Imperial Service Troops|state cavalry]] squadrons of [[Gwalior]], [[Jodhpur]], and [[Mysore]]. While primarily utilised for ceremonial purposes, the regiment can be deployed for internal security or police roles if required.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Dallal, ''Horse Warriors: India's 61st Cavalry'', {{ISBN|0-9544083-1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 61st Cavalry and the President's Body Guard parade in full [[dress uniform]] in New Delhi each year in what is probably the largest assembly of traditional cavalry still to be seen in the world. Both the Indian and the Pakistani armies maintain armoured regiments with the titles of [[Lancer]]s or Horse, dating back to the 19th century.

As of 2007 the Chinese [[People's Liberation Army]] employed two battalions of horse-mounted border guards in Xinjing Military District for border patrol work. The PLA mounted units last saw action during border clashes with [[Vietnam]] in the 1970s and 80s, after which most cavalry units were disbanded as part of the major military downsizing of the 1980s.
In the wake of the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]], there were calls to rebuild the army horse inventory for disaster relief in difficult terrain. Subsequent Chinese media reporting&lt;ref&gt;''Global Times'' 20 November 2009 and Xinhua News Agency 22 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; confirms that the Chinese Army maintains operational horse cavalry at squadron strength in the Mongolia Autonomous Region for scouting and logistical purposes.

The [[Chilean Army]] still maintains a mixed armoured cavalry regiment, with elements of it acting as mounted mountain exploration troops, based in the city of [[Angol]], being part of the III Mountain Division&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Regimiento de Caballería n.º 3 &quot;Húsares&quot;]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Circular reference|date=October 2019}}, and another independent exploration cavalry detachment in the town of [[Chaiten]]. The rugged mountain terrain calls for the use of [[Chilean Horse|special horses]], suited for that use.

====Ceremonial horse cavalry and armored cavalry retaining traditional titles====
[[File:Italian Army - A mounted troop of the &quot;Lancieri di Montebello&quot; Regiment (8th) in Rome 2019.jpg|thumb|320px|Italian Army regiment “Lancieri di Montebello” (8th) on public duties in Rome 2019]]
Cavalry or mounted gendarmerie units continue to be maintained for purely or primarily ceremonial purposes by the Algerian, Argentine, Bolivian, Brazilian, British, Bulgarian, Canadian, Chilean, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, Hungarian, Indian, Italian, Jordanian, Malaysian, Moroccan, Nepalese, Nigerian, North Korean, Omani, Pakistani, Panamanian, Paraguayan, Peruvian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Senegalese, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Tunisian, Turkmenistan, United States, and Venezuelan armed forces.

A number of armoured regiments in the [[British Army]] retain the historic designations of Hussars, Dragoons, Light Dragoons, Dragoon Guards, Lancers and Yeomanry. Only the [[Household Cavalry]] (consisting of the [[Life Guards (United Kingdom)|Life Guards]]' mounted squadron, The [[Blues and Royals]]' mounted squadron, the State Trumpeters of The [[Household Cavalry]] and the [[Household Cavalry]] Mounted Band) are maintained for mounted (and dismounted) ceremonial duties in London.

The [[French Army]] still has regiments with the historic designations of [[Cuirassier]]s, [[Hussar]]s, [[Chasseur]]s, [[Dragoon]]s and [[Spahi]]s. Only the cavalry of the [[French Republican Guard|Republican Guard]] and a ceremonial ''fanfare'' detachment of trumpeters for the cavalry/armoured branch&lt;ref&gt;Cyr Darnoc De Saint-mandé, pp. 33–36, ''Gazette des Uniformes'', December 2002&lt;/ref&gt; as a whole are now mounted.

In the [[Canadian Army]], a number of regular and reserve units have cavalry roots, including [[The Royal Canadian Hussars (Montreal)]], [[the Governor General's Horse Guards]], [[Lord Strathcona's Horse]], [[The British Columbia Dragoons]][[Royal Canadian Dragoons|, The Royal Canadian Dragoons]], and the [[South Alberta Light Horse]]. Of these, only Lord Strathcona's Horse and the Governor General's Horse Guards maintain an official ceremonial horse-mounted cavalry troop or squadron.&lt;ref&gt;The Honours, Flags, and Heritage Structure of the Canadian Forces&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the Army of the Russian Federation reintroduced a ceremonial mounted squadron wearing historic uniforms.

Both the Australian and New Zealand armies follow the British practice of maintaining traditional titles ([[Australian Light Horse|Light Horse]] or Mounted Rifles) for modern mechanised units. However, neither country retains a horse-mounted unit.

Several [[armour|armored]] units of the modern [[United States Army]] retain the designation of &quot;[[Armored cavalry]]&quot;. The United States also has &quot;[[Air assault|air cavalry]]&quot; units equipped with [[helicopter]]s. The Horse Cavalry Detachment of the U.S. Army's [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]], made up of active duty soldiers, still functions as an active unit; trained to approximate the weapons, tools, equipment and techniques used by the United States Cavalry in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pao.hood.army.mil/1stCavDiv/horseDet/default.html First Team!

==Light and heavy cavalry==
{{See also|Heavy cavalry|light cavalry}}
Historically, cavalry was divided into [[horse archer]]s, [[Light cavalry|light]] and [[heavy cavalry]]. The differences were their role in combat, the size of the mount, and how much armor was worn by the mount and [[Equestrianism|rider]].

Early light cavalry (like the [[auxiliary (Roman military)|auxiliaries of the Roman army]]) were typically used to [[Reconnaissance|scout]] and [[skirmish]], to cut down retreating infantry, and for defeating enemy [[projectile|missile]] troops. Armoured cavalry such as the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[cataphract]] were used as shock troops—they would charge the main body of the enemy and in many cases, their actions decided the outcome of the battle, hence the later term &quot;battle cavalry&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;p. 490, Lynn&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Gunpowder warfare|Gunpowder Age]], armored cavalry units still retained [[cuirass]]es and helmets for their protective value against [[sword]] and [[bayonet]] strikes, and the morale boost these provide to the wearers. By this time the main difference between light and heavy cavalry was their training; the former was regarded as a tool for harassment and reconnaissance, while the latter was considered best for close-order charges.

Since the development of [[armored warfare]], the distinction between light and heavy armor has persisted basically along the same lines. [[Armored car (military)|Armored car]]s and [[light tank]]s have adopted the [[reconnaissance]] role while [[medium tank|medium]] and [[heavy tank]]s are regarded as the decisive [[shock troops]].

==Social status==
From the beginning of civilization to the 20th century, ownership of heavy cavalry horses has been a mark of wealth amongst settled peoples. A cavalry horse involves considerable expense in breeding, training, feeding, and equipment, and has very little productive use except as a mode of transport.

For this reason, and because of their often decisive military role, the cavalry has typically been associated with high [[social status]]. This was most clearly seen in the [[Feudalism|feudal system]], where a lord was expected to enter combat armored and on horseback and bring with him an entourage of lightly armed [[peasants]] on foot. If landlords and peasant levies came into conflict, the poorly trained footmen would be ill-equipped to defeat armored knights.

In later national armies, service as an officer in the cavalry was generally a badge of high social status. For instance prior to 1914 most officers of British cavalry regiments came from a socially privileged background and the considerable expenses associated with their role generally required private means, even after it became possible for officers of the [[line infantry]] regiments to live on their pay. Options open to poorer cavalry officers in the various European armies included service with less fashionable (though often highly professional) frontier or colonial units. These included the British Indian cavalry, the Russian [[Cossacks]] or the French [[Chasseurs d' Afrique]].

During the 19th and early 20th centuries most monarchies maintained a mounted cavalry element in their [[Royal Guards|royal or imperial guards]]. These ranged from small units providing ceremonial escorts and palace guards, through to large formations intended for active service. The mounted escort of the Spanish Royal Household provided an example of the former and the twelve cavalry regiments of the [[Guards Corps (German Empire)|Prussian Imperial Guard]] an example of the latter. In either case the officers of such units were likely to be drawn from the aristocracies of their respective societies.

==On film==
Some sense of the noise and power of a cavalry charge can be gained from the 1970 film ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]'', which featured some 2,000 cavalrymen,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Corrigan |first=Major J. G. H. |url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/t-z/waterloo.html |title=Waterloo (review) |publisher=[[Channel 4]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327224105/http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/t-z/waterloo.html |archivedate=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of them Cossacks. It included detailed displays of the horsemanship required to manage animal and weapons in large numbers at the gallop (unlike the real [[battle of Waterloo]], where deep mud significantly slowed the horses).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/t-z/waterloo.html ''Waterloo''] Film review by Major J. G. H. Corrigan. Accessed 2008-02-07.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gary Cooper]] movie ''[[They Came to Cordura]]'' contains a scene of a cavalry regiment deploying from march to battle line formation. A smaller-scale cavalry charge can be seen in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (2003); although the finished scene has substantial [[computer-generated imagery]], raw footage and reactions of the riders are shown in the Extended Version DVD Appendices.
