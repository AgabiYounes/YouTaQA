'''Carl Edward Sagan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|eɪ|ɡ|ən}}; November 9, 1934{{spaced ndash}}December 20, 1996) was an American [[astronomer]], [[physical cosmology|cosmologist]], [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]], [[Astrobiology|astrobiologist]], author, science popularizer, and [[science communicator]] in astronomy and other natural sciences. He is best known as a science popularizer and communicator. His best known scientific contribution is research on [[extraterrestrial life]], including experimental demonstration of the production of [[amino acids]] from basic chemicals by [[radiation]]. Sagan assembled the first physical messages sent into space: the [[Pioneer plaque]] and the [[Voyager Golden Record]], universal messages that could potentially be understood by any extraterrestrial intelligence that might find them. Sagan argued the now accepted hypothesis that the high surface temperatures of [[Venus]] can be attributed to and calculated using the [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref name=surftemp&gt;{{cite book |title=Conversations with Carl Sagan |edition=illustrated |first1=Carl |last1=Sagan |first2=Tom |last2=Head |publisher=Univ.

Sagan published more than 600 scientific papers and articles and was author, co-author or editor of more than 20 books.&lt;ref name=&quot;scholar&quot;/&gt; He wrote many [[popular science]] books, such as ''[[The Dragons of Eden]]'', ''[[Broca's Brain]]'' and ''[[Pale Blue Dot (book)|Pale Blue Dot]]'', and narrated and co-wrote the award-winning 1980 television series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]''.  The most widely watched series in the history of American [[public television]], ''Cosmos'' has been seen by at least 500 million people across 60 different countries.&lt;ref name =Starchild&gt;{{cite web | url=http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/whos_who_level2/sagan.html | title=StarChild: Dr. Carl Sagan |work=StarChild | publisher=[[NASA]] | accessdate=October 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''[[Cosmos (Carl Sagan book)|Cosmos]]'' was published to accompany the series. He also wrote the science fiction novel ''[[Contact (novel)|Contact]]'', the basis for a 1997 [[Contact (1997 American film)|film of the same name]]. His papers, containing 595,000 items,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Seth MacFarlane Collection of the Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan Archive: A Finding Aid to the Collection in the Library of Congress|date=2013|publisher=Manuscript Division, Library of Congress|url=http://rs5.loc.gov/service/mss/eadxmlmss/eadpdfmss/2013/ms013113.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; are archived at [[The Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lowensohn|first1=Josh|title=Massive Carl Sagan archive posted by Library of Congress|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/4/5379446/massive-carl-sagan-archive-posted-by-library-of-congress|accessdate=January 16, 2016|website=The Verge|date=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan advocated [[Scientific skepticism|scientific skeptical inquiry]] and the [[scientific method]], pioneered [[exobiology]] and promoted the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence ([[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]]). He spent most of his career as a professor of astronomy at [[Cornell University]], where he directed the Laboratory for [[Planetary science|Planetary Studies]]. Sagan and his works received numerous awards and honors, including the [[NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal]], the [[National Academy of Sciences]] [[Public Welfare Medal]], the [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]] for his book ''The Dragons of Eden'', and, regarding ''Cosmos: A Personal Voyage'', two [[Emmy Award]]s, the [[Peabody Award]], and the [[Hugo Award]]. He married three times and had five children. After suffering from [[myelodysplastic syndrome|myelodysplasia]], Sagan died of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 62, on December 20, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.cornell.edu/stories/1996/12/carl-sagan-cornell-astronomer-dies-today-dec-20-seattle|title=Carl Sagan, Cornell astronomer, dies today (Dec. 20) in Seattle|publisher=[[Cornell University]]|date=December 20, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education==
Carl Sagan was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York.&lt;ref name=poundstone&gt;[[#Poundstone|Poundstone 1999]], pp. 363–364, 374–375.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Samuel Sagan, was an immigrant [[Sewing|garment worker]] from [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]], then in the [[Russian Empire]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Internet Accuracy Project&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Carl Sagan |url=http://www.accuracyproject.org/cbe-Sagan,Carl.html |website=Internet Accuracy Project |publisher=Internet Accuracy Project |location=Grandville, MI |accessdate=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in today's [[Ukraine]]. His mother, Rachel Molly Gruber, was a housewife from New York. Carl was named in honor of Rachel's [[biological mother]], Chaiya Clara, in Sagan's words, &quot;the mother she never knew&quot;.&lt;!-- note: &quot;she&quot; is correct, refers to Rachel. Please do not turn this into &quot;he&quot; --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot;&gt;[[#Davidson|Davidson 1999]].&lt;/ref&gt;

He had a sister, Carol, and the family lived in a modest apartment near the [[Atlantic Ocean]], in [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn|Bensonhurst]], a Brooklyn neighborhood. According to Sagan, they were [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jews]], the most liberal of North American Judaism's four main groups. Carl and his sister agreed that their father was not especially religious, but that their mother &quot;definitely believed in God, and was active in the temple; ... and served only [[Kosher foods|kosher]] meat&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|12}} During the depths of the [[Great Depression|Depression]], his father worked as a theater usher.

According to biographer Keay Davidson, Sagan's &quot;inner war&quot; was a result of his close relationship with both of his parents, who were in many ways &quot;opposites&quot;. Sagan traced his later analytical urges to his mother, a woman who had been extremely poor as a child in New York City during [[World War I]] and the 1920s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|2}} As a young woman, she had held her own intellectual ambitions, but they were frustrated by social restrictions: her poverty, her status as a woman and a wife, and her Jewish ethnicity. Davidson notes that she therefore &quot;worshipped her only son, Carl. He would fulfill her unfulfilled dreams.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|2}}

However, he claimed that his sense of wonder came from his father, who in his free time gave apples to the poor or helped soothe labor-management tensions within New York's garment industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|2}} Although he was awed by Carl's intellectual abilities, he took his son's inquisitiveness in stride and saw it as part of his growing up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|2}} In his later years as a writer and scientist, Sagan would often draw on his childhood memories to illustrate scientific points, as he did in his book ''[[Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors (book)|Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|9}} Sagan describes his parents' influence on his later thinking:&lt;ref name=&quot;Spangenburg&quot;&gt;[[#Spangenburg &amp; Moser|Spangenburg &amp; Moser 2004]], pp. 2–5.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|My parents were not scientists. They knew almost nothing about science. But in introducing me simultaneously to skepticism and to wonder, they taught me the two uneasily cohabiting modes of thought that are central to the scientific method.}}

Sagan recalls that one of his most defining moments was when his parents took him to the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] when he was four years old. The exhibits became a turning point in his life. He later recalled the moving map of the ''[[Futurama (New York World's Fair)|America of Tomorrow]]'' exhibit: &quot;It showed beautiful highways and cloverleaves and little General Motors cars all carrying people to skyscrapers, buildings with lovely spires, flying buttresses—and it looked great!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|14}} At other exhibits, he remembered how a flashlight that shone on a [[Solar cell|photoelectric cell]] created a crackling sound, and how the sound from a [[tuning fork]] became a wave on an [[oscilloscope]]. He also witnessed the future media technology that would replace radio: television. Sagan wrote:&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|14}}
{{quote|Plainly, the world held wonders of a kind I had never guessed. How could a tone become a picture and light become a noise?}}

He also saw one of the Fair's most publicized events, the burial of a [[time capsule]] at [[Flushing Meadows–Corona Park|Flushing Meadows]], which contained mementos of the 1930s to be recovered by Earth's descendants in a future millennium. &quot;The time capsule thrilled Carl&quot;, writes Davidson. As an adult, Sagan and his colleagues would create similar time capsules—capsules that would be sent out into the galaxy; these were the [[Pioneer plaque]] and the ''[[Voyager Golden Record]]'' précis, all of which were spinoffs of Sagan's memories of the World's Fair.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|15}}

During [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] Sagan's family worried about the fate of their European relatives. Sagan, however, was generally unaware of the details of the ongoing war. He wrote, &quot;Sure, we had relatives who were caught up in the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] was not a popular fellow in our household... But on the other hand, I was fairly insulated from the horrors of the war.&quot; His sister, Carol, said that their mother &quot;above all wanted to protect Carl... She had an extraordinarily difficult time dealing with World War&amp;nbsp;II and the Holocaust.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|15}} Sagan's book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' (1996) included his memories of this conflicted period, when his family dealt with the realities of the war in Europe but tried to prevent it from undermining his optimistic spirit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spangenburg&quot; /&gt;

=== Inquisitiveness about nature ===
Soon after entering elementary school he began to express a strong inquisitiveness about nature. Sagan recalled taking his first trips to the [[public library]] alone, at the age of five, when his mother got him a library card. He wanted to learn what stars were, since none of his friends or their parents could give him a clear answer:&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|18}}
{{quote|I went to the librarian and asked for a book about stars; ... And the answer was stunning. It was that the Sun was a star but really close. The stars were suns, but so far away they were just little points of light&amp;nbsp;... The scale of the universe suddenly opened up to me. It was a kind of religious experience. There was a magnificence to it, a grandeur, a scale which has never left me. Never ever left me.}}

At about age six or seven, he and a close friend took trips to the [[American Museum of Natural History]] across the East River in [[Manhattan]]. While there, they went to the [[Hayden Planetarium]] and walked around the museum's exhibits of [[outer space|space]] objects, such as [[meteorite]]s, and displays of dinosaurs and animals in natural settings. Sagan writes about those visits:&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|18}}
{{quote|I was transfixed by the dioramas—lifelike representations of animals and their habitats all over the world. Penguins on the dimly lit Antarctic ice; ... a family of [[gorilla]]s, the male beating his chest, ... an American [[grizzly bear]] standing on his hind legs, ten or twelve feet tall, and staring me right in the eye.}}

His parents helped nurture his growing interest in science by buying him chemistry sets and reading materials. His interest in space, however, was his primary focus, especially after reading science fiction stories by writers such as [[H. G. Wells]] and [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], which stirred his imagination about life on other planets such as [[Mars]]. According to biographer Ray Spangenburg, these early years as Sagan tried to understand the mysteries of the planets became a &quot;driving force in his life, a continual spark to his intellect, and a quest that would never be forgotten&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spangenburg&quot; /&gt;

In 1947 he discovered ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' magazine, which introduced him to more [[hard science fiction]] speculations than those in Burroughs's novels.&lt;ref name=&quot;sagan19780528&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/28/archives/growing-up-with.html |title=Growing up with Science Fiction |last=Sagan |first=Carl |date=May 28, 1978 |work=The New York Times |access-date=December 12, 2018 |page=SM7 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year inaugurated the &quot;[[flying saucer]]&quot; [[mass hysteria]] with the young Carl suspecting that the &quot;discs&quot; might be alien spaceships.&lt;ref name=&quot;anb.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anb.org/articles/13/13-02612-print.html |title=American National Biography Online, Carl Sagan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== High-school years ===
Sagan had lived in Bensonhurst, where he went to David A. Boody Junior High School. He had his [[bar mitzvah]] in Bensonhurst when he turned 13.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|23}} The following year, 1948, his family moved to the nearby town of [[Rahway, New Jersey]], for his father's work, where Sagan then entered [[Rahway High School]]. He graduated in 1951.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|23}} Rahway was an older industrial town, and the Sagans were among its few Jewish families.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|23}}

[[File:Carl Sagan 1951.png|thumb|right|Photo of Sagan from high-school yearbook, 1951]]
Sagan was a straight-A student but was bored due to unchallenging classes and uninspiring teachers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|23}} His teachers realized this and tried to convince his parents to send him to a private school, the administrator telling them, &quot;This kid ought to go to a school for gifted children, he has something really remarkable.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|24}} This they couldn't do, partly because of the cost.

Sagan was made president of the school's chemistry club, and at home he set up his own laboratory. He taught himself about molecules by making cardboard cutouts to help him visualize how [[molecules]] were formed: &quot;I found that about as interesting as doing [chemical] experiments&quot;, he said.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|24}} Sagan remained mostly interested in astronomy as a hobby, and in his junior year made it a career goal after he learned that astronomers were paid for doing what he always enjoyed: &quot;That was a splendid day—when I began to suspect that if I tried hard I could do astronomy full-time, not just part-time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot;/&gt;{{rp|25}}

Before the end of high school, he entered an essay contest in which he posed the question of whether human contact with advanced life forms from another planet might be as disastrous for people on Earth as it was for Native Americans when they first had contact with Europeans.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[#Poundstone|Poundstone 1999]], p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The subject was considered controversial, but his rhetorical skill won over the judges, and they awarded him first prize.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; By graduation, his classmates had voted him &quot;most likely to succeed&quot; and put him in line to be valedictorian.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

=== University education ===
Sagan attended the [[University of Chicago]], which was one of the few colleges he applied to that would consider admitting a 16-year-old, despite his excellent high-school grades. Its Chancellor, Robert Hutchins, structured the school as an &quot;ideal meritocracy&quot;, with no age requirement.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;[[#Poundstone|Poundstone 1999]], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The school also employed a number of the nation's leading scientists, including [[Enrico Fermi]] and [[Edward Teller]], along with operating the famous [[Yerkes Observatory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

During his time as an honors program [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]], Sagan worked in the laboratory of the [[geneticist]] [[Hermann Joseph Muller|H. J. Muller]] and wrote a thesis on the [[abiogenesis|origins of life]] with [[physical chemistry|physical chemist]] [[Harold Urey]]. Sagan joined the Ryerson Astronomical Society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://astro.uchicago.edu/RAS/ |title=Ryerson Astronomical Society |work=Ryerson Astronomical Society (RAS) |publisher=[[University of Chicago]] Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics |accessdate=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in laughingly self-proclaimed &quot;nothing&quot;&lt;!-- literally in the cited source - please do not change this --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sic.

He went on to earn a  [[Master of Science|M.S.]] degree in [[physics]] in 1956, before earning a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in 1960 with his thesis ''Physical Studies of Planets'' submitted to the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics.&lt;ref name=phd&gt;{{cite thesis | last = Sagan | first = Carl | author-link = Carl Sagan | title = Physical Studies of the Planets | degree = PhD | year = 1960 | publisher = University of Chicago | page = ii | quote = A thesis in four parts submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the Department of Astronomy, University of Chicago, June, 1960 |oclc=20678107 | id = {{ProQuest|301918122}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=November 11, 1993 |title=Graduate students receive first Sagan teaching awards |journal=University of Chicago Chronicle |volume=13 |issue=6 |accessdate=August 30, 2013 |url=http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/931111/sagan.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Head|Head 2006]], p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spangenburg &amp; Moser|Spangenburg &amp; Moser 2004]], p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

He used the summer months of his [[Postgraduate education|graduate studies]] to work with his [[Doctoral advisor|dissertation director]], [[planetary science|planetary scientist]] [[Gerard Kuiper]],&lt;ref name=mathgene/&gt; as well as physicist [[George Gamow]] and chemist [[Melvin Calvin]]. The title of Sagan's dissertation reflects his shared interests with Kuiper, who throughout the 1950s had been president of the [[International Astronomical Union]]'s commission on &quot;Physical Studies of Planets and Satellites&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Tatarewicz | first = Joseph N. | author-link =  | title = Space Technology &amp; Planetary Astronomy | place = Bloomington, IN | publisher = Indiana University Press | series = Science, technology, and society | year = 1990 | page = 22 | isbn = 978-0-253-35655-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1958, the two worked on the classified{{clarify|date=January 2019}} military [[Project A119]], the secret Air Force plan to detonate a nuclear warhead on the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W1f4TvNUwLsC |title=Lunar Exploration: Human Pioneers and Robotic Surveyors |first=Paolo |last=Ulivi |date=April 6, 2004 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-1-85233-746-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan had a [[Top Secret]] clearance at the [[U.S. Air Force]] and a [[Classified information#Secret|Secret]] clearance with NASA.&lt;ref name=&quot;morrison&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morrison |first=David |authorlink=David Morrison (astrophysicist) |date=January–February 2007 |title=Carl Sagan's Life and Legacy as Scientist, Teacher, and Skeptic |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/carl_sagans_life_and_legacy_as_scientist_teacher_and_skeptic |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=29–38 |issn=0194-6730 |accessdate=August 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201115954/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/carl_sagans_life_and_legacy_as_scientist_teacher_and_skeptic |archive-date=February 1, 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; While working on his doctoral dissertation, Sagan revealed US Government classified{{clarify|date=January 2019}} titles of two [[Project A119]] papers when he applied for a University of California at Berkeley scholarship in 1959.

From 1960 to 1962 Sagan was a [[Miller Research Fellows|Miller Fellow]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu/happy-belated-birthday-carl/ |title=Happy (Belated) Birthday Carl! |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] The Berkeley Science Review |accessdate=December 1, 2013|date=November 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, he published an article in 1961 in the journal ''Science'' on the atmosphere of Venus, while also working with NASA's [[Mariner 2]] team, and served as a &quot;Planetary Sciences Consultant&quot; to the [[RAND Corporation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Carl Sagan:A life&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Carl Sagan:A life |first1=Keay |last1=Davidson |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-471-25286-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/carlsaganlife00davi/page/138 138] |url=https://archive.org/details/carlsaganlife00davi/page/138 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the publication of Sagan's ''Science'' article, in 1961 [[Harvard University]] astronomers [[Fred Whipple]] and [[Donald Menzel]] offered Sagan the opportunity to give a colloquium at Harvard and subsequently offered him a [[Academic ranks in the United States|lecturer]] position at the institution.  Sagan instead asked to be made an [[assistant professor]], and eventually Whipple and Menzel were able to convince Harvard to offer Sagan the assistant professor position he requested.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carl Sagan:A life&quot;/&gt; Sagan lectured, performed research, and advised graduate students at the institution from 1963 until 1968, as well as working at the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]], also located in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].

In 1968, Sagan was denied [[Tenure (academic)|tenure]] at Harvard. He later indicated that the decision was very much unexpected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Carl Sagan: A life |first1=Keay |last1=Davidson |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-471-25286-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/carlsaganlife00davi/page/204 204] |url=https://archive.org/details/carlsaganlife00davi/page/204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tenure denial has been blamed on several factors, including that he focused his interests too broadly across a number of areas (while the norm in academia is to become a renowned expert in a narrow specialty), and perhaps because of his well-publicized scientific advocacy, which some scientists perceived as borrowing the ideas of others for little more than self-promotion.&lt;ref name=&quot;morrison&quot;/&gt; An advisor from his years as an undergraduate student, [[Harold Urey]], wrote a letter to the tenure committee recommending strongly against tenure for Sagan.&lt;ref name=&quot;anb.org&quot;/&gt;

Long before the ill-fated tenure process, [[Cornell University]] astronomer [[Thomas Gold]] had courted Sagan to move to [[Ithaca, New York]], and join the faculty at Cornell. Following the denial of tenure from Harvard, Sagan accepted Gold's offer and remained a faculty member at Cornell for nearly 30 years until his death in 1996. Unlike Harvard, the smaller and more laid-back astronomy department at Cornell welcomed Sagan's growing celebrity status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Carl Sagan:A life |first1=Keay |last1=Davidson |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-471-25286-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/carlsaganlife00davi/page/213 213] |url=https://archive.org/details/carlsaganlife00davi/page/213 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following two years as an associate professor, Sagan became a [[Professor|full professor]] at Cornell in 1970 and directed the Laboratory for [[Planetary science|Planetary Studies]] there. From 1972 to 1981, he was associate director of the Center for Radiophysics and Space Research (CRSR) at Cornell. In 1976, he became the David Duncan Professor of Astronomy and Space Sciences, a position he held for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Conversations with Carl Sagan |edition=illustrated |first1=Carl |last1=Sagan |first2=Tom |last2=Head |publisher=Univ.

Sagan was associated with the U.S. space program from its inception. From the 1950s onward, he worked as an advisor to [[NASA]], where one of his duties included briefing the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] [[astronaut]]s before their flights to the [[Moon]]. Sagan contributed to many of the [[robotic spacecraft]] missions that explored the [[Solar System]], arranging experiments on many of the expeditions. Sagan assembled the first physical message that was sent into space: a [[Gold plating|gold-plated]] [[Pioneer plaque|plaque]], attached to the space probe ''[[Pioneer&amp;nbsp;10]]'', launched in 1972. ''[[Pioneer&amp;nbsp;11]]'', also carrying another copy of the plaque, was launched the following year. He continued to refine his designs; the most elaborate message he helped to develop and assemble was the [[Voyager Golden Record]], which was sent out with the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] space probes in 1977. Sagan often challenged the decisions to fund the [[Space Shuttle]] and the [[International Space Station]] at the expense of further robotic missions.&lt;ref name=&quot;CharlieRose&quot;&gt;{{cite interview |last=Sagan |first=Carl |title=An Interview with Carl Sagan |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soF-aS169bw |work=[[Charlie Rose (TV series)|Charlie Rose]] |publisher=[[PBS]] |location=New York |date=January 5, 1995 |accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scientific achievements ===
Former student [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]] describes Sagan as &quot;an 'idea person' and a master of intuitive physical arguments and '[[Back-of-the-envelope calculation|back of the envelope]]' calculations&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;morrison&quot; /&gt; and [[Gerard Kuiper]] said that &quot;Some persons work best in specializing on a major program in the laboratory; others are best in liaison between sciences. Dr. Sagan belongs in the latter group.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;morrison&quot; /&gt;

Sagan's contributions were central to the discovery of the high surface temperatures of the planet [[Venus]].&lt;ref name=surftemp /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Planetary Climate |edition= |first1=Raymond T. |last1=Pierrehumbert |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-139-49506-6 |page=202 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bO_U8f5pVR8C}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=bO_U8f5pVR8C&amp;pg=PA202 Extract of page 202].&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1960s no one knew for certain the basic conditions of Venus' surface, and Sagan listed the possibilities in a report later depicted for popularization in a [[Time Life]] book ''Planets''. His own view was that Venus was dry and very hot as opposed to the balmy paradise others had imagined. He had investigated [[radio wave]]s from Venus and concluded that there was a surface temperature of {{convert|500|°C|-2}}. As a visiting scientist to NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], he contributed to the first [[Mariner program|Mariner]] missions to Venus, working on the design and management of the project. [[Mariner 2]] confirmed his conclusions on the surface conditions of Venus in 1962.

Sagan was among{{clarify|date=October 2014}} the first to hypothesize that [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] might possess oceans of liquid compounds on its surface and that [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] might possess subsurface oceans of water. This would make Europa potentially habitable.&lt;ref&gt;Much of Sagan's research in the field of planetary science is outlined by [[William Poundstone]]. Poundstone's biography of Sagan includes an 8-page list of Sagan's scientific articles published from 1957 to 1998. Detailed information about Sagan's scientific work comes from the primary research articles. Example: {{cite journal |last1=Sagan |first1=C. |last2=Thompson |first2=W. R. |last3=Khare |first3=B.

Darling]]'s [http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/T/Titanprebiotic.html ''The Encyclopedia of Science''].&lt;/ref&gt; Europa's subsurface ocean of water was later indirectly confirmed by the spacecraft ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]''. The mystery of Titan's reddish haze was also solved with Sagan's help. The reddish haze was revealed to be due to complex [[Organic compound|organic molecules]] constantly raining down onto Titan's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pafumi |first=G.

Sagan further contributed insights regarding the atmospheres of Venus and [[Jupiter]], as well as seasonal changes on [[Mars]]. He also perceived [[global warming]] as a growing, man-made danger and likened it to the natural development of Venus into a hot, life-hostile planet through a kind of [[runaway greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cosmos_book&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Sagan |first=Carl |title=Cosmos |edition=1st Ballantine Books |origyear=Originally published 1980 |year=1985 |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-345-33135-9 |oclc=12814276 |lccn=80005286 |ref=Sagan 1980 (1985 ed.)|title-link=Cosmos (Carl Sagan book) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan and his Cornell colleague [[Edwin Ernest Salpeter]] speculated about [[Jupiter#Possibility of life|life in Jupiter's clouds]], given the planet's dense atmospheric composition rich in organic molecules. He studied the observed color variations on Mars' surface and concluded that they were not seasonal or vegetational changes as most believed,{{clarify|date=October 2014}} but shifts in surface dust caused by [[dust storm#Extraterrestrial dust storms|windstorms]].

Sagan is also known for his research on the possibilities of [[Astrobiology|extraterrestrial life]], including experimental demonstration of the production of [[amino acid]]s from basic chemicals by [[radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Columbia Encyclopedia]] |title=Sagan, Carl Edward |url=http://www.bartelby.com/65/sa/Sagan-Ca.html |accessdate=August 30, 2013 |edition=Sixth |date=May 2001 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |location=New York |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011220013/http://bartelby.com/65/sa/Sagan-Ca.html |archivedate=October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ATP Synthesized&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=No Writer Attributed |title=Sagan Synthesizes ATP In Laboratory |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1963/8/21/sagan-synthesizes-atp-in-laboratory-plaboratory/ |accessdate=September 12, 2015 |work=The Harvard Crimson |date=August 21, 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Cosmos'': popularizing science on TV===
[[File:Carl Sagan - 1980.jpg|thumb|Sagan in ''Cosmos'' (1980)]]
In 1980 Sagan co-wrote and narrated the award-winning 13-part [[PBS]] television series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'', which became the most widely watched series in the history of American public television. The show has been seen by at least 500 million people across 60 different countries.&lt;ref name=Starchild /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/pqrst/sagan_carl.html |title=Carl Sagan |work=EMuseum |publisher=[[Minnesota State University, Mankato]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528213538/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/pqrst/sagan_carl.html |archivedate=May 28, 2010 |accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cosmolearning.com/documentaries/cosmos/ |title=CosmoLearning Astronomy |publisher=CosmoLearning |accessdate=October 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book, ''Cosmos'', written by Sagan, was published to accompany the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;NationalGeo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/03/140316-carl-sagan-science-galaxies-space/ |title=Who Was Carl Sagan? |last=Vergano |first=Dan |date=March 16, 2014 |website=National Geographic Daily News |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his earlier popularity as a science writer from his best-selling books, including ''The Dragons of Eden'', which won him a [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1977, he was asked to write and narrate the show. It was targeted to a general audience of viewers, who Sagan felt had lost interest in science, partly due to a stifled educational system.&lt;ref name=Browne&gt;Browne, Ray Broadus. ''The Guide to United States Popular Culture'', ''Popular Press'' (2001) p. 704.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the 13 episodes was created to focus on a particular subject or person, thereby demonstrating the synergy of the universe.&lt;ref name=Browne/&gt; They covered a wide range of scientific subjects including the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life]] and a perspective of humans' place on Earth.

The show won an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;cosmosemmy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/cosmos |title=Cosmos |publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]] |accessdate=September 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with a [[Peabody Award]], and transformed Sagan from an obscure astronomer into a pop-culture icon.&lt;ref&gt;''Popular Science'', Oct. 2005, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine ran a cover story about Sagan soon after the show broadcast, referring to him as &quot;creator, chief writer and host-narrator of the show&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Golden |first=Frederic |date=October 20, 1980 |title=The Cosmic Explainer |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=August 30, 2013 |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,951539,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, &quot;Cosmos&quot; was released on a remastered set of DVDs.

=== Scientific and critical thinking advocacy ===
&lt;span id=&quot;Scientific_advocacy&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- [[Sagan (number)]] redirects here --&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Sagan's ability to convey his ideas allowed many people to understand the cosmos better—simultaneously emphasizing the value and worthiness of the human race, and the relative insignificance of the Earth in comparison to the [[Universe]]. He delivered the 1977 series of [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://richannel.org/christmas-lectures/1977/1977-carl-sagan |title=Christmas Lectures 1977: The Planets : Ri Channel |work=Ri Channel |publisher=[[Royal Institution|Royal Institution of Great Britain]] |location=London |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan was a proponent of the search for extraterrestrial life. He urged the scientific community to listen with [[radio telescope]]s for signals from potential intelligent [[Extraterrestrial life#Indirect search|extraterrestrial life-forms]]. Sagan was so persuasive that by 1982 he was able to get a petition advocating SETI published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', signed by 70 scientists, including seven [[Nobel Prize]] winners. This signaled a tremendous increase in the respectability of a then-controversial field. Sagan also helped [[Frank Drake]] write the [[Arecibo message]], a radio message beamed into space from the [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo radio telescope]] on November 16, 1974, aimed at informing potential extraterrestrials about Earth.

Sagan was chief technology officer of the professional planetary research journal ''[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]]'' for 12 years. He co-founded [[The Planetary Society]] and was a member of the [[SETI Institute]] Board of Trustees. Sagan served as Chairman of the Division for Planetary Science of the [[American Astronomical Society]], as President of the Planetology Section of the [[American Geophysical Union]], and as Chairman of the Astronomy Section of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS).

[[File:Planetary society2.jpg|thumb|left|[[The Planetary Society]] members at the organization's founding. Carl Sagan is seated on the right.]]
At the height of the [[Cold War]], Sagan became involved in [[nuclear disarmament]] efforts by promoting hypotheses on the effects of [[nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], when [[Paul Crutzen]]'s [[Nuclear winter#1982|&quot;Twilight at Noon&quot;]] concept suggested that a substantial nuclear exchange could trigger a [[Nuclear winter#1982|nuclear twilight]] and upset the delicate balance of life on Earth by cooling the surface. In 1983 he was one of five authors—the &quot;S&quot;—in the follow-up [[Nuclear winter#1983|&quot;TTAPS&quot;]] model (as the research article came to be known), which contained the first use of the term &quot;[[nuclear winter]]&quot;, which his colleague [[Richard P. Turco]] had coined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turco |first1=R. P. |authorlink1=Richard P. Turco |last2=Toon |first2=O. B. |authorlink2=Owen Toon |last3=Ackerman |first3=T.

Carl Sagan discussed his involvement in the political nuclear winter debates and his erroneous global cooling prediction for the Gulf War fires in his book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 he co-authored the book ''[[The Cold and the Dark: The World after Nuclear War]]'' and in 1990 the book ''A Path Where No Man Thought: Nuclear Winter and the End of the Arms Race'', which explains the nuclear-winter hypothesis and advocates [[nuclear disarmament]]. Sagan received a great deal of skepticism and disdain for the use of media to disseminate a very uncertain hypothesis. A personal correspondence with nuclear physicist [[Edward Teller]] around 1983 began amicably, with Teller expressing support for continued research to ascertain the credibility of the winter hypothesis. However, Sagan and Teller's correspondence would ultimately result in Teller writing: &quot;A propagandist is one who uses incomplete information to produce maximum persuasion.

Sagan wrote a sequel to ''Cosmos'', ''[[Pale Blue Dot (book)|Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space]]'', which was selected as a notable book of 1995 by ''[[The New York Times]]''. He appeared on PBS's ''[[Charlie Rose (TV series)|Charlie Rose]]'' program in January 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;CharlieRose&quot; /&gt; Sagan also wrote the introduction for [[Stephen Hawking]]'s bestseller ''[[A Brief History of Time]]''. Sagan was also known for his popularization of science, his efforts to increase scientific understanding among the general public, and his positions in favor of [[scientific skepticism]] and against [[pseudoscience]], such as his [[Debunker|debunking]] of the [[Betty and Barney Hill abduction]]. To mark the tenth anniversary of Sagan's death, [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]], a former student of Sagan, recalled &quot;Sagan's immense contributions to planetary research, the public understanding of science, and the skeptical movement&quot; in ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;morrison&quot; /&gt;

Following [[Saddam Hussein]]'s threats to light [[Kuwait]]'s oil wells on fire in response to any physical challenge to [[Iraq]]i control of the oil assets, Sagan together with his &quot;TTAPS&quot; colleagues and [[Paul Crutzen]], warned in January 1991 in the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' and ''[[Wilmington Morning Star]]'' newspapers that if the fires were left to burn over a period of several months, enough smoke from the 600 or so 1991 [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] &quot;might get so high as to disrupt agriculture in much of South Asia&amp;nbsp;...&quot; and that this possibility should &quot;affect the war plans&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-01-23/news/1991023131_1_kuwait-saddam-hussein-sagan |title=PAGE 1 OF 2: Burning oil wells could be disaster, Sagan says January 23, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6tEVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RBQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6851,2148654&amp;dq=world-climate-conference+oil+fires ''Wilmington morning Star'']. January 21, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; these claims were also the subject of a televised debate between Sagan and physicist [[Fred Singer]] on January 22, aired on the [[ABC News]] program ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/4960296/The-Kuwaiti-Oli-Fires |title=The Kuwaiti Oil Fires |author=Hirschmann, Kris |publisher=Facts on File |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193647/http://www.scribd.com/doc/4960296/The-Kuwaiti-Oli-Fires |archivedate=January 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--The reference for this is a hardcopy transcript of the episode, excerpts on the Fred Singer talk page.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title = FIRST ISRAELI SCUD FATALITIES OIL FIRES IN KUWAIT |series = Nightline |serieslink = Nightline (US news program) |network = ABC |airdate = January 22, 1991 |transcript = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:F-14A VF-114 over burning Kuwaiti oil well 1991.JPEG|thumb|left|Sagan admitted that he had overestimated the danger posed by the 1991 [[Kuwaiti oil fires]].]] In the televised debate, Sagan argued that the effects of the smoke would be similar to the effects of a [[nuclear winter]], with Singer arguing to the contrary. After the debate, the fires burnt for many months before extinguishing efforts were complete. The results of the smoke did not produce continental-sized cooling. Sagan later conceded in ''The Demon-Haunted World'' that the prediction did not turn out to be correct: &quot;it ''was'' pitch black at noon and temperatures dropped 4–6&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;!-- unspaced in the original --&gt; over the [[Persian Gulf]], but not much smoke reached stratospheric altitudes and Asia was spared&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sagan 1995|Sagan 1995]], p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later years Sagan advocated the creation of an organized search for asteroids/[[near-Earth object]]s (NEOs) that might impact the Earth but to forestall or postpone developing the technological methods that would be needed to defend against them.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Head|Head 2006]], p. 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that all of the numerous methods proposed to [[asteroid impact avoidance|alter the orbit of an asteroid]], including the employment of [[nuclear weapon design|nuclear detonations]], created a [[Asteroid impact avoidance#Deflection technology concerns|deflection dilemma]]: if the ability to deflect an asteroid away from the Earth exists, then one would also have the ability to divert a non-threatening object towards Earth, creating an immensely destructive weapon.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Sagan |first1=Carl |last2=Ostro |first2=Steven J. |authorlink2=Steven J.

Sagan remained hopeful that the natural NEO impact threat and the intrinsically double-edged essence of the methods to prevent these threats would serve as a &quot;new and potent motivation to maturing international relations&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url=http://www.astrosociety.org/silicon-valley-astronomy-lectures/taking-a-hit-asteroid-impacts-and-evolution/ |title=Taking a Hit: Asteroid Impacts &amp; Evolution |website=Astronomical Society of the Pacific |publisher=[[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] |last=Morrison |first=David|authorlink=David Morrison (astrophysicist) |date=October 3, 2007 |accessdate=August 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later acknowledging that, with sufficient international oversight, in the future a &quot;work our way up&quot; approach to implementing nuclear explosive deflection methods could be fielded, and when sufficient knowledge was gained, to use them to aid in [[mining asteroids]].&lt;ref name=&quot;e-reading.club&quot;/&gt;  His interest in the use of nuclear detonations in space grew out of his work in 1958 for the [[Armour Research Foundation]]'s [[Project A119]], concerning the possibility of detonating a nuclear device on the lunar surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/war-is-boring/3516ac20ae1e |title=When Earth Dreamed of Nuking the Moon |last1=Gault |first1=Matthew |date=November 28, 2013 |website=medium.com |publisher=War is Boring |accessdate=November 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan was a critic of [[Plato]], having said of the ancient Greek philosopher: &quot;Science and mathematics were to be removed from the hands of the merchants and the artisans. This tendency found its most effective advocate in a follower of [[Pythagoras]] named Plato&quot; and&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Backbone of Night |series=[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]] |first=Carl (writer/host) |last=Sagan |network=PBS |airdate=November 9, 1980 |number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
He (Plato) believed that [[Theory of Forms|ideas were far more real than the natural world]]. He advised the astronomers not to waste their time observing the stars and planets. It was better, he believed, just to think about them. Plato expressed hostility to observation and experiment. He taught contempt for the real world and disdain for the practical application of scientific knowledge. Plato's followers succeeded in extinguishing the light of science and experiment that had been kindled by [[Democritus]] and the [[Ionian School (philosophy)|other Ionians]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Popularizing science ===
Speaking about his activities in popularizing science, Sagan said that there were at least two reasons for scientists to share the purposes of science and its contemporary state. Simple self-interest was one: much of the funding for science came from the public, and the public therefore had the right to know how the money was being spent. If scientists increased public admiration for science, there was a good chance of having more public supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/29/archives/carl-sagan-obliged-to-explain-carl-sagan.html|title=Carl Sagan: Obliged to Explain|author=BOYCE RENSBERGER|editor=The New York Times|date=May 29, 1977|accessdate=March 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other reason was the excitement of communicating one's own excitement about science to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Carl Sagan, an Astronomer Who Excelled at Popularizing Science, Is Dead at 62 |first=William |last=Dicke |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1109.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 21, 1996 |accessdate=August 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
While Sagan was widely adored by the general public, his reputation in the scientific community was more polarized.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics sometimes characterized his work as fanciful, non-rigorous, and self-aggrandizing,&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; and others complained in his later years that he neglected his role as a faculty member to foster his celebrity status.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Sagan's harshest critics, [[Harold Urey]], felt that Sagan was getting too much publicity for a scientist and was treating some scientific theories too casually.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson, p. 203&quot;&gt;Davidson, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Urey and Sagan were said to have different philosophies of science, according to Davidson. While Urey was an &quot;old-time empiricist&quot; who avoided theorizing about the unknown, Sagan was by contrast willing to speculate openly about such matters.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Whipple]] wanted Harvard to keep Sagan there, but learned that because Urey was a Nobel laureate, his opinion was an important factor in Harvard denying Sagan tenure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson, p. 203&quot;/&gt;

Sagan's Harvard friend [[Lester Grinspoon]] also stated: &quot;I know Harvard well enough to know there are people there who certainly do not like people who are outspoken.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson, p. 203&quot;/&gt; Grinspoon added:&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson, p. 203&quot;/&gt;
{{quote|Wherever you turned, there was one astronomer being quoted on everything, one astronomer whose face you were seeing on TV, and one astronomer whose books had the preferred display slot at the local bookstore.}}

Some, like Urey, later came to realize that Sagan's popular brand of scientific advocacy was beneficial to the science as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson, p. 297&quot;&gt;Davidson, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; Urey especially liked Sagan's 1977 book ''[[The Dragons of Eden]]'' and wrote Sagan with his opinion: &quot;I like it very much and am amazed that someone like you has such an intimate knowledge of the various features of the problem... I congratulate you... You are a man of many talents.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson, p. 297&quot;/&gt;

Sagan was accused of borrowing some ideas of others for his own benefit and countered these claims by explaining that the misappropriation was an unfortunate side effect of his role as a science communicator and explainer, and that he attempted to give proper credit whenever possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson, p. 203&quot;/&gt;

=== Social concerns ===
Sagan believed that the [[Drake equation]], on substitution of reasonable estimates, suggested that a large number of extraterrestrial civilizations would form, but that the lack of evidence of such civilizations highlighted by the [[Fermi paradox]] suggests [[Technology|technological]] civilizations tend to self-destruct. This stimulated his interest in identifying and publicizing ways that humanity could destroy itself, with the hope of avoiding such a [[Risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth|cataclysm]] and eventually becoming a [[spacefaring]] species. Sagan's deep concern regarding the potential destruction of [[Risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth|human civilization]] in a [[nuclear holocaust]] was conveyed in a memorable cinematic sequence in the final episode of ''Cosmos'', called &quot;Who Speaks for Earth?&quot; Sagan had already resigned{{date?}} from the [[United States Air Force Scientific Advisory Board|Air Force Scientific Advisory Board]]'s UFO investigating [[Condon Committee]] and voluntarily surrendered his [[Security clearance#Top Secret|top-secret clearance]] in protest over the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Druyan |first=Ann |authorlink=Ann Druyan |date=November 2000 |title=A New Sense of the Sacred Carl Sagan's 'Cosmic Connection' |journal=[[American Humanist Association|The Humanist]] |volume=60 |issue=6 |accessdate=August 29, 2013 |url=https://www.questia.com/library/1G1-78889720/a-new-sense-of-the-sacred-carl-sagan-s-cosmic-connection}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his marriage to his third wife ([[novelist]] Ann Druyan) in June 1981, Sagan became more politically active—particularly in opposing escalation of the [[nuclear arms race]] under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]].
[[File:US and USSR nuclear stockpiles.svg|thumb|The United States and [[Soviet Union]]/Russia nuclear stockpiles, in [[Historical nuclear weapons stockpiles and nuclear tests by country|total number of nuclear bombs/warheads in existence]] throughout the [[Cold War]] and post-Cold War era]]
In March 1983, Reagan announced the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]]—a multibillion-dollar project to develop a comprehensive [[missile defense|defense]] against attack by [[Nuclear weapons delivery#Ballistic missile|nuclear missiles]], which was quickly dubbed the &quot;Star Wars&quot; program. Sagan spoke out against the project, arguing that it was technically impossible to develop a system with the level of perfection required, and far more expensive to build such a system than it would be for an enemy to defeat it through [[Decoy#Military decoy|decoys]] and other means—and that its construction would seriously destabilize the &quot;nuclear balance&quot; between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], making further progress toward [[nuclear disarmament]] impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVUk30GFsL4 |title=YouTube |website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] declared a unilateral moratorium on the [[Nuclear weapons testing|testing of nuclear weapons]], which would begin on August 6, 1985—the 40th&amp;nbsp;anniversary of the [[Nuclear weapon#Fission weapons|atomic bombing]] of [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]]—the Reagan administration dismissed the dramatic move as nothing more than propaganda and refused to follow suit. In response, US [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]] and peace activists staged a series of protest actions at the [[Nevada National Security Site|Nevada Test Site]], beginning on [[Easter|Easter Sunday]] in 1986 and continuing through 1987. Hundreds of people in the &quot;[[Nevada Desert Experience]]&quot; group were arrested, including Sagan, who was arrested on two separate occasions as he climbed over a chain-link fence at the test site during the underground [[Operation Charioteer]] and [[Operation Musketeer (Nuclear test)|United States's Musketeer nuclear test series]] of detonations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spangenburg &amp; Moser|Spangenburg &amp; Moser 2004]], p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan was also a vocal advocate of the controversial notion of [[testosterone poisoning]], arguing in 1992 that human males could become gripped by an &quot;unusually severe [case of] testosterone poisoning&quot; and this could compel them to become [[genocidal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rethinking Risk and the Precautionary Principle |edition= |first1=Julian |last1=Morris |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-08-051623-3 |page=116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XX6Us6SjLYkC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=XX6Us6SjLYkC&amp;pg=PA116 Extract of page 116].&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of [[Moondance magazine]] writer [[Daniela Gioseffi]]'s 1990 book ''Women on War'', he argues that females are the only half of humanity &quot;untainted by testosterone poisoning&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italianamericanwriters.com/womenonwar.html Women On War], Daniela Gioseffi.&lt;/ref&gt; One chapter of his 1993 book ''[[Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors (book)|Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors]]'' is dedicated to testosterone and its alleged poisonous effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Atheists in America |edition=reprinted |first1=Melanie E.|last1=Brewster |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-231-53700-1 |page=102 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iMjaAgAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=iMjaAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102 Extract of page 102].&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan was married three times.  In 1957, he married biologist [[Lynn Margulis]]. The couple had two children, Jeremy and [[Dorion Sagan]]. After Carl Sagan and Margulis divorced, he married artist [[Linda Salzman Sagan|Linda Salzman]] in 1968 and they also had a child together, [[Nick Sagan]]. During these marriages, Carl Sagan focused heavily on his career, a factor which may have contributed to Sagan's first divorce.&lt;ref name=&quot;morrison&quot; /&gt; In 1981, Sagan married author [[Ann Druyan]] and they later had two children, Alexandra and Samuel Sagan. Carl Sagan and Druyan remained married until his death in 1996. He lived in an [[900 Stewart Avenue (Ithaca, New York)|Egyptian revival house in Ithaca]] perched on the edge of a cliff that had formerly been the headquarters of a [[Cornell]] secret society.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=1207807200 |url-status=dead |title=Dear Uncle Ezra |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606171745/http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=1207807200 |archive-date=June 6, 2013 |access-date=August 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Daughter Alexandra (also known as Sasha) published a book in 2019 on her father's primary legacy: skepticism does not mean pessimism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kveller.com/sasha-sagan-on-making-jewish-rituals-meaningful-for-secular-jews/|title=Sasha Sagan on Making Jewish Rituals Meaningful for Secular Jews|date=October 23, 2019|website=Kveller|language=en|access-date=November 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaac Asimov]] described Sagan as one of only two people he ever met whose intellect surpassed his own. The other, he claimed, was the [[Computer science|computer scientist]] and [[artificial intelligence]] expert [[Marvin Minsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954–1978 |origyear=Originally published 1980; Garden City, NY: [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |year=1981 |publisher=[[Avon (publisher)|Avon]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-380-53025-0 |oclc=7880716 |lccn=79003685 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/217 217, 302] |url=https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/217 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan wrote frequently about religion and the relationship between religion and science, expressing his skepticism about the conventional conceptualization of God as a sapient being. For example: &lt;blockquote&gt;Some people think God is an outsized, light-skinned male with a long white beard, sitting on a throne somewhere up there in the sky, busily tallying the fall of every sparrow. Others—for example [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Albert Einstein]]—considered God to be essentially the sum total of the physical laws which describe the universe. I do not know of any compelling evidence for anthropomorphic patriarchs controlling human destiny from some hidden celestial vantage point, but it would be madness to deny the existence of physical laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sagan |first=Carl |title=Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science |edition=Reprint |origyear=Originally published 1979 |year=1980 |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-345-33689-7 |oclc=428008204 |lccn=78021810 |page=330|title-link=Broca's Brain (book) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another description of his view on the concept of God, Sagan wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;The idea that God is an oversized white male with a flowing beard who sits in the sky and tallies the fall of every sparrow is ludicrous. But if by God one means the set of physical laws that govern the universe, then clearly there is such a God. This God is emotionally unsatisfying&amp;nbsp;... it does not make much sense to pray to the law of gravity.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source required for this quotation.|date=November 2019}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On [[atheism]], Sagan commented in 1981: &lt;blockquote&gt;An atheist is someone who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has compelling evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, we would have to know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sagan2006&quot;&gt;[[#Head|Head 2006]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=gJ1rDj2nR3EC&amp;pg=PA70 p. 70]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sagan also commented on Christianity and the [[Jefferson Bible]], stating &quot;My long-time view about Christianity is that it represents an amalgam of two seemingly immiscible parts, the religion of Jesus and the religion of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]. [[Thomas Jefferson]] attempted to excise the Pauline parts of the New Testament. There wasn't much left when he was done, but it was an inspiring document.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schei|first=Kenneth A.|title=An Atheist for Jesus|year=1996|publisher=Synthesis|isbn=978-0-926491-01-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding spirituality and its relationship with science, Sagan stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;'Spirit' comes from the Latin word 'to breathe'. What we breathe is air, which is certainly matter, however thin. Despite usage to the contrary, there is no necessary implication in the word 'spiritual' that we are talking of anything other than matter (including the matter of which the brain is made), or anything
outside the realm of science. On occasion, I will feel free to use the word. Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light-years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, Carl; Druyan, Ann (1997).

An environmental appeal, &quot;Preserving and Cherishing the Earth&quot;, signed by Sagan with other noted scientists in January 1990, stated that &quot;The historical record makes clear that religious teaching, example, and leadership are powerfully able to influence personal conduct and commitment... Thus, there is a vital role for religion and science.&quot;

In reply to a question in 1996 about his religious beliefs, Sagan answered, &quot;I'm agnostic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Head |first=Tom |year=1997 |title=Conversations with Carl | journal=Skeptic |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=32–38 }} Excerpted in [[#Head|Head 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan maintained that the idea of a creator God of the Universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could challenge it would be an infinitely old universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sagan |first=Carl |title=The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark |edition=1st Ballantine Books |origyear=Originally published 1995 |year=1997 |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-345-40946-1 |oclc=36504316 |lccn=95034076 |page=278|title-link=The Demon-Haunted World }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan's views on religion have been interpreted as a form of [[pantheism]] comparable to Einstein's belief in [[Spinozism|Spinoza's God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tracy |first=David |authorlink=David Tracy |editor1-last=Cobb |editor1-first=John B., Jr. |editor1-link=John B.

In 2006, Ann Druyan edited Sagan's 1985 Glasgow ''[[Gifford Lectures]] in Natural Theology'' into a book, ''[[The Varieties of Scientific Experience: A Personal View of the Search for God]]'', in which he elaborates on his views of divinity in the [[nature|natural world]].

Sagan is also widely regarded as a [[freethought|freethinker]] or [[skepticism|skeptic]]; one of his most famous quotations, in ''Cosmos'', was, &quot;Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode | title= Encyclopaedia Galactica | series=Cosmos: A Personal Voyage |first=Carl (writer/host) |last=Sagan | network=PBS | airdate=December 14, 1980 | number=12 | minutes=01:24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (called the &quot;[[Sagan standard]]&quot; by some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lawsoflife.co.uk/sagans-standard/ | title= Sagan's Standard |last=Rawson |first=Hugh | work=The Unwritten Laws of Life | publisher= CSBC Ltd | year=2008 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112045003/http://lawsoflife.co.uk/sagans-standard/ |archivedate=January 12, 2012 |accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This was based on a nearly identical statement by fellow founder of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal]], [[Marcello Truzzi]], &quot;An extraordinary claim requires extraordinary proof.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Truzzi |first=Marcello |authorlink=Marcello Truzzi |title=On the Extraordinary: An Attempt at Clarification |year=1978 |journal=Zetetic Scholar |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=11 |url=http://www.tricksterbook.com/truzzi/ZS-Issues-PDFs/ZeteticScholarNo1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Truzzi |first=Marcello |editor-last=Binkowski |editor-first=Edward |year=1998 |title=On Some Unfair Practices towards Claims of the Paranormal |journal=Oxymoron: Annual Thematic Anthology of the Arts and Sciences |volume= 2: The Fringe |issn=1090-2236 |oclc=35240974 |accessdate=September 1, 2013 |url=http://www.skepticalinvestigations.org/Anomali/practices.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea had been earlier aphorized in [[Théodore Flournoy]]'s work ''From India to the Planet Mars'' (1899) from a longer quote by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] (1749–1827), a French mathematician and astronomer, as the Principle of Laplace: &quot;The weight of the evidence should be proportioned to the strangeness of the facts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Flournoy |first=Théodore |authorlink=Théodore Flournoy |others=Introduction by Hélène Boursinhac; translation by Daniel B.

Late in his life, Sagan's books elaborated on his [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] view of the world. In ''The Demon-Haunted World'', he presented tools for testing arguments and detecting fallacious or fraudulent ones, essentially advocating wide use of critical thinking and the scientific method. The compilation ''Billions and Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium'', published in 1997 after Sagan's death, contains essays written by Sagan, such as his views on abortion, as well as an account by his widow, Ann Druyan, of his death in relation to his having been an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] and freethinker.

Sagan warned against humans' tendency towards [[anthropocentrism]]. He was the faculty adviser for the Cornell Students for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. In the ''Cosmos'' chapter &quot;Blues For a Red Planet&quot;, Sagan wrote, &quot;If there is life on Mars, I believe we should do nothing with Mars. Mars then belongs to the Martians, even if the Martians are only microbes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sagan 1980 (1985 ed.)|Sagan 1980 (1985 ed.)]], p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan was a user and advocate of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. Under the pseudonym &quot;Mr.&amp;nbsp;X&quot;, he contributed an essay about smoking cannabis to the 1971 book ''Marihuana Reconsidered''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grinspoon |first=Lester |authorlink=Lester Grinspoon |others=New introduction by author |edition=2nd (reprint) |title=Marihuana Reconsidered |origyear=2nd ed. published 1977; Cambridge, MA: [[Harvard University Press]] |year=1994 |publisher=Quick American Archives |location=Oakland, CA |isbn=978-0-932551-13-9 |oclc=32410025 |lccn=77076767 |url=https://archive.org/details/marijuanareconsi00grin }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mr. X | url=http://marijuana-uses.com/mr-x/ | publisher=Marijuana-Uses.com | author=Sagan, Carl | accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- NOTE: The book's title spells 'Marihuana' with an 'h' --&gt; The essay explained that marijuana use had helped to inspire some of Sagan's works and enhance sensual and intellectual experiences.

In 1994, engineers at [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] code-named the [[Power Macintosh&amp;nbsp;7100]] &quot;Carl Sagan&quot; in the hope that Apple would make &quot;billions and billions&quot; with the sale of the PowerMac&amp;nbsp;7100.&lt;ref name=poundstone /&gt; The name was only used internally, but Sagan was concerned that it would become a product endorsement and sent Apple a cease-and-desist letter.

=== UFOs ===
In 1947, the year that inaugurated the &quot;[[flying saucer]]&quot; [[fad|craze]], the young Sagan suspected the &quot;discs&quot; might be alien spaceships.&lt;ref name=&quot;anb.org&quot;/&gt;

Sagan's interest in [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] reports prompted him on August 3, 1952, to write a letter to U.S.&amp;nbsp;Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] to ask how the United States would respond if flying saucers turned out to be extraterrestrial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|51–52}} He later had several conversations on the subject in 1964 with [[Jacques Vallée]].&lt;ref name=westrum&gt;{{cite book|last=Westrum |first=Ron |authorlink=Ron Westrum |editor-last=Jacobs |editor-first=David M. |editor-link=David M.

[[Stuart Appelle]] notes that Sagan &quot;wrote frequently on what he perceived as the [[logic]]al and [[empiricism|empirical]] [[fallacy|fallacies]] regarding UFOs and the [[Alien abduction|abduction experience]]. Sagan rejected an [[extraterrestrial hypothesis|extraterrestrial explanation]] for the phenomenon but felt there were both empirical and [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] benefits for examining UFO reports and that the subject was, therefore, a legitimate topic of study.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Appelle |first=Stuart |authorlink=Stuart Appelle |editor-last=Jacobs |editor-first=David M. |title=UFOs and Abductions: Challenging the Borders of Knowledge |year=2000 |publisher=University Press of Kansas |location=Lawrence, KS |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ufosabductions00davi/page/7 7–30] |chapter=Ufology and Academia: The UFO Phenomenon as a Scholarly Discipline |isbn=978-0-7006-1032-7 |oclc=43615835 |lccn=00028970 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/ufosabductions00davi/page/7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 Sagan was a member of the Ad&amp;nbsp;Hoc Committee to Review [[Project Blue Book]], the [[United States Air Force|U.S.&amp;nbsp;Air Force]]'s UFO investigation project. The committee concluded Blue Book had been lacking as a scientific study, and recommended a university-based project to give the UFO phenomenon closer scientific scrutiny. The result was the [[Condon Committee]] (1966–68), led by physicist [[Edward Condon]], and in their final report they formally concluded that UFOs, regardless of what any of them actually were, did not behave in a manner consistent with a threat to national security.

Sociologist [[Ron Westrum]] writes that &quot;The high point of Sagan's treatment of the UFO question was the [http://meetings.aaas.org/ AAAS' symposium] in 1969. A wide range of educated opinions on the subject were offered by participants, including not only proponents such as [[James E. McDonald|James McDonald]] and [[J.&amp;nbsp;Allen Hynek]] but also skeptics like astronomers [[William Kenneth Hartmann|William Hartmann]] and [[Donald Howard Menzel|Donald Menzel]]. The roster of speakers was balanced, and it is to Sagan's credit that this event was presented in spite of pressure from Edward Condon.&quot;&lt;ref name=westrum /&gt; With physicist Thornton Page, Sagan edited the lectures and discussions given at the symposium; these were published in 1972 as ''UFO's: A Scientific Debate''. Some of Sagan's many books examine UFOs (as did one episode of ''Cosmos'') and he claimed a religious undercurrent to the phenomenon.

Sagan again revealed his views on interstellar travel in his 1980 ''Cosmos'' series. In one of his last written works, Sagan argued that the chances of extraterrestrial spacecraft visiting Earth are vanishingly small. However, Sagan did think it plausible that Cold War concerns contributed to governments misleading their citizens about UFOs, and wrote that &quot;some UFO reports and analyses, and perhaps voluminous files, have been made inaccessible to the public which pays the bills&amp;nbsp;... It's time for the files to be declassified and made generally available.&quot; He cautioned against jumping to conclusions about suppressed UFO data and stressed that there was no strong evidence that aliens were visiting the Earth either in the past or present.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sagan 1995|Sagan 1995]], pp. 81–96, 99–104&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;Sagan's paradox&quot;===

Sagan's contribution to the 1969 symposium was an attack on the belief that UFOs are piloted by extraterrestrial beings. Applying several logical assumptions (see [[Drake equation]]), Sagan calculated the possible number of advanced civilizations capable of interstellar travel to be about one million. He projected that any civilization wishing to check on all the others on a regular basis of, say, once a year would have to launch 10,000 spacecraft annually. Not only does that seem like an unreasonable number of launchings, but it would take all the material in one percent of the universe's stars to produce all the spaceships needed for all the civilizations to seek each other out.

To argue that the Earth was being chosen for regular visitations, Sagan said, one would have to assume that the planet is somehow unique, and that assumption &quot;goes exactly against the idea that there are lots of civilizations around. Because if there are then our sort of civilization must be pretty common. And if we're not pretty common then there aren't going to be many civilizations advanced enough to send visitors&quot;.

This argument, which some called Sagan's paradox, helped to establish a new school of thought, namely the belief that extraterrestrial life exists, but it has nothing to do with UFOs. The new belief had a salutary effect on UFO studies. It helped separate researchers who wanted to distinguish UFOs from those who wanted to identify their pilots and it gave scientists opportunities to search the universe for intelligent life unencumbered by the stigma associated with UFOs.&lt;ref&gt;David Jacobs.

=== Posthumous recognition ===
The 1997 film ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'', based on Sagan's only fiction novel of the same name&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-671-43400-7|website=www.publishersweekly.com|access-date=November 6, 2019|title=Fiction Book Review: Contact by Carl Sagan, Author Simon &amp; Schuster $18.45 (0p) ISBN 978-0-671-43400-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finished after his death, ends with the dedication &quot;For Carl&quot;. His photo can also be seen in the film.

In 1997 the [[Sagan Planet Walk]] was opened in Ithaca, New York. It is a walking-scale model of the Solar System, extending 1.2&amp;nbsp;km from the center of The Commons in downtown Ithaca to the [[Sciencenter]], a hands-on museum. The exhibition was created in memory of Carl Sagan, who was an Ithaca resident and Cornell Professor. Professor Sagan had been a founding member of the museum's advisory board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencenter.org/saganpw/ |title=Sagan Planet Walk |website=sciencenter.org |publisher=[[Sciencenter]] |location=Ithaca, NY |accessdate=March 10, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205135839/http://www.sciencenter.org/saganpw/ |archivedate=February 5, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The landing site of the unmanned ''[[Mars Pathfinder]]'' spacecraft was renamed the [[Mars Pathfinder#End of mission|Carl Sagan Memorial Station]] on July 5, 1997. Asteroid [[2709&amp;nbsp;Sagan]] is named in his honor, as is the [[Carl Sagan Institute]] for the search of habitable planets.

Sagan's son, Nick Sagan, wrote several episodes in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise. In an episode of ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' entitled &quot;[[Terra Prime]]&quot;, a quick shot is shown of the relic [[Rover (space exploration)|rover]] ''[[Mars Pathfinder#Sojourner rover|Sojourner]]'', part of the ''Mars Pathfinder'' mission, placed by a historical marker at [[Mars Pathfinder|Carl Sagan Memorial Station]] on the Martian surface. The marker displays a quote from Sagan: &quot;Whatever the reason you're on Mars, I'm glad you're there, and I wish I was with you.&quot; Sagan's student [[Steve Squyres]] led the team that landed the rovers ''[[Spirit (rover)|Spirit]]'' and ''[[Opportunity (rover)|Opportunity]]'' successfully on Mars in 2004.

On November 9, 2001, on what would have been Sagan's 67th birthday, the [[Ames Research Center]] dedicated the site for the Carl Sagan Center for the Study of Life in the Cosmos. &quot;Carl was an incredible visionary, and now his legacy can be preserved and advanced by a 21st&amp;nbsp;century research and education laboratory committed to enhancing our understanding of life in the universe and furthering the cause of space exploration for all time&quot;, said NASA Administrator [[Daniel Goldin]]. Ann Druyan was at the Center as it opened its doors on October 22, 2006.

Sagan has at least three awards named in his honor:
* The [[Carl Sagan Memorial Award]] presented jointly since 1997 by the American Astronomical Society and The Planetary Society,
* The [[Carl Sagan Medal]] for Excellence in Public Communication in Planetary Science presented since 1998 by the American Astronomical Society's [[Division for Planetary Sciences]] (AAS/DPS) for outstanding communication by an active planetary scientist to the general public—Carl Sagan was one of the original organizing committee members of the DPS, and
* The [[Carl Sagan Award for Public Understanding of Science]] presented by the [[Council of Scientific Society Presidents]] (CSSP)—Sagan was the first recipient of the CSSP award in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cssp.us/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=47 |title=Sagan Award for Public Understanding of Science |publisher=Council of Scientific Society Presidents |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726075012/http://cssp.us/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=47 |archivedate=July 26, 2007 |accessdate=May 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

August 2007 the [[Independent Investigations Group]] (IIG) awarded Sagan posthumously a Lifetime Achievement Award. This honor has also been awarded to [[Harry Houdini]] and [[James Randi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iigwest.com/iigawards/2006/index.html |title=The 2007 IIG Awards |website=IIG |publisher=[[Independent Investigations Group]] |location=Los Angeles |date=August 18, 2007 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, a musical compositor [[Benn Jordan]] released his album [[Benn Jordan#As Benn Jordan|Pale Blue Dot]] as a tribute to Carl Sagan's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://headphonecommute.com/2008/12/11/two-and-a-half-questions-with-benn-jordan/|title=Two and a Half Questions with Benn Jordan|date=2008-12-12|website=Headphone Commute|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bennjordan.bandcamp.com/album/pale-blue-dot|title=Pale Blue Dot, by Benn Jordan|website=Benn Jordan|access-date=2019-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2009, a musical project known as [[Symphony of Science]] sampled several excerpts of Sagan from his series ''Cosmos'' and remixed them to [[electronic music]]. To date, the videos have received over 21&amp;nbsp;million views worldwide on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Boswell, John |date=November 9, 2009 |title=A Glorious Dawn |medium=[[Gramophone record#Common formats|7-in (17.5 cm) gramophone record]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgiXGELjbc |accessdate=September 3, 2013 |publisher=[[Third Man Records]] |location=Nashville, TN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 Swedish science fiction short film ''[[Wanderers (short film)|Wanderers]]'' uses excerpts of Sagan's narration of his book ''Pale Blue Dot'', played over digitally-created visuals of humanity's possible future expansion into outer space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=D'Orazio |first=Dante |date=November 30, 2014 |title=Wonderful short film imagines the day when we conquer the solar system |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/30/7310433/wanderers-sci-fi-short-film-imagines-when-humans-conquer-the-solar-system |newspaper=The Verge |location= |access-date=February 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=David |first=Leonard |date=December 1, 2014 |title=Epic Short Film 'Wanderers' Envisions Humanity's Future in Space |url=http://www.space.com/27895-wanderers-science-fiction-short-film.html |newspaper= |location=Space.com |access-date=February 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, the Finnish-based [[symphonic metal]] band [[Nightwish]] released the song &quot;Sagan&quot; as a non-album bonus track for their single &quot;[[Élan (song)|Élan]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nightwish.com/en/news?page=2|title=Latest News – Nightwish – The Official Website|work=nightwish.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song, written by the band's songwriter/composer/keyboardist [[Tuomas Holopainen]], is an homage to the life and work of the late Carl Sagan.

In August 2015, it was announced that a biopic of Sagan's life was being planned by [[Warner Bros.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tracking-board.com/tb-exclusive-warner-bros-heads-to-the-cosmos-with-carl-sagan-biopic/ &quot;WARNER BROS.
