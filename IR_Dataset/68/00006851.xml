'''''Coronation Street''''' (often referred to as '''''Corrie''''') is a [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[soap opera]] created by [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]] and shown on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] since 9 December 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jones |first=Judith |title=Coronation Street |url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/coronationst.htm |website=Museum TV |accessdate=29 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504064814/http://www.museum.tv/eotv/coronationst.htm |archivedate=4 May 2016 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme centres on Coronation Street in [[Weatherfield]], a fictional town based on inner-city [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]]. In the show's fictional history, the street was built in 1902 and named in honour of the coronation of King [[Edward VII]].

The series typically airs six times a week: Monday, Wednesday and Friday 7:30–8&amp;nbsp;pm and 8:30–9&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Six&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itv.com/news/2016-06-29/coronation-street-to-air-six-times-a-week-from-next-year/ |title=Coronation Street to air six times a week from next year |date=29 June 2016 |accessdate=11 May 2018 |publisher=ITV News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2017, ten sequential classic episodes of the series dated from 1986 onwards have been broadcast weekly on [[ITV3]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Classic&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/news/a838626/coronation-street-classic-episodes-coming-to-itv3/ |title=Coronation Street Classic episodes are coming to ITV3 Next Month |first=Joe |last=Anderton |date=20 September 2017 |publisher=Hearst Magazines UK |accessdate=21 September 2017 |newspaper=Digital Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme was conceived in 1960 by scriptwriter [[Tony Warren]] at Granada Television in [[Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/sep/17/the-road-to-coronation-street-tv-review |title=TV review: The Road to Coronation Street |newspaper=The Guardian |date=17 September 2010 |accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warren's initial proposal was rejected by the station's founder [[Sidney Bernstein, Baron Bernstein|Sidney Bernstein]], but he was persuaded by producer [[Harry Elton]] to produce the programme for 13 pilot episodes. Within six months of the show's first broadcast, it had become the most-watched programme on British television, and is now a significant part of [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eventmagazine.co.uk/kudos-extends-coronation-street-tour-contract/event-suppliers/article/1318459 &quot;Kudos extends Coronation Street The Tour contract&quot;].

''Coronation Street'' is made by [[ITV Granada]] at [[MediaCityUK]] and shown in all [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] regions, as well as internationally. On 17 September 2010, it became the world's longest-running television soap opera and was listed in ''[[Guinness World Records]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Coronation Street recognised as longest running soap |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/entertainment-arts-11410873/coronation-street-recognised-as-longest-running-soap |agency=BBC |date=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hemley&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Coronation Street breaks two world records |first=Matthew |last=Hemley |work=[[The Stage]] |date=24 September 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2015 |url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2010/coronation-street-breaks-two-world-records/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 September 2015, ''Coronation Street'' was broadcast live to mark [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]]'s sixtieth anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itv.com/news/story/2015-09-23/live-coronation-street-episode-wows-viewers/ |title=Live Coronation Street episode wows viewers |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by the conventions of [[kitchen sink realism]], ''Coronation Street'' is noted for its depiction of a down-to-earth, working-class community, combined with light-hearted humour and strong characters.&lt;ref&gt;Little, Daran (1998). ''The Women of Coronation Street'', Boxtree. {{ISBN|0-7522-2443-3}}, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The show currently averages around six million viewers per episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.barb.co.uk/viewing-data/four-screen-dashboard/|title=Four-screen dashboard|website=[[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show premiered its 10,000th episode on Friday 7 February 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/coronation-street-air-10000th-episode |title=Coronation Street to air 10,000th episode |publisher=ITV Press Centre |date=27 January 2020 |accessdate=31 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===1960s===
The [[Coronation Street: The First Episode|first episode]] was aired on 9 December 1960 at 7&amp;nbsp;pm, and was not initially a critical success; ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' columnist Ken Irwin claimed the series would only last three weeks. Granada Television had commissioned only 13 episodes, and some inside the company doubted the show would last beyond its planned production run.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the criticism, viewers were immediately drawn into the serial, won over by ''Coronation Street''{{'}}s ordinary characters.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The programme also made use of [[Northern England English|Northern English]] language and [[dialect]]; affectionate local terms like &quot;eh, chuck?&quot;, &quot;nowt&quot; ({{IPAc-en|n|aʊ|t}}, from ''nought'', meaning ''nothing''), and &quot;by 'eck!&quot; became widely heard on British television for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeffrey |last=Miller |editor=Graham Nown |title=Street Talk: The Language of Coronation Street |publisher=[[Ward Lock]]|year=1986 |location=London|isbn= 978-0-7063-6514-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ken Barlow (1960) (small).jpg|thumb|left|[[Ken Barlow]] in the first episode of ''Coronation Street'', 1960]]

Early episodes told the story of student [[Ken Barlow]] ([[William Roache]]), who had won a place at university, and thus found his working-class background—as well as his parents, [[Frank Barlow (Coronation Street)|Frank]] (Frank Pemberton) and [[Ida Barlow|Ida]] ([[Noel Dyson]])—something of an embarrassment.&lt;ref&gt;TV Times. (1960) p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The character was one of the few to have experienced life outside of Coronation Street. In some ways this predicts the growth of [[globalisation]], and the decline of similar communities. In an episode from 1961, Barlow declares: &quot;You can't go on just thinking about your own street these days. We're living with people on the other side of the world. There's more to worry about than [[Elsie Tanner]] ([[Pat Phoenix]]) and her boyfriends.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = Granada Television | title =Coronation Street 1961 | medium = Television serial drama  | publisher = Granada | location =Quay Street, Manchester | date =8 November 1961 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roache is the only remaining member of the original cast, which makes him the longest-serving actor in ''Coronation Street'', and in British and global soap history.

At the centre of many early stories, there was [[Ena Sharples]] ([[Violet Carson]]), caretaker of the Glad Tidings Mission Hall, and her friends: timid [[Minnie Caldwell]] ([[Margot Bryant]]), and bespectacled [[Martha Longhurst]] ([[Lynne Carol]]). The trio were likened to the [[Greek chorus]], and the [[Weird Sisters|three witches]] in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'', as they would sit in the [[The snug|snug bar]] of [[Rovers Return Inn|The Rovers Return Inn]], passing judgement over family, neighbours and frequently each other.&lt;ref&gt;Tinker. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Headstrong Ena often clashed with [[Elsie Tanner]] ([[Pat Phoenix]]), whom she believed espoused a dauntlessly loose set of morals. Elsie resented Ena's interference and gossip, which most of the time had little basis in reality.

In April 1961, [[Jed Stone]] ([[Kenneth Cope]]) made his first appearance and returned the following year in 1962. He left in 1963, but returned three years later in 1966. He left again and then returned 42 years later in 2008.

In March 1961, ''Coronation Street'' reached No. 1 in the [[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board|television ratings]] and remained there for the rest of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg10&quot;/&gt; Earlier in 1961, a Television Audience Measurement (TAM) showed that 75% of available viewers (15&amp;nbsp;million) tuned into ''Corrie'', and by 1964 the programme had over 20&amp;nbsp;million regular viewers, with ratings peaking on 2 December 1964, at 21.36&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Little (1995). p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BFI Most Watched 1960s |work=The Museum of Broadcast Communications |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/mostwatched/1960s.html |accessdate=29 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223181243/http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/mostwatched/1960s.html |archivedate=23 February 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Storylines throughout the decade included Elsie's mystery poison-pen letter, the 1962 marriage of Ken and [[Valerie Barlow|Valerie Tatlock]] ([[Anne Reid]]), [[Storylines of Coronation Street#Killing of Martha Longhurst|the death of Martha Longhurst]] in 1964, the birth of the Barlow twins in 1965, Elsie Tanner's wedding to [[Steve Tanner (Coronation Street)|Steve Tanner]] ([[Paul Maxwell (actor)|Paul Maxwell]]) and a train crashing from the viaduct (both in 1967), Steve Tanner's murder in 1968, and a coach crash in 1969.

In spite of rising popularity with viewers, ''Coronation Street'' was criticised by some for its outdated portrayal of the urban working class, and its representation of a community that was a [[nostalgia|nostalgic]] fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert C|last=Allen|title=Soap Opera|work=The Museum of Broadcast Communications|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/soapopera/soapopera.htm|accessdate=7 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050523235035/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/soapopera/soapopera.htm|archivedate=23 May 2005|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the first episode in 1960, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' printed: &quot;The programme is doomed from the outset&amp;nbsp;... For there is little reality in this new serial, which apparently, we have to suffer twice a week.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tinker. pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1967, critics were suggesting that the programme no longer reflected life in 1960s Britain, but reflected how life was in the ''1950s''. Granada hurried to update the programme, with the hope of introducing more issue-driven stories, including [[Lucille Hewitt]] ([[Jennifer Moss (actress)|Jennifer Moss]]) becoming addicted to drugs, [[Jerry Booth (Coronation Street)|Jerry Booth]] ([[Graham Haberfield]]) being in a storyline about homosexuality, [[Emily Nugent]] ([[Eileen Derbyshire]]) having an out-of-wedlock child, and introducing a black family, but all of these ideas were dropped for fear of upsetting viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
The show's [[production team]] was tested when many core cast members left the programme in the early 1970s. When [[Arthur Leslie]] died suddenly in 1970, his character, Rovers' landlord [[Jack Walker (Coronation Street)|Jack Walker]], died with him.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.67.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anne Reid]] quit as Valerie Barlow; her character was killed off in 1971, electrocuting herself with a faulty hairdryer.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg73&quot;/&gt; Ratings reached a low of eight million in February 1973, when [[Pat Phoenix]] quit as [[Elsie Tanner]], [[Violet Carson]] as [[Ena Sharples]] were written out for most of the year due to illness, and [[Doris Speed]] (haughty landlady [[Annie Walker (Coronation Street)|Annie Walker]]) took two months' leave due to bereavement.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg86&quot;&gt;Little. (2000) p.86.&lt;/ref&gt; The audience of ITV's other flagship soap opera ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]'' increased markedly at this time, as its established cast, such as Meg Richardson ([[Noele Gordon]]), grew in popularity.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg86&quot;/&gt; These sudden departures forced the writing team to quickly develop characters who had previously stood in the background. The roles of [[Bet Lynch]] ([[Julie Goodyear]]), [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre Hunt]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]), [[Rita Sullivan|Rita Littlewood]] ([[Barbara Knox]]), [[Mavis Wilton|Mavis Riley]] ([[Thelma Barlow]]) and [[Ivy Tilsley|Ivy Tyldesley]] ([[Lynne Perrie]]) were built up between 1972 and 1973 (with Perrie's character being renamed to the better-known &quot;Tilsley&quot;), and characters such as [[Gail McIntyre|Gail Potter]] ([[Helen Worth]]), [[Blanche Hunt]] ([[Patricia Cutts]]/[[Maggie Jones (actress)|Maggie Jones]]), and [[Vera Duckworth]] ([[Liz Dawn]]) first appearing in 1974. These characters would remain at the centre of the programme for many years.&lt;ref name = &quot;fsobxi&quot;&gt;Little. (2000) p.93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comic storylines had been popular in the series in the 1960s, but had become sparse during the early 1970s. These were re-introduced by new producer [[Bill Podmore]] who joined the series in 1976. He had worked on Granada comedy productions prior to his appointment.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.107.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stan Ogden|Stan]] ([[Bernard Youens]]) and [[Hilda Ogden]] ([[Jean Alexander]]) were often at the centre of overtly funny storylines, with other comic characters including [[Eddie Yeats]] ([[Geoffrey Hughes]]), [[Fred Gee]] ([[Fred Feast]]), and [[Jack Duckworth]] ([[Bill Tarmey]]) all making their first appearances during the decade.

In 1976, Pat Phoenix returned to her role as Elsie Tanner and, after a spate of ill health, Violet Carson returned on a more regular basis as Ena.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) p.131.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Coronation Street's'' stalwart cast slotted back into the programme alongside the newcomers, examining new relationships between characters of different ages and backgrounds: Eddie Yeats became the Ogdens' lodger, Gail Potter and [[Suzie Birchall]] ([[Cheryl Murray]]) moved in with Elsie, [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) arrived in 1976 as the tough factory boss, and Annie Walker reigned at the Rovers with her trio of staff: Bet Lynch, Fred Gee and [[Betty Williams (Coronation Street)|Betty Turpin]] ([[Betty Driver]]).

Storylines throughout the decade included a warehouse fire in 1975, the birth of [[Tracy Barlow|Tracy Langton]] in 1977, the murder of [[Ernest Bishop]] ([[Stephen Hancock]]) in 1978, a lorry crashing into the Rovers Return in 1979, and the marriage of Gail to [[Brian Tilsley]] ([[Christopher Quinten]]) (also in 1979).

For eleven weeks, between August and October 1979, [[industrial action]] forced ''Coronation Street'' and the entire ITV network (apart from the [[Channel Islands]]) off the air. When ITV did return, its first evening schedule included a special &quot;catch-up&quot; edition of ''Coronation Street''. This included storylines which would have taken place during the strike, and they were explained in the form of a narrative chat between Bet Lynch and popular character [[Len Fairclough]] ([[Peter Adamson (actor)|Peter Adamson]]). For several weeks the channel had very few fresh episodes to show, and episodes of the game show ''[[3-2-1]]'' were screened in its place. ''Coronation Street'' returned to ITV screens with a regular scheduled time closer to the end of 1979.

''Coronation Street'' had little competition within its prime time slot, and certain critics suggested that the programme had grown complacent, moving away from socially viable storylines and again presenting a dated view of working class life.&lt;ref&gt;Liddement. (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
Between 1980 and 1989, ''Coronation Street'' underwent some of the biggest changes since its launch. By May 1984, [[William Roache]] ([[Ken Barlow]]) stood as the only original [[cast member]], after the departures of [[Violet Carson]] ([[Ena Sharples]]) in 1980, [[Doris Speed]] ([[Annie Walker (Coronation Street)|Annie Walker]]) in 1983, and both [[Pat Phoenix]] ([[Elsie Tanner]]) and [[Jack Howarth (actor)|Jack Howarth]] ([[Albert Tatlock]]) in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.134. and pp.153–59.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, [[antihero]] [[Len Fairclough]] ([[Peter Adamson (actor)|Peter Adamson]]), one of the show's central male characters since 1961, was killed off, and in 1984, Stan Ogden ([[Bernard Youens]]) died.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) pp.153–59.&lt;/ref&gt; While the press predicted the end of ''Corrie'', [[H. V. Kershaw]] declared that &quot;There are no stars in ''Coronation Street''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tinker. p.62.&lt;/ref&gt; Writers drew on the show's many archetypes, with established characters stepping into the roles left by the original cast.&lt;ref name=&quot;little172&quot;&gt;Little. (1995) p.172.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phyllis Pearce]] ([[Jill Summers]]) was hailed as the new Ena Sharples in 1982, the Duckworths moved into No.9 in 1983 and slipped into the role once held by the Ogdens, while [[Percy Sugden]] ([[Bill Waddington]]) appeared in 1983 and took over the grumpy war veteran role from Albert Tatlock.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) p.162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) p.171.&lt;/ref&gt; The question of who would take over the Rovers Return after Annie Walker's 1983 exit was answered in 1985 when Bet Lynch (who also mirrored the vulnerability and strength of Elsie Tanner) was installed as landlady. In 1983, [[Shirley Armitage]] (Lisa Lewis) became the first major black character in her role as machinist at Baldwin's Casuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;little172&quot;/&gt;

Ken Barlow married [[Deirdre Langton]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]) on 27 July 1981. The episode was watched by over 15&amp;nbsp;million viewers&amp;nbsp;– more ITV viewers than the wedding of [[Prince Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JWu5CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=ken+deirdre+wedding+1981+15+million+viewer+source |work=Google Books |title=Two weddings to Ken |accessdate=14 May 2018|isbn=9781780894898 |last1=Young |first1=Glenda |date=22 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s relationships were cemented between established characters: [[Alf Roberts]] ([[Bryan Mosley]]) married [[Audrey Roberts|Audrey Potter]] ([[Sue Nicholls]]) in 1985; [[Kevin Webster]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]) married [[Sally Webster|Sally Seddon]] ([[Sally Dynevor|Sally Whittaker]]) in 1986;&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) p.174, pp.182–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Bet Lynch married [[Alec Gilroy]] ([[Roy Barraclough]]) in 1987; and 1988 saw the marriages of both Ivy Tilsley and [[Don Brennan (Coronation Street character)|Don Brennan]] ([[Geoffrey Hinsliff]]), and the long-awaited union of Mavis Riley and [[Derek Wilton]] ([[Peter Baldwin (actor)|Peter Baldwin]]), after over a decade of on-off romances and a failed marriage attempt in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) pp.184, 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the arrival of [[Channel 4]], and its edgy new soap opera ''[[Brookside]]'', was one of the biggest changes for ''Coronation Street''. Unlike ''Coronation Street'', which had a very nostalgic view of working-class life, ''Brookside'' brought together working and middle-class families in a more contemporary environment. The dialogue often included expletives and the stories were more hard-hitting, and of the current Zeitgeist. Whereas stories at this time in ''Coronation Street'' were largely about family affairs, ''Brookside'' concentrated on social affairs such as [[industrial action]], unemployment, and the [[black market]]. The BBC also introduced a new prime time soap opera, ''[[EastEnders]]'' in 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg165&quot;&gt;Little. (2000) p.165.&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''Brookside'', ''EastEnders'' had a more gritty premise than ''Coronation Street'', although unlike ''Brookside'' it tended to steer clear of blue language and politicised stories.

While ratings for ''Coronation Street'' remained consistent throughout the decade, ''[[EastEnders]]'' regularly obtained higher viewing figures due to its omnibus episodes shown at weekends.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.170.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Coronation Street'' episode broadcast on 2 January 1985 attracted 21.40 million viewers, making it the most-watched episode in the shows history based on a single showing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/britains-most-watched-tv-show-of-last-80-years-revealed-10639498 |work=Sky News |title=Britain's most watched TV show of last 80 years |accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent episodes would achieve higher figures when the original broadcast and omnibus edition figures were combined. With prime time competition, ''Corrie'' was again seen as being old fashioned, with the introduction of the 'normal' Clayton family in 1985 being a failure with viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg165&quot; /&gt; Between 1988 and 1989, many aspects of the show were modernised by new producer [[David Liddiment]]. A new exterior set had been built in 1982, and in 1989 it was redeveloped to include new houses and shops. Production techniques were also changed with a new studio being built, and the inclusion of more location filming, which had moved the show from being shot on film to [[videotape]] in 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg188&quot;&gt;Little. (2000) p.188.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to new pressures, an introduction of the third weekly episode aired on 20 October 1989, to broadcast each Friday at 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg188&quot;/&gt;

The 1980s featured some of the most prominent storylines in the programme's history, such as Deirdre Barlow's affair with [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) in 1983, the first soap storyline to receive widespread media attention.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) p.165.&lt;/ref&gt; The feud between Ken Barlow and Mike Baldwin would continue for many years, with Mike even marrying Ken's daughter, [[Susan Barlow|Susan]] ([[Wendy Jane Walker]]). In 1986, there was a fire at the Rovers Return. The episode that aired on 25 December 1987, attracted a combined audience (original and omnibus) of 26.65&amp;nbsp;million – a figure helped by the fact that this episode heralded the departure of immensely-popular character [[Hilda Ogden]] ([[Jean Alexander]]). Between 1986 and 1989, the story of [[Rita Sullivan|Rita Fairclough]]'s ([[Barbara Knox]]) [[psychological abuse]] at the hands of [[Alan Bradley (Coronation Street)|Alan Bradley]] ([[Mark Eden]]), and then his subsequent death under the wheels of a [[Blackpool tramway|Blackpool tram]], was played out. This storyline gave the show its highest combined viewing figure in its history with 26.93&amp;nbsp;million for the episode that aired on 15 (and 19) March 1989, where Alan is hiding from the police after trying to kill Rita in the previous episode. This rating is sometimes incorrectly credited to the 8 December 1989 tram death episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nostalgiacentral.com/television/tv-by-decade/tv-shows-1980s/1980s-television-introduction/ |work=Nostalgia Central |title=1980s Television |accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other stories included the birth of [[Nick Tilsley|Nicky Tilsley]] ([[Warren Jackson]]) in 1980, Elsie Tanner's departure and [[Stan Ogden]]'s funeral in 1984, the birth of [[Sarah Platt|Sarah-Louise Tilsley]] (Lynsay King) in 1987, and [[Brian Tilsley]]'s murder in 1989.

New characters were introduced, such as [[Terry Duckworth]] ([[Nigel Pivaro]]), [[Curly Watts]] ([[Kevin Kennedy (actor)|Kevin Kennedy]]), [[Martin Platt]] ([[Sean Wilson (actor)|Sean Wilson]]), [[Reg Holdsworth]] ([[Ken Morley]]), and the McDonald family; one of whom, [[Simon Gregson]], started on the show as [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street character)|Steve McDonald]] a week after his 15th birthday, and has been on the show ever since.

===1990s===
In spite of updated sets and production changes, ''Coronation Street'' still received criticism. In 1992, chairman of the [[Ofcom|Broadcasting Standards Council]], [[Lord Rees-Mogg]], criticised the low representation of [[minority group|ethnic minorities]], and the programme's portrayal of the cosy familiarity of a bygone era. Some newspapers ran headlines such as &quot;''Coronation Street'' shuts out blacks&quot; (''[[The Times]]''), and &quot;'Put colour in t'Street&quot; (''Daily Mirror'').&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) p.217.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patrick Stoddart]] of ''The Times'' wrote: &quot;The millions who watch ''Coronation Street''&amp;nbsp;– and who will continue to do so despite Lord Rees-Mogg&amp;nbsp;– know real life when they see it&amp;nbsp;... in the most confident and accomplished soap opera television has ever seen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.205.&lt;/ref&gt; Black and Asian characters had appeared, but it was not until 1999 that the show featured its first regular non-white family, the Desai family. There was also an Irish Traveller family who made a brief appearance for 4 episodes – spear headed by famous Irish actress Rachael McCrudden who played the part of Josie Joyce and her husband Conor McCrudden ( Jonjo Joyce). They were written off after they went on a rampage of drinking Dutch Gold and were caught by police after holding up the local Des Kelly carpets looking for wet finish Lino.

New characters [[Des Barnes|Des]] ([[Philip Middlemiss]]) and Steph Barnes ([[Amelia Bullmore]]) moved into one of the new houses in 1990, being dubbed by the media as [[Yuppie]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.194.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raquel Watts|Raquel Wolstenhulme]] ([[Sarah Lancashire]]) first appeared in 1991 and went on to become one of the most popular characters. The McDonald family were developed and the fiery relationships between [[Liz McDonald|Liz]] ([[Beverly Callard]]), [[Jim McDonald (Coronation Street)|Jim]] ([[Charles Lawson]]), [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street character)|Steve]] ([[Simon Gregson]]) and [[Andy McDonald (Coronation Street)|Andy]] ([[Nicholas Cochrane]]) interested viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) p.211.&lt;/ref&gt; Other newcomers were [[Maud Grimes]] ([[Elizabeth Bradley]]), [[Roy Cropper]] ([[David Neilson]]), [[Gary Mallett|Gary]] and [[Judy Mallett]] ([[Ian Mercer]] and [[Gaynor Faye]]), as well as [[Fred Elliott]] ([[John Savident]]) and [[Ashley Peacock]] ([[Steven Arnold]]). The amount of [[slapstick]] and physical humour in storylines increased during the 1990s, with comical characters such as [[Reg Holdsworth]] ([[Ken Morley]]) and his water bed.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) p.220.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s storylines included the death of newborn Katie McDonald in 1992, [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]]'s ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) wedding to [[Alma Sedgewick]] ([[Amanda Barrie]]) in 1992, [[Tommy Duckworth]] being sold by his father [[Terry Duckworth|Terry]] ([[Nigel Pivaro]]) in 1993, [[Deirdre Barlow]]'s ([[Anne Kirkbride]]) marriage to Moroccan [[Samir Rachid]] ([[Al Nedjari]]), and the rise of [[Tanya Pooley]] ([[Eva Pope]]) between 1993 and 1994.

In 1995, [[Julie Goodyear]] ([[Bet Lynch]]) left the show. She made brief return appearances in 1999, 2002 and 2003.

In 1997, Brian Park took over as producer, with the idea of promoting young characters as opposed to the older cast. On his first day, he cut the characters of [[Derek Wilton]] ([[Peter Baldwin (actor)|Peter Baldwin]]), [[Don Brennan (Coronation Street Character)|Don Brennan]] ([[Geoffrey Hinsliff]]), [[Percy Sugden]] ([[Bill Waddington]]), [[Bill Webster]] ([[Peter Armitage]]), [[Billy Williams (Coronation Street)|Billy Williams]] ([[Frank Mills (British actor)|Frank Mills]]) and [[Maureen Holdsworth]] ([[Sherrie Hewson]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg235&quot;&gt;Little. (2000) p.235.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thelma Barlow]], who played Derek's wife [[Mavis Wilton|Mavis]], was angered by the firing of her co-star and resigned. The production team lost some of its key writers when Barry Hill, Adele Rose and Julian Roach all resigned as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg235&quot;/&gt;

In line with Park's suggestion, younger characters were introduced: Nick Tilsley was recast, played by [[Adam Rickitt]], [[single parent|single mother]] [[Zoe Tattersall]] ([[Joanne Froggatt]]) first appeared, and the Battersbys moved into No.5. Storylines focussed on tackling 'issues', such as drug dealers, eco-warriors, religious cults, and a transsexual woman.&lt;ref name=&quot;little241&quot;&gt;Little. (2000) p.241.&lt;/ref&gt; Park quit in 1998, after deciding that he had done what he intended to do; he maintained that his biggest achievement was the introduction of [[Hayley Cropper|Hayley Patterson]] ([[Julie Hesmondhalgh]]), the first [[transsexual]] character in a British soap.&lt;ref name=&quot;little241&quot;/&gt;

Some viewers were alienated by the new ''Coronation Street'', and sections of the media voiced their disapproval. Having received criticism of being too out of touch, ''Corrie'' now struggled to emulate the more modern ''Brookside'' and ''EastEnders''. In the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', [[Victor Lewis-Smith]] wrote: &quot;Apparently it doesn't matter that this is a first-class soap opera, superbly scripted and flawlessly performed by a seasoned repertory company.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg235&quot;/&gt;

One of ''Coronation Street'''s best known storylines took place in March/April 1998, with [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre Rachid]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]) being wrongfully imprisoned after a relationship with con-man [[Jon Lindsay (Coronation Street)|Jon Lindsay]] ([[Owen Aaronovitch]]). The episode in which Deirdre was sent to prison had an audience of 19&amp;nbsp;million viewers, and 'Free the Weatherfield One' campaigns sprung up in a media frenzy.&lt;ref name=&quot;little241&quot;/&gt; Then Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] even passed comment on Deirdre's sentencing in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PM supports Weatherfield One|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/71934.stm|date=31 March 1998|accessdate=7 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deirdre was freed after three weeks, with Granada stating that they had always intended for her to be released, in spite of the media interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;little241&quot;/&gt;

On 8 December 2000, the show celebrated its fortieth year by broadcasting a live, hour-long [[Coronation Street: 40th anniversary live episode|episode]]. [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]] appeared as himself in an [[ITV News]] bulletin report.&lt;ref name=&quot;prince&quot;&gt;{{cite news | work=BBC News| title= Prince stars in live soap |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1061585.stm| accessdate=2 September 2006 | date=8 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in the year, 13-year-old [[Sarah-Louise Platt]] ([[Tina O'Brien]]) had become pregnant and given birth to a baby girl, [[Bethany Platt|Bethany]], on 4 June. The episode where [[Gail Platt|Gail]] was told of her daughter's pregnancy was watched by 15&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg256&quot;&gt;Little. (2000) p.256.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2000, Mike Baldwin married Linda Sykes but shortly afterwards, his drunken son Mark confessed he and Linda had been having an affair behind his dad's back. The episode attracted an audience of 16.8&amp;nbsp;million and in the 2000 [[British Soap Awards]] won Best Storyline.

From 1999 to 2001, issue-led storylines were introduced such as [[Toyah Battersby]]'s ([[Georgia Taylor]]) rape, [[Roy Cropper|Roy]] and [[Hayley Cropper]] ([[David Neilson]] and [[Julie Hesmondhalgh]]) abducting their [[foster care|foster child]], Sarah Platt's [[Chat room|Internet chat room]] abduction and [[Alma Baldwin|Alma Halliwell]]'s ([[Amanda Barrie]]) death from [[cervical cancer]].&lt;ref name=CNProd&gt;{{cite web|title=Coronation Street Producer|publisher= Corrie.net |url=http://www.corrie.net/profiles/staff/producers.html|accessdate=27 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such storylines were unpopular with viewers and ratings dropped and in October 2001, Macnaught was abruptly moved to another Granada department and Carolyn Reynolds took over. ''Corrie'' continued to struggle in the ratings, with ''EastEnders'' introducing some of its strongest stories. In 2002, Kieran Roberts was appointed as producer and aimed to re-introduce &quot;gentle storylines and humour&quot;, after deciding that ''the Street'' should not try to compete with other soaps.&lt;ref name=CNProd/&gt; In 2002, [[Gail Platt]] ([[Helen Worth]]) married [[Richard Hillman]] ([[Brian Capron]]), a [[financial adviser|financial advisor]] who would go on to leave [[Duggie Ferguson]] ([[John Bowe (actor)|John Bowe]]) to die; murder both his ex-wife [[Patricia Hillman|Patricia]] ([[Annabelle Apsion]]) and local neighbour [[Maxine Peacock]] ([[Tracy Shaw]]); and attempt to kill both his mother-in-law [[Audrey Roberts]] ([[Sue Nicholls]]) and her longtime friend, [[Emily Bishop]] ([[Eileen Derbyshire]]). After confessing his crimes to Gail in a two-episode handler, Hillman left the street for two weeks before returning with a suicidal impact on himself and his stepfamily; he kidnapped Gail, her children Sarah and [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]), and granddaughter Bethany, before driving them into a canal – though the Platt family survived whilst Richard drowned. The storyline received wide press attention, and viewing figures peaked at 19.4&amp;nbsp;million, with Hillman dubbed a &quot;serial killer&quot; by the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Street drama hits ratings high|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2796201.stm |date=25 February 2003 |accessdate=12 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Todd Grimshaw]] ([[Bruno Langley]]) became ''Corrie's'' first regular homosexual character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Street gay kiss complaints rejected |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3238111.stm|accessdate=12 March 2007 | date=3 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 another gay male character was introduced, [[Sean Tully]] ([[Antony Cotton]]). The character of [[Karen McDonald]] ([[Suranne Jones]]) was developed, with her fiery marriage to Steve and warring with [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]). In 2004, ''Coronation Street'' [[retconned]] the Baldwin family when Mike's nephew [[Danny Baldwin]] ([[Bradley Walsh]]) and his wife [[Frankie Baldwin|Frankie]] ([[Debra Stephenson]]) moved to the area from [[Essex]], with their two sons [[Jamie Baldwin|Jamie]] ([[Rupert Hill]]) and [[Warren Baldwin|Warren]] ([[Danny Young (actor)|Danny Young]]). Until this time, Mike Baldwin had been portrayed as an [[only child]], with his father (also called [[List of Coronation Street characters (1980)#Frankie Baldwin|Frankie]] and portrayed by [[Sam Kydd]]) appearing in the programme between 1980 and 1982 confirming the fact.

In 2007, [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]) murdered Charlie Stubbs and claiming it was self-defence; the audience during this storyline peaked at 13.3&amp;nbsp;million. At the 2007 British Soap Awards, it won Best Storyline, and Ford was voted Best Actress for her portrayal. Other storylines included [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]) becoming a prostitute and the show's first bisexual love triangle (between [[Michelle Connor]] ([[Kym Marsh]]), [[Sonny Dhillon]] ([[Pal Aron]]), and [[Sean Tully]] ([[Antony Cotton]])). The Connor family were central to many storylines during 2007 — the accidental death of a Polish worker at Underworld due to overworking, Michelle's discovery that her brothers [[Paul Connor (Coronation Street)|Paul]] ([[Sean Gallagher (actor)|Sean Gallagher]]) and [[Liam Connor|Liam]] ([[Rob James-Collier]]) were the cause of her husband's death, Paul's use of an escort service, his kidnapping of Leanne and his subsequent death.

In the storyline, [[Nick Tilsley]] and [[Leanne Battersby]]'s bar—The Joinery—exploded during [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]]'s stag party. As a result, the viaduct was destroyed, sending a [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]] tram careering onto the street, destroying [[Weatherfield#D&amp;S Alahan Corner Shop|D&amp;S Alahan's Corner Shop]] and [[Weatherfield#The Kabin|The Kabin]].

Since 1960, ''Coronation Street'' has featured many characters whose popularity with viewers and critics has differed greatly. The original cast was created by Tony Warren, with the characters of [[Ena Sharples]] ([[Violet Carson]]), [[Elsie Tanner]] ([[Pat Phoenix]]) and [[Annie Walker (Coronation Street)|Annie Walker]] ([[Doris Speed]]) as central figures.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; These three women remained with the show for 20 years or more, and became [[archetypes]] of British soap opera, often being emulated by other serials. Ena was the street's busybody, battle-axe and self-proclaimed moral voice.&lt;ref&gt;Tinker. p.38.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsie was the [[Hooker with a heart of gold|tart with a heart]], who was constantly hurt by men in the search for true love.&lt;ref&gt;Tinker. p.57.&lt;/ref&gt; Annie Walker, landlady of the [[Rovers Return Inn]], had [[delusions of grandeur]] and saw herself as better than other residents of ''Coronation Street''.&lt;ref&gt;Tinker. p.40.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Coronation Street'' became known for the portrayal of strong female characters,&lt;ref&gt;Geraghty, Christine. ''Women and Soap Opera'', Polity Press, London, 1991. ({{ISBN|978-0-7456-0568-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; including original cast characters like Ena, Annie and Elsie, and [[Hilda Ogden]] ([[Jean Alexander]]), who first appeared in 1964; who became household names during the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Warren's programme was largely matriarchal, which some commentators put down to the female-dominant environment in which he grew up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Will |last = Hadcroft |title = Daran Little interview |url = http://www.corrie.net/profiles/interviews/little.html |work = Corrie.net |accessdate =22 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the show has a long tradition of psychologically abused husbands, most famously [[Stan Ogden]] ([[Bernard Youens]]) and [[Jack Duckworth]] ([[Bill Tarmey]]), husbands of Hilda and [[Vera Duckworth]] ([[Liz Dawn]]), respectively.

[[Ken Barlow (Coronation Street)|Ken Barlow]] ([[William Roache]]) entered the storyline as a young radical, reflecting the youth of 1960s Britain, where figures like [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]] and the model [[Twiggy]] were to reshape the concept of youthful rebellion. Though the rest of the original Barlow family were killed off before the end of the 1970s, Ken, who for 27 years was the only character from the first episode remaining, has remained the constant link throughout the entire series. In 2011, [[Dennis Tanner]] ([[Philip Lowrie]]), another character from the first episode, returned to ''Coronation Street'' after a 43-year absence. Since 1984, Ken Barlow has been the show's only remaining original character. Emily Bishop ([[Eileen Derbyshire]]) had appeared in the series since late-January 1961, when the show was just weeks old, and was the show's longest-serving female character before she departed on 1 January 2016. Rita Tanner ([[Barbara Knox]]) appeared on the show for one episode in December 1964, before returning as a full-time cast member in January 1972. She is currently the second longest-serving original cast member on the show.

Stan and Hilda Ogden were introduced in 1964, with Hilda becoming one of the most famous British soap opera characters of all time. In a 1982 poll, she was voted fourth-most recognisable woman in Britain, after [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]], [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) p.188.&lt;/ref&gt; Hilda's best-known attributes were her [[pinny]], hair curlers, and the &quot;muriel&quot; in her [[living room]] with three &quot;flying&quot; duck ornaments. Hilda Ogden's departure on Christmas Day 1987, remains the highest-rated episode of ''Coronation Street'' ever, with nearly 27,000,000 viewers. Stan Ogden had been killed off in 1984 following the death of actor [[Bernard Youens]] after a long illness which had restricted his appearances towards the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Dennis |last = Barker |title = Obituary: Leslie Duxbury |url = https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,1635800,00.html |work = The Guardian |date = 7 November 2005 |accessdate =2 September 2006 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bet Lynch]] ([[Julie Goodyear]]) first appeared in 1966, before becoming a regular in 1970, and went on to become one of the most famous ''Corrie'' characters.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.66.&lt;/ref&gt; Bet stood as the central character of the show from 1985 until departing in 1995, often being dubbed as &quot;Queen of the Street&quot; by the media, and indeed herself. The character briefly returned in June 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Queen of the Street The Amazing Life of Julie Goodyear |url = http://www.alkenmrs.com/soapsrus/coronationstreet/csqueenstreet.html|work = Alken M R S |accessdate =9 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Coronation Street'' and its characters often rely heavily on archetypes, with the characterisation of some of its current and recent cast based loosely on past characters. [[Phyllis Pearce]] ([[Jill Summers]]), [[Blanche Hunt]] ([[Maggie Jones (actress)|Maggie Jones]]) and [[Sylvia Goodwin]] ([[Stephanie Cole]]) embodied the role of the acid-tongued busybody originally held by Ena, [[Sally Webster]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]) has grown snobbish, like Annie, and a number of the programme's female characters, such as [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]), mirror the vulnerability of Elsie and Bet. Other recurring archetypes include the war veteran such as [[Albert Tatlock]] ([[Jack Howarth (actor)|Jack Howarth]]), [[Percy Sugden]] ([[Bill Waddington]]) and [[Gary Windass]] ([[Mikey North]]), the bumbling retail manager like [[Leonard Swindley]] ([[Arthur Lowe]]), [[Reg Holdsworth]] ([[Ken Morley]]), [[Norris Cole (Coronation Street)|Norris Cole]] ([[Malcolm Hebden]]), quick-tempered, tough tradesmen like [[Len Fairclough]] ([[Peter Adamson (actor)|Peter Adamson]]), [[Jim McDonald (Coronation Street)|Jim McDonald]] ([[Charles Lawson]]), [[Tommy Harris (Coronation Street)|Tommy Harris]] ([[Thomas Craig (actor)|Thomas Craig]]) and [[Owen Armstrong]] ([[Ian Puleston-Davies]]), and the perennial losers such as Stan and Hilda, Jack and Vera, [[Les Battersby]] ([[Bruce Jones (actor)|Bruce Jones]]), [[Beth Tinker]] ([[Lisa George]]) and [[Kirk Sutherland]] ([[Andrew Whyment]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg7&quot;&gt;Little. (1998) p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Villains are also common character types such as [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]), [[Alan Bradley (Coronation Street)|Alan Bradley]] ([[Mark Eden]]), [[Jenny Bradley]] ([[Sally Ann Matthews]]), [[Rob Donovan]] ([[Marc Baylis]]), [[Frank Foster (Coronation Street)|Frank Foster]] ([[Andrew Lancel]]), [[Tony Gordon]] ([[Gray O'Brien]]), [[Caz Hammond]] ([[Rhea Bailey]]), [[Richard Hillman]] ([[Brian Capron]]), [[Greg Kelly (Coronation Street)|Greg Kelly]] ([[Stephen Billington]]), [[Will Chatterton]] ([[Leon Ockenden]]), [[Nathan Curtis (Coronation Street)|Nathan Curtis]] ([[Christopher Harper (actor)|Christopher Harper]]), [[Callum Logan]] (Sean Ward), [[Karl Munro]] ([[John Michie]]), [[Pat Phelan (Coronation Street)|Pat Phelan]] (Connor McIntyre), [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]), [[Maya Sharma]] ([[Sasha Behar]]), [[Kirsty Soames]] ([[Natalie Gumede]]) and [[John Stape]] ([[Graeme Hawley]]). The show's former archivist and scriptwriter [[Daran Little]] disagreed with the characterisation of the show as a collection of stereotypes. &quot;Rather, remember that Elsie, Ena and others were the first of their kind ever seen on British television. If later characters are stereotypes, it's because they are from the same original mould. It is the hundreds of programmes that have followed which have copied ''Coronation Street''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg7&quot;/&gt;

==Storylines==
{{Main|Storylines of Coronation Street}}
Over the show's history, ''Coronation Street'' has highlighted a wide range of different social issues, including: [[rape]], [[incest]], [[murder]], [[hit-and-run]], [[cancer]], [[adultery]], [[sexual exploitation]], [[child grooming]], [[revenge porn]], [[prostitution]], [[poverty]], [[homelessness]], [[domestic violence]], [[Parental abuse by children|parental abuse]], [[teenage pregnancy]], [[advanced maternal age|late in life pregnancy]], [[surrogacy]], [[abortion]], [[stillbirth]], [[premature birth]], [[miscarriage]], [[adoption]], [[foster care|fostering]], [[male rape]], [[alcoholism]], [[drug addiction]], [[psychotic episode]]s, [[Problem gambling|gambling addiction]], [[terminal illness]], [[euthanasia]], [[suicide]], [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[postpartum depression]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], [[homosexuality]], [[homosexuality and Islam|homosexuality in Islam]], [[child sexual abuse]], being [[transgender]], [[HIV]], [[deafness]], [[epilepsy]], [[osteoporosis]], [[childhood cancer]], [[Ehlers–Danlos syndrome]], [[brain aneurysm]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[organ transplant]], [[sepsis]], [[amputation]], [[myotonic dystrophy]], [[identity theft]], [[compulsive hoarding]], [[drink driving]], [[coercive control]] and [[skin whitening]].

==Production==
===Broadcast format===
Between 9 December 1960 and 3 March 1961, ''Coronation Street'' was broadcast twice weekly, on Wednesday and Friday.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg10&quot;/&gt; During this period, the Friday episode was broadcast live, with the Wednesday episode being pre-recorded 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later.&lt;ref name = &quot;xvvlbv&quot;&gt;Kershaw. p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; When the programme went fully networked on 6 March 1961, broadcast days changed to Monday and Wednesday.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg10&quot;&gt;Little. (2000) p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; The last regular episode to be shown live was broadcast on 3 February 1961.

The series was transmitted in black and white for the majority of the 1960s. Preparations were made to film episode 923, to be transmitted Wednesday 29 October 1969, in colour. This instalment featured the street's residents on a coach trip to the Lake District. In the end, suitable colour film stock for the cameras could not be found and the footage was shot in black and white. The following episode, transmitted Monday 3 November, was videotaped in colour but featured black and white film inserts and title sequence. Like [[BBC1]], the ITV network was officially broadcast in black and white at this point (though programmes were actually broadcast in colour as early as July that year for colour transmission testing and adjustment) so the episode was seen by most in black and white.

The ITV network, like [[BBC1]], began full colour transmissions on 15 November 1969. Daran Little, for many years the official programme archivist, claims that the first episode to be transmitted in colour was episode 930 shown on 24 November 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.58.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1970 a technicians' dispute turned into a [[work-to-rule]] when sound staff were denied a pay rise given to camera staff the year before for working with colour recording equipment. The terms of the work-to-rule were that staff refused to work with the new equipment (though the old black and white equipment had been disposed of by then) and therefore programmes were recorded and transmitted in black and white, including ''Coronation Street''&lt;ref&gt;Richard Marson. &quot;Inside Updown&amp;nbsp;– the story of &quot;Upstairs Downstairs&quot;. Kaleidoscope publishing 2001. p.50.&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute was resolved in early 1971 and the last black and white episode was broadcast on 8 February 1971.

Episode 5191, originally broadcast on 7 January 2002, was the first to be broadcast in [[16:9]] widescreen format. ''Coronation Street'' was the last UK-wide soap to make the switch to 16:9 (''[[Take the High Road]]'' remained in [[4:3]] until it finished in 2003).

From 22 March 2010, ''Coronation Street'' was produced in 1080/50i for transmission on HDTV platforms on [[ITV HD]]. The first transmission in this format was episode 7351 on 31 May 2010 with a new set of titles and re-recorded theme tune. On 26 May 2010 ITV previewed the new HD titles on the ''Coronation Street'' website. Due to copyright reasons only viewers residing in the UK could see them on the ITV site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/s3/coronation-street/news/a219473/coronation-street-to-join-itv1-hd.html |title='Coronation Street' to join ITV1 HD |website=Digital Spy |date=12 May 2010|accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production staff===
''Coronation Street's'' creator, [[Tony Warren]], wrote the first 13 episodes of the programme in 1960, and continued to write for the programme intermittently until 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;top10writers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Coronation Street's top ten writers|work=Corrie.net|url=http://www.corrie.net/profiles/staff/writers.html|accessdate=31 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had retained links with ''Coronation Street'' up to his death in 2016, often advising on storylines.

[[H. V. Kershaw|Harry Kershaw]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H V Kershaw|work=IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0449958/|accessdate=31 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the script editor for ''Coronation Street'' when the programme began in 1960, working alongside Tony Warren. Kershaw was also a script writer for the programme and the show's producer between 1962 and 1971. He remains the only person, along with John Finch, to have held the three posts of script editor, writer and producer. Kershaw continued to write for the programme until his retirement in January 1988.

[[Adele Rose]] was the longest-serving ''Coronation Street'' writer, completing 455 scripts between 1961 and 1998. She also created ''[[Byker Grove]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adele Rose|work=IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0741220/|accessdate=31 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Podmore]] was the show's longest serving producer. By the time he stepped down in 1988 he had completed 13 years at the production helm. Nicknamed the &quot;godfather&quot; by the tabloid press,&lt;ref&gt;Podmore, p.33.&lt;/ref&gt; he was renowned for his tough, uncompromising style and was feared by both crew and cast alike. He is probably most famous for sacking [[Peter Adamson (actor)|Peter Adamson]], the show's Len Fairclough, in 1983.

Iain Macleod is the current series producer.

[[Michael Apted]], best known for the ''[[Up Series|Up!]]'' series of documentaries was a director on the programme in the early 1960s. This period of his career marked the first of his many collaborations with writer [[Jack Rosenthal]]. Rosenthal, noted for such television plays as ''[[Bar Mitzvah Boy]]'', began his career on the show, writing over 150 episodes between 1961 and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Rosenthal|work=IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0742768/#writer1960|accessdate=31 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Abbott]] was a story editor on the programme in the 1980s and began writing episodes in 1989, but left in 1993 to produce ''[[Cracker (UK TV series)|Cracker]]'', for which he later wrote, before creating his own dramas such as ''[[Touching Evil]]'' and ''[[Shameless (UK TV series)|Shameless]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Abbott|work=IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0008036/|accessdate=31 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russell T Davies]] was briefly a storyliner on the programme in the mid-1990s,&lt;ref name=RTDIMDb&gt;{{cite web|title=Russell T Davies|work=IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0203961/|accessdate=31 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; also writing the script for the [[direct-to-video]] special &quot;[[Coronation Street: Viva Las Vegas!|Viva Las Vegas!]]&quot;&lt;ref name=RTDIMDb/&gt; He, too, has become a noted writer of his own high-profile television drama programmes, including ''[[Queer as Folk (UK)|Queer as Folk]]'' and the 2005 revival of ''[[Doctor Who]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The Gallifrey Archives |title=Russell T Davies |url=http://www.gallifrey.org.uk/russelltdavies.html |accessdate=2 June 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824072836/http://www.gallifrey.org.uk/russelltdavies.html |archivedate=24 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jimmy McGovern]] also wrote some episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Jones, Judith | work=The Museum of Broadcast Communications | title= Coronation street |url= http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/C/htmlC/coronationst/coronationst.htm| accessdate=2 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theme music===
The show's [[theme music]], a [[cornet]] piece, accompanied by a [[Brass band (British style)|brass band]] plus clarinet and double bass, reminiscent of northern band music, was written by [[Eric Spear]].&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, p.25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity of the trumpeter was not public knowledge until 1994, when jazz musician and journalist Ron Simmonds revealed that it was the Surrey musician Ronnie Hunt. He added, &quot;an attempt was made in later years to re-record that solo, using Stan Roderick, but it sounded too good, and they reverted to the old one.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ron Simmonds, [http://www.jazzprofessional.com/interviews/Stan%20Roderick_3.htm &quot;Stan Roderick&amp;nbsp;– A tribute&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205194520/http://www.jazzprofessional.com/interviews/Stan%20Roderick_3.htm |date=5 December 2008 }}, ''Jazz Professional'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'' published a contradictory story that a young musician from Wilmslow called David Browning played the trumpet on both the original recording of the theme in 1960 and a re-recording in 1964, for a one-off payment of £36.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/127724_just_36_notes_for_corrie_trumpet.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130421032236/http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/127724_just_36_notes_for_corrie_trumpet.html |url-status=dead |archivedate=21 April 2013 |title=Just 36 notes for Corrie trumpet |work=Manchester Evening News |date=19 August 2004 |last=Palmer |first=Carl |publisher=M.E.N.

Media }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, the ''[[Mail on Sunday]]'' resolved the matter. Browning conceded that Hunt recorded the original in 1960, but believed that his own re-recording in 1964&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_8003/is_2009_June_14/ai_n38233383/?tag=rel.res2 Corrie tune row as musicians blow own trumpets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903215211/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_8003/is_2009_June_14/ai_n38233383/?tag=rel.res2 |date=3 September 2015 }}, ''Mail on Sunday'', 14 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; or 1972 had been used since that date. [[ITV plc|ITV]] then confirmed to the ''Mail'' that a second version had been recorded in the 1970s, but was only used for a very short while before reverting to Hunt's 1960 recording. In the 1980s the same version was converted to stereo.&lt;ref name=&quot;MOS-2010-06-21&quot;&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/mail-on-sunday-london-england-the/mi_8003/is_2009_June_21/brass-warfare-coronation-street-rival/ai_n38243210/ Brass warfare on Coronation Street as rival trumpeters say: I played that solo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903215211/http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/mail-on-sunday-london-england-the/mi_8003/is_2009_June_21/brass-warfare-coronation-street-rival/ai_n38243210/ |date=3 September 2015 }}, ''Mail on Sunday'', 21 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronnie Hunt said he was paid £6, and found the experience frustrating as Eric Spear insisted on many takes before obtaining the sound that he wanted. After taking a break in a local pub, Hunt achieved the desired mournful sound by playing very close to the microphone.&lt;ref name=&quot;MOS-2010-06-21&quot;/&gt;

A new, completely re-recorded version of the theme tune replaced the original when the series started broadcasting in HD on 31 May 2010. It accompanied a new montage-style credits sequence featuring images of Manchester and Weatherfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/soaps/coronationstreet/news/newopeningtitles/ |title=New Opening Titles |work=Coronation Street&amp;nbsp;– ITV Soaps |publisher=ITV.com |accessdate=7 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603192821/http://www.itv.com/soaps/coronationstreet/news/newopeningtitles/ |archivedate=3 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reggae version of the theme tune was recorded by The I-Royals and released by Media Marvels and [[Warner Music Group|WEA]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/I-Royals-Coronation-Street/release/2929583|title=The I-Royals – Coronation St.|website=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 March 2017, it was revealed on the YouTube channel of Corrie that some of the soap's cast would sing a specially-written lyric, of which will be added to the new theme song that will be played, as of the first episode of the evening of Monday, 3 April 2017, but it turned out to be an April Fools joke.

===Viewing figures===
Episodes in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, regularly attracted figures of between 18 and 21&amp;nbsp;million viewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=29 November 1970|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=36U_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZlYMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7272,4995717&amp;dq=coronation-street&amp;hl=en|title=British Television Bares It All|work= [[The Robesonian]]|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=7 December 1980|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PNE8AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LS4MAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=coronation%20street%20ratings&amp;pg=6856%2C1692656|title=Soap Opera Becomes Institution in Great Britain|work= [[Oxnard Press-Courier]]|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=8 January 1988|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UzpAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UlkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=coronation%20street%20ratings&amp;pg=3387%2C924360|title=Both sides claim victory in festive TV ratings war|work= [[The Glasgow Herald]]|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the 1990s and early 2000s, 14 to 16&amp;nbsp;million per episode would be typical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=18 October 2000|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/success-of-bbc-news-at-ten-is-bad-news-for-itv-634832.html|title=Success of BBC news at ten is bad news for ITV |work= The Independent|accessdate=16 November 2011|last1=Moyes|first1=Jojo|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=2 January 1999|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/writer-ridicules-soap-actors-1044488.html?CMP=ILC-refresh|title=Writer ridicules soap actors|work= [[The Independent]]|accessdate=16 November 2011|location=London|first=David|last=Lister}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most terrestrial television in the UK, a decline in viewership has taken place and the show posts an average audience of just under 9&amp;nbsp;million per episode {{as of|2013|lc=y}}, remaining one of the highest rated programmes in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=20 January 1999|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a143506/32m-see-blumenthal-take-on-little-chef.html|title=3.2m see Blumenthal take on 'Little Chef'|work= [[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=10 December 2010|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/10/ratings-coronation-street-live|title=Coronation Street live show draws show's biggest audience for seven years|work= guardian.co.uk|accessdate=16 November 2011|last=Plunkett|first=John|location=London|publisher=Guardian News and Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since ''[[EastEnders]]'' began airing in 1985 on the [[BBC]], the two programmes have constantly battled it out for first place in the ratings.

''Coronation Street'' rates as one of the most watched programmes on UK television for every day it is aired. The episode that aired on 2 January 1985, where [[Bet Lynch]] ([[Julie Goodyear]]) finds out she has got the job as manager of the Rovers Return, is the highest-rated single episode in the show's history, attracting 21.40 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/britains=most=watched-tv-show-of-last-80-years-revealed-10639498 |work=Sky New |title=Britain's most watched TV show of last 80 years revealed |accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 25 December 1987 episode, where [[Hilda Ogden]] ([[Jean Alexander]]) leaves the street to start a new life as a housekeeper for long-term employer Dr Lowther, attracted a combined audience of 26.65 million for its original airing and omnibus repeat on 27 December 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/resources/tv-facts/tv-since-1981//1987/top10/ |work=BARB |title=Top 10 programmes 1987 |accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the second-highest combined rating in the show's history.

[[File:Coronation Street set October 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Shot of the former ''Coronation Street'' exterior set at Granada Studios. The set is close to [[Manchester city centre]], hence the high rise buildings, which are not part of the programme.]]
The regular exterior buildings shown in ''Coronation Street'' include a row of terrace houses, several townhouses, and communal areas including a newsagents (''The Kabin''), a café (''Roy's Rolls''), a general grocery shop (''D&amp;S Alahan's''), a factory (''Underworld'') and ''Rovers Return Inn'' [[public house]]. The Rovers Return Inn is the main meeting place for the show's characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg73&quot;&gt;Little. (2000) p.73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1960 and 1968, street scenes were filmed before a set constructed in a studio, with the house fronts reduced in scale to 3/4 and constructed from wood.&lt;ref name=&quot;tinkerpg95&quot;&gt;Tinker. p.95.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 Granada built an outside set not all that different from the interior version previously used, with the wooden façades from the studio simply being erected on the new site.&lt;ref name=&quot;tinkerpg95&quot;/&gt; These were replaced with brick façades, and back yards were added in the 1970s.

In 1982, a permanent full-street set was built in the Granada [[backlot]], an area between Quay Street and Liverpool Road in Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=53.477749,-2.255217&amp;spn=0.00068,0.001808&amp;t=k&amp;z=19 |title=Google Maps |publisher=Google Maps|accessdate=20 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The set was constructed from reclaimed [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] brick.&lt;ref name=&quot;tinkerpg95&quot;/&gt; The set was updated in 1989 with the construction of a new factory, two shop units and three modern town houses on the south side of the street.&lt;ref name = &quot;vuqqwe&quot;&gt;Little.

Between 1989 and 1999, the [[Granada Studios Tour]] allowed members of the public to visit the set. The exterior set was extended and updated in 1999. This update added to the [[Rosamund Street]] and Victoria Street façades, and added a viaduct on Rosamund Street. Most interior scenes are shot in the adjoining purpose-built studio.&lt;ref name = &quot;vuqqwe&quot;/&gt;

In 2008, ''Victoria Court'', an apartment building full of luxury flats, was started on Victoria Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/Soaps/coronationstreet/galleries/Picturespecials/NewCorrieflats/default.html |title=Coronation Street |publisher=ITV.com |date=16 September 2009 |accessdate=20 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227115448/http://www.itv.com/Soaps/coronationstreet/galleries/Picturespecials/NewCorrieflats/default.html |archivedate=27 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, production moved to a new site at Trafford Wharf, a former dock area about two miles to the east, part of the [[MediaCityUK]] complex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/coronation-street-move-weatherfield-street-6356375 &quot;Revealed: Coronation Street set at its new MediaCityUK home&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314235021/http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/coronation-street-move-weatherfield-street-6356375 |date=14 March 2014 }}, ''Manchester Evening News'', 29 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Trafford Wharf backlot is built upon a former truck stop site next to the [[Imperial War Museum North]]. It took two years from start to finish to recreate the iconic Street. The houses were built to almost full scale after previously being three-quarter size.

On 5 April 2014, the staff began to allow booked public visits to the old Quay Street set. An advert, with a voiceover from [[Victoria Wood]], appeared on TV to advertise the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/coronationstreet|title=Ticketmaster.co.uk&amp;nbsp;– Coronation St. The Tour.

On 12 March 2018, the extension of the '' Victoria Street'' set was officially unveiled. The new set features a garden, featuring a memorial bench paying tribute to the 22 victims of the [[Manchester Arena bombing]], including ''Coronation Street'' super fan Martyn Hett. The precinct includes a [[Greater Manchester Police]] station called ''Weatherfield Police station''. As part of a [[product placement]] deal between three companies and [[ITV Studios]], new additions include a [[Tram|Tram stop station]] which is named ''Weatherfield North'' with ''[[Transport for Greater Manchester]]'' ''[[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]]''  branding, and shop front facades of [[Costa Coffee]] and the Weatherfield branded [[Co-op Food|Co-op]] Food store interior scenes have been screened and exterior scenes at the new set first aired on 20 April 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;shops&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-43376925 |title=Coronation Street unveils new on-set memorial to Manchester Arena victims |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=12 March 2018 |accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast==
===United Kingdom===
For 60 years, ''Coronation Street'' has remained at the centre of ITV's prime time schedule. The programme is shown in the UK in six episodes, over three evenings a week on ITV. From Friday 9 December 1960 until Friday 3 March 1961, the programme was shown in two episodes broadcast Wednesday and Friday at 7&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg10&quot;/&gt; Schedules were changed and from Monday 6 March 1961 until Wednesday 11 October 1989, the programme was shown in two episodes broadcast Monday and Wednesday at 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg10&quot;/&gt; The third weekly episode was introduced on Friday 20 October 1989, broadcast at 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg188&quot; /&gt; From 1996, an extra episode was broadcast at 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm on Sunday nights. Aside from Granada, the programme originally appeared on the following stations of the ITV network: [[Anglia Television]], [[Associated-Rediffusion]], [[Television Wales and the West]], [[Scottish Television]], [[Southern Television]] and [[Ulster Television]]. From episode 14 on Wednesday 25 January 1961, [[Tyne Tees Television]] broadcast the programme. That left [[Associated Television|ATV]] in the Midlands as the only ITV station not carrying the show. When they decided to broadcast the programme, national transmission was changed from Wednesday and Friday at 7&amp;nbsp;pm to Monday and Wednesday at 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm and the programme became fully networked under this new arrangement from episode 25 on Monday 6 March 1961.

As the ITV network grew over the next few years, the programme was transmitted by these new stations on these dates onward: [[Westward Television]] from episode 40 on 1 May 1961, [[Border Television]] from episode 76 on 4 September 1961, [[Grampian Television]] from episode 84 on 2 October 1961, [[Channel Television]] from episode 180 on 3 September 1962 and [[Teledu Cymru]] (north and west Wales) from episode 184 on 17 September 1962. At this point, the ITV network became complete and the programme was broadcast almost continuously across the country at 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm on Monday and Wednesday for the next twenty-seven years.

From episode 2981 on Friday 20 October 1989 at 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm, a third weekly episode was introduced and this increased to four episodes a week from episode 4096 on Sunday 24 November 1996, again at 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.229.&lt;/ref&gt; The second Monday episode was introduced in 2002 and was broadcast at 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm to usher in the return of [[Bet Lynch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris |last=Diamond |title=Coronation Street Review |url=http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/reviews/2002/coronationstreet.htm |work=Off The Telly |date=10 June 2002 |accessdate=9 March 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014022108/http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/reviews/2002/coronationstreet.htm |archivedate=14 October 2006 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Monday 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm episode was used intermittently during the popular Richard Hillman story line but has become fully scheduled since episode 5568 on Monday 25 August 2003. Additional episodes have been broadcast during the weekly schedule of ITV at certain times, notably in 2004 when, between 22 and 26 November, eight episodes were shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |first= Neil| last= Wilkes |title= Corrie to be aired eight times in one week|url = http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a16769/corrie-to-air-eight-times-in-one-week.html |work= Digital Spy|date= 5 November 2004 |accessdate =9 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Older episodes had been broadcast by satellite and cable channel [[Granada Plus]] from launch in 1996. The first episodes shown were from episode 1588 (originally transmitted on Monday 5 April 1976) onwards. Originally listed and promoted as ''Classic Coronation Street'', the &quot;classic&quot; was dropped in early 2002, at which stage the episodes were from late 1989. By the time of the channel's closure in 2004, the repeats had reached February 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ITV3 secures Sky viewers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/nov/01/television.bskyb|last=Deans|first=Jason||work=[[The Guardian]]|date=1 November 2004|accessdate=20 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this, &quot;specials&quot; were broadcast on Saturday afternoons in the early years of the channel with several episodes based on a particular theme or character(s) were shown. The latest episode shown in these specials was from 1991. In addition, on 27 and 28 December 2003, several Christmas Day editions of the show were broadcast.

From 23 July 2009 ''Coronation Street'' started to be broadcast in five instalments a week, at 7:30&amp;nbsp; and 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm on Mondays and Fridays, and at 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm on Thursdays. The Thursday episode replaced the former Wednesday show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jul/08/coronation-street-move-wednesdays|title=Coronation Street to move from Wednesdays&amp;nbsp;– after nearly 50 years|accessdate=8 July 2009 | work=guardian.co.uk | first=Leigh | last=Holmwood | date=8 July 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasional late night episodes of ''Coronation Street'' begin at 10&amp;nbsp;pm, due to the [[watershed (television)|watershed]]. Repeat episodes, [[omnibus (broadcast)|omnibus]] broadcasts and specials have been shown on ITV and [[ITV2]]. In January 2008 the omnibus returned to the main ITV channel where it was aired on Saturday mornings/afternoons depending on the schedule and times. In May 2008 it moved to Sunday mornings until August 2008 when it returned to Saturdays. In January 2009 it moved back to Sunday mornings usually broadcasting at around 9.25am until December 2010. In January 2011 the omnibus moved to Saturday mornings on ITV at 9.25am. During the Rugby World Cup, which took place in New Zealand, matches had to be broadcast on a Saturday morning, so the omnibus moved to Saturday lunchtimes/afternoons during September and October 2011. However, as of 22 October 2011 the omnibus moved back to Saturday mornings at 9.25am on ITV. From January 2012 the omnibus was no longer broadcast on ITV after four years, it stayed on ITV2 for eight years. From January 2020, the omnibus moved to ITV3. 

On 30 June 2011 it was confirmed that ''Coronation Street'' would return to its traditional 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm timeslot on a Wednesday evening in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a327711/coronation-street-moves-back-to-wednesday-nights.html |title='Coronation Street' moves back to Wednesday nights&amp;nbsp;– Coronation Street News&amp;nbsp;– Soaps |website=Digital Spy |date=30 June 2011 |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sixth weekly episode aired on Wednesdays at 8:30pm from 20 September 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;Six&quot;/&gt; ITV also confirmed on this date that [[ITV3]] would air afternoon timeslot sequential reruns of ''Classic Coronation Street''. Two classic episodes were retransmitted between Mondays to Fridays at 2:40&amp;nbsp;pm until 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm from 2 October 2017. The first episodes shown were from episode 2587 (originally transmitted on Wednesday 15 January 1986) onwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Classic&quot;/&gt;

===International===
''Coronation Street'' is shown in various countries worldwide. [[YouTube]] has the first episode and many others available as reruns.

The programme was first aired in Australia in 1963 on [[TCN]]-9 Sydney, [[GTV (Australia)|GTV]]-9 Melbourne and [[NWS (TV station)|NWS]]-9 Adelaide, and by 1966 ''Coronation Street'' was more popular in Australia than in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) p.67.&lt;/ref&gt; The show eventually left free-to-air television in Australia in the 1970s. It briefly returned to the Nine Network in a daytime slot during 1994–1995. In 2005 [[STW]]-9 Perth began to show episodes before the 6&amp;nbsp;pm news to improve the lead in to Nine News Perth, but this did not work and the show was cancelled a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaspy.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=3618&amp;st=75&amp;s=3d781df6ed1846c4dfd8bc83f262d6da |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120904060644/http://www.mediaspy.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=3618&amp;st=75&amp;s=3d781df6ed1846c4dfd8bc83f262d6da |url-status=dead |archivedate=4 September 2012 |title=City by City Programming Differences&amp;nbsp;– Forums&amp;nbsp;– Page 4 |publisher=Media Spy |accessdate=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 Pay-TV began and [[Arena (television network)|Arena]] began screening the series in one-hour instalments on Saturdays and Sundays at 6:30&amp;nbsp;pm EST.

''Coronation Street'' is shown Mon-Thu at 7:20&amp;nbsp;pm EST &amp; a double episode on Fridays. Episodes on UKTV are 1 week behind UK broadcast.

In Canada, ''Coronation Street'' is broadcast on [[CBC Television]]. Until 2011, episodes were shown in Canada approximately 10 months after they aired in Britain; however, beginning in the fall of 2011, the CBC began showing two episodes every weekday, in order to catch up with the ITV showings, at 6:30&amp;nbsp;pm and 7&amp;nbsp;pm local time Monday-Friday, with an [[omnibus (broadcast)|omnibus]] on Sundays at 7.30am. By May 2014, the CBC was only two weeks behind Britain, so the show was reduced to a single showing weeknights at 6:30&amp;nbsp;pm local time. The show debuted on Toronto's [[CBLT-DT|CBLT]] in July 1966.&lt;ref name=Walrus&gt;{{cite journal|last=Groen |first=Danielle |title=walrusmagazine.com/articles/2011.01-television-craving-corrie/1/ |journal=[[The Walrus]] |date=January 2011 |url=http://walrusmagazine.com/articles/2011.01-television-craving-corrie/1/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130205204358/http://walrusmagazine.com/articles/2011.01-television-craving-corrie/1/ |url-status=dead |archivedate=5 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 edition of the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' recognises the 1,144 episodes sold to the now-defunct CBC-owned [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan]], TV station [[CBKST]] by Granada TV on 31 May 1971 to be the largest number of TV shows ever purchased in one transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec00guin_1/page/160 160]|publisher=Guinness|year=2001|isbn=0-85112-124-1|url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec00guin_1/page/160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show traditionally aired on weekday afternoons in Canada, with a Sunday morning omnibus.

If it didn't come back, something would happen on [[Parliament Hill]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therecord.com/whatson/artsentertainment/article/715097--cbc-to-jettison-wheel-of-fortune-jeopardy|title=Your online newspaper for Kitchener, Waterloo, Cambridge and area|publisher=|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kirstine Stewart]], the head of the CBC's English-language division, once remarked: &quot;Coronation Street fans are the most loyal, except maybe for [[curling]] viewers, of all CBC viewers.&quot;&lt;ref name=Walrus/&gt; In late September 2014, CBC aired extra episodes to become only one week behind the UK in airing of new episodes.

In the Republic of Ireland, ''Coronation Street'' aired on [[Virgin Media Three]] (formerly named [[Be3]]) for same night repeats and currently airs the Sunday omnibus from 1pm. The shows same night repeats currently air for an hour from 10:30pm on Virgin Media Two(formerly named 3e), on Monday’s,Wednesday’s and Friday’s. The show was first aired in 1978, beginning with episodes from 1976. Ireland eventually caught up with the current UK episodes in 1983. Until 1992 it was broadcast on [[RTÉ2]] and from 1992 to 2001 it was broadcast on [[RTÉ One]]. In 2001 Granada TV bought 45 percent of TV3, which resulted in TV3 broadcasting series from 2001 to 2014. In 2006, ITV sold its share of the channel but TV3. TV3 continued to buy the soap until the end of 2014 when it moved to [[UTV Ireland]]. Coronation Street has broadcast on each of the main Irish networks, except for the [[Irish language]] network [[TG4]]. From December 2016, ''Coronation Street'' returned to TV3 (now Virgin Media One). The show is consistently the channels most viewed programme every week.

In South Africa, ''Coronation Street'' episodes are broadcast three days after the UK air date on ITV Choice.

In New Zealand, ''Coronation Street'' has been shown locally since 1964, first on [[NZBC]] television until 1975,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/cheers-to-50-years/1970s-tv-trivia-3484296|title=1970s: TV Trivia|work=TVNZ Ondemand|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then on [[TV One (New Zealand)|TV One]], which broadcasts it in a 4-episode/2-hour block on Fridays from 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm. Since September 2014, TV One has added a 2-episode/1-hour block on Saturday from 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm. Because TV One has never upgraded to showing the equivalent of five or six episodes per week, New Zealand continues to fall further and further behind with episodes, and is 23 months behind Britain (as of 28 March 2014). During the weekday nights of the week ending 11 April 2014 and previous weeks, Coronation Street was the least watched programme on TV One in the 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm slot by a considerable margin in comparison to other weeknights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.throng.co.nz/2014/04/tv-ratings-11-april-2014/ |title=Throng TV Ratings |date=12 April 2014 |accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The serial aired on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm until October 2011, when the show moved to a 5:30&amp;nbsp;pm half-hour slot every weekday.

Granada launched one spin-off in 1965, ''[[Pardon the Expression]]'', following the story of clothing store manager Leonard Swindley ([[Arthur Lowe]]) after he left Weatherfield.

From 1985 to 1988 Granada TV produced a sitcom called ''[[The Brothers McGregor]]'' featuring a pair of half-brothers (one black, one white) who had appeared in a single episode of ''Coronation Street'' as old friends of Eddie Yeats and guests at his wedding. The original actors were unavailable so the characters were recast with [[Paul Barber (actor)|Paul Barber]] and [[Philip Whitchurch]]. The show ran for 26 episodes over four series.

In 1985, a sister series, ''[[Albion Market]]'' was launched. It ran for one year, with 100 episodes produced.

''Coronation Street'' and rival soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'' had a crossover for ''[[Children in Need 2010|Children in Need]]'' in November 2010 called &quot;[[East Street (Children in Need)|East Street]]&quot;. ''EastEnders'' stars that visited Weatherfield include [[Laurie Brett]] as [[Jane Beale]], [[Charlie G. Hawkins]] as [[Darren Miller]], [[Kylie Babbington]] as [[Jodie Gold]], [[Nina Wadia]] as [[Zainab Masood]] and [[John Partridge (performer)|John Partridge]] as [[Christian Clarke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11773594|title=Coronation Street and EastEnders to merge for charity|date=17 November 2010|work=BBC News |accessdate=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 December 2012, ''Coronation Street'' produced a [[Text Santa]] special entitled ''A Christmas Corrie'' which featured [[Norris Cole (Coronation Street)|Norris Cole]] in the style of Scrooge, being visited by the ghosts of dead characters. The ghosts were [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]], [[Maxine Peacock]], [[Derek Wilton]] and [[Vera Duckworth]]. Other special guests include [[Torvill and Dean]], [[Lorraine Kelly]] and [[Sheila Reid]]. The episode concluded with Norris learning the error of his ways and dancing on the cobbles. The original plan for this feature was to have included [[Jack Duckworth]], along with Vera, but actor [[Bill Tarmey]] died before filming commenced. In the end a recording of his voice was played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corrie faves to return|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/corrie-faves-jack-duckworth-and-vera-1403343|publisher=The Mirror|date=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Documentaries====
''Coronation Street: Family Album'' was several documentaries about various families living on the street.

&quot;Farewell&amp;nbsp;...&quot; was several documentaries featuring the best moments of a single character who had recently left the series—most notably, Farewell Blanche (Hunt), Farewell Jack (Duckworth), Farewell Mike (Baldwin), Farewell Vera (Duckworth), Farewell Janice (Battersby), Farewell Liz (McDonald), Farewell Becky (McDonald), and Farewell Tina (McIntyre).  Most of these were broadcast on the same day as the character's final scenes in the series.

''Stars on the Street'' was aired around Christmas 2009. It featured actors from the soap talking about the famous guest stars who had appeared in the series including people who were in it before they were famous.

In December 2010, ITV made a few special programmes to mark the 50th anniversary. ''Coronation Street Uncovered: Live'', hosted by [[Stephen Mulhern]] was shown after the episode with the tram crash was aired on ITV 2. On 7 and 9 December a countdown on the greatest Corrie moments, ''Coronation Street: 50 Years, 50 Moments'', the viewers voted &quot;The Barlows at Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; as the greatest moment. On 10 December [[Paul O'Grady]] hosted a quiz show, ''Coronation Street: The Big 50'' with three teams from the soap and a celebrity team answering questions about Coronation Street and other soaps. Also, ''[[Come Dine with Me]]'' and ''[[Celebrity Juice]]'' aired Coronation Street specials in the anniversary week.

====International adaptation====
The German TV series ''[[Lindenstraße]]'' took ''Coronation Street'' as the model. ''Lindenstraße'' started in 1985.

===Films===
Over the years ''Coronation Street'' has released several straight-to-video films. Unlike other soaps which often used straight-to-video films to cover more contentious plot lines that may not be allowed by the broadcaster, ''Coronation Street'' has largely used these films to reset their characters in other locations.

In 1995, ''Coronation Street: The Cruise'' also known as ''Coronation Street: The Feature Length Special'' was released on VHS to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the show. ITV heavily promoted the programme as a direct-to-video exclusive but broadcast a brief version of it on 24 March 1996. The [[Independent Television Commission]] investigated the broadcast, as viewers complained that ITV misled them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MacDonald|first=Marianne|title='Street' cruises for fall over video's brief honeymoon |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/street-cruises-for-fall-over-videos-brief-honeymoon-1304046.html|accessdate=1 October 2010|newspaper=The Independent|date=10 April 1996|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, following the controversial cruise spin-off, ''Coronation Street: Viva Las Vegas!'' was released on VHS, featuring [[Jack Duckworth]], [[Vera Duckworth]], [[Fiona Middleton]] and [[Maxine Peacock]] on a trip to Las Vegas.

In 1999, six special episodes of ''Coronation Street'' were produced, following the story of [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve McDonald]], [[Vicky McDonald]], [[Vikram Desai]], [[Bet Gilroy]] and [[Reg Holdsworth]] in Brighton.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.248.&lt;/ref&gt; This video was titled ''Coronation Street: Open All Hours'' and released on VHS.

In 2008, ITV announced filming was to get underway for a new special DVD episode, ''[[Coronation Street: Out of Africa]]'', following the Battersby-Brown family, which included the temporary return of [[Cilla Battersby-Brown]].

In 2009, another DVD special, ''[[Coronation Street: Romanian Holiday]]'', was released. The feature-length comedy drama followed [[Roy Cropper|Roy]], [[Hayley Cropper|Hayley]] and [[Becky Granger|Becky]] as they travelled to Romania for the wedding of a face from their past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a160096/roy-hayley-becky-for-romanian-corrie-dvd.html |title=Roy, Hayley, Becky for Romanian Corrie DVD |website=Digital Spy |date=15 June 2009 |accessdate=20 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC commissioned a one-off drama called ''[[The Road to Coronation Street]]'', about how the series first came into being. [[Jessie Wallace]] plays [[Pat Phoenix]] ([[Elsie Tanner]]) with [[Lynda Baron]] as [[Violet Carson]] ([[Ena Sharples]]), [[Celia Imrie]] as [[Doris Speed]] ([[Annie Walker (Coronation Street)|Annie Walker]]) and James Roache as his own father William Roache (Ken Barlow). It was broadcast on 16 September 2010 on [[BBC Four]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wollaston|first=Sam|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/sep/17/the-road-to-coronation-street-tv-review |title=TV review: The Road to Coronation Street |work=The Guardian |date= 17 September 2010 |accessdate=17 January 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 November 2010, ''Coronation Street: A Knight's Tale'' was released. [[Reg Holdsworth]] and [[Curly Watts]] returned in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B003YL40QC |title=Coronation Street-A Knight's Tale |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Taylor (Coronation Street)|Mary]] tries to take [[Norris Cole (Coronation Street)|Norris]] to an apparently haunted castle where she hoped to seduce him. [[Rosie Webster|Rosie]] gets a job there and she takes [[Jason Grimshaw|Jason]] with her. [[Brian Capron]] also guest starred as an assumed relative of [[Richard Hillman]].  He rises out of a lake with a comedic &quot;wink to the audience&quot; after Hillman drowned in 2003.

A feature-length film is planned for a 2020 release in order to tie with the show's 60th anniversary.

===Stage===
{{main|Corrie!}}
In August 2010, many ''Coronation Street'' characters were brought to the stage in [[Jonathan Harvey (playwright)|Jonathan Harvey]]'s comedy play ''[[Corrie!]]''. The play was commissioned to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the TV series and was presented at [[The Lowry]] in Salford, England&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelowry.com/event/corrie &quot;Corrie!

==In popular culture==
The British rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] produced a single &quot;[[I Want to Break Free]]&quot; in 1984 which reached number 3 position in UK charts and which is largely known for its music video for which all the band members dressed in women's clothes, which parodied the characters and is considered an homage to the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sutcliffe, Phil |author2=Hince, Peter |author3=Mack, Reinhold |title=Queen: The Ultimate Illustrated History of the Crown Kings of Rock|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=adNONbUWLjgC&amp;pg=PT183|date=15 November 2009|publisher=MBI Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-7603-3719-6 |page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video depicts Mercury as a housewife, loosely based on [[Bet Lynch]], who wants to &quot;break free&quot; from his life. Although Lynch was a blonde in the soap opera, Mercury thought he would look too silly as a blonde and chose a dark wig. May plays another, more relaxed housewife based on [[Hilda Ogden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Freestone, Peter  |author2=Evans, David |title=Freddie Mercury: An Intimate Memoir by the Man who Knew Him Best|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AH8zZsbmB98C&amp;pg=PA119|year=2001|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn= 978-0-7119-8674-9 |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an [[April Fools' Day]] joke in 2019, [[TheJournal.ie]] claimed that [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Jeremy Corbyn]] had made an attempt to appear in an episode of ''Coronation Street'' in response to [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Theresa May]]'s supposed appearance in a special live episode, where she was to issue a final plea for unity on [[Brexit]]. In the joke, Corbyn's plan had not come to fruition, with members of ''Coronation Street'''s crew deeming his request inappropriate in light of the devastation already wreaked upon the soap opera's characters following its most recent [[Panties|knicker]] factory tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sean|last=Murray|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-eastenders-4559197-Apr2019/|title=Theresa May to make appearance on Eastenders in bid to win over Brexit doubters: Leo Varadkar leaked the news last evening, surprising the British press ahead of tonight's show|work=[[TheJournal.ie]]|date=1 April 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401084418/https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-eastenders-4559197-Apr2019/|archivedate=1 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Gavin|last=O'Callaghan|url=https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/april-fools-roundup-best-gags-16057867|title=April fools roundup: The best gags from across Dublin and Irish newspapers – We've seen a lot of great efforts across the capital and in today's media|date=1 April 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401122914/https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/april-fools-roundup-best-gags-16057867|archivedate=1 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
