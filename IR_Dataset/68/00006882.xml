'''Chrysler''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|aɪ|s|l|ər}}; officially '''FCA US LLC''', the first acronym standing for '''Fiat Chrysler Automobiles''') is one of the &quot;[[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]]&quot; [[automobile manufacturer]]s in the United States, headquartered in [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]]. The original Chrysler Corporation was founded in 1925 by [[Walter Chrysler]] from the remains of the [[Maxwell automobile|Maxwell Motor Company]]. In 1998, it was acquired by [[Daimler AG|Daimler-Benz]], and the holding company was renamed DaimlerChrysler. After Daimler divested Chrysler in 2007, the company existed as Chrysler LLC (2007–2009) and Chrysler Group LLC (2009–2014) before merging in 2014 with Italian holding company [[Fiat S.p.A.]] and becoming a subsidiary of its successor [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]]. In addition to the Chrysler brand, FCA sells vehicles worldwide under the [[Dodge]], [[Jeep]], and [[Ram Trucks|Ram]] nameplates. Furthermore, the subsidiary includes [[Mopar]], its automotive parts and accessories division, and [[Street &amp; Racing Technology|SRT]], its performance automobile division.

After founding the company, Walter Chrysler used the [[General Motors]] [[Market segmentation|brand diversification and hierarchy]] strategy that he had seen working for [[Buick]], and acquired [[Fargo Trucks]] and Dodge Brothers, and created the [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] and [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] brands in 1928.&lt;!-- We're skipping over the Depression here. Unlike GM and Ford, Chrysler's sales and profits increased during the Depression, due to Chrysler's much greater reliance on outside parts suppliers, insulating it from the economic downturn, and the low-priced Plymouth brand. During the fat years (below), Ford &amp; GM were more profitable for exactly the same reason, because they kept the profits from parts supplier subsidiaries, leading to Chrysler's cash flow problems of the 1970s. --&gt; Facing postwar declines in market share, productivity, and profitability, as GM and Ford were growing, Chrysler borrowed $250 million in 1954 from [[Prudential Financial|Prudential Insurance]] to pay for expansion and updated car designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yARkK-FHHO8C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=1955+Prudential+chrysler+$250+million |page=18 |title=Mopar Muscle |first=Robert |last=Genat |isbn=9780760320167 |publisher=Motorbooks |date=2004 |accessdate=March 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/managementmanage00jeff|url-access=registration|quote=1955 Prudential chrysler .|title=Management and Managed: Fifty Years of Crisis at Chrysler|last=Jefferys|first=Steve|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=0521304415|location=Cambridge|pages=[https://archive.org/details/managementmanage00jeff/page/107 107]|oclc=13004251}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1954/03/02/83747978.html?pageNumber=33 New York Times] 1954&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrysler expanded into Europe by taking control of French, British and Spanish auto companies in the 1960s; [[Chrysler Europe]] was sold in 1978 to [[Groupe PSA#History|PSA Peugeot Citroën]] for $1. The company struggled to adapt to changing markets, increased U.S. import competition, and safety and [[environmental regulation]] in the 1970s. It began an engineering partnership with [[Mitsubishi Motors]], and began selling Mitsubishi vehicles branded as Dodge and Plymouth in North America. On the verge of bankruptcy in the late 1970s, it was saved by $1.5 billion in loan guarantees from the U.S. government. New CEO [[Lee Iacocca]] was credited with returning the company to profitability in the 1980s. In 1985, [[Diamond-Star Motors]] was created, further expanding the Chrysler-Mitsubishi relationship. In 1987, Chrysler acquired [[American Motors Corporation]] (AMC), which brought the profitable Jeep brand under the Chrysler umbrella. In 1998, Chrysler merged with German automaker [[Daimler-Benz]] to form [[DaimlerChrysler AG]]; the merger proved contentious with investors. As a result, Chrysler was sold to [[Cerberus Capital Management]] and renamed Chrysler LLC in 2007.

Like the other Big Three automobile manufacturers, Chrysler was impacted by the [[automotive industry crisis of 2008–2010]]. The company remained in business through a combination of negotiations with creditors, filing for [[Chrysler Chapter 11 reorganization|Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization]] on April 30, 2009, and participating in a bailout from the U.S. government through the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]]. On June 10, 2009, Chrysler emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings with the [[United Auto Workers]] pension fund, [[Fiat S.p.A.]], and the U.S. and Canadian governments as principal owners. The bankruptcy resulted in Chrysler defaulting on over $4 billion in debts. By May 24, 2011, Chrysler finished repaying its obligations to the U.S. government five years early, although the cost to the American taxpayer was $1.3 billion. Over the next few years, Fiat gradually acquired the other parties' shares while removing much of the weight of the loans (which carried a 21% interest rate) in a short period.

On January 1, 2014, Fiat S.p.A announced a deal to purchase the rest of Chrysler from the United Auto Workers retiree health trust. The deal was completed on January 21, 2014, making Chrysler Group a subsidiary of Fiat S.p.A.&lt;ref name=&quot;autonews.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20140121/OEM/140129980/fiat-completes-chrysler-acquisition-in-4-35-billion-deal#axzz2r8024er1 |title=Fiat completes Chrysler acquisition in $4.35 billion deal |publisher=Autonews.com |date=January 21, 2014 |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles was established by merging Fiat S.p.A. into the company. This was completed in August 2014. Chrysler Group LLC remained a subsidiary until December 15, 2014, when it was renamed FCA US LLC, to reflect the Fiat-Chrysler merger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Chrysler Group LLC is now FCA US LLC |url= http://www.fcausllc.com/Pages/Home.aspx |website=fcausllc.com |accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrysler had arrived at the ailing Maxwell-[[Chalmers Automobile|Chalmers]] company in the early 1920s, hired to overhaul the company's troubled operations (after a similar rescue job at the [[Willys]]-Overland car company).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kimes 2nd&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5b-flfBgbtgC&amp;q=%22salvage+job+at%22+%22Overland,+Walter+Percy+Chrysler%22+%22the+last+Chalmers+were+1924+models%22|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1805-1942|last1=Clark|first1=Henry Ausitn, Jr.|publisher=Krause Publications|year=1989|isbn=0-87341-111-0|edition=2|location=|page=257|pages=|section=Chalmers-Detroit/Chalmers|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1923 production of the Chalmers automobile was ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kimes 2nd&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Chrysler Building, NY.jpg|thumb|The [[Art Deco]] [[Chrysler Building]] in New York City was the company headquarters from 1930 until the mid-1950s.]]
In January 1924, Walter Chrysler launched the well-received Chrysler automobile. The 6-cylinder Chrysler was designed to provide customers with an advanced, well-engineered car, was an automobile at an affordable price. Elements of this car are traceable to a [[prototype]] which had been under development at Willys during Chrysler's tenure&lt;ref name=&quot;Kimes 3rd&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eA4ahvS96soC&amp;q=%22Willys+Six+that+he+had+bought%22+%22free+to+develop+their+original+design%22|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1805-1942|last1=Kimes|first1=Beverly Rae|last2=Clark|first2=Henry Austin|publisher=Krause Publications|year=1996|isbn=0-87341-428-4|edition=3|page=306|section=Chrysler|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original 1924 Chrysler included a carburetor air filter, high compression engine, full pressure lubrication, and an oil filter, features absent from most autos at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Zatz |first=David |title=Chrysler Technological Innovations |url= http://www.allpar.com/corporate/technology.html |work=allpar |accessdate=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204573704577187152424740014|title=A Nation of Drivers|last=Yost|first=Mark|date=2012-01-31|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2019-02-21|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the innovations in its early years were the first practical mass-produced four-wheel hydraulic brakes, a system nearly completely engineered by Chrysler with patents assigned to [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], and rubber engine mounts to reduce vibration.

Chrysler also developed a wheel with a ridged rim, designed to keep a deflated tire from flying off the wheel. This wheel was eventually adopted by the auto industry worldwide.

The Maxwell brand was dropped after the 1925 model year, with the new, lower-priced four-cylinder Chryslers introduced for the 1926 year being [[badge-engineering|badge-engineered]] Maxwells.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kimes 3rd&quot; /&gt; The advanced engineering and testing that went into Chrysler Corporation cars helped to push the company to the second-place position in U.S. sales by 1936, which it held until 1949.

In 1928, the Chrysler Corporation began dividing its vehicle offerings by price class and function. The [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] brand was introduced at the low-priced end of the market (created essentially by once again reworking and rebadging Chrysler's four-cylinder model).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kimes 3rd&quot; /&gt; At the same time, the [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] brand was introduced in the medium-price field. Also in 1928, Chrysler bought the Dodge Brothers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.timelessrides.com/wiki/dodge |title=Dodge Car History, Car Data, Information, Pictures |publisher=Timeless Rides |archivedate=April 8, 2012 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120408194842/http://www.timelessrides.com/wiki/dodge |accessdate=March 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; automobile and truck company and continued the successful Dodge line of automobiles and Fargo range of trucks. By the mid-1930s, the DeSoto and Dodge divisions would trade places in the corporate hierarchy.

The [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]] name had been used since 1926 but was never a separate make, just the top-of-the-line Chrysler. However, in 1955, the company decided to spin it off as its own make/brand and division to better compete with its rivals, Lincoln and Cadillac.

On April 28, 1955, Chrysler and [[Philco]] had announced the development and production of the World's First All-Transistor car radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Chrysler Promises Car Radio With Transistors Instead of Tubes in '56 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=April 28, 1955 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The all-transistor car radio, Mopar model 914HR, was developed and produced by Chrysler and Philco, and it was a $150.00 &quot;option&quot; on the 1956 [[Imperial automobile]] models.

On September 28, 1957, Chrysler had announced the first production electronic fuel injection (EFI), as an option on some of its new 1958 car models (Chrysler 300D, Dodge D500, DeSoto Adventurer, Plymouth Fury). The first attempt to use this system was by American Motors on the 1957 [[Rambler Rebel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Walton |first=Harry |title=How Good is Fuel Injection? |journal=Popular Science |date=March 1957 |volume=170|issue=3 |pages=88–93 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=byEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=1957+Rambler+fuel+injection |accessdate=March 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto.howstuffworks.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1957-1960-rambler-rebel2.htm |title=Rambler Measures Up |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |date=September 22, 2007 |accessdate=March 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bendix Corporation]]'s Electrojector used a transistor computer brain modulator box, but teething problems on [[pre-production car]]s meant very few cars were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Aird |first=Forbes |title=Bosch fuel injection systems |publisher=HP Trade|year=2001 |page=29 |isbn=978-1-55788-365-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The EFI system in the Rambler ran fine in warm weather, but suffered hard starting in cooler temperatures and AMC decided not to use this EFI system, on its 1957 Rambler Rebel production cars that were sold to the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto.howstuffworks.com&quot;/&gt; Chrysler also used the Bendix &quot;Electrojector&quot; fuel injection system and only around 35 vehicles were built with this option, on its 1958 production built car models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune |date=September 29, 1957 |page=A9 |title=New Chrysler Fuel System Is Introduced }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=allpar&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/cars/desoto/electrojector.html |publisher=Allpar.com |title=1958 DeSoto Electrojector – World's First Electronic Fuel Injection? |first=George |last=Mattar |accessdate=March 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owners of EFI Chryslers were so dissatisfied that all but one were retrofitted with carburetors (while that one has been completely restored, with original EFI electronic problems resolved).&lt;ref name=allpar/&gt;

Imperial would see new body styles introduced every two to three years, all with V8 engines and automatic transmissions, as well as technologies that would filter down to Chrysler corporation's other models. Imperial was folded back into the Chrysler brand in 1971.

The [[Plymouth Valiant|Valiant]] was also introduced for 1960 as a distinct brand. In the U.S. market, Valiant was made a model in the Plymouth line for 1961 and the DeSoto make was discontinued in 1961. With those exceptions per applicable year and market, Chrysler's range from lowest to highest price from the 1940s through the 1970s was Valiant, Plymouth, Dodge, DeSoto, Chrysler, and Imperial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Chrysler Brands, Subsidiaries, and Related Companies |publisher=Allpar |url=http://www.allpar.com/cars/auto |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chrysler starlogo.svg|thumb|250px|Chrysler &quot;pentastar&quot; logo, 1962-2014]]
From 1963 through 1969, Chrysler increased its existing stakes to take full control of the French [[Simca]], British [[Rootes Group|Rootes]] and Spanish [[Barreiros (manufacturer)|Barreiros]] companies, merging them into [[Chrysler Europe]] in 1967. In the 1970s, an engineering partnership was established with [[Mitsubishi Motors]], and Chrysler began selling Mitsubishi vehicles branded as Dodge and Plymouth in North America.

Chrysler struggled to adapt to the changing environment of the 1970s. When consumer tastes shifted to smaller cars in the early 1970s, particularly after the [[1973 oil crisis]], Chrysler could not meet the demand. Additional burdens came from increased US import competition, and tougher government regulation of car safety, fuel economy, and emissions. As the smallest of the Big 3 US automakers, Chrysler lacked the financial resources to meet all of these challenges. In 1978, [[Lee Iacocca]] was brought in to turn the company around, and in 1979 Iacocca sought US government help. Congress later passed the ''Loan Guarantee Act'' providing $1.5 billion in loan guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/government-gives-chrysler-1-5-billion-loan |date=May 10, 1980 |title=Government gives Chrysler $1.5 billion loan |accessdate=July 23, 2016 |publisher=A+E Networks }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Loan Guarantee Act'' required that Chrysler also obtain $2 billion in concessions or aid from sources outside the federal government, which included interest rate reductions for $650 million of the savings, asset sales of $300 million, local and state tax concessions of $250 million, and wage reductions of about $590 million along with a $50 million stock offering. $180 million was to come from concessions from dealers and suppliers.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Riding the Roller Coaster: History of the Chrysler Corporation|last=Hyde|first=Charles K.|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-8143-3091-6|location=Detroit|pages=207–232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a period of plant closures and salary cuts agreed to by both management and the auto unions, the loans were repaid with interest in 1983. In November 1983, the [[Chrysler minivans (S)|Dodge Caravan/Plymouth Voyager]] was introduced, establishing the [[minivan]] as a major category, and initiating Chrysler's return to stability.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chrysler|title=Chrysler {{!}} American company|last=Iacocca|first=Lee|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|language=en|access-date=2018-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, [[Diamond-Star Motors]] was created, further expanding the Chrysler-Mitsubishi relationship. In 1987, Chrysler acquired American Motors Corporation (AMC), which brought the profitable Jeep brand under the Chrysler umbrella.

[[File:Tombstone (financial industry) ad - Chrysler buys AMC 13 August 1987.jpg|thumb|In 1987 Chrysler purchased [[American Motors Corporation|American Motors]] from [[Renault]].]]
In 1985, Chrysler entered an agreement with AMC to produce [[Chrysler M platform]] rear-drive, as well as [[Dodge Omni]]s front wheel drive cars, in AMC's [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] plant. In 1987, Chrysler acquired the 47% ownership of AMC that was held by [[Renault]]. The remaining outstanding shares of AMC were bought on the [[New York Stock Exchange|NYSE]] by August 5, 1987, making the deal valued somewhere between US$1.7 billion and US$2 billion, depending on how costs were counted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://archive.org/details/jeepcolorhistory00stev |url-access= registration |quote= Chrysler purchase of AMC billion. |page=[https://archive.org/details/jeepcolorhistory00stev/page/117 117] |title=Jeep Color History |first=Steve |last=Statham |publisher=MBI Publishing |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7603-0636-9 |accessdate=March 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysler CEO [[Lee Iacocca]] wanted the Jeep brand, particularly the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee (ZJ)]] that was under development, the new world-class manufacturing plant in [[Bramalea, Ontario]], and AMC's engineering and management talent that became critical for Chrysler's future success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_daimlerchrysler_ifs/index.html |title=DaimlerChrysler: The 'What Ifs?' |journal=Ward's AutoWorld |date=June 1, 1998 |accessdate=March 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728081757/http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_daimlerchrysler_ifs/index.html |archive-date=July 28, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysler established the [[Jeep-Eagle|Jeep/Eagle division]] as a &quot;specialty&quot; arm to market products distinctly different from the [[Chrysler K platform|K-car-based]] products with the [[Eagle (automobile)|Eagle]] cars targeting import buyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/history/eagle.html |last=Minick |first=Dan |title=A Brief History of Eagle |publisher=allpar.com |accessdate=March 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former AMC [[Car dealership|dealers]] sold [[Jeep]] vehicles and various new Eagle models, as well as Chrysler products, strengthening the automaker's retail distribution system.

[[Eurostar Automobilwerk|Eurostar]], a joint venture between Chrysler and [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch]], began producing the [[Chrysler Voyager]] in Austria for European markets in 1992.

In 1998, Chrysler and its subsidiaries entered into a partnership dubbed a &quot;merger of equals&quot; with German-based [[Daimler-Benz]] AG, creating the combined entity [[DaimlerChrysler AG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://usjunkyardsnearme.com/car-resources/chrysler-history/|title=Chrysler History|publisher=USjunkyardsnearme |accessdate=August 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the surprise of many stockholders, Daimler acquired Chrysler in a stock swap&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/09/business/company-news-daimler-benz-and-chrysler-revise-ratio-for-stock-swap.html |title=Company News; Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Revise Ratio for Stock Swap |date=June 9, 1998 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; before Chrysler CEO Bob Eaton retired. It is widely accepted that the merger was needed because of Eaton's lack of planning for Chrysler in the 1990s, to become their own global automotive company. Under DaimlerChrysler, the company was named DaimlerChrysler Motors Company LLC, with its U.S. operations generally called &quot;DCX&quot;. The Eagle brand was retired soon after Chrysler's merger with Daimler-Benz in 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-09-30/business/9709300310_1_eagle-sales-chrysler-corp-chrysler-and-jeep-vehicles|title=Chrysler Discontinues Eagle Brand|last=Fitzgerald|first=Jacqueline|date=30 September 1997|work=The Chicago Tribune|accessdate=April 1, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeep became a stand-alone division, and efforts were made to merge the Chrysler and Jeep brands as one sales unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown |first=Harold |title=Franchise Dilemmas for Automobile Dealers |journal=Oklahoma City University Law Review |year=1995 |volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the Plymouth brand was also discontinued.

Eurostar also built the [[Chrysler PT Cruiser]] in 2001 and 2002. The Austrian venture was sold to [[Magna International]] in 2002 and became [[Magna Steyr]]. The Voyager continued in production until 2007, whereas the [[Chrysler 300C]], [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] and [[Jeep Commander]] were also built at the plant from 2005 to 2010.

On May 14, 2007, DaimlerChrysler announced the sale of 80.1% of Chrysler Group to American [[private equity]] firm [[Cerberus Capital Management]], L.P., thereafter known as Chrysler LLC, although Daimler (renamed as [[Daimler AG]]) continued to hold a 19.9% stake.&lt;ref name=&quot;dcx_20070514&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.daimlerchrysler.com/dccom/0-5-7145-1-858191-1-0-0-0-0-0-11979-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html |title=Cerberus Takes Majority Interest in Chrysler Group and Related Financial Services Business for EUR 5.5 Billion ($7.4 billion) |publisher=DaimlerChrysler |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124053942/http://daimlerchrysler.com/dccom/0-5-7145-1-858191-1-0-0-0-0-0-11979-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html |archivedate=January 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007–2014: Effects of Great Recession===
The economic collapse of 2007 to 2009 pushed the fragile company to the brink. On April 30, 2009, the automaker filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to be able to operate as a going concern, while renegotiating its debt structure and other obligations,&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/05/06/chrysler-gm-fiat-bankruptcy-opinions-columnists-nouriel-roubini.html|title=The Impact Of Chrysler's Bankruptcy|last=Roubini|first=Nouriel|date=2009-05-06|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in the corporation defaulting on over $4 billion in secured debts.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; The U.S. government described the company's action as a &quot;prepackaged surgical bankruptcy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

On June 10, 2009, substantially all of Chrysler's assets were sold to &quot;New Chrysler&quot;, organized as Chrysler Group LLC. The federal government provided support for the deal with US$8 billion in financing at near 21%. Under CEO [[Sergio Marchionne]], &quot;World Class Manufacturing&quot; or WCM, a system of thorough manufacturing quality, was introduced and several products re-launched with quality and luxury. The 2010 Jeep Grand Cherokee very soon became the most awarded SUV ever.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} The Ram, Jeep, Dodge, SRT and Chrysler divisions were separated to focus on their own identity and brand, and 11 major model refreshes occurred in 21 months. The PT Cruiser, Nitro, Liberty and Caliber models (created during DCX) were discontinued. On May 24, 2011, Chrysler repaid its $7.6 billion loans to the United States and Canadian governments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chrysler-May-2011-8-K&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://pdf.secdatabase.com/2194/0001193125-11-148779.pdf |title=Chrysler, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date May 24, 2011 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.autoblog.com/2011/05/24/chrysler-repays-the-rest-of-its-federal-loans-are-suvs-to-tha/|title=Chrysler repays the rest of its federal loans... are SUVs to thank?|last=Glucker|first=Jeff|date=2011-05-24|website=Autoblog|language=en|access-date=2018-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US Treasury, through the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP), invested $12.5 billion in Chrysler and recovered $11.2 billion when the company shares were sold in May 2011, resulting in a $1.3 billion loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebalance.com/auto-industry-bailout-gm-ford-chrysler-3305670|title=Was the Big 3 Auto Bailout Worth It?|last=Amadeo|first=Kimberly|website=The Balance|language=en|access-date=2018-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://money.cnn.com/2011/07/21/autos/chrysler_government_exit/index.htm?iid=EL | publisher=CNN | title=U.S. loses $1.3 billion in exiting Chrysler | accessdate=November 23, 2014 | date=July 21, 2011 | first=Annalyn | last=Censky | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509103317/http://money.cnn.com/2011/07/21/autos/chrysler_government_exit/index.htm?iid=EL | archivedate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0711/59582.html | publisher=Politico.com | title=Treasury: Chrysler bailout cost $1.3B | accessdate=November 23, 2014 | date=July 21, 2011 | first=Elias | last=Groll | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312210210/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0711/59582.html | archivedate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/TARP-Programs/automotive-programs/Pages/default.aspx | publisher=U.S. Department of the Treasury | title=Auto Industry:Program Overview - Five Year Update | accessdate=November 23, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006204916/http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/TARP-Programs/automotive-programs/Pages/default.aspx | archivedate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 21, 2011, Fiat bought the Chrysler shares held by the US Treasury.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chrysler-Jul-2011-8-K&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1730/119312511193300/filing-main.htm |title=Chrysler, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Jul 21, 2011 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purchase made Chrysler foreign-owned again, this time as the luxury division. The [[Chrysler 300]] was badged Lancia Thema in some European markets (with additional engine options), giving Lancia a much needed replacement for its flagship.

The company will also pay affected consumers up to $280 million and offer extended warranties on such vehicles worth $105 million.

====&quot;Imported From Detroit&quot;====
In 2011, Chrysler unveiled their &quot;Imported From Detroit&quot; campaign with ads featuring Detroit rapper [[Eminem]], [[Born of Fire|one of which]] aired during the Super Bowl. The campaign highlighted the rejuvenation of the entire product lineup, which included the new, redesigned and repackaged 2011 200 sedan and 200 convertible, the Chrysler 300 sedan and the Chrysler Town &amp; Country minivan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Gutierrez |first=Dianna |url= http://www.media.chrysler.com/newsrelease.do;jsessionid=FF89CD493D55543EC338709865812824?&amp;id=10512&amp;mid=23 |title=Chrysler Brand Launches New Marketing and Advertising Campaign |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=February 6, 2011 |accessdate=April 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author= Chris Shunk RSS feed |url= http://www.autoblog.com/2011/03/08/detroit-city-council-honors-chryslers-super-bowl-commercial-w/ |title=Detroit City Council honors Chrysler's Super Bowl commercial |publisher=Autoblog.com |accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the campaign, Chrysler sold a line of clothing items featuring the [[Monument to Joe Louis]], with proceeds being funneled to Detroit-area charities, including the Boys and Girls Clubs of Southeast Michigan, Habitat for Humanity Detroit and the Marshall Mathers Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Aaron |last=Richardson |url= http://www.autoblog.com/2011/03/14/report-chrysler-updates-imported-from-detroit-logo/ |title=Report: Chrysler updates 'Imported From Detroit' logo |date=March 14, 2011 |publisher=Autoblog.com |accessdate=March 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Eminem ad, there was also an ad for Detroit Lions defensive tackle [[Ndamukong Suh]] driving a Chrysler 300 to Portland, Oregon, to visit his mother, an ad featuring Detroit-born fashion designer [[John Varvatos]] cruising through a shadowy Gotham while Kevin Yon's familiar baritone traces the designer's genesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Schultz |first=Jonathan |url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/12/chrysler-exports-imported-from-detroit-to-new-york/ |title=Chrysler Exports 'Imported From Detroit' to New York |work=The New York Times |date=May 12, 2011 |accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, Chrysler Group LLC filed a lawsuit against Moda Group LLC (owner of Pure Detroit clothing retailer) for copying and selling merchandise with the &quot;Imported from Detroit&quot; slogan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Halcom |first=Chad |date=March 16, 2011 |url= http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20110316/FREE/110319936/chrysler-sues-pure-detroit-says-imported-from-detroit-merchandise-infringes-on-trademark |title=Chrysler sues Pure Detroit, says 'Imported From Detroit' merchandise infringes on trademark |work=Crain's Detroit Business |accessdate=March 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysler claimed it had notified defendant of its pending trademark application February 14, but the defendant argued Chrysler had not secured a trademark for the &quot;Imported From Detroit&quot; phrase. On June 18, 2011, U.S. District Judge Arthur Tarnow ruled that Chrysler's request did not show that it would suffer irreparable harm or that it had a strong likelihood of winning its case. Therefore, Pure Detroit's owner, Detroit retailer Moda Group LLC, can continue selling its &quot;Imported from Detroit&quot; products. Tarnow also noted that Chrysler does not have a trademark on &quot;Imported from Detroit&quot; and rejected the automaker's argument that trademark law is not applicable to the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20110629/CARNEWS/110629852/0/videonewsarchive |title=Chrysler loses 'Imported from Detroit' lawsuit |publisher=Autoweek.com |date=June 29, 2011 |accessdate=May 20, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614135955/http://www.autoweek.com/article/20110629/CARNEWS/110629852/0/videonewsarchive |archivedate=June 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Zach|last=Bowman|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2011/06/29/chrysler-legal-bid-to-halt-imported-from-detroit-merchandise-s/ |title=Chrysler legal bid to halt 'Imported From Detroit' merchandise sales falls short |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=June 29, 2011 |accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, Chrysler Group LLC and Pure Detroit agreed to a March 27 mediation to try to settle the lawsuit over the clothing company's use of &quot;Imported from Detroit&quot; slogan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20120319/AUTO0101/203190378/1148/auto01/Chrysler-Pure-Detroit-agree-mediation-settle-Imported-from-Detroit-suit |title=Chrysler, Pure Detroit agree to mediation to settle 'Imported from Detroit' suit |work=The Detroit News |date=March 19, 2012 |accessdate=May 20, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pure Detroit stated that Chrysler has made false claims about the origins of three vehicles - Chrysler 200, Chrysler 300 and Chrysler Town &amp; Country - none of which are built in Detroit.

Chrysler's [[Jefferson North Assembly]], which makes the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango, is the only car manufacturing plant of any company remaining entirely in Detroit (General Motors operates a plant which is partly in Detroit and partly in Hamtramck).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/16/business/last-car-plant-brings-detroit-hope-and-cash.html |title=Last Car Plant Brings Detroit Hope and Cash |first=Bill |last=Vlasic |date=July 15, 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Eminem settled a lawsuit against [[Audi]] alleging the defendant had ripped off the Chrysler 300 Super Bowl commercial in the [[Audi A6]] Avant ad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/publishing/audi-settles-copyright-lawsuit-with-eminem-1005306352.story |title=Audi Settles Copyright Lawsuit With Eminem Over 'Lose Yourself' Ad |first=Wolfgang |last=Spahr |work=Billboard |date=August 5, 2011 |accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====&quot;Half Time in America&quot;====
Again in 2012, Chrysler advertised during the [[Super Bowl]]. Its two-minute February 5, 2012 [[Super Bowl XLVI]] advertisement was titled &quot;Half Time in America&quot;. The ad drew criticism from several leading U.S. [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]], who suggested that its messaging implied that President [[Barack Obama]] deserved a second term and, as such, was political payback for Obama's support for the federal bailout of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-02-06/politics/politics_eastwood-ad-politics_1_chrysler-ad-halftime-show-america-auto-industry?_s=PM:POLITICS |first=Bryan |last=Monroe |publisher=CNN |title=Were politics buried inside Eastwood's 'Halftime' commercial? |date=February 6, 2012 |accessdate=April 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624062810/http://articles.cnn.com/2012-02-06/politics/politics_eastwood-ad-politics_1_chrysler-ad-halftime-show-america-auto-industry?_s=PM%3APOLITICS |archivedate=June 24, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked about the criticism in a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' interview with [[Steve Kroft]], Sergio Marchionne responded &quot;just to rectify the record I paid back the loans at 19.7% Interest.

;&quot;America's Import&quot;

In 2014, Chrysler started using a new slogan, &quot;America's Import&quot; in ads introducing their all-new 2015 Chrysler 200,&lt;ref name=&quot;detroitnews.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/chrysler/2014/10/26/new-chrysler-ad-campaign-debuts-detroit-lions-game/17959635/|title=New Chrysler 200 ad campaign debuts during Lions game|publisher=|accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; targeting foreign automakers from Germany to Japan with such ads (German performance and Japanese quality), and at the ending of selected ads, the advertisement will say, &quot;We Built This&quot;, indicating being built in America, instead of overseas.

The Chrysler brand has mostly been Chrysler's premium brand competing with brands such as [[Cadillac]], [[Packard]], [[Cord automobile|Cord]] and [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln]]. After the corporation decided to spin [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]] off as a separate brand in 1955 to better compete with Cadillac and Lincoln, Chrysler became the corporation's number two brand, but still offered luxury and near-luxury products. After the Imperial brand was dropped in 1975, Chrysler once again became the top brand.

The '''Chrysler Town &amp; Country''' is a [[station wagon]] that was manufactured by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] from 1940 to 1942 and from 1945 to 1988 (there was no production during [[World War II]] from 1943 to 1945). The [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country (pre-1990)|Town &amp; Country]] was also available in four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]], two-door [[hardtop]] (no &quot;B&quot; pillar), and [[convertible]] body styles from 1947 to 1950 and from 1983 to 1986. The 1988 model year was the last for the [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country (pre-1990)|Town &amp; Country]] [[station wagon]], after that and partly during one model year (1989), the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country (pre-1990)|Town &amp; Country]] nameplate was off the market until the 1990 model year run when Chrysler re-introduced the Town &amp; Country nameplate as a [[badge engineering|rebadged variant]] [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] [[minivan]].

Chrysler's Town &amp; Country wagon was reintroduced as a four-door station wagon of all steel construction in 1951. It was offered in both Windsor and New Yorker variants through the end of Windsor model production after the 1960 model year, and then in Newport and New Yorker models through 1965. After that, it was a model in its own right, with trim and features which bridged the gap between the two sedan lines. It was distinguished by luxury features including a carpeted loadfloor trimmed with chrome strips, and from 1968 forward, woodgrain paneling on the body sides and tailgate, a feature also associated with somewhat competitive top-shelf station wagons such as the [[AMC Ambassador]], [[Buick Estate]], [[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]], [[Ford Country Squire]], and the [[Mercury Colony Park]]. Town and Country, however, stood in a class by itself until the last of the full-sized versions of 1977. From 1978, it was sized down and absorbed into the LeBaron series, with a lesser version lacking the more luxurious features and the woodgrain bodyside decals available for a few years in the early 1980s.

[[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] re-introduced the Town &amp; Country nameplate in calendar year 1989 as a luxury [[badge engineering|rebadged variant]] of the [[Dodge Grand Caravan]]/[[Plymouth Grand Voyager]] [[minivan]] for the 1990 model year and continued to sell this incarnation of the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] until the end of the 2016 model year when [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] reintroduced the Pacifica nameplate for their minivan in calendar year 2016 for the 2017 model year run.

===1950s===
Chrysler introduced their first overhead-valve, high-compression V8 engine in 1951, Displacing 331 cubic inches, it was rated at 180 bhp, 20 more hoursepower than the new-for-1949 Cadillac V8. It was unique as the only American V8 engine designed with hemispherical combustion chambers. After successfully winning Mexican Road Races, the engine was upgraded to 250 bhp by 1955. Although Chrysler didn't have the capital to build a small sporty car (such as the [[Chevrolet Corvette]] and the [[Ford Thunderbird]]), they decided to build a unique sporting car based on the New Yorker hardtop coupe, that featured a 300-bhp &quot;Hemi&quot; V8. To add to the car's uniqueness, the car was given a grille from the [[Chrysler Imperial|Imperial]], and side trim from the less-adorned Windsor. A [[PowerFlite]] 2-speed automatic transmission was the only available gearbox. It was marketed as the [[Chrysler 300]], emphasizing the engine's horsepower.

A 1955 restyle by newly-hired [[Virgil Exner]] saw a dramatic rise in Chrysler sales, which rose even more in 1957, when the entire line was dramatically restyled a second time with a sloping front end and high-flying tailfins at the rear. Although well-received at first, it soon became apparent that quality control was compromised to get the new cars to market on an accelerated schedule. Sales therefore plummeted in 1958 and 1959 despite improvements in quality. Throughout the mid- and late-1950s, Chryslers were available in top-line New Yorker, mid-line Saratoga, and base Windsor series. Exner's designs for the Chrysler brand in the early 1960s were overblown versions of the late 1950s, which were unhelpful in sales. Exner left his post by 1962, leaving [[Elwood Engel]], a recent transfer from Ford Motor Co, in charge of Chrysler styling.

===1960s===
Although early 1960s Chrysler cars reflected Virgil Exner's exaggerated styling, ELwood Engel's influence was evident as early as 1963, when a restyled, trimmer, boxier Chrysler was introduced. The Windsor and Saratoga series were replaced with the Newport, while New Yorker continued as the top-of-the-line. The Chrysler 300, officially part of the New York line, continued in production through 1965, adding a different letter of the alphabet for each year of production, starting with the 300-B of 1956, through the 300-L of 1965. 1962 saw a &quot;non-letter&quot; 300 which was lower in price but was equipped with downgraded standard equipment. The '65 Chryslers were again dramatically restyled, with a thoroughly modern unit body and larger engines up to 440 cubic inches. They were trim and boxy, with glass-covered headlamps and a swept-back roofline for 2-door hardtop models. Although Chryslers though the 1960s were well-built, quality cars with man innovative features (such as unit bodies and front torsion bar suspension), sales slumped as American buyers bought record numbers of cars from Ford and GM.

===1970s===
The Cordoba was introduced by Chrysler for the 1975 model year as an upscale personal luxury car, competing with the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]], [[Buick Regal]], and [[Mercury Cougar#Third generation (1974–1976)|Mercury Cougar]]. The Cordoba was originally intended to be a Plymouth—the names [[Dodge Mirada|Mirada]], [[Eagle Premier|Premier]], [[Chrysler Sebring|Sebring]], and Grand Era were associated with the project; all except Grand Era would be used on later Chrysler, Dodge, and Eagle vehicles, though only the [[Dodge Mirada]] would be related to the Cordoba. However, losses from the newly introduced full-size C-body models due to the [[1973 oil crisis]] encouraged Chrysler executives to seek higher profits by marketing the model under the more upscale Chrysler brand.

The car was a success, with over 150,000 examples sold in 1975, a sales year that was otherwise dismal for the company. For the 1976 model year, sales increased slightly to 165,000. The mildly revised 1977 version also sold well, with just under 140,000 cars. The success of using the Chrysler nameplate strategy is contrasted to sales of its similar and somewhat cheaper corporate cousin, the [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Dodge Charger]] SE.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/cars/dodge/charger/sales.html|website=applar.com|title=Dodge Charger Sales and Production|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interiors were more luxurious than the Dodge Charger SE and much more than the top-line standard intermediates (Plymouth Fury, Dodge Coronet) with a velour cloth notchback bench seat and folding armrest standard. Optionally available were bucket seats upholstered in [[Corinthian leather]] with a center armrest and cushion, or at extra cost, a center console with floor shifter and storage compartment.

In 1977, Chrysler brought out a new mid-size line of cars called [[Chrysler LeBaron|LeBaron]] (a name previously used for an Imperial model) which included a coupe, sedan, and station wagon.

===1980s===
For 1982, the LeBaron moved to the [[front-wheel drive]] [[Chrysler K platform]], where it was the upscale brand's lowest priced offering. It was initially available in just [[sedan (car)|sedan]] and [[coupe]] versions. In early 1982, it was released in a [[convertible (car)|convertible]] version, bringing to the market the first factory-built open-topped domestic vehicle since the 1976 [[Cadillac Eldorado]]. A station wagon version called the '''Town and Country''' was added as well. A special Town and Country convertible was also made from 1983 to 1986 in limited quantities (1,105 total), which like the wagon featured simulated wood paneling that made it resemble the original 1940s [[Chrysler Town and Country (pre-1990)|Town and Country]]. This model was part of the well-equipped Mark Cross option package for the latter years.

In 1982 the R-body line was discontinued and the New Yorker nameplate transferred to the smaller M-body line. Up to this point, the Chrysler M-body entry had been sold as LeBaron, but that name was moved to a new K-car based FWD line (refer to the [[Chrysler LeBaron]] article for information on the 1977-81 M-bodies). Following the nameplate swap, the M-body line was consolidated and simplified. 360 V8 engines were gone, as were coupes and station wagons (the K-car LeBaron's coupe and wagon replaced them).  The Fifth Avenue option was still available as a $1,244 option package. It was adapted from the earlier LeBaron's package, with a distinctive vinyl roof, electro-luminescent opera lamps, and a rear fascia adapted from the Dodge Diplomat. Interiors featured button-tufted, pillow-soft seats covered in either &quot;Kimberley velvet&quot; or &quot;[[Corinthian leather]]&quot;, choices that would continue unchanged throughout the car's run. In addition, the carpet was thicker than that offered in the base New Yorker, [[Dodge Diplomat|Diplomat]] and [[Plymouth Gran Fury|Gran Fury/Caravelle Salon]], and the interior had more chrome trim.

1983 was the last year for Chrysler's Cordoba coupe.  Also in 1983, Chrysler introduced a new front-wheel drive New Yorker model based on a stretched K-Car platform. Additionally, a less expensive, less equipped version of the new New Yorker was sold as the [[Chrysler E-Class]] in 1983 and 1984.  More upscale stretched K-Car models were also sold as [[Chrysler Executive]] sedans and limousines.

For 1984, the New Yorker Fifth Avenue was now simply called Fifth Avenue, setting the name that would continue for six successful years.  All Fifth Avenues from 1984 to 1989 were powered by a 5.2&amp;nbsp;L (318&amp;nbsp;in³) V8 engine, with either a two barrel [[carburetor]] making {{Convert|140|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} (in all states except California) or a four barrel rated at {{Convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} (in [[California]]), mated to Chrysler's well-known [[Torqueflite]] three speed [[automatic transmission]]. Fifth Avenue production was moved from [[Windsor, Ontario]] to [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Beginning in late 1986 through the 1989 model year, they were manufactured at the [[American Motors]] plant in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] (purchased by Chrysler in 1987). The Fifth Avenue also far outsold its [[Dodge Diplomat]] and [[Plymouth Gran Fury]] siblings, with a much greater proportion of sales going to private customers, despite its higher price tag.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allpar.com/model/dodge-diplomat.html &quot;Dodge Diplomat, Plymouth Gran Fury, Chrysler Lebaron, Town &amp; Country, New Yorker, Fifth Avenue, and Caravelle&quot;, allpar.com], retrieved on 2010-01-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Production peaked at 118,000 cars for 1986 and the Fifth Avenue stood out in a by-now K-car dominated lineup as Chrysler's lone concession to traditional RWD American sedans.

Chrysler introduced a new mid-size five door hatchback model for 1985 under the [[Chrysler LeBaron GTS|LeBaron GTS]] nameplate.  It was sold alongside the mid-size LeBaron sedan, coupe, convertible, and station wagon. The LeBaron coupe and convertible were redesigned for 1987.  Unlike previous LeBarons, this new coupe and convertible had unique styling instead of being just two-door versions of the sedan. The new design featured [[hidden headlamps]] (through 1992) and full width taillights.

The New Yorker was redesigned for the 1988 model year and now included a standard V6 engine. This generation New Yorker also saw the return of hidden headlamps which had not been available on the New Yorker since the 1981 [[Chrysler R platform|R-body]] version. In 1989, Chrysler brought out the [[Chrysler TC by Maserati|TC by Maserati]] luxury roadster as a more affordable alternative to Cadillac's Allante. It was a joint venture model between Chrysler and Maserati.

===1990s===
[[File:ChryslerNewYorker.jpg|thumb|left|1992–1993 Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue]]
Chrysler re-introduced the Town &amp; Country nameplate in calendar year 1989 as a luxury [[badge engineering|rebadged variant]] of the [[Dodge Grand Caravan]]/[[Plymouth Grand Voyager]] [[minivan]] for the 1990 model year and continued to sell this incarnation of the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] until the end of the 2016 model year when [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] reintroduced the Pacifica nameplate for their minivan in calendar year 2016 for the 2017 model year run. 1990 saw the previous relationship between New Yorker and Fifth Avenue return, as the Fifth Avenue became a model of the New Yorker. There was some substantive difference, however, as the New Yorker Fifth Avenue used a [[Chrysler Y platform|slightly longer chassis]] than the standard car. The new New Yorker Fifth Avenue's larger interior volume classified it as a full-size model this time; despite having smaller exterior dimensions than the first generation.  For 1990, Chrysler's new 3.3-liter [[V6]] engine was the standard and only choice, teamed with the company's A-604 four-speed electronic automatic transaxle. Beginning in 1991, a larger 3.8-liter V-6 became optional. It delivered the same 147 horsepower as the 3.3, but had more torque.

The New Yorker Fifth Avenue's famous seats, long noted for their button-tufted appearance and sofa-like comfort, continued to be offered with the customer's choice of velour or leather, with the former &quot;Corinthian leather&quot; replaced by that of the Mark Cross company. Leather-equipped cars bore the Mark Cross logo on the seats and, externally, on an emblem attached to the brushed aluminum band ahead of the rear door opera windows. In this form, the New Yorker Fifth Avenue resembled the newly revived [[Chrysler Imperial#1990–1993|Chrysler Imperial]], although some much-needed distinction was provided between the cars when the New Yorker Fifth Avenue (along with its New Yorker Salon linemate) received restyled, rounded-off front and rear ends for the 1992 model year, while the Imperial continued in its original crisply-lined form.

[[File:Imperial 1992.png|thumb|left|1992 Chrysler Imperial]]
[[File:Chrysler Imperial rear.jpg|thumb|left|The 1990s Chrysler Imperial featured full-width taillights.]]

The early 1990s saw a revival of the Imperial as a high-end sedan in Chrysler's lineup.&lt;ref name=beaulieu&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Georgano |editor-first=Nick N. |authorlink=G.N. Georgano |title=The Beaulieu encyclopedia of the automobile |publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers |year=2000 |pages=753–745 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bxMUKaqcUPoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA753&amp;dq=Imperial+automobile+luxury |isbn=978-1-57958-367-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the 1955–1983 Imperial, this car was a model of Chrysler, not its own marque. Based on the [[Chrysler Y platform|Y platform]], it represented the top [[full-size]] model in Chrysler's lineup; below it was the similar [[Chrysler Fifth Avenue|New Yorker Fifth Avenue]], and below that was the shorter wheelbase [[Chrysler New Yorker|New Yorker]]. The reintroduction of the Imperial was two years after the [[Lincoln Continental#Eighth generation (1988–1994)|Lincoln Continental]] was changed to a front-wheel drive sedan with a V6 engine. Other domestic competitors in this segment included the [[Cadillac Sedan de Ville]]/[[Cadillac Fleetwood|Fleetwood]], [[Oldsmobile 98]] and [[Buick Electra]]/[[Buick Park Avenue|Park Avenue]].  Though closely related, the Imperial differed from the New Yorker Fifth Avenue in many ways. The Imperial's nose was more wedge-shaped, while the New Yorker Fifth Avenue's had a sharper, more angular profile (the New Yorker Fifth Avenue was later restyled with a more rounded front end). The rears of the two cars also differed. Like the front, the New Yorker Fifth Avenue's rear came to stiffer angles while the Imperial's rear-end came to more rounded edges. Also found on the Imperial were full-width taillights which were similar to those of the Chrysler TC, as well as the early 1980s Imperial coupe, while the New Yorker Fifth Avenue came with smaller vertical taillights.

Initially, the 1990 Imperial was powered by the {{convert|147|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.3 L ''[[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.3|EGA]]'' [[V6 engine]], which was rated at {{convert|185|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque. For 1991, the 3.3 L V6 was replaced by the larger 3.8 L ''[[Chrysler 3.3 engine#OHV|EGH]]'' V6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1990-to-1993-chrysler-imperial-new-yorker-fifth-avenue.htm |title=1990–1993 Chrysler Imperial/New Yorker Fifth Avenue: Overview |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120920084608/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1990-to-1993-chrysler-imperial-new-yorker-fifth-avenue.htm |archivedate=20 September 2012 |accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although horsepower only increased to {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, with the new larger 3.8 L V6 torque increased to {{convert|215|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 2750 rpm. A four-speed [[automatic transmission]] was standard with both engines.

Also new for 1990 was a redesigned LeBaron sedan which offered a standard V6 engine. Later models would also be available with 4 cylinder engines.

The Town &amp; Country minivan was restyled for 1991 in conjunction with the restyling of the Dodge and Plymouth minivan models. 1991 would also be the last year for the TC by Maserati, leaving the LeBaron as the brand's sole coupe and convertible options.

[[File:Chrysler Concorde LX silver rear cz.jpg|thumb|left|First generation featured full width taillamp design.]]

The first generation of the [[Chrysler Concorde]] debuted at the 1992 [[North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]] as a 1993 model. It debuted as a single, well-equipped model with a base price of [[United States dollar|US$]]18,341.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/chrysler14.htm |title=How Chrysler Works: The Chrysler Concorde |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |date=1 June 2007 |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of all the LH sedans, the first generation Concorde was most closely related to the [[Eagle Vision]]. The Concorde was given a more traditional image than the Vision. The two shared nearly all sheetmetal in common with the main differences limited to their grilles, rear fascias, body side moldings, and wheel choices. The Concorde featured a modern take on Chrysler's signature waterfall grille. It was split into six sections divided by body colored strips with the [[History of Chrysler#Logos|Chrysler Pentastar]] logo on the center strip. The Concorde's rear fascia was highlighted by a full-width and full-height [[lightbar]] between the taillights, giving the appearance that the taillights stretched across the entire trunk. In keeping with its upscale position, Concorde's body side moldings incorporated bright chrome (later golden colored) work not found on its Dodge or Eagle siblings. On Concordes with gray lower body paint color, the gray came all the way up to the chrome beltline; on Visions the gray lower body paint area was smaller and much more subtle. Wheel styles, which included available aluminum wheels with a Spiralcast design, were also unique to the Chrysler LH sedans (Concorde, LHS, New Yorker); Dodge and Eagle had their own different wheel styles.

Introduced in May 1993 for the 1994 model year, the Chrysler LHS was the top of the line model for the division, as well as the most expensive of the [[Chrysler LH platform]] cars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allpar-2ndGen&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/model/300LHS.html |title=Creating the second-generation Chrysler LHS and the Chrysler 300M |publisher=allpar |date=April 2014 |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the LH-series models shared a {{convert|113.0|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase and were developed using Chrysler's new computer drafting system.&lt;ref name=&quot;edmunds1999test&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.edmunds.com/chrysler/300m/1999/road-test.html |title=1999 Chrysler 300M and 1999 Chrysler LHS Road Test |date=1 January 1999 |first=Greg |last=Anderson |publisher=Edmunds |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car was differentiated from the division's [[Chrysler New Yorker|New Yorker]] sedan by its bucket leather seats (the New Yorker had a bench seat) and standard features such as alloy wheels that were options on the New Yorker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/model/lh2/index.html |title=1993-1997 Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision, and Chrysler Concorde, New Yorker, and LHS |publisher=allpar |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further differences between the Chrysler LHS and its New Yorker counterpart were a floor console and shifter, five-passenger seating, lack of chrome trim, an upgraded interior and a sportier image. The New Yorker was dropped after the 1996 model year in favor of a six-passenger option on the LHS. The LHS received a minor face change in 1995 when the corporate wide pentastar emblem was replaced with the revived Chrysler brand emblem. Standard features of the LHS included a 3.5 L EGE 24-valve {{convert|214|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} V6 engine, body-colored grille, side mirrors and trim, traction control, aluminum wheels, integrated fog lights, 8-way power adjustable front seats, premium sound systems with amplifiers, and automatic temperature control. Unlike the New Yorker, leather seats were standard.

[[File:Chrysler New Yorker LH.jpg|thumb|left|1994–1996 Chrysler New Yorker]]

The final generation of the New Yorker continued with front-wheel drive on an elongated version of the new [[Chrysler LH platform]] and was released in May 1993 along with the nearly identical '''Chrysler LHS''' as an early 1994 model, eight months after the original LH cars: the Chrysler Concorde, [[Dodge Intrepid]], and Eagle Vision, were introduced. The New Yorker came standard with the 3.5&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Chrysler SOHC V6 engine#3.5|EGE]]'' which produced {{convert|214|hp|abbr=on}}. Chrysler gave the New Yorker a more &quot;traditional American&quot; luxury image, and the LHS a more European performance image (as was done with the [[Eagle Vision]]). Little separated New Yorker from LHS in appearance, with New Yorker's chrome hood trim, body-color cladding, standard chrome wheel covers and 15&quot; wheels, column shifter and front bench seat, being the only noticeable differences. An option provided for 16&quot; wheels and a firmer suspension type (&quot;touring suspension&quot;). This option eliminated the technical differences between New Yorker and LHS. LHS came with almost all of New Yorker's optional features as standard equipment and featured the firmer tuned suspension, to go with its more European image.

During the 1994 model run, various changes were made to the New Yorker. On the outside, New Yorker was switched to new accent-color body cladding, whereas LHS received body-color cladding. This change aligned New Yorker with the Chrysler Concorde which also had accent-color cladding. Instead of standard 15&quot; and optional 16&quot; wheels, for the sake of enhanced stability 16&quot; wheels became standard and the 15&quot; wheels were dropped. Likewise, the touring suspension option available on early 1994 New Yorker models was discontinued, leaving only &quot;ride-tuned&quot; suspension.

In 1995, the Chrysler Sebring was introduced as a coupe, replacing the LeBaron coupe, and the new [[Chrysler JA platform|JA platform]] [[Chrysler Cirrus]] replaced the outgoing LeBaron sedan.  A year later, a convertible version of the Sebring went on the market and replaced the LeBaron convertible. In 1999, Chrysler introduced the new LH platform [[Chrysler 300M|300M]] sedan alongside a redesigned LHS.  The 300M was originally designed to be the next generation Eagle Vision but since the Eagle brand had been discontinued in 1998, it instead became a Chrysler sedan.

===2000s===
In 2000, the [[Chrysler Voyager|Voyager]] and Grand Voyager minivans were repositioned as Chrysler models due to the phasing out of the Plymouth brand.  In 2001, a sedan was added to the Sebring model line and served as a replacement for the discontinued Cirrus.  That same year, the Chrysler brand added a retro-styled [[Chrysler PT Cruiser|PT Cruiser]] as well as the [[Chrysler Prowler|Prowler]] roadster which had previously been a Plymouth model.  By 2004, all Chrysler brand minivans were now sold under the Town &amp; Country nameplate.

The 2000s also saw the Chrysler brand move into the fast growing crossover/SUV segment with the introduction of the [[Chrysler Pacifica (crossover)|Chrysler Pacifica]] crossover in 2004, and the [[Chrysler Aspen]] SUV in 2007.  The Pacifica would be discontinued in 2008 (the nameplate would return on a new minivan model in 2017) and the Aspen would be discontinued in 2009.

Between 2004 and 2008, Chrysler offered a two-seat coupe and convertible model called [[Chrysler Crossfire|Crossfire]]. This was in addition to Chrysler's five-seat Sebring coupe (through 2005) and four-seat convertible being sold at the time.

In 2005, Chrysler introduced the [[Chrysler LX platform|LX platform]] [[Chrysler 300]] sedan which replaced both the 300M and Concorde.  It was the brand's first rear-wheel drive sedan since the discontinuation of the Chrysler Fifth Avenue in 1989.  It was also the first time a Chrysler sedan was available with a V8 engine since 1989.

===2010s===
Following FCA's acquisition of Chrysler, FCA set a long-term goal of reviving the Chrysler brand as a full luxury brand to compete again with Cadillac and other luxury brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/09/21/report-fiat-wants-chrysler-to-be-a-cadillac-competitor/ |title=REPORT: Fiat wants Chrysler to be a Cadillac Competitor |work=autoblog.com |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company stated in October 2009 that future plans for Chrysler brand vehicles include closer cooperation and shared development between Chrysler and [[Lancia]], an upscale Italian automaker within the Fiat Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/lancia-chrysler-to-share-products.html |title=Lancia, Chrysler to share products |publisher=Leftlanenews.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the brand's winged emblem was modified, eliminating the historic blue ribbon center which dated from the 1930s, replacing it with a blue-backed &quot;Chrysler&quot; nameplate. Also that year, the Chrysler 300 was restyled and the Sebring was rebranded as the [[Chrysler 200]].  In May 2014, FCA announced it would make the brand a mainstream brand with premium features.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAToday-3892304&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2014/05/06/fiat-chrysler-chrysler-brand/8746707/ |title=Chrysler brand goes mainstream, adds compact |work=[[USA Today]] |date=2014-05-06 |publisher=[[Gannett Company|Gannett]] |location=[[Tysons Corner, Virginia|Tysons Corner, VA]] |issn=0734-7456 |accessdate=2014-05-07 |first1=Alisa |last1=Priddle |first2=Brent |last2=Snavely |first3=Tom |last3=Walsh |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617124026/https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2014/05/06/fiat-chrysler-chrysler-brand/8746707/ |archivedate=June 17, 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A redesigned Chrysler 200 was introduced for 2015 as a sedan only, but would be discontinued in 2017 as FCA shifted focus more towards SUVs and minivans.  For 2017, the [[Chrysler Pacifica (minivan)|Chrysler Pacifica]] nameplate returned on a new minivan, replacing the long-running Town &amp; Country.

===2020s===
On June 27, 2019, FCA announced that the low-end ''L'' and ''LX'' models would be separated from the Pacifica line and sold under the Voyager nameplate starting with the 2020 model year.  Additionally, a fleet-only Voyager ''LXi'' version would be added.

The brand's current lineup consists of the [[Chrysler 300]], [[Chrysler Pacifica (minivan)|Chrysler Pacifica]] and [[Chrysler Voyager]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chrysler.com/|title=Chrysler Official Site - Cars and Minivans|website=chrysler.com|access-date=2019-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiat===
In 2010, Fiat Auto was planning to sell seven of its vehicles in the U.S. by 2014, while Fiat-controlled Chrysler Group was to supply nine models to sell under Fiat brands in the European market, according to a five-year plan rolled out on April 21, 2010 in [[Turin]], Italy, by Fiat and Chrysler CEO [[Sergio Marchionne]]. At least five of the Fiat Auto models were expected to be marketed in the U.S. under its [[Alfa Romeo]] brand. Showing the level of integration envisioned, a product introduction timeline envisaged Chrysler-built compact and full-size SUVs going on sale in 2012 and 2014, respectively, in both European and North American markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2010-04-21-fiat-splits_N.htm|title=7 new Fiat models bound for U.S.; 9 Chryslers to go abroad|last=Healey|first=James R.|date=April 21, 2010|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental initiatives==
Chrysler produced an experimental [[Battery electric vehicle|electric]] vehicle in 1979, the company developed [[Chrysler ETV-1]] electric prototype in cooperation with [[U.S. Department of Energy]].

In 1992, Chrysler developed the [[Dodge EPIC]] concept minivan. In 1993, Chrysler began to sell a limited-production electric minivan called the [[Chrysler TEVan|TEVan]]; however only 56 were produced. In 1997, a second generation, called the EPIC, was released. It was discontinued after 1999.{{Citation needed|date = July 2015}}

Chrysler once owned the [[Global Electric Motorcars]] company, building low-speed [[neighborhood electric vehicles]], but sold GEM to [[Polaris Industries]] in 2011.

In September 2007, Chrysler established [[Envi (Automobile)|ENVI]], an in-house organization focused on [[electric vehicle|electric-drive vehicles]] and related technologies which was disbanded by late 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krolicki&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/11/07/us-chrysler-ev-idUSTRE5A605N20091107?sp=true |title=Chrysler dismantles electric car plans under Fiat |date=November 6, 2009 |first=Kevin |last=Krolicki |work=Reuters |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009, Chrysler took US$70 million in grants from the U.S. [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] to develop a test fleet of 220 [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] pickup trucks and minivans.

==Chrysler Defense==
The dedicated tank building division of Chrysler, this division was founded as the Chrysler Tank division in 1940, originally with the intention of providing another production line for the [[M2 Medium Tank]], so that the U.S. Army could more rapidly build up its inventory of the type. Its first plant was the [[Detroit Arsenal (Warren, Michigan)|Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant]]. When the M2A1 was unexpectedly declared obsolete in August of the same year, plans were altered (though not without considerable difficulty) to produce the [[M3 Lee#Development|M3 Grant]] instead, primarily for the British as part of the United States under the counter support for Great Britain against Nazi Germany (the U.S. not yet being formally in the war), with the balance of the revised order going to the U.S. Army as the ''Lee''. After December 1941 and the United States' entry into the war against the Axis powers, the Tank division rapidly expanded, with new facilities such as the [[Packard Proving Grounds|Tank Arsenal Proving Ground]] at (then) [[Utica, Michigan]]. It also quickly widened the range of products it was developing and producing, including the [[M4 Sherman#U.S. design prototype|M4 Sherman tank]] and the [[Chrysler A57 multibank]] tank engine.

==Special programs==
During World War II, essentially all of Chrysler's facilities were devoted to building military vehicles (the [[Jeep]] brand came later, after Chrysler acquired [[American Motors Corporation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_djEK2wqmAIC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=Multi-auto+Tank+Engine+Designed+and+Developed+by+Central+Engineering |page=192 |title=The Birth of Chrysler Corporation and Its Engineering Legacy |first=Carl |last=Breer |first2=Anthony J. |last2=Yanik |year=1992 |publisher= SAE International |isbn=978-1-56091-524-9 |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also designing V12 and V16 hemi-engines producing {{convert|2500|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} for airplanes, but they did not make it into production as [[jet engine|jets]] were developed and were seen as the future for air travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.allpar.com/mopar/hemi/chrysler-hemi.html |title=The Original Chrysler Hemi Engine |publisher=Allpar.com |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s [[Cold War]] period, Chrysler [[Chrysler air raid siren|made air raid sirens]] powered by its Hemi V-8 engines.

===Radar antennas===
When the [[Radiation Laboratory]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] was established in 1941 to develop [[microwave radar]]s, one of the first projects resulted in the [[SCR-584]], the most widely recognized radar system of the war era. This system included a [[parabolic antenna]] six feet in diameter that was mechanically aimed in a helical pattern (round and round as well as up and down).

One of Chrysler's most significant contributions to the war effort was not in the field of vehicles but in the radar field. For the final production design of this antenna and its highly complex drive mechanism, the Army's [[Signal Corps Laboratories]] turned to Chrysler's Central Engineering Office. There, the parabola was changed from aluminum to steel, allowing production forming using standard automotive presses. To keep weight down, 6,000 equally spaced holes were drilled in the face (this had no effect on the radiation pattern). The drive mechanism was completely redesigned, using technology derived from Chrysler's research in automotive gears and differentials. The changes resulted in improved performance, reduced weight, and easier maintenance. A large portion of the Dodge plant was used in building 1,500 of the SCR-584 antennas as well as the vans used in the systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Stout |first=Wesley W. |title=The Great Detective |publisher=Chrysler Corporation |year=1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Colton |first=Roger B. |title=Radar in the United States Army |publisher=Proceedings of the I.R.E. |volume=33 |pages=740–753 |year=1947 |url=http://cecom.army.mil/historian/docdisp.php?fname=RadarintheUSArmy_byRogerColton.pdf&amp;dirname=Radar |accessdate=April 28, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625022825/http://cecom.army.mil/historian/docdisp.php?fname=RadarintheUSArmy_byRogerColton.pdf&amp;dirname=Radar |archivedate=June 25, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aircraft===
* [[Chrysler VZ-6]]

===Missiles===
In April 1950, the U.S. Army established the Ordnance Guided Missile Center (OGMC) at [[Redstone Arsenal]], adjacent to [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. To form OGMC, over 1,000 civilian and military personnel were transferred from [[Fort Bliss, Texas]]. Included was a group of German scientists and engineers led by [[Wernher von Braun]]; this group had been brought to America under [[Project Paperclip]]. OGMC designed the Army's first [[short-range ballistic missile]], the [[PGM-11 Redstone]], based on the WWII German [[V-2]] missile. Chrysler established the Missile Division to serve as the Redstone prime contractor, setting up an engineering operation in Huntsville and for production obtaining use from the U.S. Navy of a large plant in [[Sterling Heights, Michigan]]. The Redstone was in active service from 1958 to 1964; it was also the first missile to test-launch a live [[nuclear weapon]], first detonated in a 1958 test in the South Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;Bullard, John W.; &quot;History Of The Redstone Missile System,&quot; Historical Monograph Project Number: AMC 23 M. Historical Division, Army Missile Command&lt;/ref&gt;

Working together, the Missile Division and von Braun's team greatly increased the capability of the Redstone, resulting in the [[PGM-19 Jupiter]], a [[medium-range ballistic missile]]. In May 1959, a Jupiter missile launched two small monkeys into space in a [[nose cone]]; this was America's first successful flight and recovery of live space payloads. Responsibility for deploying Jupiter missiles was transferred from the Army to the Air Force; armed with [[nuclear warheads]], they were first deployed in [[Italy]] and [[Turkey]] during the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Fact Sheet: Chrysler SM-78/PGM-19 Jupiter |publisher=National Museum of the U.S. Air Force |url=http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=534 |date=May 14, 2009 |accessdate=April 1, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407094736/http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=534 |archivedate=April 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space boosters===
In July 1959, [[NASA]] chose the [[Redstone missile]] as the basis for the [[Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle]] to be used for suborbital test flights of the [[Project Mercury]] spacecraft. Three unmanned MRLV launch attempts were made between November 1960 and March 1961, two of which were successful. The MRLV successfully launched the chimpanzee [[Ham the Chimp|Ham]], and astronauts [[Alan Shepard]] and [[Gus Grissom]] on three suborbital flights in January, May and July 1961, respectively.

America's more ambitious manned space travel plans included the design of the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn series]] of heavy-lift launch vehicles by a team headed by [[Wernher von Braun]]. Chrysler's Huntsville operation, then designated the Space Division, became [[Marshall Space Flight Center]]'s prime contractor for the first stage of the [[Saturn I]] and [[Saturn IB]] versions. The design was based on a cluster of Redstone and [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter]] fuel tanks, and Chrysler built it for the [[Apollo program]] in the [[Michoud Assembly Facility]] in East New Orleans, one of the largest manufacturing plants in the world. Between October 1961 and July 1975, NASA used ten Saturn Is and nine Saturn IBs for suborbital and orbital flights, all of which were successful;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/sp4206.htm|title=Stages to Saturn: A Technological History of the Apollo/Saturn Launch Vehicles NASA SP-4206|last=Bilstein|first=Roger E.|year=1980|isbn=0-16-048909-1|access-date=March 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysler missiles and boosters never suffered a launch failure.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} The division was also a subcontractor which modified one of the [[mobile launcher platform]]s for use with the Saturn IB rockets using Saturn V infrastructure.
