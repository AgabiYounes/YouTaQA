The '''Epistle of Paul to Titus''', usually referred to simply as '''Titus''', is one of the three [[pastoral epistles]] (along with [[First Epistle to Timothy|1 Timothy]] and [[Second Epistle to Timothy|2 Timothy]]) in the [[New Testament]], historically attributed to [[Paul the Apostle]]. It is addressed to [[Saint Titus]] and describes the requirements and duties of elders and [[bishop]]s.&lt;ref name =&quot;Harris&quot;&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], ''Understanding the Bible''. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recipient==
Not mentioned in the [[Acts of the Apostles]], [[Saint Titus]] was noted in [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] (cf. Gal. 2:1, 3) where Paul wrote of journeying to Jerusalem with [[Barnabas]], accompanied by Titus. He was then dispatched to [[Corinth]], Greece, where he successfully reconciled the Christian community there with Paul, its founder. Titus was later left on the island of Crete to help organize the Church, and later met back with the Apostle Paul in [[Nicopolis]]. He soon went to [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] (now Croatia). According to [[Eusebius]] of [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] in the [[Church History (Eusebius)|''Ecclesiastical History'']], he served as the first bishop of [[Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius]], ''[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm Church History]'' III.4&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in Cortyna ([[Gortyn|Gortyna]]), Crete; his head was later removed to Venice during the invasion of Crete by the [[Saracens]] in 832 and was enshrined in [[St Mark's Basilica]], Venice, Italy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Opposed to Pauline authenticity===
Titus, along with the two other [[Pastoral epistles|pastoral epistles]] ([[First Epistle to Timothy|1 Timothy]] and [[Second Epistle to Timothy|2 Timothy]]), is regarded by the large majority of scholars as being [[Pseudepigraphy|pseudepigraphical]].&lt;ref name=&quot;forged&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrman|first=Bart|title=Forged|url=https://archive.org/details/forgedwritinginn00ehrm|url-access=registration|date=2011|publisher=HarperOne|isbn=978-006-201262-3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/forgedwritinginn00ehrm/page/93 93–105]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of the language and content of the pastoral epistles, these scholars reject that they were written by Paul and believe that they were written by an anonymous forger after his death. Critics claim the vocabulary and style of the Pauline letters could not have been written by Paul according to available biographical information and reflect the views of the emerging Church rather than the apostle's. These scholars date the epistle from the 80s AD up to the end of the 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond E. Brown]]. ''An Introduction to the New Testament''. New York: Anchor Bible, p. 662&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Church of England]]'s [[Common Worship|Common Worship Lectionary Scripture Commentary]] concurs with this view: &quot;the proportioning of the theological and practical themes is one factor that leads us to think of these writings as coming from the post-Pauline church world of the late first or early second century&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Houlden and Rogerson|title=Common Worship Lectionary: a Scriptures Commentary|year=2001|publisher=SPCK|location=London|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Titus has a very close affinity with [[First Epistle to Timothy|1 Timothy]], sharing similar phrases and expressions and similar subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Paley]] ''Horae Paulinae'' (1785)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bart D. Ehrman]]. ''The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings'' 3rd ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 2004. pp. 385ff&lt;/ref&gt; This has led many scholars to believe that it was written by the same forger who wrote 1 and 2 Timothy— this author is sometimes referred to as &quot;the Pastor.&quot;&lt;ref name =HarrisPastoral&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. “The Pastoral Epistles“ p. 340–345&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional view: Pauline authenticity===
The minority of scholars who believe Paul wrote ''Titus'' date its composition from the circumstance that it was written after Paul's visit to [[Crete]] (Titus 1:5). That visit could not be the one referred to in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] 27:7, when Paul was on his voyage to Rome as a prisoner, and where he continued a prisoner for two years. Thus traditional [[exegesis]] supposes that after his release Paul sailed from Rome into Asia, passing Crete by the way, and that there he left [[Titus]] &quot;to set in order the things that were wanting.&quot; Thence he would have gone to [[Ephesus]], where he left Timothy, and from Ephesus to [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], where he wrote the ''First Epistle to Timothy'', and thence, according to the subscription of this epistle, to &quot;Nicopolis of Macedonia&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;It was written to Titus, ordained the first bishop of the church of the Cretians, from Nicopolis of Macedonia.&quot; —[[Authorized Version]] subscription after Titus 3:15
* Note: Sources that say [[Nicopolis]] was in [[Epirus]] are technically correct, but Epirus had become part of [[Macedonia (Roman province)]] in 146 BCE. In 110 CE under Trajan it became a province in its own right, separate from Macedonia and Achaia. The expression &quot;Nicopolis of Macedonia&quot; in Paul's timeframe is valid.&lt;/ref&gt; from which place he wrote to Titus, about 66 or 67.

[[File:Minuscule 699 GA folio 41v.jpg|thumb|220px|The first page of the epistle in [[Minuscule 699]] gives its title as '''προς τιτον'', &quot;To Titus.&quot;]]

Recent scholarship has revived the theory that Paul used an [[amanuensis]], or secretaries, in writing his letters (e.g. Rom 16:22), but possibly Luke for the pastorals&lt;ref&gt;George W. Knight, The Pastoral Epistles: A Commentary on the Greek Text, New International Greek Testament Commentary (Grand Rapids, MI; Carlisle, England: W.B. Eerdmans; Paternoster Press, 1992), 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William D. Mounce, Pastoral Epistles, vol. 46, Word Biblical Commentary (Dallas: Word, Incorporated, 2000), cxxix.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a common practice in ancient letter writing, even for the biblical writers.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, E. Randolph. Paul and First-Century Letter Writing: Secretaries, Composition and Collection. Downers Grove, IL; Leicester, England: InterVarsity Press; Apollos, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry Y. Gamble, “Amanuensis,” ed. David Noel Freedman, The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary (New York: Doubleday, 1992), 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epimenides paradox==
One of the [[secular]] peculiarities of the Epistle to Titus is the reference to the [[Epimenides paradox]]: &quot;One of the Cretans, a prophet of their own, said, 'Cretans are always liars'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref|Titus|1:12–13|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement by a member of a group that all members are liars is a famous [[logic problem]], applicable also to {{Bibleref|Psalms|116:11|ESV}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Psalms-116-11/|title=PSALMS 116:11 KJV &quot;I said in my haste, All men [are] liars.&quot;|website=www.kingjamesbibleonline.org|access-date=2020-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==False teachers==
In ''Titus 1:9'' Paul describes some among the [[Jewish Christians]] as false teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref|Titus|1:9–16|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = United Bible Societies| isbn = 978-0-8267-0168-8| last1 = Arichea| first1 = Daniel Castillo| last2 = Hatton| first2 = Howard| title = A handbook on Paul's letters to Timothy and to Titus| location = New York| date = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul describes the false teachers as rebellious, empty talkers who claim to teach the law &quot;without understanding&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref|1 Timothy|1:6|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and deceivers who deliberately lead the faithful astray.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = InterVarsity Press| isbn = 978-0-8308-1814-3| last = Towner| first = Philip H| title = 1–2 Timothy [and] Titus| location = Downers Grove (Ill.)| date = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin wrote that vain talking (Greek: mataiologia) is contrasted here with useful doctrine, including any trivial and frivolous doctrines that contribute nothing to [[piety]] and fear of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Printed for the Calvin Translation Society| last1 = Calvin| first1 = Jean| last2 = Calvin Translation Society| title = Calvin's commentaries ...| location = Edinburgh| date = 1844}}&lt;/ref&gt;
