      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''ergative case''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{smallcaps|'''erg'''}}) is the [[grammatical case]] that identifies the noun&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Loos|first=Eugene|title=Glossary of linguistic terms|url=http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOflinguisticTerms/WhatIsErgativeCase.htm|work=LinguaLinks Library 5.0 Plus|accessdate=September 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304190305/http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOflinguisticTerms/WhatIsErgativeCase.htm|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as a [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of a [[transitive verb]] in [[ergative–absolutive language]]s.

==Characteristics==
In such languages, the ergative case is typically [[Markedness|marked]] (most [[Salience (communication)|salient]]), while the [[absolutive case]] is unmarked. New work in [[Grammatical case|case theory]] has vigorously supported the idea that the ergative case identifies the agent (the intentful performer of an action) of a verb (Woolford 2004).

In [[Kalaallisut]] (Greenlandic) for example, the ergative case is used to mark subjects of transitive verbs and possessors of nouns.

[[Nez Perce language|Nez Perce]] has a three-way nominal case system with both ergative (''-nim'') and [[accusative]] (''-ne'') plus an absolute (unmarked) case for intransitive subjects: ''hipáayna qíiwn'' ‘the old man arrived’; ''hipáayna wewúkiye'' ‘the elk arrived’; ''wewúkiyene péexne qíiwnim'' ‘the old man saw an elk’.

[[Sahaptin language|Sahaptin]] has an ergative noun case (with suffix ''-nɨm'') that is limited to transitive constructions only when the direct object is 1st or 2nd person: ''iwapáatayaaš łmámanɨm'' ‘the old woman helped me’; ''paanáy iwapáataya łmáma'' ‘the old woman helped him/her’ (direct); ''páwapaataya łmámayin'' ‘the old woman helped him/her’ (inverse).

Other languages that use the ergative case are [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Chechen language|Chechen]], and other [[Caucasian languages]], [[Mayan languages]], [[Mixe–Zoque languages]], [[Wagiman language|Wagiman]] and other [[Australian Aboriginal languages]] as well as [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Burushaski]] and [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]]. Among all [[Indo-European languages]] only, [[Yaghnobi language|Yaghnobi]], [[Kurdish language]] varieties (including [[Kurmanji]], [[Zazaki]] and [[Sorani]]),&lt;ref&gt;Theodora Bynon. 1979. The Ergative Construction in Kurdish. ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'' Vol. 42, No. 2:211-224.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hindi]]/[[Urdu]], along with some other [[Indo-Aryan languages]], are ergative.

The ergative case is also a feature of some [[constructed language]]s such as [[Na'vi language|Na'vi]], [[Ithkuil]] and [[Black Speech]].
