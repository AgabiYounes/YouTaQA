'''Eubulides''' ({{lang-el|Εὑβουλίδης}}; fl. 4th century BCE) of [[Miletus]] was a [[philosopher]] of the [[Megarian school]], and a pupil of [[Euclid of Megara]].  He is famous for his [[paradox]]es.

==Life==
Eubulides was a pupil of [[Euclid of Megara]],&lt;ref name=&quot;diog1&quot;&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, ii. 108&lt;/ref&gt; the founder of the [[Megarian school]]. He was a contemporary of [[Aristotle]], against whom he wrote with great bitterness.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, ii. 109; Athenaeus, viii, 50 354c; Aristocles, in Eusebius ''[[Praeparatio Evangelica]]'' xv. 2&lt;/ref&gt; He taught logic to [[Demosthenes]],&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Vit. X Orat.''; Apuleius, ''Orat. de Mag.''; Photius, ''Bibliotheca'', 265&lt;/ref&gt; and he is also said to have taught [[Apollonius Cronus]], the teacher of [[Diodorus Cronus]], and the historian [[Euphantus]]. He may have been the author of a book about [[Diogenes of Sinope]].&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 20. However, there may be confusion with an unknown &quot;Eubulus&quot; who is mentioned as an author of work about Diogenes at vi. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paradoxes of Eubulides==
Eubulides is most famous for inventing the forms of seven famous [[paradoxes]],&lt;ref name=&quot;diog1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://philosophy.about.com/od/Philosophical-Questions-Puzzle/a/Paradoxes-Of-Eubulides.htm |title=Paradoxes of Eubulides |publisher=About.com (New York Times)  |author=Andrea Borghini |accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which, however, are also ascribed to [[Diodorus Cronus]]:&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, ii. 111&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Liar paradox|The Liar (''pseudomenos'') paradox]]:&lt;br&gt;A man says: &quot;What I am saying now is a [[lie]].&quot; If the statement is true, then he is lying, even though the statement is true. If the statement is a lie, then he is not actually lying, even though the statement is a lie. Thus, if the speaker is lying, he tells the truth, and vice versa.
# 
## The Masked Man (''enkekalymmenos'') paradox:&lt;br&gt;&quot;Do you know this masked man?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;But he is your father. So – do you not know your own father?&quot;
## The Electra (''Elektra'') paradox:&lt;br&gt;[[Electra]] doesn't know that the man approaching her is her brother, [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]].  Electra knows her brother.  Does Electra know the man who is approaching?
## The Overlooked Man (''dialanthanôn'') paradox:&lt;br /&gt;Alpha ignored the man approaching him and treated him as a stranger.  The man was his father.  Did Alpha ignore his own father and treat him as a stranger?
# 
## [[Sorites paradox|The Heap (''sôritês'') paradox]]:&lt;br&gt;A single grain of sand is certainly not a heap.  Nor is the addition of a single grain of sand enough to transform a non-heap into a heap: when we have a collection of grains of sand that is not a heap, then adding but one single grain will not create a heap. And yet we know that at some point we will have a heap.
## The Bald Man (''phalakros'') paradox:&lt;br&gt;A man with a full head of hair is obviously not bald.  Now the removal of a single hair will not turn a non-bald man into a bald one.  And yet it is obvious that a continuation of that process must eventually result in baldness.
# The Horns (''keratinês'') paradox:&lt;br&gt;What you have not lost, you have. But you have not lost horns. Therefore, you have horns.

The first paradox ([[Liar paradox|the Liar]]) is probably the most famous, and is similar to the famous paradox of [[Epimenides paradox|Epimenides the Cretan]]. The second, third and fourth paradoxes are variants of a single paradox and relate to the problem of what it means to &quot;know&quot; something and the identity of objects involved in an affirmation (compare the [[masked man fallacy]]).  The fifth and sixth paradoxes are also a single paradox and is usually thought to relate to the vagueness of language.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;This phenomenon at the heart of the [sorites] paradox is now recognised as the phenomenon of vagueness.&quot; {{cite SEP |url-id=sorites-paradox |title=Sorites Paradox |last=Hyde |first=Dominic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final paradox attacks presumptions involved in a proposition, and is related to the [[syllogistic fallacy]].

These paradoxes were very well known in ancient times, some are alluded to by Eubulides' contemporary [[Aristotle]]&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Sophistici Elenchi'', 24, 25, 22&lt;/ref&gt; and even partially by [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Euthydemus''&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Aulus Gellius]] mentions how the discussion of such paradoxes was considered (for him) after-dinner entertainment at the [[Saturnalia]],&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius, xviii. 2. 9&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], on the other hand, considered them a waste of time: &quot;Not to know them does no harm, and mastering them does no good.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''Epistles'', 45. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
