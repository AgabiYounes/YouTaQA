[[File:Ախալցխայի տարազ մանրամասն.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Gold embroidery on an ''gognots'' (apron) of a 19th-century [[Armenians|Armenian]] bridal dress from [[Akhaltsikhe]].]]

'''Embroidery''' is the [[craft]] of decorating [[Textile|fabric]] or other materials using a [[sewing needle|needle]] to apply [[yarn|thread or yarn]].

Embroidery may also incorporate other materials such as [[pearl]]s, [[bead]]s, [[quill]]s, and [[sequin]]s. In modern days, embroidery is usually seen on caps, hats, coats, blankets, dress shirts, denim, dresses, stockings, and [[golf shirt]]s. Embroidery is available with a wide variety of [[yarn|thread or yarn]] color.

Some of the basic techniques or [[Embroidery stitch|stitches]] of the earliest embroidery are [[chain stitch]], [[buttonhole stitch|buttonhole or blanket stitch]], [[running stitch]], [[satin stitch]], [[cross stitch]]. Those stitches remain the fundamental techniques of hand embroidery today.

=== Origins ===
The process used to tailor, patch, mend and reinforce cloth fostered the development of sewing techniques, and the decorative possibilities of sewing led to the art of embroidery.{{sfn|Gillow|Sentance|1999|p=12}} Indeed, the remarkable stability of basic embroidery stitches has been noted:

{{blockquote|It is a striking fact that in the development of embroidery ... there are no changes of materials or techniques which can be felt or interpreted as advances from a primitive to a later, more refined stage. On the other hand, we often find in early works a technical accomplishment and high standard of craftsmanship rarely attained in later times.&lt;ref&gt;Marie Schuette and Sigrid Muller-Christensen, ''The Art of Embroidery'' translated by Donald King, Thames and Hudson, 1964, quoted in {{harvnb|Netherton|Owen-Crocker|2005|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[The art of embroidery]] has been found worldwide and several early examples have been found. Works in China have been dated to the [[Warring States period]] (5th–3rd century BC).{{sfn|Gillow|Sentance|1999|p=178}} In a garment from [[Migration period]] Sweden, roughly 300–700 AD, the edges of bands of trimming are reinforced with running stitch, back stitch, stem stitch, tailor's buttonhole stitch, and whip-stitching, but it is uncertain whether this work simply reinforced the seams or should be interpreted as decorative embroidery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coatsworth&quot;&gt;Coatsworth, Elizabeth: &quot;Stitches in Time: Establishing a History of Anglo-Saxon Embroidery&quot;, in {{harvnb|Netherton|Owen-Crocker|2005|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient [[Greek mythology]] has credited the goddess [[Athena]] with passing down the art of embroidery along with [[weaving]], leading to the famed competition between herself and the mortal [[Arachne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art of Embroidery: History of Style and Technique|last=Synge|first=Lanto|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|year=2001|isbn=9781851493593|location=Woodbridge, England|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical applications and techniques ===
Depending on time, location and materials available, embroidery could be the domain of a few experts or a widespread, popular technique. This flexibility led to a variety of works, from the royal to the mundane.

Elaborately embroidered clothing, religious objects, and household items often were seen as a mark of wealth and status, as in the case of [[Opus Anglicanum]], a technique used by professional workshops and guilds in medieval [[England]].{{sfn|Levey|King|1993|p=12}} In 18th-century England and its colonies, samplers employing fine silks were produced by the daughters of wealthy families. Embroidery was a skill marking a girl's path into womanhood as well as conveying rank and social standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/ngv-embroidery-exhibition-imagine-a-12yearold-spending-two-years-on-this-20150324-1m699n.html |title=NGV embroidery exhibition: imagine a 12-year-old spending two years on this... |last=Power |first=Lisa |date=27 March 2015 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |access-date=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, embroidery is also a folk art, using materials that were accessible to nonprofessionals. Examples include [[Hardanger]] from Norway, [[Drawn thread work#Poltava-style drawnwork|Merezhka]]  from [[Ukraine]], [[Mountmellick embroidery]] from Ireland, [[Nakshi kantha]] from [[Bangladesh]] and [[West Bengal]], and [[Brazilian embroidery]]. Many techniques had a practical use such as [[Sashiko]] from [[Japan]], which was used as a way to reinforce clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Handa City Sashiko Program at the Society for Contemporary Craft|url=http://www.japansocietypa.org:80/event-2293412|website=Japan-America Society of Pennsylvania|accessdate=25 January 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705152304/http://www.japansocietypa.org/event-2293412|archivedate=5 July 2017|date=7 Oct 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seamwork.com/issues/2016/04/sashiko|title=Sashiko|website=Seamwork Magazine|publisher=Colette Media, LLC|language=en|access-date=2018-01-26|first=Kat|last=Siddle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While historically viewed as a pastime, activity, or hobby, intended just for women, embroidery has often been used as a form of biography. Women who were unable to access a formal education or, at times, writing implements, were often taught embroidery and utilized it as a means of documenting their lives. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=A. Mary|date=July 2003|title=The Theory and Practice of Counting Stitches as Stories: Material Evidences of Autobiography in Needlework|url=|journal=Women's Studies|volume=32|pages=641|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of documenting the histories of marginalized groups, especially women of color both within the United States and around the world, embroidery is a means of studying the every day lives of those whose lives largely went unstudied throughout much of history. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van der Merwe|first=Ria|date=November 2017|title=From a silent past to a spoken future.

[[File:Morocco Fez Embroidery Horse Cover.JPG|thumb|Morocco [[fly mask]] embroidery, 18th–19th century]]

Embroidery was an important art in the Medieval Islamic world. The 17th-century [[Turkish people|Turkish]] traveler [[Evliya Çelebi]] called it the &quot;craft of the two hands&quot;. Because embroidery was a sign of high social status in Muslim societies, it became widely popular. In cities such as [[Damascus]], [[Cairo]] and [[Istanbul]], embroidery was visible on [[handkerchief]]s, uniforms, flags, [[calligraphy]], shoes, [[robe]]s, tunics, horse trappings, slippers, sheaths, pouches, covers, and even on [[leather]] [[Belt (clothing)|belts]]. Craftsmen embroidered items with [[gold]] and [[silver]] thread. Embroidery cottage industries, some employing over 800 people, grew to supply these items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200703/the.skill.of.the.two.hands.htm |work=Saudi Aramco World |title=The Skill of the Two Hands |last=Stone |first=Caroline |date=May–June 2007 |volume=58 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, in the reign of the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]], his chronicler [[Abu al-Fazl ibn Mubarak]] wrote in the famous [[Ain-i-Akbari]]:
&quot;His majesty (Akbar) pays much attention to various stuffs; hence [[Iran]]i, [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], and [[Mongolia]]n articles of wear are in much abundance especially textiles embroidered in the patterns of ''Nakshi'', ''Saadi'', ''Chikhan'', ''Ari'', ''Zardozi'', ''Wastli'', ''Gota'' and ''Kohra''. The imperial workshops in the towns of [[Lahore]], [[Agra]], [[Fatehpur Sikri|Fatehpur]] and [[Ahmedabad]] turn out many masterpieces of workmanship in fabrics, and the figures and patterns, knots and variety of fashions which now prevail astonish even the most experienced travelers. Taste for fine material has since become general, and the drapery of embroidered fabrics used at feasts surpasses every description.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/201104/mughal.maal.htm |work=Saudi Aramco World |title=Mughal Maal |access-date=2011-08-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222152801/http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/201104/mughal.maal.htm |archive-date=2016-02-22 |url-status=live |last=Werner |first=Louis |date=July–August 2011 |volume=62 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Automation ===
[[File:Székely Land - Great Market Hall, 2014.09.12 (25).JPG|thumb|Hand-made embroidery – Székely Land, 2014]]
The development of machine embroidery and its [[mass production]] came about in stages during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The first embroidery machine was the [[hand embroidery machine]], invented in France in 1832 by Josué Heilmann.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://trc-leiden.nl/trc-needles/tools/embroidery/hand-embroidery-machine|title=Hand Embroidery Machine|last=Willem|website=trc-leiden.nl|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next evolutionary step was the [[schiffli embroidery machine]]. The latter borrowed from the sewing machine and the [[Jacquard machine|Jacquard loom]] to fully automate its operation. The manufacture of [[St. Gallen Embroidery|machine-made embroideries]] in [[St. Gallen]] in eastern Switzerland flourished in the latter half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Röllin, Peter. ''Stickerei-Zeit, Kultur und Kunst in St. Gallen 1870–1930''. VGS Verlagsgemeinschaft, St. Gallen 1989, {{ISBN|3-7291-1052-7}} (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;  Both St. Gallen, Switzerland and [[Plauen|Plauen, Germany]] were important centers for machine embroidery and embroidery machine development.  Many Swiss and Germans immigrated to [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson county, New Jersey]] in the early twentieth century and developed a machine embroidery industry there.  Shiffli machines have continued to evolve and are still used for industrial scale embroidery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Machine_Made_Embroideries.html?id=3qkQAQAAMAAJ|title=Machine Made Embroideries|last=Schneider|first=Coleman|date=1968|publisher=Globe Lithographing Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==
[[File:EMBROIDERED EGGS BY I FOROSTYUK.jpg|thumb|decorated [[Easter egg]]s. Works by Inna Forostyuk, the folk master from the [[Luhansk]] region ([[Ukraine]])]]
[[File:Japanese embroidery on festival cart.jpg|thumb|Japanese free embroidery in silk and metal threads, contemporary.]]
[[File:Hardanger embroidery.png|thumb|[[Hardanger embroidery|Hardanger]], a [[whitework]] technique. Contemporary.]]
Embroidery can be classified according to what degree the design takes into account the nature of the base material and by the relationship of stitch placement to the fabric. The main categories are free or surface embroidery, counted embroidery, and needlepoint or canvas work.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|url =http://www.needlenthread.com/2016/10/needlework-terminology-surface-embroidery.html|title =Needlework Terminology: Surface Embroidery|last =Corbet|first =Mary|date =October 3, 2016|access-date =November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In free or surface embroidery, designs are applied without regard to the weave of the underlying fabric.  Examples include [[crewel embroidery|crewel]] and traditional Chinese and Japanese embroidery.

[[Counted-thread embroidery]] [[patterns]] are created by making stitches over a predetermined number of threads in the foundation fabric. Counted-thread embroidery is more easily worked on an [[even-weave]] foundation fabric such as embroidery [[canvas]], [[aida cloth]], or specially woven [[cotton]] and [[linen]] fabrics. Examples include [[cross-stitch]] and some forms of [[blackwork embroidery]].

While similar to counted thread in regards to technique, in [[canvas work]] or [[needlepoint]], threads are stitched through a fabric mesh to create a dense pattern that completely covers the foundation fabric.{{sfn|Gillow|Sentance|1999|p=198}} Examples of canvas work include [[Bargello (needlework)|bargello]] and [[Berlin wool work]].

Embroidery can also be classified by the similarity of appearance. In [[drawn thread work]] and [[cutwork]], the foundation fabric is deformed or cut away to create holes that are then embellished with embroidery, often with thread in the same color as the foundation fabric. When created with white thread on white linen or cotton, this work is collectively referred to as [[whitework]].{{sfn|Readers Digest|1979|pp=74–91}} However, whitework can either be counted or free. [[Hardanger embroidery]] is a counted embroidery and the designs are often geometric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Yvette Stanton|title= Early Style Hardanger|publisher=Vetty Creations|isbn=978-0-9757677-7-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, styles such as [[Broderie anglaise]] are similar to free embroidery, with floral or abstract designs that are not dependent on the weave of the fabric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Catherine Amoroso Leslie|title=Needlework Through History: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lEiGeSLKLjMC&amp;pg=PA58|accessdate=13 September 2013|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33548-8|pages=34, 226, 58}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cross stitch embroidery.jpg|thumb|Tea-cloth, [[Hungary]], mid-20th century]]

== Materials ==
[[File:Patiala Phulkari.jpg|thumb| [[Phulkari]] from the [[Punjab region]] of India. Phulkari embroidery, popular since at least the 15th century, is traditionally done on hand-spun cotton cloth with simple darning stitches using silk floss.]]
[[File:Bayeux Tapestry scene55 Eustach.jpg|thumb|upright|Laid threads, a surface technique in wool on linen. The [[Bayeux Tapestry]], 11th century.]]

The fabrics and yarns used in traditional embroidery vary from place to place. [[Wool]], [[linen]], and [[silk]] have been in use for thousands of years for both fabric and yarn. Today, [[embroidery thread]] is manufactured in [[cotton]], [[rayon]], and [[novelty yarn]]s as well as in traditional wool, linen, and silk. [[Ribbon]] embroidery uses narrow ribbon in silk or silk/[[organza]] blend ribbon, most commonly to create floral motifs.{{sfn|van Niekerk|2006}}

Surface embroidery techniques such as chain stitch and [[couching]] or laid-work are the most economical of expensive yarns; couching is generally used for [[Goldwork (embroidery)|goldwork]]. Canvas work techniques, in which large amounts of yarn are buried on the back of the work, use more materials but provide a sturdier and more substantial finished textile.{{sfn|Readers Digest|1979|pp=112–115}}

In both canvas work and surface embroidery an [[embroidery hoop]] or frame can be used to stretch the material and ensure even stitching tension that prevents pattern distortion. Modern canvas work tends to follow symmetrical counted stitching patterns with designs emerging from the repetition of one or just a few similar stitches in a variety of hues. In contrast, many forms of surface embroidery make use of a wide range of stitching patterns in a single piece of work.{{sfn|Readers Digest|1979|pp=1–19, 112–117}}

== Machine ==
[[File:Machine chain stitch.jpg|right|thumb|Commercial machine embroidery in [[chain stitch]] on a [[voile]] curtain, China, early 21st century.]]

Contemporary embroidery is stitched with a [[computer]]ized embroidery machine using patterns digitized with [[embroidery software]]. In [[machine embroidery]], different types of &quot;fills&quot; add texture and design to the finished work. [[Machine embroidery]] is used to add [[logo]]s and [[monogram]]s to business shirts or jackets, gifts, and team apparel as well as to decorate household linens, draperies, and decorator fabrics that mimic the elaborate hand embroidery of the past.

Machine embroidery is most typically done with [[Rayon|rayon thread]], although [[Polyester|polyester thread]] can also be used. [[Cotton]] thread, on the other hand, is prone to breaking and should be avoided if under 30 [[Thread (yarn)#Wt and Gunze count|wt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.threadsmagazine.com/2008/11/02/choosing-machine-embroidery-threads|title=Choosing Machine-Embroidery Threads|last=|first=|date=2008-11-02|work=Threads Magazine|access-date=2018-11-27|publisher=The Taunton Press, Inc|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been a development in free hand machine embroidery, new machines have been designed that allow for the user to create free-motion embroidery which has its place in textile arts, quilting, dressmaking, home furnishings and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Using logo embroidery|url=http://www.schilder-pixner.at/stickerei/ |publisher=Oekaki Renaissance |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can use the embroidery software to digitize the digital embroidery designs. These digitized design are then transferred to the embroidery machine with the help of a flash drive and then the embroidery machine embroiders the selected design onto the fabric.

== Resurgence of hand embroidery ==
In the last couple of years{{When|date=February 2020}} there has been an exponential growth in the popularity of embroidering by hand. As a result of visual media such as Pinterest and Instagram, artists are able to share their work more extensively, which has inspired younger generations to pick up needle and threads. 

Contemporary embroidery artists believe hand embroidery has grown in popularity as a result of an increasing need for relaxation and digitally disconnecting practises&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lekadre.com/embroidery-modern-art-form/|title=History of embroidery and its rise in popularity|last=Elin|date=2019-06-11|website=Charles and Elin|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Along with technological advancements and social media, people are getting more aware of the need for digital detox and hand embroidery (just like other hand work such as [[knitting]] and [[Crochet|crocheting]]) allows for that. 

Modern hand embroidery, as opposed to [[Cross-stitch|cross-stitching]], is characterised by a more &quot;liberal&quot; approach. Where stitches are more freely combined in unconventional ways to create various textures and designs.

== Qualifications ==
City and Guilds qualification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityandguilds.com/qualifications-and-apprenticeships/creative#fil=uk&amp;acc=11820-creativetechniques|title=Creative|publisher=City &amp; Guilds}}&lt;/ref&gt; in embroidery allows embroiderers to become recognized for their skill. This qualification also gives them the credibility to teach. For example, the notable textiles artist, [[Kathleen Laurel Sage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kathleenlaurelsage.co.uk/a-little-about-me/|title=A Little About Me|work=Kathleen Laurel Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt; began her teaching career by getting the City and Guilds Embroidery 1 and 2 qualifications.
