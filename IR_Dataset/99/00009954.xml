== Origins and history ==
{{Further|History of the Eurovision Song Contest}}

As a [[Effects of World War II|war-torn Europe]] was rebuilding itself in the 1950s, the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) — based in Switzerland — set up an ad hoc committee to search for ways of bringing together the countries of the EBU around a &quot;light entertainment programme&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bristol&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Singing out loud and proud|date=17 May 2005|publisher=[[Daily Mail and General Trust]]|work=[[Bristol Evening Post]]|author=Staff|quote=In the mid-1950s, the members of the European Broadcasting Union set up an ad hoc committee to investigate ways of rallying the countries of Europe round a light entertainment programme. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) was formed on 12 February 1950 by 23 broadcasting organisations from Europe and the Mediterranean at a conference in Devon, United Kingdom. It was on 6 June 1954, that Montreux became the venue for the first transmission by the EBU's Eurovision Network of the Narcissus Festival and its flower-bedecked procession floats. At Monaco, in late January 1955, this committee, chaired by Marcel Bezençon, director general of Swiss Television, came up with the idea of creating a song contest, inspired by the very popular San Remo Festival. The idea was approved by the EBU General Assembly in Rome on 19 October 1955, and it was decided that the first &quot;Eurovision Grand Prix&quot; – so baptised, incidentally, by a British journalist – would take place in spring 1956 at Lugano, Switzerland.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a committee meeting held in Monaco in January 1955 with [[Marcel Bezençon]] of the Swiss television as chairman, the committee conceived the idea (initially proposed by [[Sergio Pugliese]] of the Italian television [[RAI]]) of an international song contest where countries would participate in one television programme to be transmitted simultaneously across all countries of the union.&lt;ref name=&quot;bristol&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GoldenJubilee&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Patrick |last=Jaquin |date=1 December 2004 |url=http://www.ebu.ch/en/union/diffusion_on_line/television/tcm_6-8971.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040811033906/http://www.ebu.ch/en/union/diffusion_on_line/television/tcm_6-8971.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 August 2004 |title=Eurovision's Golden Jubilee |publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |accessdate=18 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition was based upon the existing [[Sanremo Music Festival]] held in Italy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[BBC Online]] |year=2003 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/eurovision/2003/history |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224074456/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/eurovision/2003/history/ |archivedate=24 December 2007 |title=History of Eurovision |accessdate=20 July 2006 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was seen as a technological experiment in [[live television]]. In those days it was a very ambitious project to join many countries together in a wide-area international network. Satellite television did not exist and the [[Eurovision Network]] comprised a terrestrial [[Microwave radio relay|microwave network]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EBU40years&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=George T. |last=Waters |date=Winter 1994 |url=http://www.ebu.ch/en/technical/trev/trev_262-editorial.html |title=Eurovision: 40 years of network development, four decades of service to broadcasters |publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |accessdate=15 July 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627213443/http://www.ebu.ch/en/technical/trev/trev_262-editorial.html |archivedate=27 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept, then known as &quot;Eurovision Grand Prix&quot;, was approved by the EBU General Assembly in a meeting held in Rome on 19 October 1955, and it was decided that the first contest would take place in spring 1956 in Lugano, Switzerland.&lt;ref name=&quot;bristol&quot; /&gt; The name &quot;Eurovision&quot; was first used in relation to the EBU's network by British journalist George Campey in the London ''[[Evening Standard]]'' in 1951.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoldenJubilee&quot;/&gt;

The first contest was held in the town of [[Lugano]], Switzerland, on 24 May 1956. Seven countries participated—each submitting two songs, for a total of 14. This was the only contest in which more than one song per country was performed: since 1957 all contests have allowed one entry per country. The [[Eurovision Song Contest 1956|1956 contest]] was won by the host nation, Switzerland.&lt;ref name=&quot;milestones&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |year=2005 |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/english/611.htm |title=Historical Milestones |accessdate=26 May 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526065558/http://www.eurovision.tv/english/611.htm |archivedate=26 May 2006 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Naming ===

The contest was first known as the &quot;Eurovision Grand Prix&quot; (in English). This &quot;Grand Prix&quot; name was adopted by Germany, Denmark, Norway and the [[Francophone countries]], with the French designation being ''{{lang|fr|Le Grand-Prix Eurovision de la Chanson Européenne}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Franck |last=Thomas |year=1999 |url=http://www.eurovision-fr.net/histoire/histoire5659.php  |title=Histoire 1956 à 1959 |publisher=eurovision-fr.net |accessdate=17 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502192602/http://www.eurovision-fr.net/histoire/histoire5659.php |archivedate=2 May 2006 |language=fr }}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Grand Prix&quot; was dropped in 1973 and replaced with'' {{lang|fr|Concours}}'' (contest) in French and in 2001 with the English name in German, but not in Danish or [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. The [[Eurovision (network)|Eurovision network]] is used to carry many news and sports programmes internationally, among other specialised events organised by the EBU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |date=14 June 2005 |url=http://www.ebu.ch/departments/operations/ops.php |title=The EBU Operations Department |accessdate=20 July 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060717185857/http://www.ebu.ch/departments/operations/ops.php |archivedate=17 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the minds of the public, the name &quot;Eurovision&quot; is most closely associated with the Song Contest.&lt;ref name=&quot;EBU40years&quot;/&gt;

== Format ==

The format of the contest has changed over the years, though the basic tenets have always been thus: participant countries submit original songs, performed live on a television programme broadcast across the Eurovision Network by the EBU simultaneously to all countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3712029.stm | work=BBC News | title=Voting fault hits Eurovision heat | date=13 May 2004 | accessdate=2 May 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411121135/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3712029.stm | archive-date=11 April 2012 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; A &quot;country&quot; as a participant is represented by one television broadcaster from that country: typically, but not always, that country's national [[public broadcasting|public broadcasting organisation]]. The programme is hosted by one of the participant countries, and the programme is broadcast from the [[auditorium]] in the host city. During this programme, after all the songs have been performed, the countries then proceed to cast votes for the other countries' songs: nations are not allowed to vote for their own song.&lt;ref name=&quot;2009rules&quot;/&gt; At the end of the programme, the song with the most points is declared as the winner. The winner receives, simply, the prestige of having won—although it is usual for a [[trophy]] to be awarded to the winning songwriters, and the winning country is formally invited to host the event the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;milestones&quot;/&gt;

The programme is invariably opened by one or more presenters, welcoming viewers to the show. Between the songs and the announcement of the voting, an interval act is performed.

As national broadcasters join and leave the [[Eurovision (network)|Eurovision]] feed transmitted by the EBU, the EBU/Eurovision [[Station identification|network logo ident]] (not to be confused with the song contest logo) is displayed. The accompanying theme music (used on other Eurovision broadcasts) is the prelude to [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]]'s ''[[Te Deum (Charpentier)|Te Deum]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoldenJubilee&quot;/&gt; Originally, the same logo was used for both the Eurovision network and the European Broadcasting Union, however, they now have two different logos; when the ident is transmitted, it is the Eurovision network logo that appears.

Active members include media organisations, whose broadcasts are often made available to at least 98% of households in their own country which are equipped to receive such transmissions.&lt;ref name=&quot;EBUmembership&quot;/&gt;

If an EBU Active Member wishes to participate they must fulfil conditions as laid down by the rules of the contest. A separate copy is drafted annually. {{as of|2015}}, this included the necessity to have broadcast the previous year's programme within their country. After Russia's withdrawal from the 2017 event in Ukraine, and Channel 1 Russia's refusal to air the event, there is some confusion as to whether this rule still exists. C1R did enter a song in 2018, which was voted out of the competition at the semi-final.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-44074233|title=Eurovision 2018: Second semi-final sees Russia eliminated|last=Todd|first=Lucy|date=May 10, 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=June 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614162340/https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-44074233|archive-date=14 June 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common misconception is that Eurovision participants have to be from Europe. However, that's not true, any full EBU member is eligible for participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eurovoix.com/2018/11/23/eurovision-north-african-countries/|title=Jon Ola Sand: &quot;Participation of North African countries in Eurovision is possible|last1=Herbert|first1=Emily|date=23 November 2018|access-date=23 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401192528/https://eurovoix.com/2018/11/23/eurovision-north-african-countries/|archive-date=1 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, associate members are eligible for participation since Eurovision 2017, as long as the Eurovision Reference Group approves it (on a case by case basis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eurovoix.com/2016/10/19/esc17-wording-changes-regarding-associate-member-participation/|title=ESC'17: Wording changes regarding associate member participation|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|date=19 October 2016|access-date=23 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123201106/https://eurovoix.com/2016/10/19/esc17-wording-changes-regarding-associate-member-participation/|archive-date=23 November 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2019}}, Australia is the only associate member to have participated.

The broadcaster must have paid the EBU a participation fee in advance of the [[time limit|deadline]] specified in the rules of the contest for the year in which they wish to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/about/faq|title=FAQ - Eurovision Song Contest|website=eurovision.tv|access-date=2019-02-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190205044019/https://eurovision.tv/about/faq/|archive-date=5 February 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eligibility to participate is not determined by [[geography|geographic]] inclusion within the continent of Europe, despite the &quot;Euro&quot; in &quot;Eurovision&quot; – nor does it have any relation to the [[European Union]]. Several countries geographically outside the boundaries of Europe have competed: [[Israel]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Armenia]] in Western Asia (Cyprus is a member of the [[Council of Europe]] and a [[member state of the European Union]]), since [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1981|1981]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]] respectively; Australia since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work= Eurovision Song Contest |date= 10 February 2015 |url= http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=australia_to_participate_in_the_2015_eurovision_song_contest |title= Australia to compete in the 2015 Eurovision Song Contest |access-date= 10 February 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150210191207/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=australia_to_participate_in_the_2015_eurovision_song_contest |archive-date= 10 February 2015 |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Morocco, in North Africa, in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980 competition]] alone.

: &lt;small&gt;a) Before [[German reunification]] in 1990 Germany was presented once as 'West Germany' (at the 1976 contest). East Germany (the German Democratic Republic) never competed. At all other contests the country was presented as 'Germany' (and in 1967 as the 'Federal Republic of Germany').&lt;/small&gt;
: &lt;small&gt;b) The entries presented as being from &quot;[[Yugoslavia]]&quot; represented the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], except for the 1992 entry, which represented the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. This nation dissolved in 1991/92 into five independent states: Slovenia, Croatia, North Macedonia (as Macedonia/FYROM), Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia reconstituted itself as [[Serbia and Montenegro]] in 2003—entered the contest in 2004—and finally dissolved in 2006, making two separate states: Serbia and Montenegro; both of which made their début in the contest in 2007, the winner that year being Serbia.&lt;/small&gt;

However it was revealed in May 2015 that Australia might become a permanent participant following some reports by Jon Ola Sand to the [[Sveriges Television|Swedish broadcaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://escxtra.com/2015/05/21/australia-may-become-a-solid-participant-says-jos/|title=Australia: Australia may become a solid participant, says JOS|publisher=escXtra|last=Waddell|first=Nathan|accessdate=21 May 2015|date=21 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521212207/http://escxtra.com/2015/05/21/australia-may-become-a-solid-participant-says-jos/|archive-date=21 May 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, the EBU announced that Australia would return in 2016 and after this the country would become an effective participant in the contest.&lt;/small&gt;

Most of the expense of the contest is covered by [[Sponsor (commercial)|commercial sponsors]] and contributions from the other participating nations. The contest is considered to be a unique opportunity for promoting the host country as a tourist destination. In the summer of 2005, Ukraine abolished its normal visa requirement for visitors from the EU to coincide with its hosting of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Helen |last= Fawkes |work= [[BBC News Online]] |date= 19 May 2005 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4561275.stm |title= Ukrainian hosts' high hopes for Eurovision |accessdate= 19 July 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080412070715/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4561275.stm |archive-date= 12 April 2008 |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preparations for the event start a matter of weeks after the host wins in the previous year, and confirms to the EBU that they intend to—and have the capacity to—host the event.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} A host city is chosen—often a national or regional capital city—and a suitable concert venue is identified. The two largest concert venues were [[Parken Stadium|Parken]] in Copenhagen (which held approximately 38,000 people when Denmark hosted in 2001&lt;ref name=&quot;milestones&quot;/&gt;) and the [[Esprit Arena]] in Düsseldorf (which held approximately 36,500 people when Germany hosted in 2011). The smallest town to have been hosts was [[Millstreet]] in [[County Cork]], Ireland, in 1993. The village had a population of 1,500&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Republic of Ireland |url=http://www.ria.gov.ie/filestore/publications/English-CORK-_Millstreet-FINALISED.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908050648/http://www.ria.gov.ie/filestore/publications/English-CORK-_Millstreet-FINALISED.pdf |archivedate=8 September 2008 |title=General Information on Millstreet |accessdate=17 July 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;—although the [[Green Glens Arena]] venue could hold up to 8,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millstreet.ie/green%20glens/greenglens.htm|title=Green Glens Arena|work=[[Millstreet|Town of Millstreet]]|accessdate=19 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604045611/http://www.millstreet.ie/green%20glens/greenglens.htm|archive-date=4 June 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Host country ===

After the first two contests were hosted by Switzerland and Germany, it was decided that henceforth the winning country would host the contest the next year.&lt;ref name=&quot;milestones&quot;/&gt; The winner of the 1957 Contest was the Netherlands, and Dutch television accepted the responsibility of hosting in 1958. In all but five of the years since this rule has been in place, the winning country has hosted the show the following year. The exceptions are:

* {{ESCYr|1960}}—hosted by the [[BBC]] in London when the Netherlands declined due to expense. The UK was chosen to host because it had come second in 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;50yrs&quot;/&gt;
* {{ESCYr|1963}}—hosted by the BBC in London when France declined due to expense, as did second- and third-placed Monaco and Luxembourg when offered hosting duties.&lt;ref name=&quot;50yrs&quot;/&gt;
* {{ESCYr|1972}}—hosted by the BBC in [[Edinburgh]] when Monaco was unable to provide a suitable venue: [[Télé Monte Carlo|Monegasque television]] invited the BBC to take over due to its previous experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;50yrs&quot;/&gt;
* {{ESCYr|1974}}—hosted by the BBC in [[Brighton]] when Luxembourg declined due to expense. The BBC was becoming known as the host by default, if the winning country declined.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESC1974&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=290 |title=Eurovision Song Contest 1974 |accessdate=19 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605061122/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=290 |archivedate=5 June 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{ESCYr|1980}}—hosted by the [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]] in [[The Hague]] when Israel declined due to expense, having staged the {{ESCYr|1979}} event in Jerusalem, and the fact that the date chosen for the contest (19 April) was [[Yom Hazikaron|Israel's Remembrance Day]] that year. The Dutch offered to host the contest after several other broadcasters (including the BBC) were unwilling to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;50yrs&quot;/&gt; The reluctance of those national broadcasters to stage the contest were due to already having hosted the event during the past couple of years, in addition to the expense involved.

=== Eurovision logo and theme ===
[[File:Eurovision Song Contest logo.svg|thumb|right|Logo used in 2004–14]]

The former generic logo was introduced for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004 Eurovision Song Contest]] in Turkey, to create a consistent visual identity. The host country's flag appears in the heart of the generic logo. Each year of the contest, the host country creates a sub-theme which is usually accompanied and expressed with a sub-logo and slogan. The theme and slogan are announced by the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]] and the host country's national broadcaster.

The generic logo was revamped in 2014, ten years after the first generic logo was created. The revamped logo was conducted by lead designer Cornelis Jacobs and his team of Cityzen Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=eurovision_song_contest_logo_evolves|title=Eurovision Song Contest logo evolves|work=[[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]]|first=Jarmo|last=Siim|accessdate=31 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803055657/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=eurovision_song_contest_logo_evolves|archive-date=3 August 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logo was used for the first time in the [[2015 Eurovision Song Contest]], the 60th edition of the contest.

=== Slogans ===
Since the 2002 contest, slogans have been introduced in the show (2009 being the only exception). The slogan is decided by the host broadcaster and is then used to develop a visual design for the contest.

=== Eurovision Week ===

The term &quot;Eurovision Week&quot; is used to refer to the week during which the Contest takes place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7418045.stm | work=BBC News | title=Serbia in spotlight for Eurovision | date=23 May 2008 | accessdate=2 May 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421003937/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7418045.stm | archive-date=21 April 2010 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; As it is a live show, the Eurovision Song Contest requires the performers to have perfected their acts in rehearsals for the programme to run smoothly. In addition to rehearsals in their home countries, every participant is given the opportunity to rehearse on the stage in the Eurovision auditorium. These rehearsals are held during the course of several days before the Saturday show, and consequently the delegations arrive in the host city many days before the event. Journalists and fans are also present during the preceding days, and so the events of Eurovision last a lot longer than a few hours of television.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/about/in-depth/event-weeks|title=Event weeks - Eurovision Song Contest|website=eurovision.tv|access-date=2019-02-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180513002900/https://eurovision.tv/about/in-depth/event-weeks/|archive-date=13 May 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of officially accredited hotels are selected for the delegations to stay in, and shuttle-bus services are used to transport the performers and accompanying people to and from the contest venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |date=17 March 2008 |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news/belgrade-2008?id=587 |title=Belgrade 2008 |accessdate=19 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518160711/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news/belgrade-2008?id=587 |archivedate=18 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each participating broadcaster nominates a Head of Delegation, whose job it is to co-ordinate the movements of the delegate members, and who acts as that country's representative to the EBU in the host city.&lt;ref name=&quot;2005rules&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |year=2005 |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/searchfiles_english/574.htm |title=Rules of the 2005 Eurovision Song Contest |accessdate=10 February 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210010517/http://www.eurovision.tv/searchfiles_english/574.htm |archivedate=10 February 2006 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the delegations include performers, lyricists, composers, official press officers and—in the years where songs were performed with a live orchestra—a conductor. Also present if desired is a commentator: each broadcaster may supply their own commentary for their TV and/or radio feed, to be broadcast in each country. The commentators are given dedicated commentary booths situated around the back of the arena behind the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/story/commentator-s-guide-to-the-commentators|title=Commentator's guide to the commentators|accessdate=15 May 2011}}{{Better source|date=May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rehearsals and press conferences ===
[[File:Lena Oslo3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lena Meyer-Landrut|Lena]], representing Germany, performing [[Satellite (Lena Meyer-Landrut song)|Satellite]] during a rehearsal in 2010]]

Since 2004, the first rehearsals have commenced on the Sunday almost two weeks before the Grand Final. There are two rehearsal periods for each country. The countries taking part in the semi-finals have their first rehearsal over four days from the first Sunday to Wednesday. The second is from Thursday to Sunday. The countries which have already directly qualified for the Grand Final rehearse on the Saturday and Sunday.&lt;ref name=&quot;eurovision.tv&quot;&gt;[http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2012/RehearsalSchedule2012/_press_v1.1pdf]{{Dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2006ch Press Conference.jpg|thumb|left|Switzerland hosting a press conference at Eurovision 2006]]

After each country has rehearsed, the delegation meets with the show's production team in the viewing room. Here, they watch the footage of the rehearsal just performed. At this point the Delegation may make known any special requirements or changes needed for the performance, and request them to the host broadcaster. Following this meeting, the delegation hold a press conference where members of the accredited press may pose them questions.&lt;ref name=&quot;RehearsalSchedule&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|year=2008|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/media/ESC2008_rehearsals.pdf|title=Rehearsal Schedule|accessdate=19 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221010818/http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/media/ESC2008_rehearsals.pdf|archive-date=21 December 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rehearsals and press conferences are held in parallel; so one country holds its press conference, while the next one is in the auditorium rehearsing. A printed summary of the questions and answers which emerge from the press conferences is produced by the host press office, and distributed to journalists' [[Pigeon-hole messagebox|pigeon-holes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|year=2008|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/interviews-2008?id=944|title=Interviews 2008|accessdate=21 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517084933/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/interviews-2008?id=944|archive-date=17 May 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for the 2020 contest in Rotterdam, pigeon holes will not be used, in an effort to modernise the exchange of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/about/faq/|title=FAQ - Eurovision Song Contest|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurovision Song Contest|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before each of the semi-finals three dress rehearsals are held. Two rehearsals are held the day before (one in the afternoon and the other in the evening), while the third is held on the afternoon of the live event. Since tickets to the live shows are often scarce, tickets are also sold so the public may attend these dress rehearsals.

The same applies for the final, with two rehearsals on the Friday and the third on Saturday afternoon before the live transmission of the grand final on Saturday evening.&lt;ref name=&quot;RehearsalSchedule&quot;/&gt; For both semi-finals and for the final, the second dress rehearsal is also the ''Jury Final'', this is where the jury from each country casts their votes. This means that 50% of the result is already decided before the live contests have taken place.&lt;ref name=&quot;eurovision.tv&quot;/&gt;

=== Parties and Euroclub ===
[[File:Pht-Vugar Ibadov eurovision (35).jpg|thumb|The &quot;Euroclub&quot; in Baku, 2012]]

On the Monday evening of Eurovision Week, a ''Mayor's Reception'' is traditionally held, where the city administration hosts a celebration that Eurovision has come to their city. This is usually held in a grand municipally owned location in the city centre. All delegations are invited, and the party is usually accompanied by live music, complimentary food and drink and—in recent years—[[fireworks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AthensNews&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|date=11 May 2009|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=2560|title=The grand opening reception!|accessdate=19 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514022247/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=2560|archive-date=14 May 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the semi-final and grand final there are after-show parties, held either in a facility in the venue complex or in another suitable location within the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=2793|title=After Show Party: Reactions|accessdate=20 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714103810/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=2793|archive-date=14 July 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Euroclub'' is held every night of the week: this is a Eurovision-themed [[nightclub]], to which all accredited personnel are invited.&lt;ref name=&quot;Euroclub&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=2309|title=The EuroClub: Official party venue opened its doors|accessdate=18 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508232451/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=2309|archive-date=8 May 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the week many delegations have traditionally hosted their own parties in addition to the officially sponsored ones. However, in the new millennium the trend has been for the national delegations to centralise their activity and hold their celebrations in the Euroclub.&lt;ref name=&quot;Euroclub&quot;/&gt;

== Rules ==
{{further|Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest}}

Numerous detailed rules must be observed by the participating nations, and a new version is produced each year, for instance the rules specify various deadlines, including the date by which all the participating broadcasters must submit the final recorded version of their song to the EBU. The rules also cover sponsorship agreements and rights of broadcasters to re-transmit the show. The most notable rules which affect the format and presentation of the contest have changed over the years, and are highlighted here.

=== Live music ===

All vocals must be sung live; no voices are permitted on the backing tracks.&lt;ref name=&quot;2009rules&quot;/&gt; In 1999, [[Croatia in the Eurovision Song Contest 1999|the Croatian song]] performed by [[Doris Dragović]] and composed by [[Tonči Huljić]] featured sounds on their backing track which sounded suspiciously like human voices. The Croatian delegation stated that there were no human voices, but only digitally synthesised sounds which replicated vocals. The EBU nevertheless decided that they had broken the spirit of the rules, and docked them 33% of their points total that year for the purpose of calculating their five-year points average for future qualification.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESC1999&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=314|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1999|accessdate=21 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231130541/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=314|archive-date=31 December 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1956 until 1998, the host country was required to provide a live orchestra. Before 1973, all music had to be played by the host orchestra. From 1973 onwards, pre-recorded, non-vocal backing tracks were permitted—although the host country was still obliged to provide a live orchestra to give participants a choice. If a backing track was used, then all the instruments heard on the track were required to be present on the stage. In 1997 this requirement was dropped.&lt;ref name=&quot;50yrs&quot;/&gt;

In 1999 the requirement for a live orchestra was removed: it was left as an optional contribution.&lt;ref name=&quot;1999rules&quot;/&gt; The host that year, Israel's [[Israel Broadcasting Authority|IBA]], decided not to use an orchestra to save expenses, and thus 1999 was the first year when all the songs were played as pre-recorded backing tracks (in conjunction with live vocals).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

=== Language ===
{{Main|Languages in the Eurovision Song Contest}}

Each submission must have vocals; purely instrumental music has never been allowed. In the past, competitors have been required to sing in one of their own national languages, but this rule has been changed several times over the years. From 1956 until 1965, there was no rule restricting the languages in which the songs could be sung. In 1966, a rule was imposed stating that the songs must be performed in one of the official languages of the country participating, after Sweden was the first country to not sing in their own language, with opera singer [[Ingvar Wixell]] performing [[Absent Friend|Sweden's 1965 entry]] in English.&lt;ref name=&quot;milestones&quot;/&gt; The Swedish-language version of the song was originally selected at [[Melodifestivalen 1965]], but it was later translated into English for the Eurovision contest.

The language restriction continued until 1973, when performers were again allowed to sing in any language they wished.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESC1973&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=289|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1973|accessdate=21 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523025310/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=289|archive-date=23 May 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several winners in the mid-1970s took advantage of this: performers from non-English-speaking countries sang in English, including [[ABBA]] in 1974. In 1977, the EBU decided to revert to the national language restriction. However, special dispensation was given to Germany and Belgium as their national selections had already taken place before the decision was made; both countries' entries that year were in English.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESC1977&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=293|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1977|accessdate=21 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220022054/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=293|archive-date=20 February 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the rule was changed again to allow the choice of language once more, which resulted in 12 out of 23 countries, including the United Kingdom, [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|singing in English that year]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ESC1999&quot;/&gt; Belgium entered the 2003 contest with &quot;[[Sanomi]]&quot;, a song sung in a [[constructed language]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ArtificialLanguages&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=554|title=Ishtar for Belgium to Belgrade!|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|first=Andreas|last=Schacht|date=9 March 2008|accessdate=19 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603193358/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=554|archive-date=3 June 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; finishing in second place. In 2006, the Dutch entry, &quot;[[Amambanda]]&quot;, was sung partly in English and partly in an artificial language.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArtificialLanguages&quot;/&gt; In 2008, the Belgian entry, &quot;[[O Julissi]]&quot;, was sung in an artificial language.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArtificialLanguages&quot;/&gt; In 2011, the Norwegian entry, &quot;[[Haba Haba]]&quot;, which was sung in English and [[Swahili language|Swahili]], was the first song to be sung in an African language, apart from Arabic.&lt;ref name=&quot;AfricanLanguage&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/16749|title=Norway sends Stella Mwangi to Eurovision 2011|website=EscToday.com|first=Victor|last=Hondal|date=12 February 2011|accessdate=19 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215135659/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/16749|archive-date=15 February 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the language rule was abolished in 1999, songs in English have become increasingly common. In 2016, all but three out of 36 semi-finalists had songs in English, with only two (Bosnia and Herzegovina and North Macedonia) performing songs in their native languages, as Austria sent a song in French. In the final, all but three out of 26 contestants had songs in English. After [[Salvador Sobral]]'s win in 2017 with a Portuguese-language song, the 2018 edition saw a significant increase in the use of native languages, with twelve of 43 participants singing in their country's native language (not including Estonia, whose representative opted to sing in Italian).&lt;ref name=EN&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.euronews.com/2018/05/09/english-song-dominance-on-the-decline-at-eurovision-2018|title=English song dominance on the decline at Eurovision 2018|first1=Antonio|last1=Silva|first2=Chris|last2=Harris|website=[[Euronews]]|date=10 May 2018|access-date=5 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2019, nine of the songs were performed totally in different languages, while four others mixed English with their native languages.&lt;ref name=ESClang&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/story/eurovision-class-of-2019-languages|title=Eurovision Class of 2019: This year's languages|publisher=Eurovision Song Contest|date=5 April 2019|access-date=5 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voting ===
{{further|Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest}}

The voting system used in the contest has changed over the years. The current system has been in place since 2016, and is a [[positional voting system]]. Each country awards two sets of 12, 10, 8–1 points to their 10 favourite songs: one from their professional jury of votes of five music professionals and the other from televoting.&lt;ref name=&quot;2016 voting&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=biggest_change_to_eurovision_song_contest_voting_since_1975|title=Biggest change to Eurovision Song Contest voting since 1975|date=18 February 2016|accessdate=20 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003180415/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=biggest_change_to_eurovision_song_contest_voting_since_1975|archive-date=3 October 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, a country's votes were decided by an internal jury, but in 1997 five countries (Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom) experimented with [[televoting]], giving members of the public in those countries the opportunity to vote ''en masse'' for their favourite songs. The experiment was a success,&lt;ref name=&quot;50yrs&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = O'Connor | first = John Kennedy | year = 2005 | title = The Eurovision Song Contest 50 Years The Official History | publisher = Carlton Books Limited | location = London|isbn = 978-1-84442-586-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1998 onwards all countries were encouraged to use televoting wherever possible. Back-up juries are still used by each country, in the event of a televoting failure. Nowadays members of the public may also vote by SMS, in addition to televoting.

==== Scrutineers and executive supervisors ====
Since 1964 the voting has been presided over by the EBU [[scrutineer]], who is responsible for ensuring that all points are allocated correctly and in turn. Since 2011, the Executive Supervisor was supported by an Event Supervisor, to oversee and coordinate all event-related matters on behalf of the EBU. Sietse Bakker served in the role for the first six years, replaced by Nadja Burkhardt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Supervisors&quot;/&gt;

The following are the scrutineers and Executive Supervisors of the Eurovision Song Contest appointed by the EBU:&lt;ref name=&quot;Supervisors&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/about/organisers/executive-supervisor|title=Executive Supervisor - Eurovision Song Contest|website=eurovision.tv|accessdate=19 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190419221638/https://eurovision.tv/about/organisers/executive-supervisor|archive-date=19 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Presentation of votes ====
[[File:Eurovision 2004 Scoreboard.jpg|right|thumb|Electronic scoreboard, as [[Johnny Logan (singer)|Johnny Logan]] announces the Irish votes in 2004]]

After the interval act is over, when all the points have been calculated, the presenter(s) of the show call upon each voting country in turn to invite them to announce the results of their vote. Prior to 1994 the announcements were made over [[telephone line]]s; with the audio being piped into the auditorium for the audience to hear, and over the television transmission. However, since and including 1994 the announcements have been presented visually. Often the opportunity is taken by each country to show their spokesperson standing in front of a backdrop which includes a famous place in that country. For example, the French spokesperson might be seen standing in front of the [[Eiffel Tower]] or an Italian presenter might be seen with the [[Colosseum]] in the background. 

From 1994 to 1999, some countries did not have their spokesperson in front of a backdrop of a famous place, instead opting to show the spokesperson in the studio or in a famous building, for example when Malta presented their votes from a hotel in the country in 1995, or have them standing behind a blurred image of the famous building or skyline. From the 2000s, new technology meant that the spokespersons could be standing behind a live video of a famous place in that country. There have also been occasions where the backdrop of the spokesperson is not a still image or video, but instead is a slideshow of multiple shots of many of that country's famous buildings. 

From 1957 to 1962, the participating countries were called in reverse order of the presentation of their songs, and from 1963 to 2003, they were called in the same order in which their songs had been presented (except for 1974). Since 2004, when semi-finals were introduced, the order of the countries' announcements of votes has changed; and the countries that did not make it to the final each year could also vote. In 2004, the countries were called in alphabetical order (according to their [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2|ISO codes]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |date=12 May 2004 |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/archive_2004/english/1098.htm |title=Eurovision 2004 – Voting Briefing |accessdate=7 May 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050507155415/http://www.eurovision.tv/archive_2004/english/1098.htm |archivedate=7 May 2005 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the votes from the non-qualifying semi-finalists were announced first, in their running order on the Thursday night; then the finalists gave their votes in their own order of performance. Between 2006 and 2010, like in 1974, a separate draw was held to determine the order in which countries would present their votes.&lt;ref name=&quot;2006draw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |date=21 March 2006 |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/english/2038.htm |title=Results from the draw |accessdate=27 May 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527003915/http://www.eurovision.tv/english/2038.htm |archivedate=27 May 2006 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2011 to 2015, the voting order was determined by the results of a jury the day before the final so as to create as much suspense as possible when the votes were revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=esctoday.com|date=11 May 2011|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/17435|title=Eurovision 2011: Voting order revealed!|access-date=6 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516140447/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/17435|archive-date=16 May 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2016, the first country to announce their votes is the country that hosted the previous year, while the last country to announce their votes is the current host.

From 1971 to 1973, each country sent two jurors, who were present at the contest venue (though the juries in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1972|1972]] were locked away in the Great Hall of [[Edinburgh Castle]]) and announced their votes as the camera was trained on them. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]] one of the Swiss jurors presented his votes with flamboyant gestures. This system was retired the next year.&lt;ref name=&quot;50yrs&quot;/&gt;

In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1956|1956]] no public votes were presented: a closed jury simply announced that Switzerland had won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=273|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1956|work=Eurovision.tv|access-date=19 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231055819/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=273|archive-date=31 December 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1957 to 1987, the points were displayed on a physical [[scoreboard]] to the side of the stage. As digital graphic technology progressed, the physical scoreboards were superseded in 1988 by an [[Computer graphics|electronic representation]] which could be displayed on the TV screen at the will of the programme's director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[BBC Online]] |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/eurovision/mymu/atoz.shtml |title=A to Z of Eurovision |accessdate=9 August 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427103610/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/eurovision/mymu/atoz.shtml |archivedate=27 April 2006 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the EBU decided to save time during the broadcast—much of which had been taken up with the announcement of every single point—because there was an ever-increasing number of countries voting.&lt;ref name=&quot;2006draw&quot;/&gt; Since then, votes from 1 to 7 from each country have been displayed automatically on screen and the remaining points (8, 10 and 12) are read out in ascending order by the spokesperson, culminating with the maximum 12 points. Countries must announce the country names and points in either English or French and the scores are repeated by the contest's presenters in the other language. For this reason, the expression ''{{lang|fr|douze points}}'' when the host or spokesperson states the top score in French is popularly associated with the contest throughout the continent.&lt;ref name=&quot;1999rules&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|date=13 October 1998|url=http://www.eurosong.net/archive/esc1999.pdf|title=Rules of the 44th Eurovision Song Contest, 1999|accessdate=18 July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723152907/http://www.eurosong.net/archive/esc1999.pdf|archive-date=23 July 2006|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2016, only the name of the top jury votegetter is announced, with the points awarded to the other 9 countries shown in an on-screen scoreboard during the announcement. In addition, only the jury points are announced by country.  The televoting results are announced in aggregate, from lowest-scoring country to highest. In the 2019 contest the televoting results were announced in aggregate in inverse standing order based on the jury votes; starting with Spain (7 points from the juries) and culminating in Sweden (239 points from the juries). After the winner has been announced, the televoting points from the country where the contest is watched from are briefly seen on screen.

==== Ties for first place ====

In {{ESCYr|1969}}, four of the sixteen countries taking part, France, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, all tied for first place with 18 points each. There was nothing in the rules to decide an outright winner, so all four were declared joint winners. This caused much discontent among most of the other participating countries, and mass walkouts were threatened. Finland, Norway, Sweden and Portugal did not participate in the 1970 Contest as a protest against the results of the previous year. This prompted the EBU to introduce a tie-break rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESC1969&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=286|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1969|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=23 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523004804/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=286|archive-date=23 May 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ESC1970&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=223|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1970|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=23 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231092150/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=223|archive-date=31 December 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current tie-break procedure was implemented in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016 contest]]. In the procedure, sometimes known as a [[Issues affecting the single transferable vote#Countback|countback]], if two (or more) countries tie, the song receiving more points from the televote is the winner. If the songs received the same number of televote points, the song that received at least one televote point from the greatest number of countries is the winner. If there is still a tie, a second tie-breaker counts the number of countries who assigned twelve televote points to each entry in the tie. Tie-breaks continue with ten points, eight points, and so on until the tie is resolved. If the tie cannot be resolved after the number of countries which assigned one point to the song is equal, the song performed earlier in the running order is declared the winner, unless the host country performed earlier (in which case the song performed later would be the winner). The tie-break procedure originally applied only to first place ties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2015/2014-09-02_2015_ESC_rules_EN_PUBLIC_RULES.pdf|title=Public rules of the 60th Eurovision Song Contest|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=1 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430201605/http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2015/2014-09-02_2015_ESC_rules_EN_PUBLIC_RULES.pdf|archivedate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but since 2008 has been applied to all places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=1469 |work=Eurovision.tv |title=Eurovision 2008 Final |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of {{CURRENTYEAR}}, the only time since 1969 when two or more countries have tied for first place on total points alone was in {{ESCYr|1991}}, when France and Sweden both totalled 146 points. At that time, there was no televote, and the tie break was to determine which country had received the most sets of twelve points, then ten points, and so on. Both France and Sweden had received four sets of 12 points, but Sweden had received more sets of 10-point scores, they were declared the winners. Had the current predominant tiebreaker been in play, France would have won instead by virtue of receiving points from more overall countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;50yrs&quot;/&gt;

=== Broadcasting ===

Each participating broadcaster is required to broadcast the show in its entirety: including all songs, recap, voting and reprise, skipping only the interval act for advertising breaks if they wish.&lt;ref name=&quot;2009rules&quot;/&gt; From 1999 onwards, broadcasters who wished to do so were given the opportunity to take more advertising breaks as short, non-essential hiatuses were introduced into the programme.&lt;ref name=&quot;1999rules&quot;/&gt; Four major interruptions or preemptions of the contest broadcast have taken place since 1999. The Dutch state broadcaster pulled their broadcast of the 2000 final to provide emergency news coverage of a major incident, the [[Enschede fireworks disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=7723&amp;_t=The+end+of+a+decade%3A+Stockholm+2000|title=The end of a decade: Stockholm 2000|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=21 December 2009|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=21 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605093702/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=7723&amp;_t=The+end+of+a+decade:+Stockholm+2000|archive-date=5 June 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain's RTVE delayed their broadcast of the second semi-final in the 2009 Contest, due to the [[2009 Mutua Madrileña Madrid Open|Madrid Open]] tennis tournament.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-delay&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.es/20090515/gente-tv-radio-programacion/soraya-borde-descalificacion-eurovision-200905150219.html|title=Soraya, al borde de la descalificación en Eurovisión|last=Escartín|first=Javier|date=15 May 2009|newspaper=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]|language=Spanish|accessdate=17 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517061608/http://www.abc.es/20090515/gente-tv-radio-programacion/soraya-borde-descalificacion-eurovision-200905150219.html|archive-date=17 May 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Albanian state broadcaster deferred their broadcast of the first semi-final in 2012 to provide emergency news coverage of the [[Qafa e Vishës bus accident]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=59793&amp;_t=albania_to_broadcast_tonights_semi-final_deferred|work=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|title=Albania to broadcast tonights semi-final deferred|accessdate=22 May 2012|date=22 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523161447/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=59793&amp;_t=albania_to_broadcast_tonights_semi-final_deferred|archive-date=23 May 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Chinese broadcaster [[Mango TV]] edited the Albanian and Irish songs out of their broadcast of the first semi-final for violations of Chinese broadcast regulations.  The Albanian performer had visible tattoos, and the Irish song featured a storyline showing vignettes of a homosexual couple.  Eurovision terminated Mango's broadcasting rights when the broadcaster refused to agree to air the second semi-final and the grand final unedited.

==== Archive status ====

The first edition ever of the Eurovision Song Contest in 1956 was broadcast live, but not recorded, so only a sound recording of the radio transmission has survived from the original broadcast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Archive&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Two @Eurovision Contests are missing|url=https://twitter.com/ebu_hq/status/597346588479070208|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=15 May 2016|date=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ninth edition in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1964|1964]] hosted by [[DR (broadcaster)|Danmarks Radio]] was recorded on tape, but a fire destroyed the recording, and it is unknown if any other TV station in Europe has another copy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Archive&quot;/&gt; Only small portions of the original broadcast and audio from the radio transmission have survived.&lt;ref name=&quot;Archive&quot;/&gt;

In late 2011, the EBU had begun archiving all the contests since the first edition in 1956 to be finalised before the 2015 Contest, for the 60th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=38943|title=EBU starts Eurovision archive project|last=Siim|first=Jarmo|accessdate=8 October 2011|date=8 October 2013|website=eurovision.tv|publisher=EBU|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317195624/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=38943|archive-date=17 March 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later reported that the archive is ready and will be released on the 60th anniversary with making the content available to journalists in broadcast-ready formats while also giving public accessibility to &quot;selected content&quot; through the official Eurovision website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://escxtra.com/2013/06/archive-to-be-opened-in-time-for-60th-anniversary/ |title=General: Archive to be opened in time for 60th Anniversary |website=escxtra.com |publisher=escXtra |accessdate=4 June 2013 |date=4 June 2013 |last=N. |first=Danny |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611090959/http://escxtra.com/2013/06/archive-to-be-opened-in-time-for-60th-anniversary/ |archivedate=11 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=May 2017}}

==== Political recognition issues ====

In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978]], hosted in Paris only a month after the [[1978 South Lebanon conflict]], during the performance of the Israeli entry, the Jordanian broadcaster [[JRTV]] suspended the broadcast and showed pictures of flowers. When it became apparent during the later stages of the voting sequence that Israel's song &quot;[[A-Ba-Ni-Bi]]&quot; was going to win the contest, JRTV abruptly ended the transmission.&lt;ref name=&quot;50yrs&quot;/&gt; Afterwards, the Jordanian news media refused to acknowledge that Israel had won and announced that the winner was Belgium (who had actually come in 2nd place).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=294|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1978|accessdate=18 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605063638/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=294|archive-date=5 June 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 JRTV did not broadcast the voting because the name of Israel appeared on the scoreboard.

In 2005, Lebanon intended to [[Lebanon in the Eurovision Song Contest|participate in the contest]]. However, Lebanese law does not allow recognition of Israel, and consequently Lebanese broadcaster [[Télé Liban]] did not intend to transmit the Israeli entry. The EBU informed them that such an act would breach the rules of the contest, and Lebanon was subsequently forced to withdraw from the competition. Their late withdrawal incurred a fine, since they had already confirmed their participation and the deadline had passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=18 March 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4362373.stm|title=Lebanon withdraws from Eurovision|accessdate=15 July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728133244/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4362373.stm|archive-date=28 July 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Eurovision Song Contest albums were still being sold in Lebanese music stores until 2009, with the word Israel erased from the back cover. {{as of|2010}}, the albums were banned completely from sale.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In 2009, the song &quot;[[We Don't Wanna Put In]]&quot; was selected to represent Georgia. However, the song text was banned by Eurovision as it was interpreted as criticism against [[Prime Minister of Russia]] [[Vladimir Putin]] after the [[Russo-Georgian War]] the previous year. When asked to change the lyrics of the song, the Georgian broadcaster [[Georgian Public Broadcaster|GPB]] withdrew from the 2009 contest.&lt;ref&gt;References are found in &quot;[[We Don't Wanna Put In]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the {{Escyr|1998}} contest, Dana International was sent to compete to represent Israel to perform the song &quot;Diva.&quot; International is a [[transgender]] woman and her victory displayed the notion that Eurovision was a place where it was safe to be openly LGBTQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/5/14/11667716/eurovision-song-contest-2016-logo-timberlake|title=Eurovision, the world's biggest and best singing competition, explained|last=Beauchamp|first=Zack|date=2016-05-14|website=Vox|language=en|access-date=2019-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eurovision created a queer identity for itself by embracing non-heteronormative performers and their performances. Although most of the European public are accepting of this identity, Russian media has had negative reactions to some of the openly queer productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/5/14/11667716/eurovision-song-contest-2016-logo-timberlake|title=Eurovision, the world's biggest and best singing competition, explained|last=Beauchamp|first=Zack|date=2016-05-14|website=Vox|language=en|access-date=2019-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the first contest, 1956, there was a recommended time limit of 3{{frac|2}} minutes per song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/history/1956/56_rules.pdf|title=Reglement du Grand Prix Eurovision 1956 De La Chanson Européenne|accessdate=19 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104171321/http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/history/1956/56_rules.pdf|archive-date=4 January 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1957|1957]], despite protests, [[Corde della mia chitarra|Italy's song]] was 5:09 minutes in duration.

Many of the entries also have longer versions (including different languages) for commercial release, and since the 1990s, some are released in additional remixed versions.
* The EBU imposes no restrictions on the nationalities of the performers or songwriters. Individual broadcasters are, however, permitted to impose their own restrictions at their discretion.&lt;ref name=&quot;2005rules&quot;/&gt; About a dozen artists have performed more than once in the Contest representing different countries, and some of the winners were not born in the country they represented.
* From 1957 to 1970 (in 1956 there was no restriction at all) only soloists and duos were allowed on stage. From 1963, a chorus of up to three people was permitted. Since 1971, a maximum of six performers have been permitted on the stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;2005rules&quot;/&gt;
* The performance and/or lyrics of a song &quot;must not bring the Contest into disrepute&quot;. No lyrics, speeches, gestures of a political or similar nature are permitted. No swearing or unacceptable language is allowed, neither are commercial messages.&lt;ref name=&quot;2009rules&quot;/&gt;
* Prior to 1990, there was no performer age limit. From 1990 to 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rules of the 2003 Eurovision Song Contest |url=http://www.myledbury.co.uk/eurovision/pdf/esc2003.pdf |access-date=1 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110000103/http://www.myledbury.co.uk/eurovision/pdf/esc2003.pdf |archive-date=10 November 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; all performers were required to be at least 16 years of age by the end of the year in which the contest was held.

* Live animals are prohibited.&lt;ref name=&quot;2009rules&quot;/&gt;
* Each artist may perform for only one country per year.
* The music and text must not have been published or performed before 1 September of the year before the contest is held. Many countries also have the additional rule that the song shall never have been [[Performance|performed]] before the relevant national Eurovision Contest. Covers, reworked or sampled versions of older songs are not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2012/ESC_2012_public_version_Rules_ENG.pdf|title=Extracts from the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest rules|work=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=20 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321165509/http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2012/ESC_2012_public_version_Rules_ENG.pdf|archive-date=21 March 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Regular Participants 1994.svg|thumb|Regular participants in 1994. Changes from 1992 include the addition of Central and Eastern European countries, and the separation of ex-Yugoslavian states.]]

The number of countries participating has steadily grown over time, from seven in 1956 to over 20 in the late 1980s. In 1993, twenty-five countries participated in the competition, including, for the first time, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia, entering independently due to the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|dissolution of Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=235|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1993|accessdate=25 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605093547/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=235|archive-date=5 June 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the most recent edition in 2019, a total of 41 countries took part, with 26 appearing in the final.

Because the contest is a live television programme, a reasonable time limit must be imposed on the duration of the show. In recent years the nominal limit has been four hours, with the broadcast occasionally over-running.&lt;ref name=&quot;1999rules&quot;/&gt;

=== Pre-selections and relegation ===

Since 1993, and following the cessation of the Eastern European [[International Radio and Television Organisation|OIRT network]] and the merger with the EBU, there have been more entries than there is time to reasonably include in a single TV show. Several relegation or qualification systems have been tried to limit the number of countries participating in the contest at one time. Thus the 1993 Contest introduced two new features: first, a pre-selection competition was held in [[Ljubljana]] in which seven [[Eastern Bloc|new countries]] fought for three places in the international competition. Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia took part in ''[[Kvalifikacija za Millstreet]]''; and the three former Yugoslav republics, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia, qualified for a place in the international final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=235|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1993|accessdate=22 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605093547/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=235|archive-date=5 June 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also to be introduced that year was &quot;relegation&quot;: the lowest-placed countries in the 1993 score table were not invited in 1994, to allow the countries which failed the 1993 pre-selection into the 1994 Contest. The 1994 Contest included—for the first time—Estonia, Romania, Slovakia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=309|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1994|accessdate=22 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605095406/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=309|archive-date=5 June 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relegation continued in 1994 and 1995;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=310|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1995|accessdate=22 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231063825/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=310|archive-date=31 December 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1996 a different pre-selection system was used, in which nearly all the countries participated. Audio tapes of all the songs were sent to juries in each of the countries some weeks before the television show. These juries selected the songs which would be included in the international broadcast.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESC1996&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=311|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1996|accessdate=18 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231163933/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=311|archive-date=31 December 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norway, as the host country in 1996 (having won the previous year), automatically qualified and so did not need to go through pre-selection.

One country which failed to qualify in the 1996 pre-selection was Germany. As one of the largest financial contributors to the EBU, their non-participation in the contest brought about a funding issue, which the EBU would have to consider.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESC1996&quot;/&gt;

=== Big Four and Big Five ===

Since 2000, [[France in the Eurovision Song Contest|France]], [[Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest|Germany]], [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest|Spain]] and [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest|United Kingdom]] have automatically qualified for the final, regardless of their positions on the scoreboard in previous contests, as they are the four biggest financial contributors to the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1999rules&quot;/&gt; These countries became known as the &quot;Big Four&quot;. On 31 December 2010, it was announced that [[Italy in the Eurovision Song Contest|Italy]] would compete in the Eurovision Song Contest after a fourteen-year absence and that it would also automatically qualify for the final, joining the other four qualifiers to become the &quot;Big Five&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|title=43 nations on 2011 participants list|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=22833&amp;_t=43+nations+on+2011+participants+list!|website=Eurovision.tv|accessdate=31 December 2010|date=31 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104061710/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=22833&amp;_t=43+nations+on+2011+participants+list!|archive-date=4 January 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany became the first and, {{as of|2019|lc=y}}, the only &quot;Big Five&quot; country to win the contest since the rule was made in 2000, when [[Lena Meyer-Landrut]] won the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010 Contest]]. [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest|Turkey]] withdrew from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013|2013 Contest]] with the status of the &quot;Big Five&quot; being one of the reasons cited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jiandani|first=Sanjay|title=Turkey will not go to Eurovision in Malmö|url=http://www.esctoday.com/40037/turkey-will-not-be-in-malmo/|website=ESCToday|accessdate=14 December 2012|date=14 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217011340/http://www.esctoday.com/40037/turkey-will-not-be-in-malmo/|archive-date=17 December 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also did not participate in the following 6 years of contests (2014–19) for similar reasons, as well as stating their opposition to the 50/50 jury and televoting system that began being applied in the final of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009 Contest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jiandani|first=Sanjay|title=Turkey: TRT confirms non participation in Eurovision 2016|url=http://esctoday.com/105436/turkey-trt-confirms-non-participation-in-eurovision-2016/|website=ESCToday|accessdate=15 May 2016|date=3 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523003912/http://esctoday.com/105436/turkey-trt-confirms-non-participation-in-eurovision-2016/|archive-date=23 May 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Big Four/Five countries pay approximately five to six times the participation fee of a &quot;standard&quot; participating country, effectively subsidizing smaller European broadcasters, thus allowing them to be able to afford entry into the competition. Without the contribution of The Big Five it is estimated that the participation cost for a &quot;standard&quot; country would be double what they currently pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pozzi |first1=Renee |title=The cost of not having the 'Big 4/5' |url=https://www.escdaily.com/the-cost-of-not-having-the-big-45/ |website=ESC DAILY |accessdate=15 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160719062541/http://www.escdaily.com/the-cost-of-not-having-the-big-45/ |archive-date=19 July 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes discussed whether the Big 5 measure benefits or prejudicates the countries' performances in the contest. Since its creation, countries of the Big Five have placed last in 8 of the latest 15 contests (2003, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2019). The only Big 5 country that has never finished last since the introduction of this concept is Italy: since its return in 2011, the country placed in the top 10 seven times out of 9 contests, including four times in the top 5, a third place and twice as the runner up; its worst place was a 21st in 2014. Some measures have been taken by the EBU to give the Big 5 contestants a similar status to those competing at the semi-finals, such as broadcasting snippets of their acts in the semi-final interval.

=== Qualification and semi-finals ===

[[File:Eurovision semifinal qualification rate map.svg|thumb|Each country's qualification rates from 2004 to present]]

From 1997 to 2001, countries qualified for each contest based on the average of their points totals for their entries over the previous five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=312|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1997|accessdate=26 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605100759/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=312|archive-date=5 June 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=266|title=Eurovision Song Contest 2001|accessdate=26 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727061435/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=266|archive-date=27 July 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was much discontent voiced over this system because a country could be excluded merely because of poor previous results, which did not take into account how good a fresh attempt might be. The worst example of this was that Bosnia and Herzegovina finished 7th with 86 points in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|1999 Contest]], but it wasn't enough to save the country being relegated from taking part in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000 Contest]]. As a result, the EBU reverted to the older relegation system for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2002|2002]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]] contests. Soon, the EBU created what was hoped would be a more permanent solution to the problem. A qualification round, known as the semi-final, was introduced for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004 Contest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=9|title=Eurovision Song Contest 2004 Semi-final|accessdate=22 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520011431/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=9|archive-date=20 May 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This semi-final was held on the Wednesday during Eurovision Week, and was a programme similar in format to the grand final, whose time slot remained 19:00 UTC on the Saturday. The highest-placed songs from the semi-final qualified for the grand final, while the lower-placed songs were eliminated. From 2005 to 2007, the semi-final programme was held on the Thursday of Eurovision Week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=157 |title=Eurovision Song Contest 2005 Semi-final |accessdate=22 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518200559/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=157 |archivedate=18 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these two shows there was enough time to include all the countries who wished to participate.

The ten highest-placed non-Big Four countries in the &quot;grand final&quot; were guaranteed a place in the following year's grand final, without having to qualify. If, for example, Germany came in the top ten, the eleventh-placed non-Big-Four country would automatically qualify for the next year's grand final.&lt;ref name=&quot;2005rules&quot;/&gt; The remaining countries—which had not automatically qualified for the grand final—had to enter the semi-final.&lt;ref name=&quot;2005rules&quot;/&gt;

At the 50th annual meeting of the EBU reference group in September 2007, it was decided that, with still more nations entering, starting from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008 contest]] onwards ''two'' semi-finals would be held,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebu.ch/CMSimages/en/PR_ESC%20Semi-Finals_01%2E10%2E07_EN_tcm6-54154.pdf|title=Eurovision Song Contest – Two Semi-finals in 2008|date=1 October 2007|accessdate=18 July 2009|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607055137/http://www.ebu.ch/CMSimages/en/PR_ESC%20Semi-Finals_01.10.07_EN_tcm6-54154.pdf|archive-date=7 June 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; from each of which one could qualify for the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/05/16/1084646073107.html | title=Bubble rapt | date=17 May 2004 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | access-date=22 September 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316012450/http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/05/16/1084646073107.html | archive-date=16 March 2008 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2008 onwards, the scoreboard position in previous years has not been relevant, and—save for the automatic qualifiers—all participating countries have had to participate in the semi-finals, regardless of their previous year's scoreboard position. The only countries which automatically qualify for the grand final are the host country and the Big Five: France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, who continue to enjoy their protected status.&lt;ref name=&quot;2009rules&quot;/&gt;

In each of the semi-finals the voting is conducted among those countries which participate in that semi-final. With regard to the automatic grand final qualifiers, who do not participate in the semi-finals, a draw is conducted to determine in which semi-final each of them will be allowed to vote. In contrast, ''every'' participating country in a particular year may vote in the Saturday grand final – whether their song qualified for the final or not.

The ten countries which receive the most votes in each semi-final qualify for the grand final. They are announced by the presenters in English and French, in a random order. Full voting results are withheld until after the grand final, whereupon they are published on the EBU's website.&lt;ref name=&quot;2009rules&quot;/&gt; To date only two countries have always qualified to the Final since the implementation of the semi-finals system in 2004: Australia and Ukraine.

Below is a chart of qualification percentage depending on times qualified/participated. For example, if a country has participated 9 times and has qualified 7 of them, it has qualified (7/9*100) = (0.777*100) = 77.77% of participation, or roughly 78% as shown below.

[[File:Eurovision winners map.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Map showing each country's number of Eurovision wins up to and including 2019.|alt=]]

{{as of|2019}}, {{Esccnty|Ireland}} holds the record for the highest number of wins, having won the contest seven times. {{Esccnty|Sweden}} is second with six wins. {{Esccnty|France}}, {{Esccnty|Luxembourg}}, the {{Esccnty|Netherlands}} and the {{Esccnty|United Kingdom}} are joint third with five wins each. {{Esccnty|Israel}} hold four victories. {{Esccnty|Denmark}} and {{Esccnty|Norway}} have both won three times, six countries have won twice, while 12 countries have won once. A further 24 countries have participated, but have yet to win.

The United Kingdom holds the record for the highest number of runner-up placings, coming in second on no fewer than [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest#Contestants|15 occasions]] {{as of|2019|lc=y}}. Germany, Russia, France, Spain and Ireland have four runner-up entries. Norway holds the record for finishing in last place in the final the most times: eleven.

Israel is the only non-European country to win four times.

Croatia is the only country to have never won the contest as its current state, but has provided a winner for a former state - Yugoslavia. In 1989, Yugoslavia won the contest with &quot;[[Rock Me (Riva song)|Rock Me]]&quot; performed by [[Riva (band)|Riva]], who won the Yugoslav selection competition that year representing (along with 2 more acts) the Yugoslav Socialist Republic of Croatia. The 1990 contest was subsequently held in Zagreb, now the capital of Croatia. 

The early years of the contest saw many wins for &quot;traditional&quot; Eurovision countries: France, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. However, the success of these countries has declined in recent decades; France last won in 1977 and Luxembourg, in 1983. The Netherlands, however, won again in 2019. Luxembourg last entered the contest in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esctoday.com/3221/luxembourg_never_to_return_to_the_contest/ |title=Eurovision Song Contest – Dusseldorf 2011 &amp;#124; News – 'Luxembourg never to return to the contest' |publisher=Esctoday.com |date=5 September 2008 |accessdate=22 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504001211/http://esctoday.com/3221/luxembourg_never_to_return_to_the_contest/ |archive-date=4 May 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first years of the 21st century produced numerous first-time winners, from both &quot;new&quot; and long-serving countries who had previously entered numerous times but without victories. Every year from 2001 to 2008 inclusive, a country won for its first time. Estonia was the first post-Soviet country to win the competition in 2001. Latvia won for the first time in 2002. In 2003, Turkey won for the first time. In 2005, {{Esccnty|Greece}} won for the first time, 15 years after the last Southern European country won, i.e. {{Esccnty|Italy}} in 1990; overall the [[Southern Europe|South of Europe]] won the competition only six times (seven if Serbia is included). The 2006 winner was {{Esccnty|Finland}}'s [[Lordi (band)|Lordi]], earning Finland's first win after having entered the contest for 45 years. {{Esccnty|Ukraine}}, on the other hand, did not have to wait so long, winning with only their second entry in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004]]. Also notably, although not the nation's first win, [[Conchita Wurst]]'s win in 2014 broke a 48-year losing run for {{Esccnty|Austria}}. The contest was won by {{Esccnty|Russia}} in 2008.

{{Esccnty|Serbia}} won the very first year it entered as an independent state, in 2007, with the Serbian-language ballad &quot;[[Molitva]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2007&amp;mm=05&amp;dd=13&amp;nav_category=113&amp;nav_id=41193 |title=News – Serbia wins Eurovision Song Contest |publisher=B92 |accessdate=15 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071122210407/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2007&amp;mm=05&amp;dd=13&amp;nav_category=113&amp;nav_id=41193 |archivedate=22 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, {{Esccnty|Serbia and Montenegro}} also almost won the initial year it entered as a competitor state, finishing up second behind Ukraine, also with a [[Lane moje|ballad]] in Serbian language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eq7nilnv93cC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=serbia+montenegro+lane+moje+second#v=onepage&amp;q=serbia%20montenegro%20lane%20moje%20second|title=A Song for Europe|work=google.rs|isbn=9780754658795|last1=Raykoff|first1=Ivan|last2=Tobin|first2=Robert Deam|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other relatively quick winners were {{Esccnty|Latvia}}, who won in 2002, only their third year competing, and Azerbaijan, who won in 2011 in only their fourth year in the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/year|title=By year|work=Eurovision.tv|access-date=20 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007081953/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/year|archive-date=7 October 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When {{Esccnty|Portugal}} won in 2017, they ended a 49-year run of entering without a win, beating {{Esccnty|Finland}}'s previous record of 45 years. {{Esccnty|Cyprus}} now holds this record, with 35 years without a win, achieving their highest score, Second, in 2018, and {{Esccnty|Malta}} is the most successful country without a win, achieving two-second places and two third places.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Eurovision song contest&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/year |title=History of Eurovision song contest |publisher=Eurovision.tv |date=20 October 2014 |accessdate=20 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007081953/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/year |archive-date=7 October 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, {{Esccnty|Norway}} won the contest with 387 points – [[Alexander Rybak]] held the winning title with his song &quot;[[Fairytale (Alexander Rybak song)|Fairytale]]&quot;. His performance meant he had the highest total in the history of the competition, becoming the first competitor to score 300 or more points, including 16 maximum scores. This feat was emulated in 2012, when Sweden won with 372 points, but with a new record of 18 maximum scores.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Eurovision song contest&quot;/&gt; In 2015, {{Esccnty|Sweden}} won the contest with 365 points, becoming the first country to ever reach 300 points or more twice while winning both times. {{Esccnty|Russia}} placed second with 303 points, becoming the first country to score more than 300 points without winning.

In 2016, the scoring system was changed, which meant that it was much easier to achieve over 300 points – in fact, the winner – [[Jamala]] of {{Esccnty|Ukraine}}, achieved 534 points, and all of top 9 scored 200 or more points, and 25 of the 26 positions got their highest points ever. This feat was then extended in 2017 when Salvador Sobral beat Ukraine's points record by 224 points, getting 758 points in total, in addition to {{Esccnty|Bulgaria}} beating the same score by 81 points, with a total amount of 615 points. However, had Portugal won under the previous voting system, it would still have had the highest total ever, with 417 points, becoming the first competitor to score 400 or more points, and would have set a new record of 20 maximum scores, beating Norway and Sweden, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.escxtra.com/2017/05/14/eurovision-2017-old-voting/|title=An Alternate Universe: Eurovision 2017 Under the Old Voting System|date=14 May 2017|website=ESCXTRA|access-date=15 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170612015618/https://www.escxtra.com/2017/05/14/eurovision-2017-old-voting/|archive-date=12 June 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the introduction of the [[Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest#Voting Systems|50/50 voting system]] in 2009, the juries and the voters have disagreed on the winner on five occasions, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018|2018]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2019|2019]]. [[Azerbaijan in the Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011 winner Azerbaijan]] won only the televotes (jury votes were won by Italy) and [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015 winner Sweden]] won only the jury votes (televotes were won by Italy). In 2016, [[Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016|Ukraine]] did not win either the jury vote or the televote, but won the contest with the highest combined vote. The televote was won by Russia and the jury vote by Australia. In 2018, eventual winner [[Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018|Israel]] won the televote but only came in third with the jury vote (won by Austria). In 2019, [[Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019|Netherlands]] placed third with the juries (North Macedonia first, Sweden second) and second with the televote (Norway first). However, The Netherlands had the highest combined vote and thus they won the contest.

=== Winning artists ===

There have been a number of Eurovision artists and groups whose careers were directly launched into the spotlight following their win. Notable examples were [[ABBA]], who won the contest for Sweden in 1974 with their song &quot;[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]&quot;, and went on to become one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|most successful pop bands]] in history;&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate1&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/09/12/DDBN12SDVQ.DTL | title=Opening of Sweden's ABBA museum is delayed | date=12 September 2008 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | access-date=20 May 2019 | archive-url=https://archive.today/20120909051343/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/09/12/DDBN12SDVQ.DTL | archive-date=9 September 2012 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[French Canadian]] singer [[Céline Dion]], who won the contest for Switzerland in 1988 with the song &quot;[[Ne partez pas sans moi]]&quot;, which subsequently helped launch her international career;&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters2007&quot;/&gt;
and the winners of the 1981 contest, [[Bucks Fizz]] for the United Kingdom with the song &quot;[[Making Your Mind Up]]&quot;, which also launched a successful international career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jul/01/bucks-fizz-abba-bob-stanley-eurovision|title=Bucks Fizz: more than just a Kwik Save Abba|last=Stanley|first=Bob|date=1 July 2015|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503111128/https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jul/01/bucks-fizz-abba-bob-stanley-eurovision|archive-date=3 May 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other winners were well-known artists who won the contest mid-career after they had already established themselves, including [[Katrina and the Waves]], winners in 1997 with &quot;[[Love Shine a Light]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/lloyd-webber-agrees-to-try-to-write-a-winner-for-eurovision-966380.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028030500/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/lloyd-webber-agrees-to-try-to-write-a-winner-for-eurovision-966380.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 October 2014 |work=The Independent |location=London |title=Lloyd Webber agrees to try to write a winner for Eurovision |first=Sadie |last=Gray |date=19 October 2008 |accessdate=2 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], winner in 1969 with &quot;[[Boom Bang-a-Bang]]&quot;, and [[Sandie Shaw]], winner in 1967 with &quot;[[Puppet on a String]]&quot;. Women have dominated the contest since its inception, with 38 solo female wins, notably including the first two winners, all four winners in the infamous 1969 contest, and the two entries that initially tied for the win in 1991 before Sweden, represented by Carola, won the tie-breaker and claimed sole victory. A further 11 victories feature women as members of duos or groups, though these are mostly mixed-gender, including ABBA's win in 1974 and Brotherhood of Man in 1976, meaning women have been present on 49 of the 67 total winning entries {{as of|2019|lc=y}}. {{Citation needed|date = August 2017}} The 2017 winner was a solo male performance by [[Salvador Sobral]]. However, his sister and the song's composer [[Luísa Sobral]] joined him for the winner's reprise.

The most recent winner of the contest is [[Duncan Laurence]] who won the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2019|2019 contest]] for The Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://eurovisionworld.com/esc/israel-wins-eurovision-song-contest-2018| title=Netta Barzilai from Israel wins Eurovision Song Contest 2018| date=2018-05-12| access-date=12 May 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180512235106/https://eurovisionworld.com/esc/israel-wins-eurovision-song-contest-2018| archive-date=12 May 2018| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interval acts and guest appearances ==
[[File:Michael Flatley cropped.jpg|150px|thumb|Irish dance champion [[Michael Flatley]], was part of one of the most appreciated interval acts, ''[[Riverdance]]'' which made its debut in Dublin 1994]]

Since {{ESCYr|1960}}, the tradition of interval acts between the songs in the competition programme and the announcement of the voting has been established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|url=https://eurovision.tv/story/star-percussionist-revealed-as-eurovision-interval-act|title=Star percussionist revealed as Eurovision interval act|accessdate=21 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ESC+_Interval_acts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=esc-plus.com |url=https://www.esc-plus.com/the-definitive-guide-to-eurovision-interval-acts/|title=The definitive guide to Eurovision interval acts |accessdate=21 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these acts, there are usually the previous winner, performances devoted to the history of the Eurovision Song Contest, as well as representatives of the traditional music scene of the host country.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESC+_Interval_acts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiwi_Interval_acts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|website=[[Wiwibloggs]]|url=https://wiwibloggs.com/2019/04/09/poll-favourite-eurovision-interval-act/236713/|title=Poll: What is your favourite Eurovision grand final interval act from the past decade? |accessdate=21 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the interval performances was the first public appearance of [[Riverdance]], a theatrical show consisting mainly of traditional Irish music and dance, in {{ESCYr|1994}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Clive |last=Barnes |url=http://www.riverdance.com/htm/theshow/thejourney |title=Riverdance Ten Years on |website=RiverDance|accessdate=27 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522033151/http://www.riverdance.com/htm/theshow/thejourney/|archive-date=22 May 2009 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HuffPost_Interval_acts&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=[[HuffPost]]|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/eurovision-2017-best-interval-acts_uk_5916c005e4b0031e737dddc0|title=Eurovision 2017: Our Countdown Of The 10 Best Interval Acts Ever|accessdate=21 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riverdance was later performed as an interval act at both the ''[[Congratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest]]'' (2005) and ''[[Eurovision Song Contest's Greatest Hits]]'' (2015) events.

Interval and opening entertainment has included such acts as pop superstars [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] ({{ESCYr|2019}}), [[Justin Timberlake]] ({{ESCYr|2016}}), [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]] ({{ESCYr|2001}}) and [[t.A.T.u.]] ({{ESCYr|2009}}), but also violinist [[Vanessa-Mae]] ({{ESCYr|1998}}) and [[world music]] artists [[Mariza]] ({{ESCYr|2018}}) and [[Goran Bregović]] ({{ESCYr|2008}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |url=https://eurovision.tv/story/justin-timberlake-makes-world-premiere-live-performance-in-the-eurovision-song-contest|title=Justin Timberlake makes world premiere live performance in the Eurovision Song Contest!|accessdate=21 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|newspaper=[[CNN]] |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/18/europe/madonna-eurovision-israel-scli-intl/index.html|title=Eurovision: Madonna mixes politics with a classic hit during performance|accessdate=21 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world-renowned [[Cirque du Soleil]] ({{ESCYr|2009}}), [[Alexandrov Ensemble]] ({{ESCYr|2009}}), [[Vienna Boys' Choir]] ({{ESCYr|1967}} and {{ESCYr|2015}}), [[Fire of Anatolia]] ({{ESCYr|2004}}) and ''Prague Theatre of Illuminated Drawings'' ({{ESCYr|1984}}) also performed on the Eurovision stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;HuffPost_Interval_acts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|url=https://eurovision.tv/story/cirque-du-soleil-opener-for-the-final|title=Cirque du Soleil!|accessdate=21 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[flashmob]]-styled performance with [[Madcon]] performing &quot;[[Glow (Madcon song)|Glow]]&quot;, alongside live and taped footage of public outdoor dance events from across Europe, was the interval act for {{ESCYr|2010}}.

The {{ESCYr|1999}} event in [[Jerusalem]] finished with the three presenters inviting everyone on stage to sing a rendition of the English version of &quot;[[Hallelujah (Milk and Honey song)|Hallelujah]]&quot;, the Israeli winner from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|1979 Contest]], as a tribute to the victims of the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|Balkan War]] (particularly [[Serbia and Montenegro|FR Yugoslavia]], which was banned from participation as penalty for the Balkan Wars).

In recognition of Australia's love affair with the annual event, the interval act for the second semi-final in {{ESCYr|2014}} was a presentation by Australia featuring [[Jessica Mauboy]] who performed &quot;[[Sea of Flags]]&quot;. Her appearance marked the first time Australia had been represented at Eurovision and was first solo artist from a non-participating country to perform as a guest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/jessica-mauboy-to-perform-at-eurovision|title=Jessica Mauboy to perform at Eurovision|website=SBS News|date=26 March 2014|accessdate=22 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2014 the winners of the most recent [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest]] also make a guest appearance during one of the three shows, typically at the Grand Final (however this was moved to the first semi-final for the 2019 contest)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eurovoix.com/2019/05/08/eurovision19-junior-eurovision-guest-appearance-moved-to-semi-final-one/|title=Eurovision'19: Junior Eurovision Guest Appearance Moved to Semi-Final One|date=8 May 2019|website=eurovoix.com|publisher=Eurovoix|accessdate=23 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are interviewed at a press conference held for the junior contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebu.ch/news/2014/05/junior-eurovision-song-contest-g|title=Junior Eurovision Song Contest: Gaia glows in Copenhagen|date=13 May 2014|website=www.ebu.ch|accessdate=23 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/story/discover-the-junior-eurovision-song-contest-2015|title=#Discover the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2015|website=eurovision.tv|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|date=22 May 2015|accessdate=23 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, a concert television programme was held to commemorate the contest's twenty-fifth anniversary. The event, entitled [[Songs of Europe (1981 concert)|Songs of Europe]], took place in [[Mysen]], Norway, featuring nearly all the winners of the contest, from 1956 to 1981. It was hosted by [[Rolf Kirkvaag]] and [[Titten Tei]].

In 2005, the EBU had agreed with the Danish broadcaster, [[DR (broadcaster)|DR]], to produce a programme to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Eurovision Song Contest. The show, entitled [[Congratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest]] after [[Cliff Richard]]'s {{ESCYr|1968}} [[Congratulations (Cliff Richard song)|entry]] for the United Kingdom, was held in Copenhagen, and featured a competition among fourteen of the most popular songs from the last 50 years of the contest. A telephone vote was held to determine the most popular Eurovision song of all-time, which was won by the ABBA song &quot;[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]&quot; (winner for Sweden in {{ESCYr|1974}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| work= [[BBC News Online]]| date= 23 October 2005| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4366574.stm| title= Abba win 'Eurovision 50th' vote| accessdate= 20 July 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061019212102/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4366574.stm| archive-date= 19 October 2006| url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was hosted by the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997 Contest]] winner for the United Kingdom, [[Katrina Leskanich]], and Latvia's representative on its debut at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000 Contest]], [[Renārs Kaupers]].

In 2015, the EBU had decided again to commemorate the contest and agreed with the United Kingdom's broadcaster, BBC, to produce a show for the 60th anniversary of the contest, after evaluating several proposals from member broadcasters in regards to the anniversary celebration beyond the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015 Contest]] in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/71929/ebu-pan-european-survey/|title=EBU: A pan-European survey|website=esctoday.com|publisher=ESCToday|last=Borg|first=Luje|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=9 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213031830/http://www.esctoday.com/71929/ebu-pan-european-survey|archive-date=13 December 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eurovoix.com/2015/01/29/60th-anniversay-bbc-confirmed-as-show-producers/|title=60th Anniversay: BBC Confirmed As Show Producers|website=eurovoix.com|publisher=Eurovoix|accessdate=29 January 2015|date=29 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130063012/http://eurovoix.com/2015/01/29/60th-anniversay-bbc-confirmed-as-show-producers/|archive-date=30 January 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/eurovision-2015-bbc-to-produce-60th-anniversary-special-3451/|title=Eurovision 2015: BBC to produce 60th anniversary special|website=officialcharts.com|publisher=Official Charts Company|accessdate=29 January 2015|date=29 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203140548/http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/eurovision-2015-bbc-to-produce-60th-anniversary-special-3451/|archive-date=3 February 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event, entitled [[Eurovision Song Contest's Greatest Hits]], took place at the [[Eventim Apollo]] in [[Hammersmith]], London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roxburgh|first1=Gordon|title=Official: London to host Eurovision's 60th Anniversary Event|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=official_london_to_host_eurovisions_60th_anniversary_event|website=eurovision.tv|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=3 February 2015|date=3 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203140459/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=official_london_to_host_eurovisions_60th_anniversary_event|archive-date=3 February 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and featured [[Eurovision Song Contest's Greatest Hits#Participating countries|fifteen acts from thirteen countries]] in the official line-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Freeman|first1=Guy|title=Eurovision's Greatest Hits – full line-up revealed!|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/eurovision/entries/8aedd078-e506-4242-9df3-9b8a14b03ead|website=bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 February 2015|format=6 February 2015|date=2015-02-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207135729/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/eurovision/entries/8aedd078-e506-4242-9df3-9b8a14b03ead|archive-date=7 February 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Event Details&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jiandani|first1=Sanjay|title=United Kingdom: 4 more Eurovision acts join the party!|url=http://esctoday.com/94879/united-kingdom-join-party/|website=esctoday.com|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=5 February 2015|date=5 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205202212/http://esctoday.com/94879/united-kingdom-join-party/|archive-date=5 February 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the 50th anniversary show in 2005 which was broadcast live, this event did not feature a competition and was pre-recorded to be televised across Europe and other EBU members on various dates schedule by the respective broadcasters.

== Criticism and controversy ==

The contest has been the subject of criticism regarding both its musical and political content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=9 May 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/berkshire/6640231.stm|title=Politics 'not Eurovision factor'|accessdate=25 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331000020/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/berkshire/6640231.stm|archive-date=31 March 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=14 May 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6654719.stm|title=Malta slates Eurovision's voting|accessdate=25 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305012257/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6654719.stm|archive-date=5 March 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, on rare occasions, certain countries have been booed when performing or receiving points, especially when being given by a neighbour country.

=== Musical style and presentation ===

Because the songs play to such a diverse international audience with contrasting musical tastes, and countries want to be able to appeal to as many people as possible to gain votes, this has led to the music of the contest being characterised as a &quot;mishmash of [[power ballads]], ethnic rhythms and [[bubblegum pop]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul|last=Majendie|date=11 August 2007|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKL1142844820070814|work=[[Reuters]]|title=Edinburgh Fringe show celebrates Eurovision kitsch|accessdate=18 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601071040/http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKL1142844820070814|archive-date=1 June 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This well-established pattern, however, was broken in 2006 with Finnish metal band [[Lordi]]'s victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovisionaustria.com/blog/eurovisions-diamond-day/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903222919/http://www.eurovisionaustria.com/blog/eurovisions-diamond-day/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 September 2015 |title=Eurovision's Diamond Day }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Eurovision is a visual show, many performances attempt to attract the attention of the voters through means other than the music, notably elaborate lighting sequences and [[pyrotechnics]]; sometimes leading to bizarre on-stage theatrics and costumes, including the use of revealing dress.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;Paul Allatson, &quot;'[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a776540935?words=allatson&amp;hash=267716188 Antes cursi que sencilla’: Eurovision Song Contests and the Kitsch Drive to Euro-Unity] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125180218/http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a776540935?words=allatson&amp;hash=267716188 |date=25 January 2009 }},&quot; in the Special issue on Creolisation: Towards a Non-Eurocentric Europe, in ''Culture, Theory and Critique'', vol. 48, no. 1 (Spring 2007): 87–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political and geographical voting ===

The contest has long been accused by some of political bias; the perception is that judges and televoters allocate points based on their nation's relationship to the other countries, rather than the musical merits of the songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work= [[BBC News Online]] |date= 16 May 2004 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/3719157.stm |title= Eurovision votes 'farce' attack |accessdate= 15 July 2006 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060427085641/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/3719157.stm |archive-date= 27 April 2006 |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one study of Eurovision voting patterns, certain countries tend to form &quot;clusters&quot; or &quot;cliques&quot; by frequently voting in the same way.&lt;ref name=&quot;FennEtAl&quot;/&gt; Another study concludes that as of 2006, [[voting bloc]]s have, on at least two occasions, crucially affected the outcome of the contest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gatherer&quot;&gt;Derek Gatherer. &quot;[http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/9/2/1.html Comparison of Eurovision Song Contest Simulation with Actual Results Reveals Shifting Patterns of Collusive Voting Alliances.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505041808/http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/9/2/1.html |date=5 May 2007 }}&quot;, ''Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation''  vol. 9, no. 2. 31 March 2006.

It allows the analysis to find collusive associations over time periods where the voting scheme is non-homogeneous. The results show a changing pattern in the collusive tendencies previously discussed. The current research into the analysis of the voting patterns has been used in notable sources, such as the Economist, for investigating whether over 10-year periods such collusion is increasing or decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Economist|first1=DailyChart|title=Partisanship at Eurovision is becoming more blatant|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2018/05/daily-chart-7|journal=Economist|accessdate=11 May 2018|date=2018-05-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511153023/https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2018/05/daily-chart-7|archive-date=11 May 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Economist|first1=WarableGames|title=Neighbourly voting in the Eurovision Song Contest|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21742117-continents-annual-singing-tournament-becoming-increasingly-partisan-neighbourly-voting|journal=Economist|accessdate=12 May 2018|date=2018-05-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180512021846/https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21742117-continents-annual-singing-tournament-becoming-increasingly-partisan-neighbourly-voting|archive-date=12 May 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, [[Terry Wogan]], the United Kingdom's presenter of Eurovision since 1980 and one of the only three presenters mentioned by name during the contest proper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Eurovision Song Contest 2008|episodelink = Eurovision Song Contest 2008|series=Eurovision Song Contest|serieslink=Eurovision Song Contest|airdate=24 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; stood down from [[BBC One]]'s broadcast in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]] saying &quot;The voting used to be about the songs. Now it's about national prejudices. We [the United Kingdom] are on our own. We had a very good song, a very good singer, we came joint last. I don't want to be presiding over another debacle&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=28 November 2015|url=http://www.nme.com/news/eurovision/38821|title=erry Wogan 'very doubtful' about presenting Eurovision again|access-date=28 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815014245/http://www.nme.com/news/eurovision/38821|archive-date=15 August 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influential factor is the high proportion of [[expatriate]]s and ethnic minorities living in certain countries. Although judges and televoters cannot vote for their own country's entry, expatriates can vote for their country of origin.

The total numbers of points to be distributed by each country are equal, irrespective of the country's population. Thus voters in countries with larger populations have less power as individuals to influence the result of the contest than those voting in smaller countries. For example, San Marino holds the same voting power as Russia despite the vast geographic and population differences between them.

To try to reduce the effect of voting blocs, national juries were re-introduced alongside televoting in the final in 2009: each contributing 50% of the vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;juryconfirmed&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/news/read/12655 |title=EBU confirms 50/50 vote for Eurovision Song Contest |last=Viniker |first=Barry |date=8 December 2008 |website=ESCToday |accessdate=8 December 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211002140/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/12655 |archivedate=11 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This hybrid system was expanded in 2010 to also be implemented in the semi-finals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Countries&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=7923&amp;_t=Exclusive%3A+39+countries+to+be+represented+in+Oslo|title=Exclusive: 39 countries to be represented in Oslo|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=31 December 2009|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]]|accessdate=31 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103100815/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=7923&amp;_t=Exclusive:+39+countries+to+be+represented+in+Oslo|archive-date=3 January 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since 1994 no country has won two years in a row, and semi-finals have also been won by different countries, until 2012 when Sweden won the second semi-final in 2011 and 2012. Although many of them used to give their 12 points to the same country each year, like Turkey and Azerbaijan, it has been noticed that factors such as the sets of other high votes received (7, 8 or 10 points) and the number of countries giving points to a specific entry, also highly affect the final positions.

An overview of the overall preference between countries that exhibits patterns of high score allocations is a question that appears frequently and recently a new study investigates the question of 'neglect' in the competition. The concept of 'neglect' here is represented by countries which produce patterns of biased low score allocations to certain countries. Together these two patterns provide a better view of the competition's intrinsic country pair biases. Result of such a study are presented in this paper.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mantzaris et al 2018&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/s42001-018-0020-2|title = Preference and neglect amongst countries in the Eurovision Song Contest| journal=Journal of Computational Social Science| volume=1| issue=2| pages=377–390|year = 2018|last1 = Mantzaris|first1 = Alexander V.| last2=Rein| first2=Samuel R.| last3=Hopkins| first3=Alexander D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the analysis it can be seen that countries which exhibit these biases do not receive a penalization from other participants and it presents itself as a means to accumulate more points by establishing these partnerships.

=== Running order of the participating songs ===

From 2013 onwards, the final and the semi-finals running order of the competing performances at the semi-finals and the final has been decided by the show's producers and then approved by the EBU Executive Supervisor and the Reference Group. An &quot;allocation draw&quot; occurs for the final and the semi-finals with each nation drawing to perform in the first or second half.&lt;ref name=&quot;follow_live_heads_of_delegations_meet_in_vienna&quot; /&gt; Prior to 2013, the order was decided at random (though when the host nation performs is still decided at random, to ensure fairness).&lt;ref name=follow_live_heads_of_delegations_meet_in_vienna&gt;{{cite web|title=Heads of Delegations meet in Vienna|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=follow_live_heads_of_delegations_meet_in_vienna|website=eurovision.tv|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=16 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316150354/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=follow_live_heads_of_delegations_meet_in_vienna|archive-date=16 March 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some statistical evidence that the contest's results were positively related to the running number in 2009–2012.&lt;ref name=order_effects&gt;{{cite web|title=Antipov, E.

Position 17 has the most victories, with 7. Positions 25, 26 and 27 have not won either, but there have been very few finals with that many participants.
