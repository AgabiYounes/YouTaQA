'''''EastEnders''''' is a [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[soap opera]] created by [[Julia Smith]] and [[Tony Holland]] which has been broadcast on [[BBC One]] since 1985. Set in [[Albert Square]] in the [[East End of London]] in the fictional Borough of [[Walford]], the programme follows the stories of local residents and their families as they go about their daily lives. Initially there were two 30-minute episodes per week, later increasing to three, but since 2001, episodes have been broadcast on every [[weekday]] except Wednesday (outside of special occasions).

Within eight months of the show's launch, it reached the number one spot in [[Broadcaster's Audience Research Board|BARB]]'s TV ratings and has consistently remained among the top rated series in Britain. In 2013, the average audience share for an episode was around 30 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a502337/coronation-street-79m-watch-paul-and-lloyds-showdown.html|title='Coronation Street': 7.9m watch Paul and Lloyd's showdown|website=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=9 August 2015|date=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, ''EastEnders'' remains a significant programme in terms of the BBC's success and audience share, and also in the history of British television drama, tackling many dilemmas that are considered to be controversial and [[taboo]] issues in [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]] and social life previously unseen on UK mainstream television.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Demory, Christopher Pullen (2013). &quot;Queer Love in Film and Television: Critical Essays&quot;. p. 35. Palgrave Macmillan,&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|September 2019}}, ''EastEnders'' has won ten [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA Awards]] and the [[Inside Soap]] Award for Best Soap for 14 years running (from 1997 to 2012),&lt;ref name=&quot;insidesoap&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5380486.stm|title=Rival soaps tie on awards night|date=26 September 2006|work=BBC News|location=London|quote=EastEnders won the top soap title for the 10th consecutive year, voted for by readers of Inside Soap magazine.|accessdate=4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as twelve [[National Television Awards]] for Most Popular Serial Drama&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltvawards.com/winners|title=Past Winners&amp;nbsp;– The National Television Awards 2011|website=[[National Television Awards]]|accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 11 awards for Best British Soap at the [[British Soap Awards]]. It has also won 13 TV Quick and TV Choice Awards for Best Soap, six [[TRIC Awards]] for Soap of The Year, four [[Royal Television Society]] Awards for Best Continuing Drama and has been inducted into the [[Rose d'Or]] Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4951052.stm|title=Rose D'Or honour for EastEnders|date=27 April 2006|work=BBC News|accessdate=4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Conception and preparations for broadcast ===
In March 1983, under two years before ''EastEnders''{{'}} first episode was broadcast, the show was a vague idea in the mind of a handful of BBC executives, who decided that what [[BBC1]] needed was a popular bi-weekly drama series that would attract the kind of mass audiences that ITV was getting with ''[[Coronation Street]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;20years p10&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2005|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first people to whom David Reid, then head of series and serials, turned were [[Julia Smith]] and [[Tony Holland]], a well established producer/script editor team who had first worked together on ''[[Z-Cars]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;20years p10&quot; /&gt; The outline that Reid presented was vague: two episodes a week, 52 weeks a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;20years p11&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2005|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the concept was put to them on 14 March 1983, Smith and Holland then went about putting their ideas down on paper; they decided it would be set in the East End of London.&lt;ref name=&quot;20years p10&quot; /&gt; [[Granada Television]] gave Smith unrestricted access to the ''Coronation Street'' production for a month so that she could get a sense how a continuing drama was produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=podcast |url=http://ax.itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/daily-bacon/id292077536 |title=Daily Bacon: Coronation Street |publisher=BBC Radio 5Live |author=Richard Bacon, host |date=17 November 2010 |accessdate=6 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303052823/http://ax.itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/daily-bacon/id292077536 |archivedate=3 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was anxiety at first that the viewing public would not accept a new soap set in the south of England, though research commissioned by lead figures in the BBC revealed that southerners would accept a northern soap, northerners would accept a southern soap and those from the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], as Julia Smith herself pointed out, did not mind where it was set as long as it was somewhere else.&lt;ref name=&quot;20years p11&quot; /&gt; This was the beginning of a close and continuing association between ''EastEnders'' and audience research, which, though commonplace today, was something of a revolution in practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;20years p11&quot; /&gt;

The show's creators were both Londoners, but when they researched Victorian squares, they found massive changes in areas they thought they knew well. However, delving further into the East End of London, they found exactly what they had been searching for: a real East End spirit—an inward-looking quality, a distrust of strangers and authority figures, a sense of territory and community that the creators summed up as &quot;Hurt one of us and you hurt us all&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;20years p11&quot; /&gt;

When developing ''EastEnders'', both Smith and Holland looked at influential models like ''Coronation Street'', but they found that it offered a rather outdated and nostalgic view of working-class life. Only after ''EastEnders'' began, and featured the characters of [[Tony Carpenter]] and [[Kelvin Carpenter]], did ''Coronation Street'' start to feature black characters, for example.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2001/02/03/bfpa03.xml Hole at the heart of the BBC]&quot;, ''The Telegraph''. Retrieved 25 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; They came to the conclusion that ''Coronation Street'' had grown old with its audience, and that ''EastEnders'' would have to attract a younger, more socially extensive audience, ensuring that it had the longevity to retain it for many years thereafter.&lt;ref name=&quot;20years&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2005|p=&lt;!-- Page numbers needed --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also looked at ''[[Brookside]]'' but found there was a lack of central meeting points for the characters, making it difficult for the writers to intertwine different storylines, so ''EastEnders'' was set in [[Albert Square]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Public secrets page 15&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Buckingham|1987|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A previous UK soap set in an East End market was [[Associated TeleVision|ATV]]'s ''[[Market in Honey Lane]]'' between 1967 and 1969. However this show, which graduated from one showing a week to two in three separate series (the latter series being shown in different time slots across the ITV network) was very different in style and approach to ''EastEnders''. The British Film Institute described ''Market In Honey Lane'' thus: &quot;It was not an earth-shaking programme, and certainly not pioneering in any revolutionary ideas in technique and production, but simply proposed itself to the casual viewer as a mildly pleasant affair.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Market on Honey Lane / Honey Lane (1967–69)|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1400806/index.html|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''EastEnders'', while also featuring an East End street market, would be very different in its approach and impact.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The target launch date was originally January 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;Insidestory p24&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith and Holland had eleven months in which to write, cast and shoot the whole thing. However, in February 1984, they did not even have a title or a place to film. Both Smith and Holland were unhappy about the January 1985 launch date, favouring November or even September 1984 when seasonal audiences would be higher, but the BBC stayed firm, and Smith and Holland had to concede that, with the massive task of getting the Elstree Studios operational, January was the most realistic date. However, this was later to be changed to February.&lt;ref name=&quot;Insidestory p24&quot; /&gt;

The project had a number of working titles—''Square Dance'', ''Round the Square'', ''Round the Houses'', ''London Pride'' and ''East 8''.&lt;ref name=&quot;eehistory&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/backstage/crew/qa/qa_content/qa_0005.shtml|title= What is the history of ''EastEnders''?]|work=BBC Online|accessdate=13 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219122918/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/backstage/crew/qa/qa_content/qa_0005.shtml|archivedate=19 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the latter that stuck (E8 is the postcode for Hackney) in the early months of creative process.&lt;ref name=&quot;20years p15&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2005|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the show was renamed after many casting agents mistakenly thought the show was to be called ''Estate'', and the fictional postcode E20 was created, instead of using E8.&lt;ref name=&quot;20years p15&quot; /&gt; Julia Smith came up with the name ''Eastenders'' after she and Holland had spent months telephoning theatrical agents and asking &quot;Do you have any real East Enders on your books?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;20years p15&quot; /&gt; However, Smith thought &quot;''Eastenders''&quot; &quot;looked ugly written down&quot; and was &quot;hard to say&quot;, so decided to capitalise the second 'e'.&lt;ref name=&quot;20years p15&quot; /&gt;

==== Initial character creation and casting ====
[[File:Dot Lou Ethel ee.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dot Cotton]], [[Ethel Skinner]] and [[Lou Beale]] were Walford's original pensioners.|alt=refer to caption]]
After they decided on the filming location of [[BBC Elstree Centre]] in [[Hertfordshire]], Smith and Holland set about creating the 23 characters needed, in just 14 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Insidestory p164&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; They took a holiday in Playa de los Pocillos, [[Lanzarote]], and started to create the characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Insidestory p48&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holland created the [[Beale family|Beale and Fowler family]], drawing on his own background. His mother, Ethel Holland, was one of four sisters raised in Walthamstow. Her eldest sister, Lou, had married a man named Albert Beale and had two children, named Peter and Pauline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Insidestory p49&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; These family members were the basis for [[Lou Beale]], [[Pete Beale]] and [[Pauline Fowler]]. Holland also created Pauline's unemployed husband [[Arthur Fowler]], their children [[Mark Fowler]] and [[Michelle Fowler]], Pete's wife [[Kathy Beale]] and their son [[Ian Beale]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Insidestory p51-56&quot; /&gt; Smith used her personal memories of East End residents she met when researching Victorian squares.&lt;ref name=&quot;Insidestory p15&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethel Skinner]] was based on an old woman she met in a pub, with ill-fitting false teeth, and a &quot;face to rival a neon sign&quot;, holding a [[Yorkshire Terrier]] in one hand and a pint of [[Guinness]] in the other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Insidestory p52&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other characters created included Jewish doctor [[Harold Legg]], the Anglo-Cypriot Osman family, [[Ali Osman]], [[Sue Osman]] and baby [[Hassan Osman]], black father and son, [[Tony Carpenter]] and [[Kelvin Carpenter]], single mother [[Mary Smith (EastEnders)|Mary Smith]] and Bangladeshi couple [[Saeed Jeffery]] and [[Naima Jeffery]]. Jack, Pearl and Tracey Watts were created to bring &quot;flash, trash, and melodrama&quot; to the Square (they were later renamed [[Den Watts|Den]], [[Angie Watts|Angie]] and [[Sharon Watts]]). The characters of [[Andy O'Brien (EastEnders)|Andy O'Brien]] and [[Debbie Wilkins]] were created to show a modern couple with outwardly mobile pretensions, and [[Lofty Holloway]] to show an outsider; someone who did not fit in with other residents. It was decided that he would be a former soldier, as Holland's personal experiences of ex-soldiers were that they had trouble fitting into society after being in the army. When they compared the characters they had created, Smith and Holland realised they had created a cross-section of East End residents. The Beale and Fowler family represented the old families of the East End, who had always been there. The Osmans, Jefferys and Carpenters represented the more modern diverse ethnic community of the East End. Debbie, Andy and Mary represented more modern-day individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;20years&quot; /&gt;

Once they had decided on their 23 characters, they returned to London for a meeting with the BBC. Everyone agreed that ''EastEnders'' would be tough, violent on occasion, funny and sharp—set in [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s Britain—and it would start with a bang (namely the death of [[Reg Cox]]). They decided that none of their existing characters were wicked enough to have killed Reg, so a 24th character, [[Nick Cotton]] was added to the line-up. He was a racist thug, who often tried to lead other young characters astray.&lt;ref name=&quot;20years p20&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2005|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; When all the characters had been created, Smith and Holland set about casting the actors for the show.

==== Final preparations ====
[[File:Eastendersearly.jpg|thumb|right|''EastEnders'' original titles sequence, 1985–1993|alt=refer to caption]]
Through the next few months, the set was growing rapidly at Elstree, and a composer and designer had been commissioned to create the title sequence. [[Simon May]] wrote the [[EastEnders theme tune|theme music]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/backstage/crew/qa/qa_content/qa_0008.shtml |title=Who wrote the thee tune?|work=BBC Online|accessdate=29 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Alan Jeapes created the visuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Insidestory p97&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visual images were taken from an aircraft flying over the East End of London at 1000 feet. Approximately 800 photographs were taken and pieced together to create one big image.&lt;ref name=&quot;Opening credits&quot; /&gt; The credits were later updated when the [[Millennium Dome]] was built.&lt;ref name=&quot;Opening credits&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/backstage/crew/qa/qa_content/qa_0001.shtml|title=How did you get the view of London used on the opening credits?|website=EastEnders|publisher=BBC Online|accessdate=13 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831031758/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/backstage/crew/qa/qa_content/qa_0001.shtml|archivedate=31 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch was delayed until February 1985&lt;ref name=&quot;Insidestory p154&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to a delay in the chat show ''Wogan'', that was to be a part of the major revamp in BBC1's schedules. Smith was uneasy about the late start as ''EastEnders'' no longer had the winter months to build up a loyal following before the summer ratings lull. The press were invited to Elstree to meet the cast and see the lot, and stories immediately started circulating about the show, about a rivalry with [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] (who were launching their own market-based soap, ''[[Albion Market]]'') and about the private lives of the cast.&lt;ref name=&quot;20years page 17&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2005|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anticipation and rumour grew in equal measure until the first transmission at 7{{nbsp}}p.m. on 19 February 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;20years page 17&quot; /&gt; Both Holland and Smith could not watch; they both instead returned to the place where it all began, Albertine's Wine Bar on Wood Lane.&lt;ref name=&quot;20years page 17&quot; /&gt; The next day, viewing figures were confirmed at 17{{nbsp}}million.&lt;ref name=&quot;20years page 17&quot; /&gt; The reviews were largely favourable,&lt;ref name=&quot;20years page 17&quot; /&gt; although, after three weeks on air, BBC1's early evening share had returned to the pre-''EastEnders'' figure of seven million, though ''EastEnders'' then climbed to highs of up to 23{{nbsp}}million later on in the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rating 1986&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Slide|1996|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the launch, both group discussions and telephone surveys were conducted to test audience reaction to early episodes. Detailed reactions were taken after six months and since then regular monitoring was conducted.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

=== 1980s broadcast history ===
Press coverage of ''EastEnders'', which was already intense, went into overdrive once the show was broadcast. With public interest so high, the media began investigating the private lives of the show's popular stars. Within days, a scandalous headline appeared – &quot;EASTENDERS STAR IS A KILLER&quot;. This referred to [[Leslie Grantham]], and his prison sentence for the murder of a taxi driver in an attempted robbery nearly 20 years earlier. This shocking tell-all style set the tone for relations between [[Albert Square]] and the press for the next 20 years.

The show's first episode attracted some 17{{nbsp}}million viewers, and it continued to attract high viewing figures from then on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/feb/08/eastenders-bbc-25-years | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Dan | last=Sabbagh | title=Is EastEnders the lifeblood of the BBC? | date=8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By Christmas 1985, the tabloids could not get enough of the soap. 'Exclusives' about ''EastEnders'' storylines and the actors on the show became a staple of tabloid buyers’ daily reading.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Writer [[Colin Brake]] suggested that 1989 was a year of big change for ''EastEnders'', both behind the cameras and in front of them. Original production designer, Keith Harris, left the show, and Holland and Smith both decided that the time had come to move on too; their final contribution coinciding with the exit of one of ''EastEnders''' most successful characters, Den Watts ([[Leslie Grantham]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;first10years&quot; /&gt; Producer [[Mike Gibbon]] was given the task of running the show and he enlisted the most experienced writers to take over the storylining of the programme, including Charlie Humphreys, Jane Hollowood and [[Tony McHale]].&lt;ref name=&quot;First10Years p70&quot; /&gt;

According to Brake, the departure of two of the soap's most popular characters, Den and Angie Watts ([[Anita Dobson]]), left a void in the programme, which needed to be filled.&lt;ref name=&quot;first10years&quot; /&gt; In addition, several other long-running characters left the show that year including Sue and Ali Osman ([[Sandy Ratcliff]] and [[Nejdet Salih]]) and their family; [[Donna Ludlow]] ([[Matilda Ziegler]]); [[Carmel Jackson]] ([[Judith Jacob]]) and [[Colin Russell (EastEnders)|Colin Russell]] ([[Michael Cashman]]). Brake indicated that the production team decided that 1989 was to be a year of change in Walford, commenting, &quot;it was almost as if Walford itself was making a fresh start&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;First10Years p75-76&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|pp=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1989 ''EastEnders'' had acquired a new executive producer, [[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]], who had previously been a successful producer on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[The Bill]]''. Brake suggested that Ferguson was responsible for bringing in a new sense of vitality and creating a programme that was more in touch with the real world than it had been over the previous year.&lt;ref name=&quot;First10Years p70&quot; /&gt;

=== Changes in the 1990s ===

=== 2000s ===
[[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]] became the Executive Producer of ''EastEnders'' in 2000. Yorke was given the task of introducing the soap's fourth weekly episode. He axed the majority of the Di Marco family and helped introduce popular characters such as the [[Slater family (EastEnders)|Slater family]]. As what [[Mal Young]] described as &quot;two of ''EastEnders''' most successful years&quot;, Yorke was responsible for highly rated storylines such as &quot;[[Who Shot Phil?]]&quot;, [[Ethel Skinner]]'s death, [[Jim Branning]] and [[Dot Cotton]]'s marriage, [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor Morgan]]'s domestic abuse of his wife [[Little Mo Morgan]], and [[Kat Slater]]'s revelation to her daughter [[Zoe Slater]] that she was her mother.

In 2002, [[Louise Berridge]] succeeded Yorke as the Executive Producer. During her time at ''EastEnders'', Berridge introduced popular characters such as [[Alfie Moon]], [[Dennis Rickman]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Berridge exit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Louise Berridge steps down as Executive Producer of EastEnders|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/09_september/21/berridge.shtml|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=1 May 2017|date=21 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chrissie Watts]], [[Jane Beale]], [[Stacey Slater]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Louise Berridge Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Ellie caught up with the former Executive Producer to talk EastEnders and find out what Louise has got up to since leaving the show|url=http://walfordweb.com/blog/entry/3788441/635468/|publisher=walfordweb.com|accessdate=28 May 2017|date=3 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519090209/http://walfordweb.com/blog/entry/3788441/635468|archive-date=19 May 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the critically panned Indian [[Ferreira family]].&lt;ref name=&quot;guard&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/sep/21/broadcasting.bbc|title= EastEnders chief steps down|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date = 21 September 2004| accessdate=18 March 2008 | location=London | first=John | last=Plunkett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berridge was responsible for some ratings success stories, such as Alfie and [[Kat Slater]]'s relationship, [[Janine Butcher]] getting her comeuppance, [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor Morgan]] and [[Jamie Mitchell]]'s death storylines and the return of one of the greatest soap icons, [[Den Watts]], who had been presumed dead for 14 years. His return in late 2003 was watched by over 16 million viewers, putting ''EastEnders'' back at number one in the rating war with the ''Coronation Street''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3151484.stm Sixteen million watch Den's return]&quot;, ''BBC''.

On 21 September 2004, Berridge quit as executive producer of ''EastEnders'' following continued criticism of the show. [[Kathleen Hutchison]] was swiftly appointed as the Executive Producer of ''EastEnders'', and was tasked with quickly turning the fortunes of the soap. During her time at the soap Hutchison axed multiple characters, and reportedly ordered the rewriting of numerous scripts.

Santer also reintroduced past and popular characters to the programme.

In 2009, producers introduced a limit on the number of speaking parts in each episode due to budget cuts, with an average of 16 characters per episode. The decision was criticised by Martin McGrath of Equity, who said: &quot;Trying to produce quality TV on the cheap is doomed to fail.&quot; The BBC responded by saying they had been working that way for some time and it had not affected the quality of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a182543/eastenders-limit-episodes-to-16-actors.html|title='EastEnders' limit episodes to 16 actors|first=Catriona|last=wightman|website=[[Digital Spy]]|date=18 October 2009|accessdate=21 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He told entertainment website [[Digital Spy]], &quot;It's really important that the feel of the week is active and exciting and not too reflective. There'll be those moments for some of our longer-serving characters that briefly reflect on themselves and how they've changed.

In late 2016, popularity and viewership of ''EastEnders'' began to decline, with viewers criticising the  storylines during the O'Connor reign, such as the killing of the Mitchell sisters and a storyline centred around the local bin collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/amphtml/elliewoodward/eastenders-has-an-ongoing-storyline-about-bins-and-its-fucki|title=&quot;EastEnders&quot; Has A Storyline About Bins And It's Driving Everyone Fucking Insane|last=Woodward|first=Ellie|date=2016-11-02|website=[[Buzzfeed]]|url-status=live|access-date=2019-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, since Yorke and Oates' reigns, opinions towards the storylines have become more favourable, with storylines such as [[Ruby Allen]]’s ([[Louisa Lytton]]) sexual consent, which featured [[Episode 5820|a special episode]] which &quot;broke new ground&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dainty episode&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/a871649/eastenders-review-ruby-allen-rape-consent-episode/|title=Why EastEnders has broken new ground with Ruby Allen's consent episode|last1=Dainty|first1=Sophie|date=29 November 2018|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=29 December 2018|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and knife crime, both of which have created &quot;vital&quot; discussions. The soap won the award for Best Continuing Drama at the [[2019 British Academy Television Awards]]; its first high profile award since 2016. However, in June 2019, ''EastEnders'' suffered its lowest ever ratings of 2.4 million due to its airing at 7pm because of the BBC’s coverage of the [[2019 FIFA Women's World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/eastenders-coronation-street-and-x-factor-decline-is-driving-down-tv-viewing-figures/|title=EastEnders, Coronation Street and The X Factor decline is driving down TV viewing figures|last=Sherwin|first=Adam|date=2018-07-18|website=[[i (newspaper)|i]]|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2019, the soap is one of the most watched series on [[BBC iPlayer]] and averages around 5 million viewers per episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.barb.co.uk/viewing-data/four-screen-dashboard/|title=Four-screen dashboard – BARB|publisher=[[Broadcasters Audience Research Board]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishnews.com/magazine/entertainment/2017/10/19/news/eastenders-is-ratings-success-on-bbc-iplayer-1167215/|title=EastEnders is ratings success on BBC iPlayer|date=2017-10-19|website=[[The Irish News]]|access-date=2019-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soap enjoyed a record-breaking year on the streaming platform in 2019, with viewers requesting to stream or download the show 234 million times, up 10% on 2018.{{Fact|date=February 2020}} The Christmas Day episode in 2019 became ''EastEnders'' biggest ever episode on BBC iPlayer, with 2.14 million viewer requests.{{Fact|date=February 2020}}

== Setting ==
[[File:The Queen Vic.jpg|right|thumb|[[The Queen Victoria]] Public House (as it looked from November 1992 to September 2010) is the main focus point of Albert Square (''pictured'').|alt=refer to caption]]
The central focus of ''EastEnders'' is the fictional [[Victorian era|Victorian]] square [[Albert Square]] in the fictional [[Walford|London Borough of Walford]]. In the show's narrative, Albert Square is a 19th-century street, named after [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Albert]] (1819–1861), the husband of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] (1819–1901, reigned 1837–1901). Thus, central to Albert Square is [[The Queen Victoria]] Public House (also known as The Queen Vic or The Vic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/haveyoursay/yourquestions/yourq_content/yourq_queen_vic.shtml |title= What's the history of the Queen Vic? |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061220221434/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/haveyoursay/yourquestions/yourq_content/yourq_queen_vic.shtml |archivedate=20 December 2006|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's producers based the square's design on [[Fassett Square]] in [[Dalston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hackney.gov.uk/xp-factsandfigures-placesfaces.htm|title=Interesting Places and Famous Faces|publisher=Hackney Borough Council|accessdate=13 December 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304201727/http://www.hackney.gov.uk/xp-factsandfigures-placesfaces.htm#.WMSKuNKLSpo|archivedate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a market close to Fassett Square at [[Ridley Road Market|Ridley Road]].

The bridge is based upon one near [[BBC Television Centre]] which carries the Hammersmith &amp; City tube line over Wood Lane W12, the Queen Vic on the former College Park Hotel pub in Willesden at the end of Scrubs Lane at the junction with Harrow Road NW10 just a couple of miles from BBC Television Centre,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Set Of EastEnders&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Venables|first1=Ben|title=The Story Behind The Set Of EastEnders|url=http://londonist.com/2015/01/exclusive-the-story-behind-the-sets-of-eastenders|publisher=Londonist|accessdate=22 December 2016|date=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the interior to the Fowlers' is based on a house in Manor Road, Colchester, close to where the supervising art director lived.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The fictional local newspaper, the ''Walford Gazette'', in which local news events such as the arrests or murders of characters appear, mirrors the real ''[[Hackney Gazette]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}&lt;!--in-merger from [[The Walford Gazette]]--&gt;

Walford East is a fictional tube station for Walford, and a tube map that was first seen on air in 1996 showed Walford East between [[Bow Road tube station|Bow Road]] and [[West Ham tube station|West Ham]], in the actual location of [[Bromley-by-Bow tube station|Bromley-by-Bow]] on the [[District line|District]] and [[Hammersmith &amp; City line|Hammersmith &amp; City]] lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://underground-history.co.uk/walford.php |title=Underground EastEnders|publisher=Underground History|accessdate=4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walford has the [[postal district]] of E20. It was named as if Walford were part of the actual [[E postcode area]] which covers much of east London,&lt;ref&gt;Royal Mail, ''Address Management Guide'', (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; the ''E'' standing for ''Eastern''.&lt;ref name=inner&gt;HMSO, ''The Inner London Letter Post'', (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; E20 was entirely fictional when it was created, as London East postal districts stopped at E18 at the time. The show's creators opted for E20 instead of E19 as it was thought to sound better.&lt;ref name=&quot;Street Names&quot; /&gt; The numbering system in real life comes from the alphabetised names of the main [[sorting office]] for each district.&lt;ref name=bpma&gt;{{cite web|publisher=British Postal Museum and Archive |url=http://www.postalheritage.org.uk/history/downloads/BPMA_Info_Sheet_Postcodes_web.pdf |title=Archive Information Sheet: Postcodes |accessdate=5 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320052708/http://www.postalheritage.org.uk/history/downloads/BPMA_Info_Sheet_Postcodes_web.pdf |archivedate=20 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If part of this real-life classification, Walford would have been assigned E17, which is the actual postcode district for [[Walthamstow]].

== Characters ==
{{See|List of EastEnders characters|List of past EastEnders characters}}
''EastEnders'' is built around the idea of relationships and strong families, with each character having a place in the community. This theme encompasses the whole Square, making the entire community a family of sorts, prey to upsets and conflict, but pulling together in times of trouble. Co-creator [[Tony Holland]] was from a large East End family, and such families have typified ''EastEnders''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Insidestory p49&quot; /&gt; The first central family was the combination of the [[Fowler family]], consisting of [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]), her husband [[Arthur Fowler|Arthur]] ([[Bill Treacher]]), and teenage children [[Mark Fowler|Mark]] ([[David Scarboro]]/[[Todd Carty]]) and [[Michelle Fowler|Michelle]] ([[Susan Tully]]). Pauline's family, the [[Beale family|Beales]], consisted of Pauline's twin brother [[Pete Beale]] ([[Peter Dean (actor)|Peter Dean]]), his wife [[Kathy Beale|Kathy]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]) and their teenage son [[Ian Beale|Ian]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]). Pauline and Pete's domineering mother [[Lou Beale]] ([[Anna Wing]]) lived with Pauline and her family. Holland drew on the names of his own family for the characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Insidestory p51-56&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|pp=51–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Watts family|Watts]] and [[Mitchell family|Mitchell]] families have been central to many notable ''EastEnders'' storylines, the show having been dominated by the Watts in the 1980s, with the 1990s focusing on the Mitchells. The early 2000s saw a shift in attention towards the newly introduced female [[Slater family (EastEnders)|Slater clan]], before a renewal of emphasis upon the restored Watts family beginning in 2003. Since 2006, ''EastEnders'' has largely been dominated by the Mitchell, Ahmed and [[Branning family|Branning]] families, though the early 2010s also saw a renewed focus on the Moon family, and from 2013 onwards, on the Carters. In 2014, the [[Fowler family|Fowlers]] were revived and merged with the Slaters, with [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]) marrying [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]). The Taylor family were introduced in 2017 and have been central to the show's main storylines. Key people involved in the production of ''EastEnders'' have stressed how important the idea of strong families is to the programme.&lt;ref name=&quot;Insidestory p49&quot; /&gt;

''EastEnders'' has an emphasis on strong family [[matriarch]]s, with examples including [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]) and [[Peggy Mitchell]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]), helping to attract a female audience.

A gender balance in the show is maintained via the inclusion of various &quot;macho&quot; male personalities such as [[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]), [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]), [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]), [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]) and [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]), &quot;bad boys&quot; such as [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]), [[Sean Slater]] ([[Robert Kazinsky]]), [[Michael Moon (EastEnders)|Michael Moon]] ([[Steve John Shepherd]]) and [[Vincent Hubbard]] ([[Richard Blackwood]]), and &quot;heartthrobs&quot; such as [[Simon Wicks]] ([[Nick Berry]]), [[Jamie Mitchell]] ([[Jack Ryder (actor)|Jack Ryder]]), [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]), [[Joey Branning]] ([[David Witts]]), [[Kush Kazemi]] ([[Davood Ghadami]]) and [[Keanu Taylor]] ([[Danny Walters (actor)|Danny Walters]]).

Over the years ''EastEnders'' has typically featured a number of elderly residents, who are used to show vulnerability, [[nostalgia]], stalwart-like attributes and are sometimes used for comedic purposes. The original elderly residents included [[Lou Beale]] ([[Anna Wing]]), [[Ethel Skinner]] ([[Gretchen Franklin]]) and [[Dot Cotton]] ([[June Brown]]).

In the main, middle-class characters exist as villains, such as [[James Wilmott-Brown]] ([[William Boyde]]), [[May Wright]] ([[Amanda Drew]]), [[Stella Crawford]] ([[Sophie Thompson]]) and [[Yusef Khan]] ([[Ace Bhatti]]) or are used to promote positive liberal influences, such as [[Colin Russell (EastEnders)|Colin Russell]] ([[Michael Cashman]]) or [[Rachel Kominski]] ([[Jacquetta May]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;redpepper&quot; /&gt;

''EastEnders'' has always featured a culturally diverse cast which has included [[black people|black]], Asian, [[Turkish people|Turkish]], Polish and Latvian characters. &quot;The expansion of minority representation signals a move away from the traditional soap opera format, providing more opportunities for audience identification with the characters and hence a wider appeal&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/eastenders.htm |title=EastEnders |website=museum.tv |first=Danielle |last=Aron |first2=Sonia |last2=Livingston |accessdate=5 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330071515/http://www.museum.tv/eotv/eastenders.htm |archive-date=30 March 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060412075647/http://www.cre.gov.uk/Default.aspx.LocID-0hgnew06m.RefLocID-0hg00900c008.Lang-EN.htm |url=http://www.cre.gov.uk/Default.aspx.LocID-0hgnew06m.RefLocID-0hg00900c008.Lang-EN.htm |archivedate=12 April 2006|title= Coronation Street and EastEnders battle it out for coveted CRE Race in the Media Award|publisher=cre.gov.uk|accessdate=27 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the programme has been criticised by the [[Commission for Racial Equality]], who argued in 2002 that ''EastEnders'' was not giving a realistic representation of the East End's &quot;ethnic make-up&quot;. They suggested that the average proportion of visible minority faces on ''EastEnders'' was substantially lower than the actual ethnic minority population in East London boroughs, and it therefore reflected the East End in the 1960s, not the East End of the 2000s. The programme has since attempted to address these issues. A [[sari]] shop was opened and various characters of different ethnicities were introduced throughout 2006 and 2007, including the Fox family, the Ahmeds, and various background artists.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/oct/08/mondaymediasection12 The art of storytelling]&quot;, ''The Guardian''.

You have to show shades of that change, but certain things are immutable, I would argue, like The Vic and the market.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Not realistic&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/news/a318721/eastenders-walford-not-realistic-says-bbc-boss/|title='EastEnders' Walford not realistic, says BBC boss|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=10 May 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, ''EastEnders'' featured &quot;gritty&quot; storylines involving drugs and crime, representing the issues faced by working-class Britain under [[Thatcherism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barker|1997|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storylines included the cot death of 14-month-old [[Hassan Osman]], [[Nick Cotton]]'s ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]) [[homophobia]], racism and murder of [[Reg Cox]] (Johnnie Clayton),&lt;ref name=&quot;issues&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/haveyoursay/yourquestions/yourq_content/yourq_issues.shtml |title= Which issues have been highlighted by ''EastEnders''? |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223225130/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/haveyoursay/yourquestions/yourq_content/yourq_issues.shtml |archivedate=23 February 2007|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Fowler]]'s ([[Bill Treacher]]) unemployment reflecting the recession of the 1980s, the rape of [[Kathy Beale]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]) in 1988 by [[James Willmott-Brown]] ([[William Boyde]])&lt;ref name=&quot;issues&quot; /&gt; and [[Michelle Fowler]]'s ([[Susan Tully]]) teenage pregnancy. The show also dealt with prostitution, mixed-race relationships, shoplifting, sexism, divorce, domestic violence and mugging. In 1989, the programme came under criticism in the British media for being too depressing, and according to writer [[Colin Brake]], the programme makers were determined to change this.&lt;ref name=&quot;First10Years p70&quot; /&gt; In 1989, there was a deliberate attempt to increase the lighter, more comic aspects of life in Albert Square. This led to the introduction of some characters who were deliberately conceived as comic or light-hearted.&lt;ref name=&quot;First10Years p70&quot; /&gt; Brake suggested that humour was an important element in ''EastEnders''{{'}} storylines during 1989, with a greater amount of slapstick and light comedy than before. He classed 1989's changes as a brave experiment, and suggested that while some found this period of ''EastEnders'' entertaining, many other viewers felt that the comedy stretched the programme's credibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;First10Years p70&quot; /&gt; Although the programme still covered many issues in 1989, such as domestic violence, drugs, rape and racism, Brake reflected that the new emphasis on a more balanced mix between &quot;light and heavy storylines&quot; gave the illusion that the show had lost a &quot;certain edge&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;First10Years p70&quot; /&gt;

As the show progressed into the 1990s, ''EastEnders'' still featured hard-hitting issues such as [[Mark Fowler]] ([[Todd Carty]]) revealing he was [[HIV]] positive&lt;ref name=&quot;issues&quot; /&gt; in 1991, the death of his wife [[Gill Fowler|Gill]] (Susanna Dawson) from an AIDS-related illness in 1992, murder, [[adoption]], [[abortion]], [[Peggy Mitchell]]'s ([[Barbara Windsor]]) battle with [[breast cancer]],&lt;ref name=&quot;issues&quot; /&gt; and [[Phil Mitchell]]'s ([[Steve McFadden]]) alcoholism and violence towards wife Kathy. [[mental disorder|Mental health issues]] were confronted in 1996 when 16-year-old [[Joe Wicks]] developed [[schizophrenia]] following the off-screen death of his sister in a car crash. The long-running storyline of Mark Fowler's HIV was so successful in raising awareness that in 1999, a survey by the National Aids Trust found teenagers got most of their information about HIV from the soap, though one campaigner noted that in some ways the storyline was not reflective of what was happening at the time as the condition was more common among the [[gay community]]. Still, heterosexual Mark struggled with various issues connected to his HIV status, including public fears of contamination, a marriage breakdown connected to his inability to have children and the side effects of combination therapies.&lt;ref name=&quot;ko&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2580435.stm|title=EastEnders' Mark to be killed off|publisher=BBC|date=16 December 2002|accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s, ''EastEnders'' covered the issue of [[euthanasia]]  with [[Ethel Skinner]]'s ([[Gretchen Franklin]]) death in a pact with her friend [[Dot Cotton]] ([[June Brown]]), the unveiling of [[Kat Slater]]'s ([[Jessie Wallace]]) [[Child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]] by her uncle [[Harry Slater (EastEnders)|Harry]] ([[Michael Elphick]]) as a child (which led to the birth of her daughter [[Zoe Slater|Zoe]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]), who had been brought up to believe that Kat was her sister), the [[domestic abuse]] of [[Little Mo Mitchell|Little Mo Morgan]] ([[Kacey Ainsworth]]) by husband [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor]] ([[Alex Ferns]]) (which involved [[marital rape]] and culminated in Trevor's death after he tried to kill Little Mo in a fire),&lt;ref name=&quot;issues&quot; /&gt; [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia Jackson]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]) giving birth at the age of 15 and then putting her baby up for adoption, and [[Janine Butcher]]'s ([[Charlie Brooks]]) [[prostitution]], [[agoraphobia]] and [[drug addiction]]. The soap also tackled the issue of mental illness and carers of people who have mental conditions, illustrated with mother and daughter [[Jean Slater|Jean]] ([[Gillian Wright]]) and [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]); Jean suffers from [[bipolar disorder]], and teenage daughter Stacey was her carer (this storyline won a Mental Health Media Award in September 2006&lt;ref name=&quot;mental&quot;&gt;&quot;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070207053634/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/news/news_content/news_20060905_n1.shtml Mental Health Media Awards 2006]&quot; BBC.

Aside from this, soap opera staples of youthful romance, jealousy, domestic rivalry, gossip and extramarital affairs are regularly featured, with high-profile storylines occurring several times a year. [[Whodunit]]s also feature regularly, including the &quot;[[Who Shot Phil?]]&quot; story arc in 2001 that attracted over 19 million viewers and was one of the biggest successes in British soap television; the &quot;[[Who Killed Archie?]]&quot; storyline, which was revealed in a special live episode of the show that drew a peak of 17 million viewers; and the &quot;[[Who Killed Lucy Beale?]]&quot; saga.

=== Set ===
[[File:EastEnders set.jpg|thumb|The Butcher/Jackson living room in 2008.|alt=refer to caption]]
The exterior set for the fictional Albert Square is located in the permanent [[backlot]] of the [[BBC Elstree Centre]], [[Borehamwood]], [[Hertfordshire]], at {{coord|51|39|32|N|0|16|40|W|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline}}, and is outdoors and open to the weather.&lt;ref name=&quot;Set&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=EastEnders Set|url=https://www.google.com/maps/@51.6586784,-0.2775168,70m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en-GB|publisher=[[Google Maps]]|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially built in 1984 with a specification that it should last for at least 15 years at a cost of £750,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kingsley|1991|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''EastEnders'' lot was designed by Keith Harris, who was a senior designer within the production team together with supervising art directors Peter Findley and Gina Parr.&lt;ref name=&quot;Londonist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Venables|first1=Ben|title=The Story Behind The Set Of EastEnders|url=http://londonist.com/2015/01/exclusive-the-story-behind-the-sets-of-eastenders|publisher=[[londonist]]|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main buildings on the square consisted originally of hollow shells, constructed from marine plywood facades mounted onto steel frames.&lt;ref name=&quot;20years p146&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2005|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower walls, pavements, etc., were constructed of real brick and tarmac. The set had to be made to look as if it had been standing for years. This was done by a number of means, including chipping the pavements, using chemicals to crack the top layer of the paint work, using varnish to create damp patches underneath the railway bridge, and making garden walls in such a way they appeared to sag.&lt;ref name=&quot;1987 Annual p43&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Barraclough|1986|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final touches were added in summer 1984, these included a [[telephone box]], [[telegraph pole]] that was provided by [[British Telecom]], [[lamppost]]s that were provided by [[Hertsmere Borough Council]] and a number of vehicles parked on the square.&lt;ref name=&quot;1987 Annual p43&quot; /&gt; On each set all the appliances are fully functional such as gas cookers, the laundry washing machines and [[The Queen Victoria]] beer pumps.&lt;ref name=&quot;1987 Annual p43&quot; /&gt;

The walls were intentionally built crooked to give them an aged appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;20years p146&quot; /&gt; The drains around the set are real so rainwater can naturally flow from the streets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Insidestory p43&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The square was built in two phases with only three sides being built, plus Bridge Street, to begin with in 1984, in time to be used for the show's first episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;Insidestory p95&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1986, Harris added an extension to the set, building the fourth side of Albert Square, and in 1987, Turpin Road began to be featured more, which included buildings such as The Dagmar.&lt;ref name=&quot;First10Years p19-20&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, George Street was added, and soon after [[Walford East tube station|Walford East Underground station]] was built, to create further locations when ''EastEnders'' went from two to three episodes per week. The set was constructed by the BBC in-house construction department under construction manager Mike Hagan. The initial build took six months to complete.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Most of the buildings on Albert Square have no interior filming space, with a few exceptions, and most do not have rears or gardens. Most areas by the front (and sometimes back) doors are decorated and dressed to match the interior set to allow shots of doors being opened.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} The grocery shop was originally open fronted, it was turned into a closed front shop, with removable interior walls to allow for filming inside the shop when the set was expanded in 1987.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Some interior shots are filmed in the actual buildings, and the café also has some interior decoration so some limited filming can take place by the door.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} The newer exterior sets including fish and chip shop, video shop and beauty salon had some interior filming space to create a greater sense of realism.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} As the show is filmed up to six weeks in advance, the trees need to have extra leaves stuck on them during the spring to make them look like they would in summer.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In February 2008, it was reported that the set would transfer to [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], where a new set would be built&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article3386610.ece |title=Sets too shabby for latest TVs force EastEnders out of town|date=18 February 2008|work=Times Online|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013170154/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article3386610.ece|archivedate=13 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the set was looking &quot;shabby&quot;, with its flaws showing up on [[high-definition television]] broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Chris|title=High-definition television forces BBC to fix sets|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/high-definition-television-forces-bbc-to-fix-its-sets-1757472.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=1 May 2017|date=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by April 2010 a follow-up report confirmed that Albert Square would remain at Elstree Studios for at least another four years, taking the set through its 25th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/apr/28/eastenders-elstree-studios EastEnders to stay at Elstree Studios] Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; The set was consequently rebuilt for high definition on the same site, using mostly real brick with some areas using a new improved plastic brick. Throughout rebuilding filming would still take place, and so scaffolding was often seen on screen during the process, with some storylines written to accommodate the rebuilding, such as the [[Queen Vic Fire Week|Queen Vic fire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Set Support Eastenders|url=http://www.mediastructures.co.uk/portfolio/tv-set-support-eastenders/|publisher=Media Structures Ltd|accessdate=5 May 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230160331/http://www.mediastructures.co.uk/portfolio/tv-set-support-eastenders/|archivedate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, then executive producer [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]] said that he wanted Albert Square to look like a real-life east London neighbourhood so that the soap would &quot;better reflect the more fashionable areas of east London beloved of young professionals&quot; giving a flavour of the &quot;creeping gentrification&quot; of east London. He added: &quot;It should feel more like London. It's been frozen in aspic for too long.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-the-papers-25922416|title=EastEnders makes a move upmarket|publisher=BBC|date=28 January 2014|accessdate=3 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC announced that they would rebuild the ''EastEnders'' set&lt;ref name=&quot;digitalspy.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/news/a546056/eastenders-announces-plans-to-build-new-exterior-set-at-elstree/|title=EastEnders announces plans to build new exterior set at Elstree|website=Digital Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt; to secure the long-term future of the show, with completion expected to be in 2018. The set will provide a modern, upgraded exterior filming resource for ''EastEnders'', and will copy the appearance of the existing buildings. However, it will be 20 per cent bigger, in order to enable greater editorial ambition and improve working conditions for staff. A temporary set will be created on-site to enable filming to continue while the permanent structure is rebuilt.&lt;ref name=&quot;digitalspy.co.uk&quot; /&gt;

=== Filming ===
The majority of ''EastEnders'' episodes are filmed at the [[Elstree Studios#The BBC period|BBC Elstree Centre]] in [[Borehamwood]], Hertfordshire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Educational Resource Part Two&quot; /&gt; In January 1987, ''EastEnders'' had three production teams each comprising a director, production manager, production assistant and assistant floor manager. Other permanent staff included the producer's office, script department and designer, meaning between 30 and 35 people would be working full-time on ''EastEnders'', rising to 60 to 70 on filming days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tinyurl.galegroup.com/tinyurl/8fBC30|title=Can they pull the plug on Dirty Den?|last=Greaves|first=William|date=6 January 1987|work=[[The Times]]|page=8|accessdate=1 January 2019 |via=The Times Digital Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the number of episodes was increased to four per week, more studio space was needed, so ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' was moved from its studio at Elstree to [[BBC Television Centre]] in April 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Revamped 'Top of the Pops' returns to old home after a decade in exile |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/revamped-top-of-the-pops-returns-to-old-home-after-a-decade-in-exile-9217880.html |work=The Independent |date=16 October 2001 |accessdate=28 February 2008 |location=London |first=Louise |last=Jury}}&lt;/ref&gt; Episodes are produced in &quot;quartets&quot; of four episodes, each of which starts filming on a Tuesday and takes nine days to record.&lt;ref name=&quot;Educational Resource Part Two&quot; /&gt; Each day, between 25 and 30 scenes are recorded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Camera Supervisor&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/backstage/crew/interviews/interview_content/interview_camera_supervisor.shtml|title=Camera Supervisor|website=EastEnders|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 January 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028084813/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/backstage/crew/interviews/interview_content/interview_camera_supervisor.shtml |archivedate=28 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the filming week, actors can film for as many as eight to twelve episodes.

''EastEnders'' is often filmed on location, away from the studios in Borehamwood. Sometimes an entire quartet is filmed on location, which has a practical function and are the result of ''EastEnders'' making a &quot;double bank&quot;, when an extra week's worth of episodes are recorded at the same time as the regular schedule, enabling the production of the programme to stop for a two-week break at Christmas. These episodes often air in late June or early July and again in late October or early November.&lt;ref name=&quot;first10years&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|p=&lt;!-- page numbers needed for each of the 21 references to this book, cite each one separately with this template --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first time this happened was in December 1985 when [[Pauline Fowler|Pauline]] ([[Wendy Richard]]) and [[Arthur Fowler]] ([[Bill Treacher]]) travelled to the [[Southend-on-Sea]] to find their son [[Mark Fowler|Mark]], who had run away from home.&lt;ref name=&quot;First10Years p36&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Episode dated 31/12/1985|series= EastEnders|network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One|BBC1]]|airdate=31 December 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, ''EastEnders'' filmed overseas for the first time, in [[Venice]], and this was also the first time it was not filmed on videotape, as a union rule at the time prevented producers taking a video crew abroad and a film crew had to be used instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;First10Years p46&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, it was reported that eight per cent of the series is filmed on location.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cost of producing continuing drama&quot; /&gt;

''EastEnders'' has featured seven live broadcasts. For its 25th anniversary in February 2010, a [[EastEnders Live|live episode]] was broadcast in which [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) was revealed as [[Archie Mitchell]]'s ([[Larry Lamb]]) killer. Turner was told only 30&amp;nbsp;minutes before the live episode and to maintain suspense, she whispers this revelation to former lover and current father-in-law, Max Branning, in the very final moments of the live show. Many other cast members only found out at the same time as the public, when the episode was broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/news/a177337/live-ep-for-eastenders-25th-anniversary/|title=Live ep for 'EastEnders' 25th anniversary|work=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=15 September 2009|accessdate=15 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 July 2012, a segment of [[Episode 4466|that evening's episode]] was screened live as [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]) carried the [[Olympic Flame]] around Walford in preparation for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nickie |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/eastenders/2011/11/the-olympic-flame-comes-to-wal.shtml |title=EastEnders: The Olympic flame comes to Walford! |publisher=BBC |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, for the soap's 30th anniversary, [[EastEnders Live Week|five episodes in a week]] featured live inserts throughout them. Episodes airing on Tuesday 17, Wednesday 18 and Thursday 19 (which featured an hour long episode and a second episode) all featured at least one live insert. The show revealed that the killer of [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]) was her younger brother, [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby]] (Eliot Carrington), during the second episode on Thursday, after a [[Who Killed Lucy Beale?|ten month mystery regarding who killed her]]. In a flashback episode which revisited the night of the murder, Bobby was revealed to have killed his sister.

=== Post-production ===
Each episode should run for 27 minutes and 15 seconds, however, if any episode runs over or under then it is the job of post-production to cut or add scenes where appropriate. As noted in the 1994 behind-the-scenes book, ''EastEnders: The First 10 Years'', after filming, tapes were sent to the videotape editor, who then edited the scenes together into an episode. The videotape editor used the director's notes so they knew which scenes the director wanted to appear in a particular episode. The producer might have asked for further changes to be made.&lt;ref name=&quot;First10Years p142&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was then copied onto [[D-3 (video)|D3 video]]. The final process was to add the audio which included background noise such as a train or a jukebox music and to check it met the [[BBC]]'s technical standard for broadcasting.&lt;ref name=&quot;First10Years p143&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, ''EastEnders'' no longer uses tapes in the recording or editing process. After footage is recorded, the material is sent digitally to the post production team. The editors then assemble all the scenes recorded for the director to view and note any changes that are needed. The sound team also have the capability to access the edited episode, enabling them to dub the sound and create the final version.&lt;ref name=&quot;EastEnders Case Study&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=EastEnders|url=https://www.bbcstudioworks.com/?case_study=eastenders|publisher=[[BBC Studios]]|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Budgets and costs ===
According to the book ''How to Study Television'', in 1995 ''EastEnders'' cost the BBC £40,000 per episode on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sun, Sea, Sex, Sand and Conservatism in the Australian Television Soap Opera|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/62594/2/62594.pdf#page=3|publisher=[[Queensland University of Technology]]|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 agreement between the BBC, the [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain]] and the Personal Managers' Association set out the pay rate for ''EastEnders'' scripts as £137.70 per minute of transmission time (£4,131 for 30 minutes), which is 85 per cent of the rate for scripts for other BBC television series. The writers would be paid 75 per cent of that fee for any repeats of the episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;Writers Guild&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC television script agreement|url=https://writersguild.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/BBC-TV-Script-Agreement.pdf|publisher=[[Writers' Guild of Great Britain]]|accessdate=11 July 2016|date=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, it was reported that actors receive a per-episode fee of between £400 and £1,200, and are guaranteed a certain number of episodes per year, perhaps as few as 30 or as many as 100, therefore annual salaries could range from £12,000 to £200,000 depending on the popularity of a character. Some actors' salaries were leaked in 2006, revealing that [[Natalie Cassidy]] ([[Sonia Fowler]]) was paid £150,000, [[Cliff Parisi]] ([[Minty Peterson]]) received £220,000, [[Barbara Windsor]] ([[Peggy Mitchell]]) and [[Steve McFadden]] ([[Phil Mitchell]]) each received £360,000 and [[Wendy Richard]] ([[Pauline Fowler]]) had a salary of £370,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;how much do soap stars earn?&quot; /&gt; In 2017, it was revealed that [[Danny Dyer]] ([[Mick Carter]]) and [[Adam Woodyatt]] ([[Ian Beale]]) were the highest-paid actors in ''EastEnders'', earning between £200,000 and £249,999, followed by [[Laurie Brett]] ([[Jane Beale]]), [[Letitia Dean]] ([[Sharon Watts]]), [[Tameka Empson]] ([[Kim Fox]]), [[Linda Henry]] ([[Shirley Carter]]), [[Scott Maslen]] ([[Jack Branning]]), [[Diane Parish]] ([[Denise Fox]]), [[Gillian Taylforth]] ([[Kathy Beale]]) and [[Lacey Turner]] ([[Stacey Slater]]), earning between £150,000 and £199,999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/19/revealed-full-list-bbcs-96-highest-paid-stars/|title=Revealed: The full list of the BBC's 96 highest-paid stars|last=Singh|first=Anita|last2=Boyle|first2=Danny|date=19 July 2017|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 report from the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] (NAO) showed that ''EastEnders'' had an annual budget of £29.9&amp;nbsp;million. Of that, £2.9&amp;nbsp;million was spent on scripts and £6.9&amp;nbsp;million went towards paying actors, extras and chaperones for child actors.&lt;ref name=&quot;how much do soap stars earn?&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|title=How much do soap stars earn?|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2011-05-14/how-much-do-soap-stars-earn|magazine=[[Radio Times]]|accessdate=4 June 2016|date=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the NAO, BBC executives approved £500,000 of additional funding for the [[EastEnders Live|25th anniversary live episode]] (19 February 2010).&lt;ref name=&quot;National Audit Office&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The BBC's management of the costs of producing continuing drama|url=https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/1011_bbc_drama.pdf#page=18|publisher=[[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]]|accessdate=4 June 2016|date=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barnes|first1=Anthony|title=BBC spent £700,000 on EastEnders episode |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/bbc-spent-700000-on-eastenders-episode-2249790.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=4 June 2016|date=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a total cost of £696,000, the difference was covered from the 2009–2010 series budget for ''EastEnders''.&lt;ref name=&quot;National Audit Office&quot; /&gt; When repeats and omnibus editions are shown, the BBC pays additional fees to cast and scriptwriters and incurs additional editing costs, which in the period 2009–2010, amounted to £5.5{{nbsp}}million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cost of producing continuing drama&quot; /&gt; According to a [[Radio Times]] article for 212 episodes it works out at £141,000 per episode or 3.5p per viewer hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;how much do soap stars earn?&quot;/&gt;

== Scheduling ==

=== Broadcast ===
Since 1985, ''EastEnders'' has remained at the centre of [[BBC One]]'s primetime schedule. Since 2001, it has been broadcast at 7:30{{nbsp}}pm on Tuesday and Thursday, and 8{{nbsp}}pm on Monday and Friday. ''EastEnders'' was originally broadcast twice weekly at 7:00{{nbsp}}pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 19 February 1985. However, in September 1985 the two episodes were moved to 7:30{{nbsp}}pm as [[Michael Grade]] did not want the soap running in direct competition with ''[[Emmerdale|Emmerdale Farm]]'', and this remained the same until 7 April 1994. The BBC had originally planned to take advantage of the 'summer break' that ''Emmerdale Farm'' usually took to capitalise on ratings, but [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] added extra episodes and repeats so that ''Emmerdale Farm'' was not taken off the air over the summer. Realising the futility of the situation, Grade decided to move the show to the later 7:30{{nbsp}}pm slot,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Newcomb |first1=Horace |title=Encyclopedia of television |date=2005 |publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn |isbn=9781579583941 |page=780 |oclc=155865398 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|newspaper= The Times|title= EastEnders loses the ratings battle|date= 15 August 1985|page= 3|issue= 62217|url= http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=herlib&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=CS52007183&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|via= [[Gale (publisher)|Gale]]|first= David|last= Hewson|access-date= 16 December 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181222121847/http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do|archive-date= 22 December 2018|url-status= dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; but to avoid tabloid speculation that it was a &quot;panic move&quot; on the BBC's behalf, they had to &quot;dress up the presentation of that move in such a way as to protect the show&quot; giving &quot;all kinds of reasons&quot; for the move.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

From 10 August 2001, ''EastEnders'' then added its fourth episode (shown on Fridays).&lt;ref name=&quot;edures&quot; /&gt; This caused some controversy as the first Friday episode clashed with ''[[Coronation Street]]'', which was moved to 8{{nbsp}}pm to make way for an hour-long episode of rural soap ''Emmerdale''. In this first head-to-head battle, ''EastEnders'' claimed victory over its rival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The Dutch version was re-written from already existing ''EastEnders'' scripts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dutch&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1673744175/|title=News: EastEnders goes Dutch|access-date=15 March 2017|url-access=limited |format=pdf|journal=[[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]]|date=15 November 1993|page=6|via=[[ProQuest]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=van Gelder|first1=Henk|title=Het Oude Noorden' is geen belediging voor intelligentie|url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/1993/03/13/het-oude-noorden-is-geen-belediging-voor-intelligentie-7176216-a656172|newspaper=[[NRC Handelsblad]]|accessdate=15 March 2017|date=13 March 1993|language=Dutch|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316232339/https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/1993/03/13/het-oude-noorden-is-geen-belediging-voor-intelligentie-7176216-a656172|archive-date=16 March 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|Hill|2004|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; The schedule remained the same as ''EastEnders'' twice weekly episodes, however some notable changes included the programme is now set in [[Rotterdam]] rather than [[London]], characters are given Dutch names ([[Den Watts|Den]] and [[Angie Watts|Angie]] became Ger and Ankie) and [[The Queen Victoria pub]] is renamed &quot;Cade Faas&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dutch&quot; /&gt;

== Criticism ==
''EastEnders'' has received both praise and criticism for most of its storylines, which have dealt with difficult themes, such as violence, rape, murder and child abuse.

==== Morality and violence ====
[[Mary Whitehouse]], social critic, argued at the time that ''EastEnders'' represented a violation of &quot;family viewing time&quot; and that it undermined the [[watershed (television)|watershed]] policy. She regarded ''EastEnders'' as a fundamental assault on the family and morality itself. She made reference to representation of family life and emphasis on psychological and emotional violence within the show. She was also critical of language such as &quot;bleeding&quot;, &quot;bloody hell&quot;, &quot;bastard&quot; and &quot;for Christ's sake&quot;. However, Whitehouse also praised the programme, describing [[Michelle Fowler]]'s decision not to have an abortion as a &quot;very positive storyline&quot;. She also felt that ''EastEnders'' had been cleaned up as a result of her protests, though she later commented that ''EastEnders'' had returned to its old ways. Her criticisms were widely reported in the tabloid press as ammunition in its existing hostility towards the BBC. The stars of ''Coronation Street'' in particular aligned themselves with Mary Whitehouse, gaining headlines such as &quot;STREETS AHEAD! RIVALS LASH SEEDY EASTENDERS&quot; and &quot;CLEAN UP SOAP! Street Star Bill Lashes 'Steamy' EastEnders&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Buckingham|1987|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''EastEnders'' has been criticised for being too violent, most notably during a [[domestic violence]] storyline between [[Little Mo Mitchell|Little Mo Morgan]] ([[Kacey Ainsworth]]) and her husband [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor Morgan]] ([[Alex Ferns]]). As ''EastEnders'' is shown pre-watershed, there were worries that some scenes in this storyline were too graphic for its audience. Complaints against a scene in which Little Mo's face was pushed in gravy on Christmas Day were upheld by the Broadcasting Standards Council. However, a helpline after this episode attracted over 2000 calls. [[Erin Pizzey]], who became internationally famous for having started one of the first [[Women's shelter|women's refuges]], said that ''EastEnders'' had done more to raise the issue of violence against women in one story than she had done in 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EastEnders: Faith, Morality and Hope in the Community|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/speeches/stories/yorke_stalbans.shtml|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=30 April 2017|date=4 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character of [[Phil Mitchell]] (played by [[Steve McFadden]] since early 1990) has been criticised on several occasions for glorifying violence and proving a bad role model to children. On one occasion following a scene in an episode broadcast in October 2002, where Phil brutally beat his godson, [[Jamie Mitchell]] ([[Jack Ryder (actor)|Jack Ryder]]), 31 complaints came from viewers who watched the scenes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2712133.stm BBC rapped over EastEnders] BBC News, last accessed on 31 January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, cast member [[Shaun Williamson]], who was in the final months of his role of [[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry Evans]], said that the programme had become much grittier over the past 10 to 15 years, and found it &quot;frightening&quot; that parents let their young children watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EastEnders star slates violence |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3358789.stm |accessdate=19 June 2011 |work=BBC News |date=31 December 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114003111/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3358789.stm |archivedate=14 November 2012 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the BBC was accused of anti-religious bias by a [[House of Lords]] committee, who cited ''EastEnders'' as an example. Dr. [[Indarjit Singh]], editor of the Sikh Messenger and patron of the World Congress of Faiths, said: &quot;''EastEnders''{{'}} Dot Cotton is an example. She quotes endlessly from the Bible and it ridicules religion to some extent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/nov/02/bbc.radio|title=BBC accused of anti-religious bias|last=Day|first=Julia|date=2 November 2005|work=The Guardian |accessdate=24 May 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, complaints were received following the storyline of Christian minister [[Lucas Johnson]] committing a number of murders that he believed was his duty to God, claiming that the storyline was offensive to Christians.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC defends&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/news/a242230/bbc-defends-eastenders-lucas-storyline/|title=BBC defends 'EastEnders' Lucas storyline|last=Love|first=Ryan|date=12 July 2010|website=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=13 July 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, ''EastEnders'', along with ''Coronation Street'', was criticised by [[Martin McGuinness]], then Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, for &quot;the level of concentration around the pub&quot; and the &quot;antics portrayed in The [...] Queen Vic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7245701.stm|title=McGuinness slams alcohol in soaps|date=14 February 2008|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, viewers complained on Twitter about scenes implying that [[Keanu Taylor]] ([[Danny Walters (actor)|Danny Walters]]) is the father of his 15-year-old sister [[Bernadette Taylor]]'s (Clair Norris) unborn baby, with the pair agreeing to keep the pregnancy secret from their mother, [[Karen Taylor (EastEnders)|Karen Taylor]] ([[Lorraine Stanley]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/826164/EastEnders-spoilers-Viewers-APPALLED-shocking-INCEST-storyline-Bernadette-Taylors-Keanu|title=EastEnders spoilers: Viewers APPALLED by shocking INCEST storyline 'Step too far'|date=7 July 2017|accessdate=3 December 2018|work=Daily Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/826416/EastEnders-incest-story-Keanu-Bernadette-BBC-ratings|title=EastEnders 'falls to lowest-ever ratings' as SHOCK incest storyline sickens viewers|date=8 July 2017|accessdate=3 December 2018|work=Daily Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the baby's father is revealed as one of Bernadette's school friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/827085/EastEnders-incest-bombshell-Keanu-Taylor-Danny-Walters-Karen-Taylor-Lorraine-Stanley|title=EastEnders spoiler: Truth about incest storyline EXPOSED as Keanu drops THIS bombshell|date=10 July 2017|accessdate=3 December 2018|work=Daily Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Allegations of national and racial stereotypes ====
In 1997, [[EastEnders episodes in Ireland|several episodes were shot and set in Ireland]], resulting in criticisms for portraying the Irish in a negatively stereotypical way. Ted Barrington, the Irish Ambassador to the UK at the time, described the portrayal of Ireland as an &quot;unrepresentative caricature&quot;, stating he was worried by the negative stereotypes and the images of drunkenness, backwardness and isolation. [[Jana Bennett]], the BBC's then director of production, later apologised for the episodes, stating on BBC1's news bulletin: &quot;It is clear that a significant number of viewers have been upset by the recent episodes of ''EastEnders'', and we are very sorry, because the production team and programme makers did not mean to cause any offence.&quot; A year later BBC chairman Christopher Bland admitted that as result of the Irish-set EastEnders episodes, the station failed in its pledge to represent all groups accurately and avoid reinforcing prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/172718.stm BBC sets out pledges], BBC News. Retrieved 21 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the show was criticised for stereotyping their Asian and Black characters, by having a black single mother, [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]), and an Asian shopkeeper, [[Zainab Masood]] ([[Nina Wadia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/news/a112057/report-brands-soaps-quottoo-whitequot/ |title=Report brands soaps 'too white' |website=[[Digital Spy]] |first=Alex |last=Fletcher |date=17 July 2008 |accessdate=4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been criticism that the programme does not authentically portray the ethnic diversity of the population of East London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Assoudani|first1=Yacine|title=Where did EastEnders go wrong?|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/10/where-did-eastenders-go-wrong|accessdate=24 June 2016|magazine=New Statesman|date=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/04/former-eastenders-producer-tv-industry-diversity-barbara-emile|title=Former EastEnders producer: TV industry must 'get real' on diversity|author=Stuart Kemp|website=the Guardian|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the programme being 'twice as white' as the real East End.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/10921204/EastEnders-is-too-white-says-BBC-Trust-chief.html|title=EastEnders is too white, says BBC Trust chief|date=23 June 2014|website=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=9 August 2015|last1=Singh|first1=Anita}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Controversial storylines ====
Some storylines have provoked high levels of viewer complaints. In August 2006, a scene involving [[Carly Wicks]] ([[Kellie Shirley]]) and [[Jake Moon]] ([[Joel Beckett]]) having sex on the floor of [[Scarlet (EastEnders)|Scarlet]] nightclub, and another scene involving [[Owen Turner]] ([[Lee Ross]]) violently attacking [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]), prompted 129 and 128 complaints, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4776447.stm BBC defends ''EastEnders'' sex scene]&quot; BBC News. Retrieved 2 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- REMOVED DUE TO LACK OF RELIABLE SOURCES, SOURCES CAN BE FOUND SO THE TEXT IS LEFT HERE HIDDEN UNTIL THE SOURCES ARE FOUND: Carly and Jake's sex scenes were later removed from the Sunday omnibus edition. The showdown of [[Rob Minter]] ([[Stuart Laing (actor)|Stuart Laing]]), [[Dawn Swann]] ([[Kara Tointon]]) and [[May Wright]]'s ([[Amanda Drew]]) storyline where May stated to Dawn she could give her an elective caesarean (Dawn being handcuffed to the bed) prompted 200 complaints. The 2007 child abuse storyline involving [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] (Charlie Jones) and [[Stella Crawford]] ([[Sophie Thompson]]) attracted 60 complaints from viewers, who found scenes where Ben was attacked by bullies as Stella looked on &quot;upsetting&quot;. --&gt;

In March 2008, scenes showing [[Tanya Branning]] ([[Jo Joyner]]) and boyfriend, [[Sean Slater]] ([[Robert Kazinsky]]), burying Tanya's husband [[Max Branning|Max]] ([[Jake Wood]]) alive, attracted many complaints. The UK communications regulator [[Ofcom]] later found that the episodes depicting the storyline were in breach of the 2005 Broadcasting Code. They contravened the rules regarding protection of children by appropriate scheduling, appropriate depiction of violence before the 9&amp;nbsp;p.m. watershed and appropriate depiction of potentially offensive content.&lt;ref name=&quot;ofcom&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/prog_cb/obb112/issue112.pdf |title=Ofcom Broadcast Bulletin 112 |date=June 2008 |website=Ofcom |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326125642/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/prog_cb/obb112/issue112.pdf |archive-date=26 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, ''EastEnders'' began a grooming and paedophilia storyline involving characters [[Tony King (EastEnders)|Tony King]] ([[Chris Coghill]]), [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]), [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]), [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Madeline Duggan]]) and [[Peter Beale]] ([[Thomas Law]]). The storyline attracted over 200 complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/18/bbc.television|title=EastEnders paedophile storyline draws 200 complaints|first=Leigh|last=Holmwood|work=The Guardian |date=18 September 2008|accessdate=6 November 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, [[Ronnie Mitchell|Ronnie Branning]] ([[Samantha Womack]]) swapped her newborn baby, who [[sudden infant death syndrome|died in cot]], with [[Kat Slater|Kat Moon]]'s ([[Jessie Wallace]]) living baby. Around 3,400 complaints were received, with viewers branding the storyline &quot;insensitive&quot;, &quot;irresponsible&quot; and &quot;desperate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12110324|title=EastEnders cot death complaints top 3,400|date=4 January 2011|work=BBC News|accessdate=5 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roz Laws from the ''[[Sunday Mercury]]'' called the plot &quot;shocking and ridiculous&quot; and asked &quot;are we really supposed to believe that Kat won't recognise that the baby looks different?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/tv/ronnies-baby-dies-so-she-swaps-him-250592|title=Ronnie's baby dies so she swaps him for Kat's in shocking and ridiculous EastEnders storyline|last=Laws|first=Roz|date=26 December 2010|work=[[Birmingham Mail]]|accessdate=26 December 2010|location=Birmingham}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths]] (FSID) praised the storyline, and its director Joyce Epstein explained, &quot;We are very grateful to ''EastEnders'' for their accurate depiction of the devastating effect that the sudden death of an infant can have on a family. We hope that this story will help raise the public's awareness of cot death, which claims 300 babies' lives each year.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Confirmed&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/news/a287462/eastenders-confirms-tragic-baby-plot/|title='EastEnders' confirms tragic baby plot|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=12 November 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=21 November 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 7 January, that storyline had generated the most complaints in show history: the BBC received about 8,500 complaints, and media regulator [[Ofcom]] received 374.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Plunkett|first=John|title=EastEnders: cot death plot complaints hit record|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jan/07/eastenders-complaints-record-cot-death|accessdate=7 January 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 January 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the controversy however, ''EastEnders'' pulled in rating highs of 9–10 million throughout the duration of the storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Plunkett|first=John|title='EastEnders' baby swap fallout nabs 10.2m|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/news/a315354/eastenders-baby-swap-fallout-nabs-102m/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Plunkett|first=John|title=Ronnie's 'Enders baby swap draws 9m|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/news/a295608/ronnies-enders-baby-swap-draws-9m/|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, the BBC defended a storyline, after receiving 278 complaints about 6 October 2014 episode where pub landlady [[Linda Carter]] ([[Kellie Bright]]) was raped by [[Dean Wicks]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29519061|title=BBC defends EastEnders rape storyline|work=BBC News|date=7 October 2014|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 November 2014 it was announced that [[Ofcom]] will investigate over the storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-30080764|title=EastEnders investigated by Ofcom over rape storyline|work=BBC News|date=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 January 2015, the investigation was cleared by Ofcom. A spokesman of Ofcom said: &quot;After carefully investigating complaints about this scene, Ofcom found the BBC took appropriate steps to limit offence to viewers. This included a warning before the episode and implying the assault, rather than depicting it. Ofcom also took into account the programme's role in presenting sometimes challenging or distressing social issues.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/news/a619266/eastenders-dean-linda-rape-episode-cleared-by-ofcom/|title=EastEnders: Dean, Linda rape episode cleared by Ofcom|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|website=[[Digital Spy]]|date=5 January 2015|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Portrayal of certain professions ====
In 2010, ''EastEnders'' came under criticism from the police for the way that they were portrayed during the &quot;[[Who Killed Archie?]]&quot; storyline. During the storyline, [[Jill Marsden (EastEnders)|DCI Jill Marsden]] ([[Sophie Stanton]]) and [[Wayne Hughes (EastEnders)|DC Wayne Hughes]] (Jamie Treacher) talk to locals about the case and Hughes accepts a bribe. The police claimed that such scenes were &quot;damaging&quot; to their reputation and added that the character [[Deanne Cunningham|DC Deanne Cunningham]] ([[Zoe Henry]]) was &quot;irritatingly inaccurate&quot;. In response to the criticism, ''EastEnders'' apologised for offending real life detectives and confirmed that they use a police consultant for such storylines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/7288626/Detectives-claim-EastEnders-has-damaged-their-profession.html|title=Detectives claim EastEnders has 'damaged their profession'|last=Leach|first=Ben|date=22 February 2010|work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=22 February 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, a storyline involving [[Lola Pearce]] ([[Danielle Harold]]), forced to hand over her baby [[Lexi Pearce]], was criticised by the charity The Who Cares? Trust, who called the storyline an &quot;unhelpful portrayal&quot; and said it had already received calls from members of the public who were &quot;distressed about the ''EastEnders'' scene where a social worker snatches a baby from its mother's arms&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fury&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.communitycare.co.uk/2012/10/09/fury-over-eastenders-misleading-social-work-storyline/|title=Fury over EastEnders' 'misleading' social work storyline|publisher=Community Care|date=9 October 2012|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scenes were also condemned by the British Association of Social Workers (BASW), calling the BBC &quot;too lazy and arrogant&quot; to correctly portray the child protection process, and saying that the baby was taken &quot;without sufficient grounds to do so&quot;. Bridget Robb, acting chief of the BASW, said the storyline provoked &quot;real anger among a profession well used to a less than accurate public and media perception of their jobs .. ''EastEnders''{{'}} shabby portrayal of an entire profession has made a tough job even tougher.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/oct/09/eastenders-social-care|title=Social workers outraged by EastEnders storyline about baby Lexi|last=Greenslade|first=Rob|website=The Guardian|date=9 October 2012|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
