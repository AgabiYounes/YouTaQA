'''Erwin Rudolf Josef Alexander Schrödinger''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|ʃ|r|ɜː|d|ɪ|ŋ|ər}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|ʃ|r|oʊ|-|,_|ˈ|ʃ|r|eɪ|-}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/schrodinger &quot;Schrödinger&quot;].

In addition, he was the author of many works on various aspects of physics: [[statistical mechanics]] and [[thermodynamics]], physics of dielectrics, [[colour theory]], [[electrodynamics]], [[general relativity]], and [[cosmology]], and he made several attempts to construct a [[unified field theory]]. In his book ''[[What Is Life?]]'' Schrödinger addressed the problems of genetics, looking at the phenomenon of life from the point of view of physics. He paid great attention to the philosophical aspects of science, ancient and oriental philosophical concepts, ethics, and religion.&lt;ref name = &quot;frs&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Heitler | first1 = W. | authorlink = Walter Heitler| doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1961.0017 | title = Erwin Schrodinger. 1887–1961 | journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]]|volume = 7 | pages = 221–226 | year = 1961 | jstor = 769408}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote on philosophy and theoretical biology.

== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
On 12 August 1887, Schrödinger was born in {{ill|Erdberg, Vienna|lt=Erdberg|de|Erdberg (Wien)}}, Vienna, Austria, to {{Interlanguage link multi|Rudolf Schrödinger|de}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Rudolf-Schr%C3%B6dinger/6000000010674794555|title=Rudolf Schrödinger|publisher=geni.com|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[wikt:cerecloth|cerecloth]] producer, botanist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schrodinger|first1=Rudolf|title=The International Plant Names Index|url=http://www.ipni.org/ipni/advPlantNameSearch.do?find_includePublicationAuthors=on&amp;find_includeBasionymAuthors=on&amp;find_rankToReturn=all&amp;output_format=normal&amp;find_authorAbbrev=Schr%C3%B6dinger|publisher=IPNI|accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Georgine Emilia Brenda Schrödinger (née Bauer) (daughter of {{Interlanguage link multi|Alexander Bauer|de|3=Alexander Bauer (Chemiker)}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Alexander-Bauer/6000000010674720758|title=Alexander Emil Anton Bauer|publisher=geni.com|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Josefa-Bauer/6000000027421433612|title=Josefa Bauer|publisher=geni.com|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Alexander-Bauer/6000000027421807059|title=Alexander Josef Bauer|publisher=geni.com|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; professor of chemistry, [[TU Wien]]). He was their only child.

His mother was of half Austrian and half English descent; his father was Catholic and his mother was Lutheran. Although he was raised in a religious household as a [[Lutheran]], he himself was an [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1994|pages=289–290}} Quote: &quot;In one respect, however, he is not a romantic: he does not idealize the person of the beloved, his highest praise is to consider her his equal. 'When you feel your own equal in the body of a beautiful woman, just as ready to forget the world for you as you for her – oh my good Lord – who can describe what happiness then. You can live it, now and again – you cannot speak of it.' Of course, he does speak of it, and almost always with religious imagery. Yet at this time he also wrote, 'By the way, I never realized that to be nonbelieving, to be an atheist, was a thing to be proud of. It went without saying as it were.' And in another place at about this same time: 'Our creed is indeed a queer creed. You others, Christians (and similar people), consider our ethics much inferior, indeed abominable. There is that little difference. We adhere to ours in practice, you don't.'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; However, he had strong interests in [[Eastern religions]] and [[pantheism]], and he used religious symbolism in his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Einstein's Dice and Schrödinger's Cat|year=2015|publisher=Perseus Books Group|isbn=978-0-465-07571-3|author=Paul Halpern|page=157|quote=&quot;In the presentation of a scientific problem, the other player is the good Lord. He has not only set the problem but also has devised the rules of the game--but they are not completely known, half of them are left for you to discover or deduce. I am very astonished that the scientific picture of the real world around me is very deficient. It gives a lot of factual information, puts all our experience in a magnificently consistent order, but is ghastly silent about all that is really near to our heart, that really matters to us. It cannot tell us a word about red and blue, bitter and sweet, physical pain and physical delight; it knows nothing of beautiful and ugly, good or bad, God and eternity. Science sometimes pretends to answer questions in these domains, but the answers are very often so silly that we are not inclined to take them seriously. I shall quite briefly mention here the notorious atheism of science. The theists reproach it for this again and again. Unjustly. A personal God cannot be encountered in a world picture that becomes accessible only at the price that everything personal is excluded from it. We know that whenever God is experienced, it is an experience exactly as real as a direct sense impression, as real as one's own personality. As such He must be missing from the space-time picture. &quot;I do not meet with God in space and time&quot;, so says the honest scientific thinker, and for that reason he is reproached by those in whose catechism it is nevertheless stated: &quot;God is a Spirit.&quot; Whence came I and whither go I? That is the great unfathomable question, the same for every one of us. Science has no answer for it&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also believed his scientific work was an approach to the [[Divinity|godhead]], albeit in a intellectual sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1992|p=4}} Quote: &quot;He rejected traditional religious beliefs (Jewish, Christian, and Islamic) not on the basis of any reasoned argument, nor even with an expression of emotional antipathy, for he loved to use religious expressions and metaphors, but simply by saying that they are naive.&quot; ... &quot;He claimed to be an atheist, but he always used religious symbolism and believed his scientific work was an approach to the godhead.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also able to learn English outside school, as his maternal grandmother was British.&lt;ref name=&quot;hof1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Hoffman, D.|title= Эрвин Шрёдингер|publisher= Мир |year=1987 |pages= 13–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1906 and 1910 Schrödinger studied in Vienna under [[Franz S. Exner]] (1849–1926) and [[Friedrich Hasenöhrl]] (1874–1915). He also conducted experimental work with Karl Wilhelm Friedrich &quot;Fritz&quot; Kohlrausch.

In 1911, Schrödinger became an assistant to Exner. At an early age, Schrödinger was strongly influenced by [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. As a result of his extensive reading of Schopenhauer's works, he became deeply interested throughout his life in [[colour theory]] and philosophy. In his lecture &quot;Mind and Matter&quot;, he said that &quot;The world extended in space and time is but our [[mental representation|representation]].&quot; This is a repetition of the first words of Schopenhauer's main work.

===Middle years===
[[File:Erwin Schrodinger2.jpg|thumb|upright|Erwin Schrödinger as a young man]]
In 1914 Erwin Schrödinger achieved [[Habilitation]] (''venia legendi''). Between 1914 and 1918 he participated in war work as a commissioned officer in the Austrian fortress artillery ([[Gorizia]], [[Duino]], [[Sistiana]], Prosecco, Vienna). In 1920 he became the assistant to [[Max Wien]], in [[Jena]], and in September 1920 he attained the position of ao. Prof. (''[[ausserordentlicher Professor]]''), roughly equivalent to Reader (UK) or associate professor (US), in [[Stuttgart]]. In 1921, he became o. Prof. (''[[ordentlicher Professor]]'', i.e. full professor), in [[Breslau University|Breslau]] (now Wrocław, Poland).

In 1921, he moved to the [[University of Zurich|University of Zürich]]. In 1927, he succeeded [[Max Planck]] at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University]] in Berlin. In 1933, Schrödinger decided to leave Germany; he disliked the Nazis' antisemitism. He became a Fellow of [[Magdalen College]] at the [[University of Oxford]]. Soon after he arrived, he received the Nobel Prize together with [[Paul Dirac]]. His position at Oxford did not work out well; his unconventional domestic arrangements, sharing living quarters with two women,{{sfn|Moore|1992|pp=278 ff.}} were not met with acceptance. In 1934, Schrödinger lectured at [[Princeton University]]; he was offered a permanent position there, but did not accept it. Again, his wish to set up house with his wife and his mistress may have created a problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz106819.html &quot;Schrödinger, Erwin Rudolf Josef Alexander&quot;] in ''Deutsche Biographie''&lt;/ref&gt; He had the prospect of a position at the [[University of Edinburgh]] but visa delays occurred, and in the end he took up a position at the University of Graz in Austria in 1936. He had also accepted the offer of chair position at Department of Physics, [[Allahabad University]] in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1940/05/20/archive/bombay-university-names-refugee-scientist-to-faculty|title=Bombay University Names Refugee Scientist to Faculty|publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=20 May 1940|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the midst of these tenure issues in 1935, after extensive correspondence with [[Albert Einstein]], he proposed what is now called the [[Schrödinger's cat]] [[thought experiment]].

===Later years===
In 1938, after the [[Anschluss]], Schrödinger had problems because of his flight from Germany in 1933 and his known opposition to [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lakhtakia1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Akhlesh Lakhtakia|title=Models and Modelers of Hydrogen: Thales, Thomson, Rutherford, Bohr, Sommerfeld, Goudsmit, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, Dirac, Sallhofer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6lC6IG7NXmcC&amp;pg=PA147|year=1996|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-02-2302-1|pages=147–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He issued a statement recanting this opposition (he later regretted doing so and explained the reason to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]).&lt;ref name=mactutorB&gt;{{Cite web|title=Erwin Rudolf Josef Alexander Schrödinger|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Printonly/Schrodinger.html|publisher=[[MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]]|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this did not fully appease the new dispensation and the University of Graz dismissed him from his job for political unreliability. He suffered harassment and received instructions not to leave the country, but he and his wife fled to Italy. From there, he went to visiting positions in [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[Ghent University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mactutorB&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lakhtakia1996&quot;/&gt;

[[File:DIAS 1942 photo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Schrödinger (front row 2nd from right) and Valera (front row 4th from left) at Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies in 1942]]
In the same year he received a personal invitation from Ireland's [[Taoiseach]], [[Éamon de Valera]] – a mathematician himself – to reside in Ireland and agree to help establish an [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies|Institute for Advanced Studies]] in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Brian|last=Daugherty|title=Brief Chronology|work=Erwin Schrödinger|url=http://bdaugherty.tripod.com/berlin/schrodinger.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309141433/http://bdaugherty.tripod.com/berlin/schrodinger.html|archive-date=9 March 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[Clontarf, Dublin]], became the Director of the School for Theoretical Physics in 1940 and remained there for 17 years. He became a naturalized Irish citizen in 1948, but retained his Austrian citizenship{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}. He wrote around 50 further publications on various topics, including his explorations of [[classical unified field theories|unified field theory]].

In 1944, he wrote ''[[What Is Life?]]'', which contains a discussion of [[negentropy]] and the concept of a complex [[molecule]] with the genetic code for living [[organism]]s. According to [[James D. Watson]]'s memoir, ''[[DNA]], the Secret of Life'', Schrödinger's book gave Watson the inspiration to research the [[gene]], which led to the discovery of the [[DNA]] [[double helix]] structure in 1953. Similarly, [[Francis Crick]], in his autobiographical book ''What Mad Pursuit'', described how he was influenced by Schrödinger's speculations about how genetic information might be stored in molecules.

Schrödinger stayed in Dublin until retiring in 1955. He had a lifelong interest in the [[Vedanta]] philosophy of [[Hinduism]], which influenced his speculations at the close of ''What Is Life?'' about the possibility that individual [[consciousness]] is only a manifestation of a unitary consciousness pervading the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;Schrödinger, Erwin. ''My View of the World'', chapter iv, and ''What Is life?''&lt;/ref&gt; A manuscript &quot;Fragment from an unpublished dialogue of Galileo&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130418015552/http://www.kingshospital.ie/thekingshospital/Files/Schroedinger%20Bluecoat.pdf &quot;Fragment from an unpublished dialogue of Galileo&quot;] manuscript&lt;/ref&gt; from this time recently resurfaced at [[The King's Hospital]] boarding school, Dublin&lt;ref&gt;Ahlstrom, Dick (18 April 2012) [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/0418/1224314875355.html 'Quantum humour' beams back after absence]. ''The Irish Times''&lt;/ref&gt; after it was written for the School's 1955 edition of their Blue Coat to celebrate his leaving of Dublin to take up his appointment as Chair of Physics at the University of Vienna.

In 1956, he returned to Vienna (chair ''ad personam''). At an important lecture during the World Energy Conference he refused to speak on nuclear energy because of his skepticism about it and gave a philosophical lecture instead. During this period Schrödinger turned from mainstream quantum mechanics' definition of [[wave–particle duality]] and promoted the [[Wave–particle duality#Wave-only view|wave idea alone]],{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} causing much controversy.

===Personal life===
On 6 April 1920, Schrödinger married Annemarie (Anny) Bertel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1992}} discusses Schrödinger's unconventional relationships, including his affair with Hildegunde March, in chapters seven and eight, &quot;Berlin&quot; and &quot;Exile in Oxford&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Schrödinger suffered from [[tuberculosis]] and several times in the 1920s stayed at a [[sanatorium]] in [[Arosa]]. It was there that he formulated his wave equation.{{sfn|Moore|1992|p=194}} As has been noted above, Schrödinger had an unconventional personal life. When he migrated to Ireland in 1938, he obtained visas for himself, his wife and also another woman, Mrs. Hilde March. March was the wife of an Austrian colleague and Schrödinger had fathered a daughter with her in 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Ronan Fanning, ''Éamon de Valera: A Will to Power'', Faber &amp; Faber, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Schrödinger wrote personally to the [[Taoiseach]], [[Éamon de Valera]], to obtain the visa for Mrs. March. In October 1939 the ''ménage à trois'' duly took up residence in Dublin.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Schrödinger fathered two further daughters by two different women during his time in Ireland.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; 
[[File:Grave Schroedinger.jpg|thumb|Annemarie and Erwin Schrödinger's gravesite; above the name plate [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger's quantum mechanical wave equation]] is inscribed:{{Equation box 1|equation=&lt;math&gt;i \hbar \dot \Psi = H \Psi&lt;/math&gt;}}]]
On 4 January 1961, Schrödinger died of tuberculosis, aged 73, in [[Vienna]].{{sfn|Moore|1992|p=10}} He left Anny a widow, and was buried in [[Alpbach]], Austria, in a Catholic cemetery. Although he was not Catholic, the priest in charge of the cemetery permitted the burial after learning Schrödinger was a member of the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1992|p=482}}: &quot;There was some problem about burial in the churchyard since Erwin was not a Catholic, but the priest relented when informed that he was a member in good standing of the Papal Academy, and a plot was made available at the edge of the Friedhof.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Anny (born 3 December 1896) died on 3 October 1965.  Schrödinger's grandson, Professor [[Terry Rudolph]], has followed in his footsteps as a quantum physicist, and teaches at [[Imperial College London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Searching for the Man Behind the Cat |url=http://brooklynrail.org/2013/06/books/searching-for-the-man-behind-the-cat |author=Ryan, Greg |date=3 June 2013 |journal=[[The Brooklyn Rail]] |accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p={{page missing|date=January 2019}}}}

==Scientific activities==
===Early career===
Early in his life, Schrödinger experimented in the fields of electrical engineering, atmospheric electricity, and atmospheric radioactivity, but he usually worked with his former teacher Franz Exner. He also studied vibrational theory, the theory of [[Brownian movement]], and mathematical statistics. In 1912, at the request of the editors of the ''Handbook of Electricity and Magnetism'', Schrödinger wrote an article titled ''Dieelectrism''. That same year, Schrödinger gave a theoretical estimate of the probable height distribution of radioactive substances, which is required to explain the observed radioactivity of the atmosphere, and in August 1913 executed several experiments in Zeehame that confirmed his theoretical estimate and those of Victor Franz Hess. For this work, Schrödinger was awarded the 1920 [[Haitinger Prize]] (Haitinger-Preis) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mehra&quot;&gt;Mehra, J. and Rechenberg, H. (1987) ''Erwin Schrödinger and the Rise of Wave Mechanics''. Springer. {{ISBN|978-0-387-95179-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other experimental studies conducted by the young researcher in 1914 were checking formulas for capillary pressure in gas bubbles and the study of the properties of soft beta-radiation appearing in the fall of gamma rays on the surface of metal. The last work he performed together with his friend Fritz Kohlrausch. In 1919, Schrödinger performed his last physical experiment on coherent light and subsequently focused on theoretical studies.

===Quantum mechanics===
====New quantum theory====
In the first years of his career Schrödinger became acquainted with the ideas of quantum theory, developed in the works of [[Max Planck]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Niels Bohr]], [[Arnold Sommerfeld]], and others. This knowledge helped him work on some problems in theoretical physics, but the Austrian scientist at the time was not yet ready to part with the traditional methods of classical physics.

The first publications of Schrödinger about atomic theory and the theory of spectra began to emerge only from the beginning of the 1920s, after his personal acquaintance with Sommerfeld and [[Wolfgang Pauli]] and his move to Germany. In January 1921, Schrödinger finished his first article on this subject, about the framework of the Bohr-Sommerfeld effect of the interaction of electrons on some features of the spectra of the alkali metals. Of particular interest to him was the introduction of relativistic considerations in quantum theory. In autumn 1922 he analyzed the electron orbits in an atom from a geometric point of view, using methods developed by the mathematician [[Hermann Weyl]] (1885–1955). This work, in which it was shown that quantum orbits are associated with certain geometric properties, was an important step in predicting some of the features of wave mechanics. Earlier in the same year he created the Schrödinger equation of the relativistic Doppler effect for spectral lines, based on the hypothesis of light quanta and considerations of energy and momentum. He liked the idea of his teacher Exner on the statistical nature of the conservation laws, so he enthusiastically embraced the articles of Bohr, [[Hans Kramers|Kramers]], and [[John C. Slater|Slater]], which suggested the possibility of violation of these laws in individual atomic processes (for example, in the process of emission of radiation). Although the experiments of [[Hans Geiger]] and [[Walther Bothe]] soon cast doubt on this, the idea of energy as a statistical concept was a lifelong attraction for Schrödinger and he discussed it in some reports and publications.&lt;ref name=jammer&gt;''The Conceptual Development of Quantum Mechanics''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1966; 2nd ed: New York: American Institute of Physics, 1989. {{ISBN|0-88318-617-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Creation of wave mechanics====
In January 1926, Schrödinger published in ''[[Annalen der Physik]]'' the paper &quot;{{Lang|de|Quantisierung als Eigenwertproblem}}&quot; (Quantization as an [[Eigenvalue]] Problem)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schrodinger|first=Erwin|title=Quantisierung als Eigenwertproblem|journal=[[Annalen der Physik]]|year=1926|volume=384|issue=4|pages=273–376|doi=10.1002/andp.19263840404|bibcode=1926AnP...384..361S}}&lt;/ref&gt; on wave mechanics and presented what is now known as the [[Schrödinger equation]]. In this paper, he gave a &quot;derivation&quot; of the wave equation for time-independent systems and showed that it gave the correct energy eigenvalues for a hydrogen-like atom. This paper has been universally celebrated as one of the most important achievements of the twentieth century and created a revolution in most areas of quantum mechanics and indeed of all physics and chemistry. A second paper was submitted just four weeks later that solved the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]], [[rigid rotor]], and [[diatomic molecule]] problems and gave a new derivation of the Schrödinger equation. A third paper, published in May, showed the equivalence of his approach to that of [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] and gave the treatment of the Stark effect. A fourth paper in this series showed how to treat problems in which the system changes with time, as in scattering problems. In this paper he introduced a complex solution to the [[Wave equation]] in order to prevent the occurrence of fourth and sixth order differential equations. (This was arguably the moment when quantum mechanics switched from real to complex numbers.) When he introduced complex numbers in order to lower the order of the differential equations, something magical happened, and all of wave mechanics was at his feet. (He eventually reduced the order to one.)&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Dreams That Stuff Is Made Of]]: The Most Astounding Papers of Quantum Physics—and How They Shook the Scientific World'', [[Stephen Hawking]], (editor), the papers by Schrödinger.&lt;/ref&gt; These papers were his central achievement and were at once recognized as having great significance by the physics community.

Schrödinger was not entirely comfortable with the implications of quantum theory. He wrote about the probability interpretation of quantum mechanics, saying: &quot;I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it.&quot; (Just in order to ridicule the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics he contrived the famous thought-experiment called [[Schrödinger's cat]] paradox.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/26/science/27eins_side.html| work=The New York Times | title=A Quantum Sampler | date=26 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Work on a unified field theory====
Following his work on quantum mechanics, Schrödinger devoted considerable effort to working on a [[unified field theory]] that would unite gravity, electromagnetism, and nuclear forces within the basic framework of General Relativity, doing the work with an extended correspondence with Albert Einstein.&lt;ref name= &quot;Halpern&quot;&gt;Halpern, Paul, [https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/battle-of-the-nobel-laureates-712d444610d3 Battle of the Nobel Laureates], April 2015 (accessed 2 April 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, he announced a result, &quot;Affine Field Theory,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schrödinger, E., ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy'', Vol. 51A (1947), [http://einstein-schrodinger.com/schrodingerI.html pp. 163–171]. (accessed 3 November 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; in a talk at the Royal Irish Academy, but the announcement was criticized by Einstein as &quot;preliminary&quot; and failed to lead to the desired unified theory.&lt;ref name= &quot;Halpern&quot; /&gt; Following the failure of his attempt at unification, Schrödinger gave up his work on unification and turned to other topics.

===Colour===
Schrödinger had a strong interest in psychology, in particular [[colour perception]] and [[colorimetry]] (German: ''{{Lang|de|Farbenmetrik}}''). He spent quite a few years of his life working on these questions and published a series of papers in this area:
* &quot;Theorie der Pigmente von größter Leuchtkraft&quot;, ''[[Annalen der Physik]]'', (4), 62, (1920), 603–22 (Theory of Pigments with Highest Luminosity)
* &quot;Grundlinien einer Theorie der Farbenmetrik im Tagessehen&quot;, ''Annalen der Physik'', (4), 63, (1920), 397–456; 481–520 (Outline of a theory of colour measurement for daylight vision)
* &quot;Farbenmetrik&quot;, ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]'', 1, (1920), 459–66 (Colour measurement).
* &quot;Über das Verhältnis der Vierfarben- zur Dreifarben-theorie&quot;, ''Mathematisch-Naturwissenschaftliche Klasse'',{{clarify|date=November 2017|post-text=Which academy?}} 134, 471, (On The Relationship of Four-Color Theory to Three-Color Theory).
* &quot;Lehre von der strahlenden Energie&quot;, ''[[Johann Heinrich Jakob Müller|Müller]]-[[Claude Pouillet|Pouillets]] Lehrbuch der Physik und Meteorologie'', Vol 2, Part 1 (1926) (Thresholds of Color Differences).

His work on the psychology of colour perception follows the step of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz|von Helmholtz]] in the same area. Some of these papers have been translated into English and can be found in: ''Sources of Colour Science'', Ed. David L. MacAdam, MIT Press (1970).

==Legacy==
The philosophical issues raised by [[Schrödinger's cat]] are still debated today and remain his most enduring legacy in popular science, while [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger's equation]] is his most enduring legacy at a more technical level. Schrödinger is one of several individuals who have been called &quot;the [[father of quantum mechanics]]&quot;. The large crater [[Schrödinger (crater)|Schrödinger]], on the [[far side of the Moon]], is named after him. The [[Erwin Schrödinger International Institute for Mathematical Physics]] was established in Vienna in 1993.

Schrödinger's portrait was the main feature of the design of the [[Austrian schilling#Banknotes|1983–97 Austrian 1000-schilling banknote]], the second-highest denomination.

A building is named after him at the [[University of Limerick]], in Limerick, Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Buildings at A Glance |publisher=[[University of Limerick]] |url=http://www2.ul.ie/web/WWW/Services/Buildings_and_Estates/At_A_Glance |accessdate=17 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330072324/http://www2.ul.ie/web/WWW/Services/Buildings_and_Estates/At_A_Glance |archive-date=30 March 2013 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; as is the 'Erwin Schrödinger Zentrum' at [[Adlershof]] in Berlin.&lt;ref name=&quot;EYCNDA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanyoungchemists.eu/index.php?page=venue|title=EYCN Delegates Assembly|year=2015|accessdate=13 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027060050/http://www.europeanyoungchemists.eu/index.php?page=venue|archive-date=27 October 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schrödinger's 126th birthday anniversary in 2013 was celebrated with a [[Google Doodle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Physicist Erwin Schrödinger's Google doodle marks quantum mechanics work|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/12/erwin-schrodinger-google-doodle|accessdate=25 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Rob|title=Google Doodle honours quantum physicist Erwin Schrödinger (and his theoretical cat)|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/google-doodle-honours-quantum-physicist-erwin-schrdinger-and-his-theoretical-cat-8756744.html|accessdate=25 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=12 August 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
