'''Ezekiel''' ({{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˈ|z|iː|k|i|əl}}; {{lang-he-n|יְחֶזְקֵאל}} ''Yəḥezqē’l'' {{IPA-he|jəħɛzˈqel|}}) is the central [[protagonist]] of the [[Book of Ezekiel]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]].

In [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]], Ezekiel is acknowledged as a Hebrew [[Biblical prophet|prophet]]. In [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], he is also viewed as the 6th-century BCE author of the Book of Ezekiel, which reveals prophecies regarding the destruction of Jerusalem, the restoration to the land of Israel, and what some call the ''Millennial Temple'' (or [[Third Temple]]) visions.

The name Ezekiel means 'God Strengthens'.

== Life ==
The author of the [[Book of Ezekiel]] presents himself as Ezekiel, the son of Buzzi, born into a priestly ([[Kohen]]) lineage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref|Ezekiel|1:3|KJV|Ezekiel 1:3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from identifying himself, the author gives a date for the first divine encounter which he presents: &quot;in the thirtieth year&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref|Ezekiel|1:1–2|KJV|Ezekiel 1:1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this is a reference to Ezekiel's age at the time, he was born around 622 BCE, about the time of [[Josiah#Religious reform|Josiah's reforms]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Betts2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Terry J. Betts|title=Ezekiel the Priest: A Custodian of Tôrâ|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mTxmJpdAuwoC&amp;pg=PA51|year=2005|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-0-8204-7425-0|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shortly after the call of [[Jeremiah]] to a prophetic ministry around 626 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tremper Longman|Longman, T.]], ''Jeremiah, Lamentations'', Hendrickson Publishers, 2008, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Ezekiel's &quot;thirtieth year&quot; is given as five years after the exile of Judah's king [[Jehoiachin]] by the Babylonians. The [[Aramaic Targum]] on Ezekiel 1:1, however, as well as the 2nd-century rabbinic work ''[[Seder Olam Rabba]]'' (chapter 26), take a different approach, where they both say that Ezekiel's vision came &quot;in the thirtieth year after [[Josiah]] was presented with a Book of the Law discovered in the Temple&quot;.

According to [[Jewish tradition]], Ezekiel did not write his own book, the Book of Ezekiel, but rather his prophecies were collected and written by the [[Men of the Great Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]], ''[[Baba Bathra]]'' [http://www.come-and-hear.com/bababathra/bababathra_15.html 15a]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josephus]] claims that [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia]]'s armies exiled three thousand [[Jew]]s from Judah,&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' Book X, 6.3.98&lt;/ref&gt; after deposing King Jehoiakim in 598 BCE.

== Living in Babylon ==
According to the Bible, Ezekiel and his wife lived during the [[Babylonian captivity]] on the banks of the [[Chebar River]], in [[Tel Abib]],{{efn|Not to be confused with modern day [[Tel Aviv]], located on the [[Mediterranean]] coastline. However, this location's name was influenced by Ezekiel 3:15.}} with other exiles from Judah.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ezekiel 1:1]], [[Ezekiel 3#Verse 15|3:15]].&lt;/ref&gt; There is no mention of him having any offspring.

=== Prophetic career ===
Ezekiel describes his calling to be a [[prophet]] by going into great detail about his encounter with [[Yahweh|God]] and four &quot;living creatures&quot; with four wheels that stayed beside the creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2c|Ezekiel|1|NIV|Ezekiel 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next five years he incessantly prophesied and acted out the destruction of [[City of David|Jerusalem]] and its temple, which was met with some opposition. However, Ezekiel and his contemporaries like [[Jeremiah]], another prophet who was living in Jerusalem at that time, witnessed the fulfillment of their prophecies with the [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|siege of Jerusalem]] by the Babylonians. On the hypothesis that the &quot;thirtieth year&quot; of [[Ezekiel 1:1]] refers to Ezekiel's age, Ezekiel was fifty years old when he had his final vision.&lt;ref name=&quot;Betts2005&quot; /&gt; On the basis of dates given in the Book of Ezekiel, his span of prophecies can be calculated to have occurred over the course of about 22 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clements1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald Ernest Clements|title=Ezekiel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cB5WoWI3FRAC&amp;pg=PA1|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-25272-4|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last recorded prophecy of Ezekiel dates to April 570 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2c|Ezekiel|29:17|NIV|Ezekiel 29:17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eichrodt2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Walther Eichrodt|title=Ezekiel: A Commentary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wLN1BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA407|date=20 June 2003|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-1-61164-596-5|page=407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World views ==

=== Jewish tradition ===
[[File:Yad Vashem Memorial to survivors by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|240px|Monument to [[Holocaust survivors]] at [[Yad Vashem]] in [[Jerusalem]]. The quote is Ezekiel 37:14.]]
Ezekiel, like [[Jeremiah]], is said by [[Talmud]]&lt;ref&gt;(Meg. 14b)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Midrash]]&lt;ref&gt;([[Sifri]], Num. 78)&lt;/ref&gt; to have been a descendant of [[Joshua]] by his marriage with the [[proselyte]] and former prostitute [[Rahab]]. Some statements found in rabbinic literature posit that Ezekiel was the son of Jeremiah, who was (also) called &quot;Buzi&quot; because he was despised by the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Radak – R. David Kimkhi – in his commentary on Ezekiel 1:3, based on Targum Yerushalmi&lt;/ref&gt;

Ezekiel was said to be already active as a prophet while in the Land of Israel, and he retained this gift when he was exiled with Jehoiachin and the nobles of the country to Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''Ant.'' x. 6, § 3: &quot;while he was still a boy&quot;; comp. Rashi on Sanh. 92b&lt;/ref&gt;

Rava states in the Babylonian Talmud that although Ezekiel describes the appearance of the throne of God ([[Merkabah]]), this is not because he had seen more than the prophet [[Isaiah]], but rather because the latter was more accustomed to such visions; for the relation of the two prophets is that of a courtier to a peasant, the latter of whom would always describe a royal court more floridly than the former, to whom such things would be familiar.&lt;ref&gt;(Ḥag. 13b)&lt;/ref&gt; Ezekiel, like all the other prophets, has beheld only a blurred reflection of the divine majesty, just as a poor mirror reflects objects only imperfectly.&lt;ref&gt;Midrash Lev. Rabbah i. 14, toward the end&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[midrash]] ''[[Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah|Canticles Rabbah]]'', it was Ezekiel whom the three pious men, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah (also called [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego]] in the Bible) asked for advice as to whether they should resist Nebuchadnezzar's command and choose death by fire rather than worship his [[idolatry|idol]]. At first God revealed to the prophet that they could not hope for a miraculous rescue; whereupon the prophet was greatly grieved, since these three men constituted the &quot;remnant of Judah&quot;. But after they had left the house of the prophet, fully determined to sacrifice their lives to God, Ezekiel received this revelation: &quot;Thou dost believe indeed that I will abandon them. That shall not happen; but do thou let them carry out their intention according to their pious dictates, and tell them nothing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Midrash Canticles Rabbah vii. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianity ===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
[[File:Ezekiel-icon.jpg|thumb|[[Russian icon]] of the Prophet Ezekiel holding a [[scroll]] with his prophecy and pointing to the &quot;closed gate&quot; (18th century, [[Iconostasis]] of [[Kizhi]] [[monastery]], Russia)]]

Ezekiel is commemorated as a [[saint]] in the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|liturgical calendar]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]—and those [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] which follow the [[Byzantine Rite]]—on July 21 (for those churches which use the traditional [[Julian Calendar]], July 21 falls on August 5 of the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]).&lt;ref&gt;Orthodox Church in America – Liturgical Calendar [https://www.oca.org/saints/lives/2019/07/21]&lt;/ref&gt; Ezekiel is commemorated on August 28 on the [[Calendar of Saints (Armenian Apostolic Church)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], and on April 10 in the [[Roman Martyrology]].

Certain [[Lutheranism|Lutheran churches]] also celebrate his commemoration on July 21.&lt;ref&gt;Emmaus Evangelical Lutheran Church, [http://www.emmaus24.org/cotw/2018-07-15_cotwbook.pdf Daily Catechesis on the Way], published 15 July 2018, accessed 21 February 2020&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saint Bonaventure]] interpreted Ezekiel's statement about the &quot;closed gate&quot; as a prophecy of the Incarnation: the &quot;gate&quot; signifying the [[Virgin Mary]] and the &quot;prince&quot; referring to Jesus. This is one of the [[lection|readings]] at [[Vespers]] on [[Great Feasts]] of the [[Theotokos]] in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Byzantine Catholic]] Churches.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} This imagery is also found in the traditional Catholic Christmas hymn &quot;[[Gaudete]]&quot; and in a saying by Bonaventure, quoted by [[Alphonsus Maria de' Liguori]]: &quot;No one can enter Heaven unless by Mary, as though through a door.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alphonsus Maria de' Liguori, ''[[The Glories of Mary]]'', Liguori, Mo.: Liguori Publications, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;623. {{ISBN|0-7648-0664-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The imagery provides the basis for the concept that God gave Mary to humanity as the &quot;Gate of Heaven&quot; (thence the dedication of churches and convents to the Porta Coeli), an idea also laid out in the ''Salve Regina'' ([[Hail Holy Queen]]) prayer.

=== Islamic tradition ===
{{Main| Dhul-Kifl}}
Ezekiel is recognized as a [[prophet]] in [[Islamic]] [[tradition]]. Although not mentioned in the [[Qur'an]] by the name, [[Muslim]] scholars, both classical{{efn|Ibn Kutayba, Ukasha, Tabari, Ibn Kathir, Ibn Ishaq, Masudi, Kisa'i, Balami, Thalabi and many more have all recognized Ezekiel as a prophet}} and modern{{efn|The greatest depth to the figure is given by [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]], in his commentary; his commentary's note '''2743''': &quot;If we accept &quot;Dhul al Kifl&quot; to be not an epithet, but an Arabicised form of &quot;Ezekiel&quot;, it fits the context, Ezekiel was a prophet in Israel who was carried away to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar after his second attack on Jerusalem (about BCE 599). His Book is included in the English Bible (Old Testament). He was chained and bound, and put into prison, and for a time he was dumb. He bore all with patience and constancy, and continued to reprove boldly the evils in Israel. In a burning passage he denounces false leaders in words which are eternally true: &quot;Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flocks? Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock. The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken ...... etc. (Ezekiel, 34:2–4).&quot;}} have included Ezekiel in lists of the [[prophets of Islam]].

The Qur'an mentions a prophet called [[Dhul-Kifl|Zul-Kifl]]. This prophet is sometimes identified with Ezekiel although Zul-Kifl's identity is disputed. [[Carsten Niebuhr]], in his ''Reisebeschreibung nach Arabian'',&lt;ref&gt;''Reisebeschreibung nach Arabian'' Copenhagen, 1778, ii. 264–266&lt;/ref&gt; says he visited [[Al Kifl]] in [[Iraq]], midway between [[Najaf]] and [[Hilla]] and said ''Kifl'' was the [[Arabic]] form of ''Ezekiel''. He further explained in his book that [[Ezekiel's Tomb]] was present in [[Al Kifl]] and that the Jews came to it on pilgrimage. The name ''Zul-Kifl'' or more correctly ''Dhū l-Kifl'' ({{lang|ar|ذو الكفل}}) would mean &quot;Possessor of the Double&quot; or &quot;Possesor of the Fold&quot; ({{lang|ar|ذو}} ''dhū'' &quot;possessor of, owner of&quot; and {{lang|ar|الكفل}} ''al-kifl'' &quot;double, folded&quot;). Some Islamic scholars have likened Ezekiel's mission to the description of Dhul-Kifl. When the exile, monarchy, and state were annihilated, a political and national life was no longer possible. In the absence of a worldly foundation it became necessary to build a spiritual one and Ezekiel performed this mission by observing the signs of the time and deducing his doctrines from them. In conformity with the two parts of his book, his personality and his preaching are alike twofold. Aside from the possible identification of Zul-Kifl with Ezekiel, [[Muslim]]s have viewed Ezekiel as a prophet, regardless of his identification with Zul-Kifl.

Ezekiel appears in all [[Muslim]] collections of ''[[Stories of the Prophets]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Stories of the Prophets'', Ibn Kathir, ''Story of Ezekiel (Hizqil)''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muslim]] [[exegesis]] further lists Ezekiel's father as [[Buzi]] (''Budhi'') and Ezekiel is given the title ''ibn al-adjus'', denoting &quot;son of the old (man)&quot;, as his parents are supposed to have been very old when he was born. A tradition, which resembles that of [[Hannah (Bible)|Hannah]] and [[Samuel]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]], states that Ezekiel's mother prayed to God in old age for the birth of an offspring and was given Ezekiel as a gift from [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', G. Vajda, ''Hizkil''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ezekiel's Tomb|The tomb of Ezekiel]] is a structure located in modern-day south [[Iraq]] near [[Al Kifl|Kefil]], believed to be the final resting place of Ezekiel.&lt;ref name=JE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=562&amp;letter=E |title=Jewishencyclopedia.com |publisher=Jewishencyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been a place of pilgrimage to both Muslims and Jews alike.
