The '''England national football team''' represents [[England]] in  men's international [[Association football|football]] and is governed by [[The Football Association]], the governing body for [[football in England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FA Handbook 2013–14|url=http://www.thefa.com/~/media/files/thefaportal/governance-docs/rules-of-the-association/2013-14/fa-handbook-2013-14.ashx|publisher=TheFA.com|accessdate=2 February 2014|page=621|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Written evidence submitted by Lord Triesman|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmcumeds/792/792we16.htm|publisher=Parliament.uk|accessdate=31 August 2014|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It competes in the three major international tournaments; the [[FIFA World Cup]], the [[UEFA European Championship]] and the [[UEFA Nations League]]. England, as a [[Countries of the United Kingdom|country of the United Kingdom]], is not a member of the [[International Olympic Committee]] and therefore the national team does not compete at the [[Olympic Games]].

England is one of the two oldest national teams in football, alongside [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], whom they played in the world's [[1872 Scotland v England football match|first international football match]] in 1872. England's home ground is [[Wembley Stadium]], London, and their headquarters is at [[St George's Park National Football Centre|St George's Park]], [[Burton upon Trent]]. The team's manager is [[Gareth Southgate]]. 

Since first entering the tournament in 1950, England has qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] 15 times. They won the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]], when they hosted [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|the finals]], and finished fourth in [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] and [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]]. Since first entering in 1964, England have never won the [[UEFA European Championship]], with their best performances being third-place finishes in [[UEFA Euro 1968#Third place play-off|1968]] and [[UEFA Euro 1996|1996]], the latter as hosts.

{{Main|History of the England national football team}}

===Early years===
[[File:England 1893.jpg|thumb|left|The England team before a match against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] at Richmond in 1893]]
The England national football team is the joint-oldest in the world; it was formed at the same time as [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. A [[England v Scotland representative matches (1870–1872)|representative match between England and Scotland]] was played on 5 March 1870, having been organised by the [[The Football Association|Football Association]]. A return fixture was organised by representatives of Scottish football teams on 30 November 1872. This match, played at [[Hamilton Crescent]] in Scotland, is viewed as the first official international football match, because the two teams were independently selected and operated, rather than being the work of a single football association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=England Match No. 1&amp;nbsp;– Scotland&amp;nbsp;– 30 November 1872&amp;nbsp;– Match Summary and Report |url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/Seas1872-00/1872-73/M0001Sco1872.html |publisher=englandfootballonline.com |accessdate=22 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203105311/http://www.englandfootballonline.com/Seas1872-00/1872-73/M0001Sco1872.html |archive-date=3 December 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next 40 years, England played exclusively with the other three [[Home Nations]]—Scotland, [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and [[Ireland national football team (1882–1950)|Ireland]]—in the [[British Home Championship]].

At first, England had no permanent home stadium. They joined [[FIFA]] in 1906 and played their first ever games against countries other than the Home Nations on a tour of Central Europe in 1908. [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] was opened in 1923 and became their home ground. The relationship between England and FIFA became strained, and this resulted in their departure from FIFA in 1928, before they rejoined in 1946. As a result, they did not compete in a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] until [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]], in which they were beaten in a [[England v United States (1950)|1–0 defeat]] by the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], failing to get past the first round in one of the most embarrassing defeats in the team's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/7823072/England-v-USA-1950-World-Cup-win-over-the-Three-Lions-lives-long-in-the-memory.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Tim |last=Hart |title=England v USA: 1950 World Cup win over the Three Lions lives long in the memory |date=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their first defeat on home soil to a foreign team was a [[1949 England v Ireland football match|2–0 loss]] to [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]], on 21 September 1949 at [[Goodison Park]]. A [[Match of the Century (1953 England v Hungary football match)|6–3 loss]] in 1953 to [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], was their second defeat by a foreign team at Wembley. In the return match in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] won 7–1. This stands as England's largest ever defeat. After the game, a bewildered [[Syd Owen]] said, &quot;it was like playing men from outer space&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article1023170.ece |title=Football's November revolution: Magnificent Magyars storm England's Wembley fortress |first=John |last=Goodbody |newspaper=The Times |date=22 November 2003 |accessdate=13 February 2011 |location=London |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429081007/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article1023170.ece |archivedate=29 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1954 FIFA World Cup]], England reached the quarter-finals for the first time, and lost 4–2 to reigning champions [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]].

===Walter Winterbottom and Alf Ramsey===
[[File:The Queen presents the 1966 World Cup to England Captain, Bobby Moore. (7936243534).jpg|thumb|[[Elizabeth II]] presenting England captain [[Bobby Moore]] with the Jules Rimet trophy following England's 4–2 victory over West Germany in the 1966 World Cup final]]
Although [[Walter Winterbottom]] was appointed as England's first ever full-time manager in 1946, the team was still picked by a committee until [[Alf Ramsey]] took over in 1963. The [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] was hosted in England and Ramsey guided England to victory with a [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|4–2 win]] against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] after [[extra time]] in the final, during which [[Geoff Hurst]] scored a [[hat-trick]]. In [[UEFA Euro 1968]], the team reached the semi-finals for the first time, being eliminated by [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]].

England qualified for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] in Mexico as reigning champions, and reached the quarter-finals, where they were knocked out by West Germany. England had been 2–0 up, but were eventually beaten 3–2 after [[extra time]]. They failed in qualification for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]], leading to Ramsey's dismissal.

===Don Revie, Ron Greenwood and Bobby Robson===
Ramsey was succeeded by [[Don Revie]] between 1974 and 1977, but the team failed to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 1976]] and the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]]. Under [[Ron Greenwood]], they managed to qualify for the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] in Spain (the first time competitively since 1962); despite not losing a game, they were eliminated in the second group stage.

[[Bobby Robson]] managed England from 1982 to 1990. Although the team failed to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 1984]], they reached the quarter-finals of the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]], losing 2–1 to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in a game made famous by two goals by [[Diego Maradona|Maradona]] for very contrasting reasons - the first being knocked in by hand, prompting the &quot;Hand of God&quot; label, the second being an outstanding individual goal, involving dribbling past several opponents. England striker [[Gary Lineker]] finished as the tournament's top scorer with six goals.

England went on to lose every match at [[UEFA Euro 1988]]. They next achieved their second best result in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] by finishing fourth&amp;nbsp;– losing again to West Germany in a semi-final finishing 1–1 after [[extra time]], then 4–3 in England's first [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]]. Despite losing to [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the third place play-off, the members of the England team were given bronze medals identical to the Italians'. Due to the emotional nature of the defeat to West Germany&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt0xx3So6zw&amp;feature=emb_logo&lt;/ref&gt;, the team were welcomed home as heroes and thousands of people lined the streets for an open-top bus parade.

===Graham Taylor, Terry Venables, Glenn Hoddle and Kevin Keegan===
The 1990s saw four England managers follow Robson, each in the role for a relatively brief period. [[Graham Taylor (footballer)|Graham Taylor]] was Robson's immediate successor. England failed to win any matches at [[UEFA Euro 1992]], drawing with tournament winners [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and later with [[France national football team|France]], before being eliminated by host nation [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. The team then failed to qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] after losing a controversial game against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in Rotterdam, which resulted in Taylor's resignation.

Between 1994 and 1996, [[Terry Venables]] managed the team. At [[UEFA Euro 1996]], held in England, they equalled their best performance at a [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]], reaching the semi-finals as they did in 1968, before exiting via a penalty shoot-out loss to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/27/retro-mbm-england-v-west-germany-sort-of-live |title =England v West Germany at Italia '90 – as it happened|date=27 March 2014|work=Guardian|accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; England striker [[Alan Shearer]] was the tournament's top scorer with five goals. Venables resigned following investigations into his financial activities.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Venables is also the only England manager ever to resign from his post because of the muddy personal details set to be showcased in a high-profile trial related to financial irregularities.&quot; {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lg7k-Y5vF8kC&amp;pg=PT855 |title=V is for Venables|publisher=[[When Saturday Comes]]|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venables' successor, [[Glenn Hoddle]], similarly left the job for non-footballing reasons after just one international tournament&amp;nbsp;– the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]&amp;nbsp;— in which England were eliminated in the second round again by Argentina and again on penalties (after a 2–2 draw). Following Hoddle's departure, [[Kevin Keegan]] took England to [[UEFA Euro 2000]], but the team left in the group stage and he resigned shortly afterwards.

===Sven-Göran Eriksson, Steve McClaren and Fabio Capello===

[[File:England team.jpg|thumb|left|The England team at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]]]
[[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] took charge between 2001 and 2006, and was the team's first non-English manager. He guided England to the quarter-finals of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], [[UEFA Euro 2004]] and the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. England lost only five competitive matches during his tenure, and England rose to number four in the world ranking under his guidance. Eriksson's contract was extended by the FA by two years, to include [[UEFA Euro 2008]], but was terminated by them after the 2006 World Cup.

[[Steve McClaren]] was then appointed as head coach, but after failing to qualify for Euro 2008 was sacked on 22 November 2007. The following month, he was replaced by a second foreign manager, Italian [[Fabio Capello]], whose experience included spells at [[Juventus]] and [[Real Madrid]]. England won all but one of their [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification&amp;nbsp;– UEFA Group 6|qualifying games]] for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], but at the tournament itself, England drew their opening two games; this led to questions about the team's spirit, tactics and ability to handle pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rifts appear as players grow tired of Capello regime |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/jun/21/england-john-terry-fabio-capello |date=21 June 2010 |last=Gibson |first=Owen |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=3 July 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; They progressed to the next round, however, where they were beaten 4–1 by [[Germany national football team|Germany]], their heaviest defeat in a World Cup finals tournament match. In February 2012, Capello resigned from his role as England manager, following a disagreement with the [[English Football Association|FA]] over their request to remove [[John Terry]] from team captaincy after accusations of racial abuse concerning the player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16941457 |title=Fabio Capello quits as England manager after meeting with FA |publisher=BBC |date=8 February 2012 |accessdate=2 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729112918/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16941457 |archive-date=29 July 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roy Hodgson, Sam Allardyce and Gareth Southgate===

[[File:Eng1966 football shirt.jpeg|thumb|upright|England shirt for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|1966 World Cup final]]]]
{{Commons|England national football team kits}}
England's traditional home colours are white shirts, navy blue shorts and white or black socks. The team has periodically worn an all-white kit.

Although England's first [[away kit]]s were blue, England's traditional away colours are red shirts, white shorts and red socks. In 1996, England's away kit was changed to grey shirts, shorts and socks. This kit was only worn three times, including against [[Germany National Football Team|Germany]] in the semi-final of [[Euro 1996]] but the deviation from the traditional red was unpopular with supporters and the England away kit remained red until 2011, when a navy blue away kit was introduced. The away kit is also sometimes worn during home matches, when a new edition has been released to promote it.

England have occasionally had a third kit. At the 1970 World Cup England wore a third kit with pale blue shirts, shorts and socks against [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]]. They had a kit similar to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]'s, with yellow shirts, yellow socks and blue shorts which they wore in the summer of 1973. For the World Cup in 1986 England had a third kit of pale blue, imitating that worn in Mexico 16 years before and England retained pale blue third kits until 1992, but they were rarely used.

[[Umbro]] first agreed to manufacture the kit in 1954 and since then has supplied most of the kits, the exceptions being from 1959–1965 with [[Bukta]] and 1974–1984 with [[Admiral Sportswear|Admiral]]. [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] purchased Umbro in 2008 and took over as kit supplier in 2013 following their sale of the Umbro brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=England's Uniforms and Playing Kits|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/teamunif/Unif.html|website=EnglandFootballOnline.com|accessdate=30 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115085155/http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamUnif/Unif.html|archive-date=15 January 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home stadium==
{{Main|England national football team home stadium}}
[[File:Wembley enggermatch.jpg|thumb|[[Wembley Stadium]] during a friendly match between England and [[Germany national football team|Germany]]]]
For the first 50 years of their existence, England played their home matches all around the country. They initially used [[cricket]] grounds before later moving on to football club stadiums. The original [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Empire Stadium]] was built in [[Wembley]], London, for the [[British Empire Exhibition]].

England played their first match at the stadium in 1924 against Scotland and for the next 27 years Wembley was used as a venue for matches against Scotland only. The stadium later became known simply as Wembley Stadium and it became England's permanent home stadium during the 1950s. In October 2000, the stadium closed its doors, ending with a [[2000 England v Germany football match|defeat]].

This stadium was demolished during the period of 2002–2003, and work began to completely rebuild it. During this time, England played at venues across the country, though by the time of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification&amp;nbsp;– UEFA Group 6|2006 World Cup qualification]], this had largely settled down to having [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s [[Old Trafford]] stadium as the primary venue, with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]'s [[St. James' Park, Newcastle|St. James' Park]] used on occasions when Old Trafford was unavailable.

They returned to the new [[Wembley Stadium]] in March 2007. The stadium is now owned by the Football Association, via its subsidiary Wembley National Stadium Limited.

===Media coverage===
All England matches are broadcast with full commentary on [[talkSPORT]] and [[BBC Radio 5 Live]]. From the [[2008–09 in English football|2008–09]] season until the 2017–18 season, England's home and away qualifiers, and friendlies both home and away are broadcast live on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] (often with the exception of [[STV (TV network)|STV]], the ITV franchisee in central and northern [[Scotland]]). England's away qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup were shown on [[Setanta Sports]] until that company's collapse. As a result of Setanta Sports's demise, England's World Cup qualifier in Ukraine on 10 October 2009 was shown in the United Kingdom on a pay-per-view basis via the internet only. This one-off event was the first time an England game had been screened in such a way. The number of subscribers, paying between £4.99 and £11.99 each, was estimated at between 250,000 and 300,000 and the total number of viewers at around 500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Meltdown averted as England match draws online audience of 500,000 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=11 October 2009 |last=Gibson |first=Owen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/oct/11/england-ukraine-internet-viewing-figures |accessdate=23 February 2010 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808042823/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/oct/11/england-ukraine-internet-viewing-figures |archive-date=8 August 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, [[Sky Sports]] broadcast the England Nations League and in-season friendlies, until 2021 and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] broadcast the European Qualifiers for Euro-World Cups and pre-tournament friendlies (after the Nations League group matches end), until 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/news/2017/jan/26/260117-england-uefa-broadcast-2018-2022-itv-sky|title=England matches to be broadcast by ITV and Sky Sports|last=Association|first=The Football|website=www.thefa.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224064012/http://www.thefa.com/news/2017/jan/26/260117-england-uefa-broadcast-2018-2022-itv-sky|archive-date=24 December 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FIFA World Cup===
{{Main|England at the FIFA World Cup}}

[[File:2018 World Cup Semifinal - England v Croatia.jpg|thumb|2018 FIFA World Cup semi-final: England vs Croatia.]]

England first appeared at the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]], and have subsequently qualified for a total of 15 FIFA World Cup finals tournaments, tied for sixth best by number of appearances. They are also tied for sixth by number of wins, alongside Spain. The national team is one of eight national teams to have won at least one [[FIFA World Cup]] title. The England team won their first and only World Cup title in [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]]. The tournament was played on home soil, and England defeated [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] 4–2 in the [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|final]]. In [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]], England finished in fourth place, losing 2–1 to host nation [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the third place play-off, after losing on penalties to champions [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in the semi-final. They also finished in fourth place in [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]], after losing 2–0 to [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in the third place play-off and 2–1 to [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] in the semi-final after extra time. The team also reached the quarter-final stage in [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]], [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]], [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]], [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]].

England failed to qualify for the World Cup in [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]], [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]] and [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]]. The team's earliest exit in the finals tournament was its elimination in the first round in [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]], [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] and, most recently, the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. This was after being defeated in both their opening two matches for the first time, against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in Group D. In 1950, four teams remained after the first round, in 1958 eight teams remained and in 2014 sixteen teams remained. In [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], England suffered its most resounding World Cup defeat, 4–1 to [[Germany national football team|Germany]], in the Round of 16 stage. This came after drawing with the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] and [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], and defeating [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] 1–0 in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group C|group stage]].

===UEFA European Championship===
{{Main|England at the UEFA European Championship}}
[[File:GER-ENG 1996-06-26.svg|thumb|Line-ups of the Euro 1996 semi-final between England (grey) and Germany.]]

England's greatest achievements at the [[UEFA European Championship]] have been to finish in third place in [[UEFA Euro 1968|1968]] and [[UEFA Euro 1996|1996]]. England hosted Euro 96, and have qualified for nine UEFA European Championship finals tournaments, tied for fourth best by number of appearances. The team has also reached the quarter-final on two recent occasions, in [[UEFA Euro 2004|2004]] and [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012]].

The team's worst result in the competition was a first-round elimination in [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980]], [[UEFA Euro 1988|1988]], [[UEFA Euro 1992|1992]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000|2000]]. The team did not enter in [[UEFA Euro 1960|1960]], and failed to qualify for the finals in [[UEFA Euro 1964|1964]], [[UEFA Euro 1972|1972]], [[UEFA Euro 1976|1976]], [[UEFA Euro 1984|1984]] and [[UEFA Euro 2008|2008]].
