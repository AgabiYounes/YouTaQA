The '''eightfold path''' is a method of [[policy analysis]] assembled by [[Eugene Bardach]], a professor at the [[Goldman School of Public Policy]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eugene Bardach {{!}} Emeritus Professor of Public Policy|url=https://gspp.berkeley.edu/directories/faculty/eugene-bardach|publisher=University of California at Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is outlined in his book ''A Practical Guide for Policy Analysis: The Eightfold Path to More Effective Problem Solving'', which is now in its fourth edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CQ Press: Book: A Practical Guide for Policy Analysis: The Eightfold Path to More Effective Problem Solving, 4th Edition, Eugene Bardach |url=http://www.cqpress.com/product/Bardach4e.html |publisher=CQ Press |accessdate=29 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010053147/http://www.cqpress.com/product/Bardach4e.html |archivedate=10 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book is commonly referenced in [[Policy|public policy]] and [[public administration]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of scholarly works referencing ''A Practical Guide for Policy Analysis''|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=4884126323094470718&amp;as_sdt=20005&amp;sciodt=0,9&amp;hl=en|publisher=Google Scholar|accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bardach's procedure is as follows:
# Define the problem
# Assemble the evidence
# Construct the alternatives
# Select the criteria
# Project the outcomes
# Confront the trade-offs
# Decide
# Tell your story

A possible ninth step, based on Bardach's own writing, might be &quot;repeat steps 1 - 8 as necessary.&quot;

=== The New York taxi driver test ===
The New York taxi driver test is a technique for evaluating the effectiveness of communication between policy makers and analysts. Bardach contends that policy explanations must be clear and down-to-earth enough for a taxi driver to be able to understand the premise during a trip through city streets. The New York taxi driver is presumed to be both a non-specialist and a tough customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bardach| first = Eugene| title = A practical guide for policy analysis: the eightfold path to more effective problem solving| year = 2000| publisher = Chatham House Publishers, Seven Bridges Press| isbn = 978-1-889119-29-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebriefings.ca/wordpress/?p%3D321 |accessdate=13 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712110533/http://www.ebriefings.ca/wordpress/?p=321 |archivedate=12 July 2011 |title=Digital Fishers – The Taxi Driver Pitch }}&lt;/ref&gt;
