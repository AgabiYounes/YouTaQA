'''Esther'''{{efn |{{IPAc-en |ˈ|ɛ|s|t|ər|}}; {{Lang-he|אֶסְתֵּר|’Estēr}}), born '''Hadassah''' ({{Hebrew Name |הֲדַסָּה|Hadasa|Haḏasā}}.}} is described in the [[Book of Esther]] as a [[Jewish]] queen of the [[Persian king]] [[Ahasuerus#Book of Esther |Ahasuerus]] (commonly identified as [[Xerxes I]], reigned 486–465 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= The Religious Policy of Xerxes and the ''Book of Esther'' | journal= The Jewish Quarterly Review | volume= 65 |issue = 3| pages= 145–155 | first =Robert J. | last = Littman | date= January 1975|jstor = 1454354| doi= 10.2307/1454354 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the narrative, Ahasuerus seeks a new wife after his queen, [[Vashti]], refuses to obey him, and Esther is chosen for her beauty. The king's chief advisor, [[Haman (Bible) |Haman]], is offended by Esther's cousin and guardian, [[Mordecai]], and gets permission from the king to have all the Jews in the kingdom killed. Esther foils the plan, and wins permission from the king for the Jews to kill their enemies, and they do so. Her story is the traditional basis for [[Purim]], which is celebrated on the date given in the story for when Haman's order was to go into effect, which is the same day that the Jews killed their enemies after the plan was reversed.

[[File:Tomb of Esther and Mordechai interior.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of the structure venerated as the tomb of Esther and Mordecai]]
According to most scholars, the name ''Esther'' is derived from the Mesopotamian goddess [[Inanna |Ishtar]] and/or the Persian word stara, &quot;star&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brettler |first1=Marc |last2=Newsom |first2=Carol |last3=Perkins |first3=Pheme |title=The New Oxford Annotated Bible: New Revised Standard Version |date=2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780190276065 |page=715 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UU5WDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA715 |language=en |chapter=Esther}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OUPedia2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mary Joan Winn Leith |editor1-last=Coogan |editor1-first=Michael D. |editor1-link=Michael D.

The [[Book of Daniel]] provides accounts of Jews in exile being assigned names relating to [[Babylonia]]n gods and &quot;[[Mordecai]]&quot; is understood to mean servant of [[Marduk]], a Babylonian god. &quot;Esther&quot; may have been a different Hebrew interpretation from the [[Proto-Semitic]] root &quot;star/'morning/evening star'&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= The Ancient Languages of Syria-Palestine and Arabia |last= Huehnergard |first= John |date=2008-04-10 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 978-1-13946934-0 |editor-last= Woodard |editor-first= Roger D. |pages= 225–46 |chapter= Appendix 1: Afro-Asiatic}}&lt;/ref&gt; which descended with the /th/ into the [[Ugaritic]] ''Athtiratu''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Divine Epithets in the Ugaritic Alphabetic Texts|last1 = Rahmouni|first1 = Aïcha |last2= Ford |first2= J.N. |date=2008 |publisher= Brill |isbn= 978-900415769-9 |page= 86|chapter=Section 1, The Near and Middle East}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arabian]] ''Athtar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Offord|first=Joseph |date=April 1915|title=The Deity of the Crescent Venus in Ancient Western Asia|journal= Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|page= 198 |jstor= 25189307}}&lt;/ref&gt; The derivation must then have been secondary for the initial [[ayin]] to be confused with an [[aleph]] (both represented by vowels in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]), and the second consonant descended as a /s/ (like in the [[Aramaic]] {{lang|arc|asthr}} &quot;bright star&quot;), rather than a /sh/ as in Hebrew and most commonly in Akkadian.

Even in Talmudic times it was realized that the name Esther was of foreign origin. According to one opinion mentioned in the [[Talmud]] (Tractate [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] [https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.13a.12?lang=bi&amp;with=Jastrow&amp;lang2=en 13a])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Soncino Babylonian Talmud: Megillah |publisher=Soncino Press |pages=47–48n15 |url=https://www.halakhah.com/rst/moed/21%20-%20Megillah%20-%202a-32a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yalkut Shimoni]] ([https://www.sefaria.org/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach.1053.7?vhe=Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach&amp;lang=bi 1053:7])&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica1910&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information |date=1910 |publisher=At the University Press |page=797 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=49aAxPLBDeQC&amp;pg=PA797 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Targum Sheni]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Targum Sheni (II) to Esther 2:7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MKNwSIEQ7l4C&amp;pg=PP697 |quote=איתקרי שמא אסתר בשם כוכב נוגהא יונית אסתירא|last1 = Parenzo|first1 = Asher ben Jacob|last2 = (Venecia)|first2 = Giovanni Bragadin|year = 1590}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cassel |first1=Paulus |title=An explanatory commentary on Esther : with four appendices consisting of the second Targum translated from the Aramaic with notes : Mithra : the winged bulls of Persepolis : and Zoroaster |date=1888 |publisher=Edinburgh : T. &amp; T.

[[Abraham Yahuda|A. S. Yahuda]] conjectured that the name Esther is derived from a reconstructed [[Medes |Median]] word ''astra'' meaning [[Myrtus|myrtle]].&lt;ref&gt;Abusch, T.

[[File:The Feast of Esther by Johannes Spilberg the Younger.jpg|left|thumb|280x280px|The Feast of Esther by Johannes Spilberg the Younger]]
In the narrative, King [[Ahasuerus]] is drunk at a festival and orders his queen, [[Vashti]], to appear before him and his guests to display her beauty. When she refuses to appear, he deposes her and seeks a new queen. Beautiful maidens gather together at the [[harem]] in the citadel of [[Susa]] under the authority of the eunuch [[Hegai]].&lt;ref name=art01&gt;{{cite book |last1=Solle |first1=Dorothee |title=Great Women of the Bible: In Art and Literature |date=2006 |publisher=Fortress Press |isbn=0800635574 |page=107 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nn6WXpISp2MC&amp;pg=PA107 |accessdate=22 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Esther was the cousin of [[Mordecai]], a member of the [[Persian Jews|Jewish]] community in the [[Exilic Period]] who claimed as an ancestor  [[Kish_(Bible)#Other_biblical_figures_named_Kish|Kish]], a [[Benjamite]] who had been taken from [[Jerusalem]] into captivity. She was the orphaned daughter of Mordecai's uncle, another Benjamite named Abihail. Upon the king's orders Esther was taken to palace where Hegai prepared her for meeting the king. Even as she advanced to the highest position of the harem, perfumed with [[myrrh]] and allocated certain foods and servants, she was under strict instructions from Mordecai, who met with her each day, to conceal her Jewish origins. The king falls in love with her and makes her Queen.&lt;ref name=art01 /&gt;

Later, Mordecai refuses to bow to [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] the [[Agagite]], who was recently made Ahasuerus' highest advisor, and Haman requests and is given permission to order all the Jews in Persia to be killed. When Esther learns of this, Mordecai tells her to reveal to the king that she is Jewish and to ask him to repeal the order. Esther hesitates, saying that she could be put to death if she goes to the king without being summoned and the king does not want to see her; Mordecai urges her to try. She goes to the king, and the king welcomes her, and says he will give her anything she wants.  Instead of asking directly about the order, she invites the king and Haman to a banquet the next day. During the banquet, the king again asked Esther if there is anything she wants, and this time she asks the king to spare her life and that of all of the Jews. The king asks who was threatening them, and she names Haman. Haman throws himself at her feet; the king thinks that Haman is attacking her and orders him to be put to death, and gives all Haman's possessions to Esther. Esther tells the king about Mordecai's role in her life, and the king makes Mordecai his highest advisor. Esther then asks the king to revoke the order, and king allows Esther and Mordecai to do so, however they wish. They send out an order in the king's name that Jews can assemble and defend themselves, and can kill anyone who threatens them, and their families, and take their goods. On the thirteenth day of Adar, the same day that Haman had set for them to be killed, the Jews do so in one city, killing 500 people but not taking plunder, and they kill around 75,000 the next day again not taking plunder, and then they feast.&lt;ref name=je&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hirsch |first1=Emil G. |last2=Prince |first2=John Dyneley |last3=Schechter |first3=Solomon |title=Jewish Encyclopedia |date=1936 |publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls Co. |location=New York |chapter-url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5872-esther |chapter=Esther}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purim==
{{Main article|Purim}}
The Jews established an annual feast, the feast of [[Purim]], in memory of their deliverance. Haman set the date of Adar 13 to commence his campaign against the Jews. This determined the date of the festival of Purim.&lt;ref name=Crawford&gt;Crawford, Sidnie White. &quot;[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/esther-bible Esther: Bible]&quot;, Jewish Women's Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
{{Further information|Esther in rabbinic literature}}
Dianne Tidball argues that while [[Vashti]] is a &quot;feminist icon&quot;, Esther is a [[Postfeminism |post-feminist]] icon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = [[Christian Focus Publications]]| isbn = 978-1-85792671-2| last = Tidball| first = Dianne| title = Esther, a True First Lady: A Post-Feminist Icon in a Secular World| date = 2001| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/esther00dian_xj2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abraham Kuyper]] notes some &quot;disagreeable aspects&quot; to her character: that she should not have agreed to take [[Vashti]]'s place, that she refrained from saving her nation until her own life was threatened, and that she carries out bloodthirsty vengeance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = [[Zondervan]]| isbn = 978-0-31086487-5| last = Kuyper| first = Abraham| title = Women of the Old Testament | date = 2010-10-05 | pages= 175–76|authorlink= Abraham Kuyper}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Esther Denouncing Haman.jpg|thumb|''Esther Denouncing Haman'' by [[Ernest Normand]]]]
The tale opens with Esther as beautiful and obedient, but also a relatively passive figure. During the course of the story, she evolves into someone who takes a decisive role in her own future and that of her people.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Michael David; Brettler, Marc Zvi; Newsom, Carol Ann and Perkins, Pheme. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nc-i_pQsiW8C&amp;pg=PA708 ''The New Oxford Annotated Bible''], Oxford University Press, 2007 {{ISBN |978-0-19528880-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sidnie White Crawford, &quot;Esther's position in a male court mirrors that of the Jews in a Gentile world, with the threat of danger ever present below the seemingly calm surface.&quot;&lt;ref name=Sidnie&gt; Crawford, Sidnie White. &quot;Esther&quot;, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2Vo-11umIZQC&amp;pg=PA329 Eerdmans Commentary on the Bible]'', James D. G. Dunn, John William Rogerson, eds., Wm. B. Eerdmans, 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-80283711-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Esther is related to [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] in that both represent a &quot;type&quot; for Jews living in Diaspora, and hoping to live a successful life in an alien environment.

===Esther as rhetorical model===
According to [[Susan Zaeske]], by virtue of the fact that Esther used only [[rhetoric]] to convince the king to save her people, the story of Esther is a &quot;rhetoric of exile and empowerment that, for millennia, has notably shaped the discourse of marginalized peoples such as Jews, women, and African Americans&quot;, persuading those who have power over them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Zaeske |first1= Susan |title= Unveiling Esther as a Pragmatic Radical Rhetoric|journal=Philosophy and Rhetoric |date=2003 |volume= 33 |issue=3|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persian culture==
[[File:Tomb of Esther and Mordechai exterior.jpg|thumb|The Shrine venerated as the tomb of Esther and [[Mordechai|Mordecai]] in [[Hamadan]], [[Iran]]]]
Given the great historical link between Persian and [[Judaism|Jewish]] history, modern day [[Persian Jew]]s are called &quot;Esther's Children&quot;. A building venerated as being the [[Tomb of Esther and Mordechai]] is located in [[Hamadan]], [[Iran]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.payvand.com/news/10/may/1135.html |title=Sad Fate of Iran's Jews | work = Payvand |first= Parvaneh|last= Vahidmanesh |date= 5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the village of [[Kfar Bar'am]] in northern [[Israel]] also claims to be the burial place of Queen Esther.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.jewishmag.com/44mag/synagogues/synagogues.htm |title=Ancient synagogues in Bar'am and Capernaum |first= Jacqueline|last=Schaalje |date= June 2001 | work = [[Jewish Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depictions of Esther==
{{see also|Book of Esther#Modern retelling}}
There are several [[:Category:Paintings of Esther|paintings depicting Esther]], including one by [[John Everett Millais|Millais]]. ''[[Esther before Ahasuerus]]'' is one of the most commonly depicted parts of the story, painted by [[Artemisia Gentileschi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Esther before Ahasuerus |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/436453. |website=Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=22 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tintoretto]] and many others.  Similar scenes appear in some panels of the [[Sistine Chapel]], including one that shows [[Haman]] crucified. The 15th century painter [[Andrea del Castagno]] shows Esther in early [[Renaissance]] period dress. 18th century painter [[Aert de Gelder]] shows Mordecai talking to Esther.&lt;ref name=art01 /&gt;  The scene of Esther's coronation is depicted on an [[illuminated manuscript]] in Barcelona. MS 288 contains a [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] showing Esther sending a message to Mordecai that some instructions he gave are too risky for her to fulfill. The Heilspiegel Altarpiece by [[Konrad Witz]] depicts Esther appearing before the king to beg mercy for the Jews despite the punishment for appearing without being summoned is death.&lt;ref name=art01 /&gt;

==Canonicity in Christianity==
The status of Esther as a [[Biblical canon|canonical book]] of the Bible has historically been under dispute. For example, in the first several centuries of Christianity, Esther does not appear in the lists of books produced by [[Melito]], [[Athanasius]], [[Cyril]], [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], and others. Additionally, no copies of Esther were found at Qumran in the contents of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. Nevertheless, by the fourth century CE, the majority of Western churches accepted Esther as a part of their Bibles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Baker Academic | isbn = 978-0-80104710-7 | last = McDonald | first = Lee Martin | title = The Biblical Canon: Its Origin, Transmission, and Authority | date = 2006-11-01 | pages = 56, 109, 128, 131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Esther is also commemorated as a matriarch in the [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] on May 24. She is also recognized as a saint in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]] Churches.
&quot;The Septuagint edition of Esther contains six parts (totaling 107 verses) not found in the Hebrew Bible. Although these interpretations originally may have been composed in Hebrew, they survive only in Greek texts. Because the Hebrew Bible’s version of Esther’s story contains neither prayers nor even a single reference to God, Greek redactors apparently felt compelled to give the tale a more explicit religious orientation, alluding to &quot;God&quot; or the &quot;Lord&quot; fifty times.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Old Testament: An Introduction to the Hebrew Bible | page = 375 | first1 = Stephen | last1 = Harris | first2 = Robert | last2 = Platzner}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These additions to Esther in the Apocrypha were added approximately in the second or first century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls | page = 182 | first1 = James | last1 = Vanderkam | first2 = Peter | last2 = Flint}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Esther | work = LXX | publisher = EC Marsh | url = http://www.ecmarsh.com/lxx/Esther/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Esther is also made reference to in chapter 28 of [[Meqabyan#First Book of Ethiopian Maccabees (Meqabyan 1)|1 Meqabyan]], a book considered [[Orthodox Tewahedo biblical canon|canonical]] in the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]].
