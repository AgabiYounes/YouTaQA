'''Edith of England''', also spelt '''Eadgyth''' or '''Ædgyth''' ({{lang-ang|Ēadgȳð}}, {{lang-de|Edgitha}}; 910 – 26 January 946), a member of the [[House of Wessex]], was [[German queen]] from 936, by her marriage with King [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]].

==Life==
Edith was born to the reigning [[Kingdom of England|English]] king [[Edward the Elder]] by his second wife, [[Ælfflæd, wife of Edward the Elder|Ælfflæd]], and hence was a granddaughter of King [[Alfred the Great]]. She had an older sister, [[Eadgifu of Wessex|Eadgifu]].

At the request of the [[East Frankish]] king [[Henry the Fowler]], who wished to stake a claim to equality and to seal the alliance between the two Saxon kingdoms, her half-brother King [[Æthelstan]] sent his sisters Edith and Edgiva to [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]]. Henry's eldest son and heir to the throne Otto was instructed to choose whichever one pleased him best. Otto chose Edith, according to [[Hrotsvitha]] a woman &quot;of pure noble countenance, graceful character and truly royal appearance&quot;, and married her in 930. 

[[File:Ankunft Ottos I. und Ediths in Magdeburg.jpg|thumb|left|Otto I and his wife Edith arrive near Magdeburg (Hugo Vogel 1898, Ständehaus Merseburg)]]
In 936 Henry the Fowler died and his eldest son Otto, Edith's husband, was crowned king at [[Aachen Cathedral]]. A surviving report of the ceremony by the medieval chronicler [[Widukind of Corvey]] makes no mention of his wife having been crowned at this point, but according to Bishop [[Thietmar of Merseburg]]'s chronicle, Eadgyth was nevertheless [[Anointing|anointed]] as queen, albeit in a separate ceremony. 

As queen consort, Edith undertook the usual state duties of a &quot;First Lady&quot;: when she turns up in the records it is generally in connection with gifts to the state's [[List of Imperial abbeys|favoured monasteries]] or memorials to holy women and saints. In this respect she seems to have been more diligent than her now widowed and subsequently sainted mother-in-law, Queen [[Matilda of Ringelheim|Matilda]], whose own charitable activities only achieve a single recorded mention from the period of Eadgyth's time as queen. There was probably rivalry between the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[:de:Mauritiuskloster|Monastery of St Maurice]] founded at [[Magdeburg]] by Otto and Eadgyth in 937, a year after coming to the throne, and Matilda's foundation [[Quedlinburg Abbey]], intended by her as a memorial to her husband, the late King Henry. Edith accompanied her husband on his travels, though not during battles. While Otto fought against the rebellious dukes [[Eberhard of Franconia]] and [[Gilbert, Duke of Lorraine|Gilbert of Lorraine]] in 939, she spent the hostilities at [[Lorsch Abbey]].

Like her brother, Æthelstan, Edith was devoted to the cult of their ancestor Saint [[Oswald of Northumbria]] and was instrumental in introducing this cult into Germany after her marriage to the emperor. Her lasting influence may have caused certain monasteries and churches in the [[Duchy of Saxony]] to be dedicated to this saint.&lt;ref name=&quot;GuardianEadgyth20Jan10&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/jan/20/alfred-great-granddaughter-remains-wessex|last=Kennedy|first=Maev|date=20 January 2010|title=Remains of Alfred the Great's granddaughter returned / Coming home: the Saxon queen lost for 1,000 years|pages=5|accessdate=20 January 2010 | location=London | work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eadgyth's death in 946 at a relatively young age, in her thirties, was unexpected. Otto apparently mourned the loss of a beloved spouse. He  married [[Adelaide of Italy]] in 951.

==Children==
Edith and Otto's children were:
* [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia]] (930 – 6 September 957)
* [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgarde]] (931 – 18 November 953), married the [[Lotharingia]]n duke [[Conrad the Red]] in 947
both buried in [[St. Alban's Abbey, Mainz]].

==Tomb==
[[File:Blick in die Grabkiste von 1510.jpg|thumb|View inside the lead coffin]]
Initially buried in the St Maurice monastery, Edith's tomb since the 16th century has been located in [[Magdeburg Cathedral]]. Long regarded as a [[cenotaph]], a lead coffin inside a stone sarcophagus with her name on it was found and opened in 2008 by archaeologists during work on the building. An inscription recorded that it was the body of Eadgyth, reburied in 1510. The fragmented and incomplete bones were examined in 2009, then brought to [[Bristol]], England, for tests in 2010. 

The investigations at Bristol, applying [[Technetium-99m|isotope]] tests on tooth enamel, checked whether she was born and brought up in [[Wessex]] and [[Mercia]], as written history indicated.&lt;ref name=&quot;GuardianEadgyth20Jan10&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DiscoveryNewsSatter&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/archaeology/english-princess-bones.html |title=Discovery News |last=Satter |first=Raphael G. |date=20 January 2010 |work=Bones of early English princess found in Germany |accessdate=21 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123012854/http://news.discovery.com/archaeology/english-princess-bones.html |archivedate=23 January 2010 }} Retrieved from Internet Archive 14 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Testing on the bones revealed that they are the remains of Eadgyth, from study made of the enamel of the teeth in her upper jaw.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100617043529/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/england/bristol/10332975.stm German cathedral bones 'are Saxon queen Eadgyth, BBC News, 16 June 2010] Retrieved from Internet Archive 14 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Testing of the enamel revealed that the individual entombed at Magdeburg had spent time as a youth in the [[chalk]]y uplands of [[Wessex]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/jun/17/saxon-princess-remains-german-cathedral Remains of first king of England's sister found in German cathedral, The Guardian, 17 June 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', Simon de Bruxelles, 17 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The bones are the oldest found of a member of English royalty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bristol.ac.uk/news/2010/7073.html Bones confirmed as those of Saxon Princess Eadgyth, University of Bristol, 17 June 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the tests the bones were re-interred in a new titanium coffin in her tomb at Magdeburg Cathedral on 22 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/0,1518,724628,00.html Königin Editha im Magdeburger Dom bestattet] in: [[Spiegel Online]] vom 22.
