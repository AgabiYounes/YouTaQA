'''Éric Alfred Leslie Satie''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|s|æ|t|i|,_|ˈ|s|ɑː|t|i}}, {{IPAc-en|US|s|æ|ˈ|t|iː|,_|s|ɑː|ˈ|t|iː}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LPD|3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EPD|18}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|eʁik sati|lang}}; 17 May 1866{{spaced ndash}}1 July 1925), who signed his name '''Erik Satie''' after 1884, was a French composer and pianist. Satie was an influential artist in the late 19th- and early 20th-century Parisian [[avant-garde]]. His work was a precursor to later artistic movements such as [[minimalism]], [[repetitive music]], and the [[Theatre of the Absurd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/erik-satie-his-music-the-vision-his-legacy|title=Lectures and events|work=gresham.ac.uk|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102053914/http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/erik-satie-his-music-the-vision-his-legacy|archivedate=2 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An eccentric, Satie was introduced as a &quot;gymnopedist&quot; in 1887, shortly before writing his most famous compositions, the ''[[Gymnopédies]]''. Later, he also referred to himself as a &quot;phonometrician&quot; (meaning &quot;someone who measures sounds&quot;), preferring this designation to that of &quot;musician&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Innes, Maria Shevtsova, ''The Cambridge Introduction to Theatre Directing'' (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 2013), p.&amp;nbsp;151.&lt;/ref&gt; after having been called &quot;a clumsy but subtle technician&quot; in a book on contemporary French composers published in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;{{Lang|fr|Je suis phonomètre avant d’être musicien&quot; [http://www.eilpianova.fr/les-spectacles/apercus-phonometriques Aperçus phonométriques &amp; autres sous-entendus]}} {{cite web |url=http://www.eilpianova.fr/les-spectacles/apercus-phonometriques |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-16 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918092808/http://www.eilpianova.fr/les-spectacles/apercus-phonometriques |archivedate=18 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his body of music, Satie left a set of writings, having contributed work for a range of publications from the [[dada]]ist ''[[391 (magazine)|391]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/reynolds/essays/hofmann2.php|title=Documents of Dada and Surrealism: Dada and Surrealist Journals in the Mary Reynolds Collection|website=Artic.edu|accessdate=1 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212081937/http://www.artic.edu/reynolds/essays/hofmann2.php#|archive-date=12 February 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the American culture chronicle ''[[Vanity Fair (American magazine 1913–36)|Vanity Fair]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orledge, ''Satie the Composer'' (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1990): p.&amp;nbsp;xxxviii.&lt;/ref&gt; Although in later life he prided himself on publishing his work under his own name, in the late 19th century he appears to have used pseudonyms such as '''Virginie Lebeau'''&lt;ref&gt;Steven Moore Whiting, ''Satie the Bohemian: From Cabaret to Concert Hall'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press; New York: Oxford University Press, 1999): p.&amp;nbsp;105.&lt;/ref&gt; and '''François de Paule'''&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Lajoinie, Erik Satie, ''L'Age d'Homme'' ({{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--Place, publisher, and ISBN needed.--&gt;1985). 443 S. 8° 1985 p.31&lt;/ref&gt; in some of his published writings.

===Early life===
[[File:MaisonSatie.jpg|thumb|Satie house and museum in [[Honfleur]], Normandy]]
Erik Satie was born on 17 May 1866, the son of Alfred Satie and his wife Jane Leslie (née Anton), who was born in London to Scottish parents. Erik was born at [[Honfleur]] in Normandy; his childhood home there is now open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musees-honfleur.fr/maison-satie.html|title=Maisons Satie|website=Musees-honfleur.fr|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Satie was four years old, his family moved to Paris, his father having been offered a translator's job in the capital. After his mother's death in 1872, he was sent (at age 6), together with his younger brother, Conrad, back to Honfleur to live with his paternal grandparents. There he received his first music lessons from a local [[organist]]. In 1878, when he was 12 years old, his grandmother died, and the two brothers were reunited in Paris with their father, who remarried (to a piano teacher) shortly afterwards. From the early 1880s onwards, Satie started publishing salon compositions by his step-mother and himself, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.550305&amp;catNum=550305&amp;filetype=About+this+Recording&amp;language=English|title=SATIE, E.: Piano Works (Selection) (Körmendi)|website=Naxos.com|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, Satie entered the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Paris Conservatoire]], where he was soon labelled untalented by his teachers. [[Georges Mathias]], his professor of piano at the Conservatoire, described his pupil's piano technique in flatly negative terms, &quot;insignificant and laborious&quot; and &quot;worthless&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Orledge |first=Robert |title=Satie, Erik |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com.library.unl.edu/subscriber/article/grove/music/40105 |work=Grove Music Online |publisher=Oxford Music Online |accessdate=24 April 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Decombes]] called him &quot;the laziest student in the Conservatoire&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sospeso.com/contents/composers_artists/satie.htm|title=The Ensemble Sospeso New York|website=Sospeso.com|accessdate=1 August 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611170019/http://www.sospeso.com/contents/composers_artists/satie.htm|archivedate=11 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Satie related that Mathias, with great insistence, had told him that his real talent lay in composing. After being sent home for two and a half years, he was readmitted to the Conservatoire at the end of 1885 (age 19), but was unable to make a more favourable impression on his teachers than he had before, and, as a result, resolved to take up [[military service]] a year later. However, Satie's military career did not last very long; within a few months he was discharged after deliberately infecting himself with bronchitis.&lt;ref&gt;in: Mary E. Davis:
''Erik Satie''.

===Montmartre===

Satie moved from his father's residence to lodgings in [[Montmartre]] in 1887, when he became 21.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Potter, ''Erik Satie: A Parisian Composer and His World'' ({{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--place of pub, ISBN needed.--&gt;Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2016): p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time he had started what was to be an enduring friendship with the romantic poet [[José Maria Vicente Ferrer Francisco de Paola Patricio Manuel Contamine|Patrice Contamine]],&lt;ref&gt;Mary E. Davis, ''Erik Satie'' ({{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--Place of publication needed.--&gt;: Reaktion Books, 2007): p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt; and had his first compositions published by his father. He soon integrated with the artistic clientele of the [[Le Chat Noir]] Café-cabaret, and started publishing his ''[[Gymnopédies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mary E. Davis, ''Erik Satie'' ({{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--Place of publication needed.--&gt;: Reaktion Books, 2007): p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt; Publication of compositions in the same vein (''{{Lang|fr|[[Ogives]]}}'', ''{{Lang|fr|[[Gnossiennes]]}}'', etc.) followed. In the same period he befriended [[Claude Debussy]]. He moved to a smaller room, still in Montmartre ({{Lang|fr|rue Cortot Nº 6}}, now [[Musée-Placard d'Erik Satie|a museum]]), in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01chr9b/p01chxtr|title=Satie's former address, 6 rue Cortot - Alistair McGowan recording The Unsent Letters of Erik Satie on location in Paris - The Unsent Letters of Erik Satie - BBC Radio 4|website=BBC|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1891 he was the official composer and chapel-master of the [[Rosicrucian Order]] (Ordre de la Rose-Croix Catholique, du Temple et du Graal), led by &quot;Sâr&quot; [[Joséphin Péladan]], which led to compositions such as ''{{Lang|fr|Salut drapeau!}}'', ''[[Le Fils des étoiles]]'', and the ''{{Lang|fr|[[Sonneries de la Rose Croix|Sonneries de la Rose+Croix]]}}''. Satie gave performances at the [[Salon de la Rose + Croix]], organized by Péladan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rose-croix.org/erik-satie-maitre-de-chapelle-des-rose-croix/|title=Érik Satie, musique des Rose-Croix - Rose-Croix.org|website=Rose-croix.org|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Satie.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Caricature of Eric Satie by [[Santiago Rusiñol]], 1891]]

By mid-1892, Satie had composed the first pieces in a compositional system of his own making (''{{Lang|fr|Fête donnée par des Chevaliers Normands en l'honneur d'une jeune demoiselle}}''), provided incidental music to a [[chivalric]] [[esoteric]] play (two ''{{Lang|fr|Préludes du Nazaréen}}''), had  his first [[hoax]] published (announcing the [[premiere]] of ''{{Lang|fr|Le bâtard de Tristan}}'', an anti-Wagnerian opera he probably never composed),&lt;ref&gt;Steven Moore Whiting, ''Satie the Bohemian: From Cabaret to Concert Hall'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press; New York: Oxford University Press, 1999): p.&amp;nbsp;151.&lt;/ref&gt; and broken from Péladan, starting that autumn with the ''Uspud'' project, a &quot;Christian Ballet&quot;, in collaboration with {{Lang|fr|Contamine de Latour}}.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Moore Whiting, ''Satie the Bohemian: From Cabaret to Concert Hall'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press; New York: Oxford University Press), 1999): p.&amp;nbsp;156.&lt;/ref&gt; While the comrades from both the {{Lang|fr|Chat Noir}} and {{Lang|fr|Miguel Utrillo's Auberge du Clou}} sympathised, a promotional brochure was produced for the project, which reads as a [[pamphlet]] for a new esoteric [[sect]].

Satie and [[Suzanne Valadon]] (an artists' model, artist, long-time friend of Miguel Utrillo, and mother of [[Maurice Utrillo]]) began an affair early in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deslettres.fr/lettre-derik-satie-a-suzanne-valadon-partout-ne-vois-yeux/|title=Lettre d'Erik Satie à Suzanne Valadon : &quot; Partout je ne vois que tes yeux. &quot; - Des Lettres|last=DesLettres|date=20 June 2016|website=Deslettres.fr|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their first night together, he proposed marriage. The two did not marry, but Valadon moved to a room next to Satie's at the {{Lang|fr|Rue Cortot}}. Satie became obsessed with her,&lt;ref name=&quot;Föreningen2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.af.lu.se/~fogwall/article5.html|title=Suzanne Valadon|publisher=Akademiska Föreningen, [[Lund University]]|accessdate=12 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003121959/http://www.af.lu.se/~fogwall/article5.html|archivedate=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling her his ''{{Lang|fr|Biqui}}'' and writing impassioned notes about &quot;her whole being, lovely eyes, gentle hands, and tiny feet&quot;. During their relationship, Satie composed the ''[[Danses gothiques]]'' as a means of calming his mind,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orledge, ''Satie the Composer'', Cambridge University Press 1990, pp. 11, 157&lt;/ref&gt; and Valadon painted a portrait of Satie, which she gave to him. After six months she moved away, leaving Satie broken-hearted. Afterwards, he said that he was left with &quot;nothing but an icy loneliness that fills the head with emptiness and the heart with sadness&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Föreningen&quot;/&gt; It is believed this was the only intimate relationship Satie ever had.&lt;ref name=&quot;grove&quot; /&gt;

In 1893, Satie met the young [[Maurice Ravel]] for the first time,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orledge, ''Satie the Composer'', Cambridge University Press 1990, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; Satie's style emerging in the first compositions of the youngster. One of Satie's own compositions of that period, ''[[Vexations]]'', was to remain undisclosed until after his death. By the end of the year he had founded the [[Église Métropolitaine d'Art de Jésus Conducteur]] (Metropolitan Art Church of Jesus the Conductor). As its only member, in the role of &quot;Parcier et Maître de Chapelle&quot;, he started to compose a ''{{Lang|fr|Grande messe}}'' (later to become known as the ''[[Messe des pauvres]]''), and wrote a flood of letters, articles and pamphlets showing off his self-assuredness in religious and artistic matters. To give an example: he applied for membership in the [[Académie Française]] twice, leaving no doubt in the application letter that the board of that organisation (presided over by [[Camille Saint-Saëns]]) as much as owed him such membership. Such proceedings without doubt rather helped to wreck his popularity in the cultural [[The Establishment|establishment]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orledge, Satie the Composer, Cambridge University Press 1990 p.50&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1895 he inherited some money, allowing him to have more of his writings printed, and to change from wearing a priest-like habit to being the &quot;Velvet Gentleman&quot;.

===Move to Arcueil===
[[File:El bohemi by Ramon Casas.jpg|thumb|upright|''Satie, Moulin de la Galette'' (&quot;The Bohemian&quot;), [[Ramon Casas]], (1891)]]
By mid-1896, all of Satie's financial means had vanished, and he had to move to cheaper and much smaller lodgings, first at the {{Lang|fr|Rue Cortot}},&lt;ref&gt;{{openplaque|3265}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two years later, after he had composed the two first sets of ''{{Lang|fr|[[Pièces froides]]}}'' in 1897, to [[Arcueil]], a suburb some five kilometres from the centre of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orledge, Satie the Composer, Cambridge University Press 1990 p.6&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period he re-established contact with his brother Conrad for numerous practical and financial matters, disclosing some of his inner feelings in the process. The letters to Conrad made it clear that he had set aside his religious ideas.

From 1899 on, Satie started making money as a cabaret pianist, adapting over a hundred compositions of popular music for piano or piano and voice, adding some of his own. The most popular of these were ''{{Lang|fr|[[Je te veux]]}}'', text by Henry Pacory; ''{{Lang|fr|Tendrement}}'', text by Vincent Hyspa; ''{{Lang|fr|Poudre d'or}}'', a waltz; ''[[La Diva de l'Empire]]'', text by Dominique Bonnaud/Numa Blès; ''{{Lang|fr|Le Picadilly}}'', a march; ''{{Lang|fr|Légende californienne}}'', text by Contamine de Latour (lost, but the music later reappears in ''{{Lang|fr|La belle excentrique}}''); and quite a few more, many of which have been lost. In his later years, Satie would reject all his cabaret music as vile and against his nature,&lt;ref&gt;Erik Satie in a 17 January 1911 letter to his brother Conrad, quoted in Volta 1989 and in Gillmor 1992 (Chronology p. xxix)&lt;/ref&gt; but for the time being, it was an income.

Only a few compositions that Satie took seriously remain from this period: ''[[Jack in the Box (Satie)|Jack in the Box]]'', music to a [[pantomime]] by [[Jules Depaquit]] (called a &quot;{{Lang|fr|clownerie}}&quot; by Satie); ''{{Lang|fr|Geneviève de Brabant}}'', a short comic opera on a serious theme, text by [[Patrice Contamine de Latour|&quot;Lord Cheminot&quot;]]; ''The Dreamy Fish'', piano music to accompany a lost tale by Cheminot;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Moore Whiting, ''Satie the Bohemian: From Cabaret to Concert Hall'', Oxford: Clarendon Press 1999, p.259&lt;/ref&gt; and a few others that were mostly incomplete, hardly any of them staged, and none of them published at the time.

Both ''{{Lang|fr|Geneviève de Brabant}}'' and ''The Dreamy Fish'' have been analysed by Ornella Volta as containing elements of competition with [[Claude Debussy]], of which Debussy was probably not aware, Satie not making this music public. Meanwhile, Debussy was having one of his first major successes with ''{{Lang|fr|[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande]]}}'' in 1902, leading a few years later to 'who-was-precursor-to-whom' debates between the two composers, in which Maurice Ravel would also get involved.

In October 1905, Satie enrolled in [[Vincent d'Indy]]'s [[Schola Cantorum de Paris]]&lt;ref&gt;Jane F. Fulcher, ''French Cultural Politics &amp; Music: From the Dreyfus Affair to the First World War'', Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;199.&lt;/ref&gt; to study classical [[counterpoint]] while still continuing his cabaret work. Most of his friends were as dumbfounded as the professors at the Schola when they heard about his new plan to return to the classrooms, especially as d'Indy was an admiring pupil of [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], not particularly favoured by Satie. Satie would follow these courses at the Schola, as a respected pupil, for more than five years, receiving a first (intermediate) diploma in 1908. Some of his classroom counterpoint-exercises, such as the ''{{Lang|fr|Désespoir agréable}}'', were published after his death. Another summary, of the period prior to the Schola, also appeared in 1911: the ''[[Trois morceaux en forme de poire]]'', which was a kind of compilation of the best of what he had written up to 1903.

[[File:Erik Satie en 1909.PNG|thumb|right|Erik Satie in 1909.]]
Something that becomes clear through these published compilations is that Satie did not so much reject [[Romanticism]] and its exponents like [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], but that he rejected certain aspects of it. From his first composition to his last, he rejected the idea of [[musical development]],&lt;ref&gt;John Williamson, ''Words and Music'' (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2005), p.&amp;nbsp;161.&lt;/ref&gt; in the strict definition of this term: the intertwining of different themes in a development section of a [[sonata form]]. As a result, his contrapuntal and other works were very short; the &quot;new, modern&quot; [[Fugue]]s do not extend further than the exposition of the theme(s). Generally, he would say that he did not think it permitted that a composer take more time from his public than strictly necessary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://etd.ohiolink.edu/rws_etd/document/get/osu1299643553/] {{dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pianonoise.com/Composer.Satie.htm|title=Satie|website=wianonoise.com|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[Melodrama]], in its historical meaning of the then popular romantic genre of &quot;spoken words to a background of music&quot;, was something Satie avoided. His 1913 ''[[Le piège de Méduse]]'' could be seen as an absurdist spoof of that genre.

In the meantime, other changes had also taken place: Satie was a member of a radical socialist party (he later switched his membership to the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]] in that area after December 1920),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Satie the Composer|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521350372|page=233|author=Robert Orledge|quote=As Satie's career progressed, he moved further and further towards the left. As early as 1908 he was an active member of the Radical-Socialist Committee in Arcueil, and he joined the official Socialist Party on the day after the assassination of [[Jean Jaurès]] (31 July 1914), switching to the Communist Party after the Congress of Tours in December 1920.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had socialised with the Arcueil community: amongst other things, he had been involved in the &quot;{{Lang|fr|Patronage laïque}}&quot; work for children.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Lajoinie, ''Erik Satie: L'Age d'Homme''{{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--Place, publisher, ISBN needed.--&gt; (1985) 443 S. 8° p.110&lt;/ref&gt; He also changed his appearance to that of the 'bourgeois functionary' with bowler hat, umbrella, etc. He channelled his medieval interests into a peculiar secret [[hobby]]: in a filing cabinet he maintained a collection of imaginary buildings, most of them described as being made out of some kind of metal, which he drew on little cards. Occasionally, extending the game, he would publish anonymous small announcements in local journals, offering some of these buildings, e.g., a &quot;castle in lead&quot;, for sale or rent.

A rare [[autochrome]] photograph of Satie exists that dates from 1911. It was reproduced on the cover of [[Robert Orledge]]'s second book on the composer, ''Satie Remembered'' (1995),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Orledge, Robert|title=Satie Remembered|isbn=9781574670011|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|date= August 28, 1995|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/satie-remembered-robert-orledge/1002046202?ean=9781574670011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; but where this autochrome was found has not been made known.

=== Later life ===
[[File:Satie autoportret Projet Buste 1913.jpg|thumb|upright|Sketch for a [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] of himself, by Satie, 1913]]
Starting in 1912, Satie's new humorous miniatures for piano became very successful, and he wrote and published many of these over the next few years (most of them premiered by the pianist [[Ricardo Viñes]]). His habit of accompanying the scores of his compositions with all kinds of written remarks was now well established, so that a few years later he had to insist that these not be read out during performances&lt;!-- avoiding &quot;Melodrama&quot; genre! --&gt;. He wrote in the first edition of ''Heures séculaires et instantanées'', &quot;To whom it may concern: 'I forbid anyone to read the text aloud during the musical performance. Ignorance of my instructions will incur my righteous indignation against the presumptuous culprit. No exception will be allowed.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williamson|first=John|title=Words and music|publisher=Liverpool University Press|location=Liverpool|year=2005|isbn=9780853236191|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had mostly stopped using [[barline]]s by this time. In some ways, these compositions were very reminiscent of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s compositions from the final years of his life,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orledge, ''Satie the Composer'' (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1990): p.&amp;nbsp;235.&lt;/ref&gt; grouped under the name [[Péchés de vieillesse]].

However, the acceleration in Satie's life did not come so much from the success of his new piano pieces; it was Ravel who inadvertently triggered the characteristics of Satie's remaining years and thus influenced the successive progressive artistic and cultural movements that rapidly manifested themselves in Paris over the following years. Paris was seen as the artistic capital of the world, and the beginning of the new century appeared to have set many minds on fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://girlsguidetoparis.com/french-culture-vive-la-belle-epoque/|title=French Culture: Vive la Belle Epoque|date=24 April 2014|website=Girlsguidetoparis.com|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910 the &quot;{{Lang|fr|Jeunes Ravêlites}}&quot;, a group of young musicians around Ravel, proclaimed their preference for Satie's earlier work from before the Schola period, reinforcing the idea that Satie had been a precursor of Debussy.

At first, Satie was pleased that at least some of his works were receiving public attention, but when he realised that this meant that his more recent work was overlooked or dismissed, he looked for other young artists who related better to his more recent ideas, so as to have better mutual support in creative activity. Thus, young artists such as [[Alexis Roland-Manuel|Roland-Manuel]], and later [[Georges Auric]], and [[Jean Cocteau]], started to receive more of his attention than the &quot;{{Lang|fr|Jeunes}}&quot;.

As a result of his contact with Roland-Manuel, Satie again began publicising his thoughts, with far more irony than he had done before (amongst other things, the ''{{Lang|fr|Mémoires d'un amnésique}}'' and ''{{Lang|fr|Cahiers d'un mammifère}}'').&lt;ref&gt;English translations of these pieces were published in ''A Mammal's Notebook'', see [[#Sources|Sources]] section below.{{Failed verification|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--Nothing of this title in the mentioned section, and it should be referenced by author, if any.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

With Jean Cocteau, whom he had first met in 1915,&lt;ref&gt;Elliott Antokoletz, ''A History of Twentieth-Century Music in a Theoretic-Analytical Context'', Routledge 2014 p.208&lt;/ref&gt; Satie started work on incidental music for a production of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', resulting in the ''[[Cinq grimaces pour Le songe d'une nuit d'été]]''. From 1916, he and Cocteau worked on the ballet ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'', which was premiered in 1917 by [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]], with sets and costumes by [[Pablo Picasso]], and choreography by [[Léonide Massine]]. Through Picasso, Satie also became acquainted with other [[cubism|cubists]], such as [[Georges Braque]], with whom he would work on other, aborted, projects.

With [[Georges Auric]], [[Louis Durey]], [[Arthur Honegger]], and [[Germaine Tailleferre]], Satie formed the [[Les Six|Nouveaux jeunes]], shortly after writing ''Parade''. Later, the group was joined by [[Francis Poulenc]] and [[Darius Milhaud]]. In September 1918, Satie&amp;nbsp;– giving little or no explanation&amp;nbsp;– withdrew from the {{Lang|fr|Nouveaux jeunes}}. Jean Cocteau gathered the six remaining members, forming the [[Les Six|Groupe des six]] (to which Satie would later have access, but later again would fall out with most of its members).

From 1919, Satie was in contact with [[Tristan Tzara]], the initiator of the [[Dada]] movement. He became acquainted with other artists involved in the movement, such as [[Francis Picabia]] (later to become a [[surrealism|Surrealist]]), [[André Derain]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Jean Hugo]] and [[Man Ray]], among others. On the day of his first meeting with Man Ray, the two fabricated the artist's first [[readymade]]: ''[[The Gift (sculpture)|The Gift]]'' (1921). Satie contributed writing to the Dadaist publication ''[[391 (magazine)|391]]''. In the first months of 1922, he was surprised to find himself entangled in the argument between Tzara and [[André Breton]] about the true nature of avant-garde art, epitomised by the failure of the Congrès de Paris. Satie originally sided with Tzara, but managed to maintain friendly relations with most players in both camps. Meanwhile, an &quot;{{Lang|fr|Ecole d'Arcueil}}&quot; had formed around Satie, taking the name from the relatively remote district of Paris where Satie lived;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Keith, ''Sleeve Notes The Best of Erik Satie'', Naxos 8.556688&lt;/ref&gt; it included young musicians such as [[Henri Sauguet]], [[Maxime Jacob]], [[Roger Désormière]] and [[Henri Cliquet-Pleyel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223074200/http://classic-intro.net/introductionalamusique/vingtieme4-1.html|title=INTRODUCTION A LA MUSIQUE CLASSIQUE - Le XXe siècle : Les compositeurs|date=23 December 2016|website=web.archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
Other work and episodes in this last period of Satie's life:
* Since 1911 he had been on friendly terms with [[Igor Stravinsky]], about whom he would later write articles.
* ''[[Le Piège de Méduse|Le piège de Méduse]]'' (1913) had a unique position in Satie's [[Work of art|oeuvre]], as it was a stage work conceived and composed seemingly without any collaboration with other artists.
* ''[[Sports et divertissements]]'' was a kind of multi-media project, in which Satie provided piano music to drawings made by [[Charles Martin (artist)|Charles Martin]]. The work was composed in 1914, but not published or performed until the early 1920s. The individual pieces are characteristic Satie &quot;miniatures&quot;: in all, there are twenty pieces - none over two minutes in length, and some as short as 15 seconds.
* He got in trouble over an insulting postcard he had written to one of his critics shortly after the premiere of ''Parade''; he was condemned to a week of imprisonment, but was finally released as a result of the (financial) intercession of [[Winnaretta Singer]], Princess Edmond de Polignac.
* Singer, who had learnt Ancient Greek when she was over 50, had commissioned a work on [[Socrates]] in October 1916; this would become his ''[[Vie de Socrate|Socrate]]'', which he presented early in 1918 to the Princess.
* From 1917 Satie wrote five pieces of ''[[furniture music]]'' (&quot;Musique d'ameublement&quot;) for different occasions.
* From 1920, he was on friendly terms with the circles around [[Gertrude Stein]], amongst others, leading to the publication of some of his articles in ''[[Vanity Fair magazine|Vanity Fair]]'' (commissioned by Sibyl Harris).
* Some works would originate under the patronage of the count Etienne de Beaumont, from 1922 onwards:
** ''[[La statue retrouvée]]'' (or &quot;Divertissement&quot;): another Satie-Cocteau-Picasso-Massine collaboration.
** ''[[Ludions]]'': a setting of [[nonsense verse|nonsense rhyme]] by [[Léon-Paul Fargue]]
** ''[[Mercure (ballet)|Mercure]]'': the subtitle of this piece (&quot;Poses plastiques&quot;) suggests it might have been intended rather as an emulation of the [[tableau vivant]] genre than as an actual ballet, the &quot;tableaux&quot; being cubist, by Picasso (and Massine).
* During his final years Satie travelled; for example, in 1924 to Belgium, invited by Paul Collaer, and to [[Monte Carlo]] for the premiere of a work on which he had collaborated.

Satie's last compositions were two 1924 ballets. ''[[Mercure (ballet)|Mercure]]'' reunited him with Picasso and Massine for a mythological spoof produced by Count Étienne de Beaumont's Soirées de Paris, and he wrote the &quot;{{Lang|fr|instantaneist}}&quot; ballet ''{{Lang|fr|[[Relâche (ballet)|Relâche]]}}'' in collaboration with Picabia, for the {{Lang|fr|[[Ballets suédois]]}} of [[Rolf de Maré]]. In a simultaneous project, Satie added music to the surrealist film ''{{Lang|fr|[[Entr'acte (film)|Entr'acte]]}}'' by [[René Clair]], which was given as an intermezzo for ''{{Lang|fr|Relâche}}''.

After years of heavy drinking (including consumption of [[absinthe]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Forgotten English|author=Jeffrey Kacirk|date=2009|isbn=978-0688166366|publisher=William Morrow Paperbacks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satie died at age 59, on 1 July 1925 from [[cirrhosis]] of the liver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050225235640/http://humanitiesweb.org/human.php?s=c&amp;p=a&amp;a=i&amp;ID=753|title=Erik Satie - Biography|date=25 February 2005|website=web.archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in the cemetery in Arcueil. There is a tiny stone monument designating a grassy area in front of an apartment building – '{{not a typo|Parc}} Erik Satie'. Over the course of his 27 years in residence at [[Arcueil]], where Satie lived in stark simplicity,&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Keith, Sleeve notes ''The Best of Erik Satie'' Naxos 8.556688&lt;/ref&gt; no one had ever visited his room. After his death, Satie's friends discovered an apartment replete with squalor and chaos. Among many other unsorted papers and miscellaneous items, it contained a large number of umbrellas, and two grand pianos placed one on top of the other, the upper instrument used as storage for letters and parcels.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Lesnie, &quot;[http://www.limelightmagazine.com.au/Article/304597,five-things-you-didn-t-know-about-erik-satie.aspx Five Things You Didn't Know about Erik Satie]&quot;, ''[[Limelight (magazine)|Limelight]]'' (13 June 2012). Retrieved 22 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; They discovered compositions that were thought to have been lost or were totally unknown. The score to ''[[Jack in the Box (Satie)|Jack in the Box]]'' was thought, by Satie, to have been left on a bus years before. These were found behind the piano, in the pockets of his velvet suits, and in other odd places, and included ''[[Vexations]]''; ''Geneviève de Brabant'' and other unpublished or unfinished stage works; ''The Dreamy Fish''; many [[Schola Cantorum]] exercises; a previously unseen set of &quot;canine&quot; piano pieces; and several other works for piano, many untitled. Some of these would be published later as additional ''{{Lang|fr|[[Gnossiennes]]}}'', ''{{Lang|fr|Pièces froides}}'', ''{{Lang|fr|Enfantines}}'', and ''[[furniture music]]''. {{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
