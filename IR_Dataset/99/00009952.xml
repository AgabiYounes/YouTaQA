[[File:Papiro con frammento della prima lettera di paolo ai tessalonicesi, III-IV secolo (PSI 2491).jpg|thumb|[[Papyrus 65]], dating to the 3rd or 4th century]]
The '''First Epistle to the Thessalonians''', commonly referred to as '''First Thessalonians''' or '''1 Thessalonians''', is a [[Pauline epistle]] of the [[New Testament]] of the [[Christian Bible]]. The epistle is attributed to [[Paul the Apostle]], and is addressed to the church in [[Thessaloniki|Thessalonica]], in modern-day [[Greece]]. It is likely the first of [[Pauline epistles|Paul's letters]], probably written by the end of AD 52&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;&gt;[[Raymond E. Brown]], ''An Introduction to the New Testament'', [[Anchor Bible]], 1997. pp. 456–466.&lt;/ref&gt; (however, some scholars believe the Epistle to Galatians may have been written at an earlier date: AD 48&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Composition==
Most New Testament scholars believe [[Paul the Apostle]] wrote this letter from [[Roman Corinth|Corinth]], although information appended to this work in many early manuscripts (e.g., [[Codex Alexandrinus|Codices Alexandrinus]], [[Codex Mosquensis I|Mosquensis]], and [[Codex Angelicus|Angelicus]]) state that Paul wrote it in Athens&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Best, ''The First and Second Epistles to the Thessalonians'' (New York: Harper and Row, 1972), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]] had returned from [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] with news of the state of the church in [[Thessalonica]] ({{bibleverse||Acts|18:1–5|49}}; {{bibleverse|1|Thes.|3:6|49}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{EBD|Thessalonians, Epistles to the|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the most part, the letter is personal in nature, with only the final two chapters spent addressing issues of doctrine, almost as an aside. Paul's main purpose in writing is to encourage and reassure the [[Christianity|Christians]] there. Paul urges them to go on working quietly while waiting in hope for the [[Second Coming|return of Christ]].

===Date===
Unlike all subsequent Pauline epistles, 1 Thessalonians does not focus on [[justification by faith]] or questions of [[Paul the Apostle and Judaism|Jewish–Gentile relations]], themes that are covered in all other letters. Many scholars see this as an indication that this letter was written before the [[Epistle to the Galatians]], where Paul's positions on these matters were formed and elucidated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot; /&gt;

===Authenticity===
[[File:Minuscule 699 (GA) folio 18.jpg|thumb|220px|The first page of the epistle in [[Minuscule 699]] gives its title as προς θεσσαλονικεις, &quot;To the Thessalonians.&quot;]]
The majority of New Testament scholars hold 1 Thessalonians to be authentic, although a number of scholars in the mid-19th century contested its authenticity, most notably [[Clement Schrader]] and [[Ferdinand Christian Baur|F.C. Baur]].&lt;ref&gt;Best, ''Thessalonians'', pp. 22–29.&lt;/ref&gt; 1 Thessalonians matches other accepted Pauline letters, both in style and in content, and its authorship is also affirmed by [[Second Epistle to the Thessalonians|2 Thessalonians]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The only possible reference to a previous missive is in 2:15....&quot; Raymond E. Brown, An Introduction to the New Testament, Anchor Bible, 1997. p. 590.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|2:13–16|50}} have often been regarded as a post-Pauline [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolation]]. The following arguments have been based on the content:
* It is perceived to be theologically incompatible with Paul's other epistles: elsewhere Paul [[Responsibility for the death of Jesus|attributed Jesus's death]] to the &quot;rulers of this age&quot; ([https://www.jw.org/en/publications/bible/study-bible/books/1-corinthians/2/#v46002008 1 Cor 2:8]) rather than to the Jews, and elsewhere Paul writes that the [[Supersessionism|Jews have not been abandoned by God]], for &quot;all Israel will be saved&quot; ([https://www.jw.org/en/publications/bible/study-bible/books/romans/11/#v45011026 Rom 11:26]); According to 1 Thes 1:10, the [[Divine retribution|wrath of God]] is still to come; it is not something that has already shown itself.&lt;ref&gt;CollegeVille Bible Commentary, p 1155&lt;/ref&gt;
* There were no extensive historical persecutions of Christians by Jews in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] prior to the [[First Jewish–Roman War|first Jewish war]].&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of the concept of imitation in 1&amp;nbsp;Thes. 2.14 is singular.
* The [[aorist]] ''eftasen'' (&quot;has overtaken&quot;) refers to the [[destruction of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Birger A. Pearson, &quot;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1508972 1 Thessalonians 2:13–16 A Deutero Pauline Interpolation]&quot;, ''Harvard Theological Review'', 64 (1971), pp. 79–94&lt;/ref&gt;
* The syntax of 1 Thes. 2:13–16 deviates significantly from that of the surrounding context.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, D., &quot;I Thess 2:13–16: Linguistic Evidence for an Interpolation,&quot; JBL 102 (1983): 269–279&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also sometimes suggested that 1 Thes. 5:1–11 is a post-Pauline insertion that has many features of [[Gospel of Luke|Lukan language]] and theology that serves as an apologetic correction to Paul's imminent expectation of the [[Second Coming]] in 1 Thes. 4:13–18.&lt;ref&gt;G. Friedrich, &quot;1. Thessalonicher 5,1–11, der apologetische Einschub eines Spaeteren,&quot; ZTK 70 (1973) 289&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars, such as Schmithals,&lt;ref&gt;Schmithals, W., ''Paul and the Gnostics'' Transl. by J. Steely (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1972), 123–218&lt;/ref&gt; Eckhart,&lt;ref&gt;K. G. Eckart, &quot;Der zweite echte Brief des Apostels Paulus an die Thessalonicher,&quot; ZThK (1961), 30–44&lt;/ref&gt; Demke&lt;ref&gt;''Theologie und Literarkritik im 1. Thessalonicherbrief''&lt;/ref&gt; and Munro,&lt;ref&gt;''The Later Stratum in 1 and 2 Thessalonians, Authority in Paul and Peter: The Identification of a Pastoral Stratum in the Pauline Corpus and 1 Peter''&lt;/ref&gt; have developed complicated theories involving [[redaction]] and interpolation in 1 and 2 Thessalonians.

===Audience===
{{See also|Early centers of Christianity}}
Paul claimed the title of the &quot;Apostle to the Gentiles&quot;, and established [[gentile]] churches in several important cities in the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name = &quot;Ehrman 2006&quot;&gt;Ehrman, Bart. Peter, Paul, and Mary Magdalene: The Followers of Jesus in History and Legend. Oxford University Press, USA. 2006. {{ISBN|0-19-530013-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Bart D. Ehrman]], the [[Acts of the Apostles]] tells a different story of Paul's career,&lt;ref name = &quot;Ehrman 2006&quot;/&gt; but in this case it reports that, while there were &quot;some&quot; Jews converted during Paul's initial preaching in Thessalonica, the gentiles who were converted were &quot;a large number&quot; and the Jews as a body fiercely opposed Paul's work there.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|17:4–5|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Text===
Paul, speaking for himself, [[Silas]], and Timothy, gives thanks for the news about their faith and love; he reminds them of the kind of life he had lived while he was with them. Paul stresses how honorably he conducted himself, reminding them that he had worked to earn his keep, taking great pains not to burden anyone. He did this, he says, even though he could have used his status as an [[Apostle (Christian)|apostle]] to impose upon them.

Paul goes on to explain that the [[Resurrection of the dead|dead will be resurrected]] prior to those still living, and both groups will greet the Lord in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1 Thessalonians|4:13–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
