They are widely used in many electronic devices ranging from simplest [[clock generator]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s to digital instruments (like calculators) and complex computers and peripherals etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  Common examples of signals generated by oscillators include signals broadcast by [[Transmitter|radio]] and [[television transmitter]]s, [[clock signal]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s that regulate computers and [[quartz clock]]s, and the sounds produced by electronic beepers and [[video game]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snelgrove&quot; /&gt;

Oscillators are often characterized by the [[frequency]] of their output signal:
*A [[Low-frequency oscillation|low-frequency oscillator]] (LFO) is an electronic oscillator that generates a frequency below approximately 20&amp;nbsp;Hz. This term is typically used in the field of audio [[synthesizer]]s, to distinguish it from an audio frequency oscillator.
*An audio oscillator&lt;!--Please don't link - circular reference--&gt; produces frequencies in the [[audio frequency|audio]] range, about 16&amp;nbsp;Hz to 20&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chattopadhyay&quot; /&gt;
*An RF oscillator produces signals in the [[radio frequency]] (RF) range of about 100&amp;nbsp;kHz to 100&amp;nbsp;GHz.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chattopadhyay&quot; /&gt; 

Oscillators designed to produce a high-power AC output from a DC supply are usually called [[Power inverter|inverters]].

There are two main types of electronic oscillator&amp;nbsp;– the linear or harmonic oscillator and the nonlinear or [[relaxation oscillator]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chattopadhyay&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Garg&quot;&gt;{{cite book

[[Crystal oscillator]]s are ubiquitous in modern electronics and produce frequencies from 32&amp;nbsp;kHz to over 150&amp;nbsp;MHz, with 32&amp;nbsp;kHz crystals commonplace in time keeping and the higher frequencies commonplace in clock generation and RF applications.

==Harmonic oscillator==
[[File:Oscillator diagram1.svg|thumb|Block diagram of a feedback linear oscillator; an amplifier ''A'' with its output ''v&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' fed back into its input ''v&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' through a [[electronic filter|filter]], ''β(jω)''.]]

The harmonic, or ''[[Linear circuit|linear]]'', oscillator produces a [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]al output.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chattopadhyay&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Garg&quot; /&gt;  There are two types:
===Feedback oscillator===

The most common form of linear oscillator is an [[electronic amplifier]] such as a [[transistor]] or [[operational amplifier]] connected in a [[feedback loop]] with its output fed back into its input through a frequency selective [[electronic filter]] to provide [[positive feedback]].  When the power supply to the amplifier is first switched on, [[electronic noise]] in the circuit provides a non-zero signal to get oscillations started. The noise travels around the loop and is amplified and [[Filter (signal processing)|filtered]] until very quickly it converges on a [[sine wave]] at a single frequency.

Feedback oscillator circuits can be classified according to the type of frequency selective filter they use in the feedback loop:&lt;ref name=&quot;Chattopadhyay&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Garg&quot; /&gt;

*In an ''[[RC oscillator]]'' circuit, the filter is a network of [[resistor]]s and [[capacitor]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chattopadhyay&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Garg&quot; /&gt; RC oscillators are mostly used to generate lower frequencies, for example in the audio range.  Common types of RC oscillator circuits are the [[phase shift oscillator]] and the [[Wien bridge oscillator]].
{{anchor|LC oscillator}}
*In an ''LC oscillator'' circuit, the filter is a [[tuned circuit]] (often called a ''tank circuit''; the tuned circuit is a [[resonator]]) consisting of an [[inductor]] (L) and [[capacitor]] (C) connected together.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chattopadhyay&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Garg&quot; /&gt;  Charge flows back and forth between the capacitor's plates through the inductor, so the tuned circuit can store electrical energy oscillating at its [[resonant frequency]]. There are small losses in the tank circuit, but the amplifier compensates for those losses and supplies the power for the output signal. LC oscillators are often used at [[radio frequency|radio frequencies]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Chattopadhyay&quot; /&gt; when a tunable frequency source is necessary, such as in [[signal generator]]s, tunable radio [[transmitter]]s and the [[local oscillator]]s in [[radio receiver]]s.  Typical LC oscillator circuits are the [[Hartley oscillator|Hartley]], [[Colpitts oscillator|Colpitts]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Chattopadhyay&quot; /&gt; and [[Clapp oscillator|Clapp]] circuits.
[[File:Oscillator comparison.svg|thumb|right|400px|Two common LC oscillator circuits, the Hartley and Colpitts oscillators]]

*In a ''[[crystal oscillator]]'' circuit the filter is a [[piezoelectric]] crystal (commonly a [[quartz crystal]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Chattopadhyay&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Garg&quot; /&gt;  The crystal mechanically vibrates as a [[resonator]], and its frequency of vibration determines the oscillation frequency. Crystals have a very high [[Q-factor]] and also better temperature stability than tuned circuits, so crystal oscillators have much better frequency stability than LC or RC oscillators. Crystal oscillators are the most common type of linear oscillator, used to stabilize the frequency of most [[radio transmitter]]s, and to generate the [[clock signal]] in computers and [[quartz clock]]s. Crystal oscillators often use the same circuits as LC oscillators, with the crystal replacing the [[tuned circuit]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Chattopadhyay&quot; /&gt; the [[Pierce oscillator]] circuit is also commonly used. Quartz crystals are generally limited to frequencies of 30&amp;nbsp;MHz or below.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chattopadhyay&quot; /&gt;  Other types of resonators, [[dielectric resonator]]s and [[surface acoustic wave]] (SAW) devices, are used to control higher frequency oscillators, up into the [[microwave]] range.  For example, SAW oscillators are used to generate the radio signal in [[cell phone]]s.

}}

In addition to the feedback oscillators described above, which use [[two-port network|two-port]] amplifying active elements such as transistors and operational amplifiers, linear oscillators can also be built using [[port (circuit theory)|one-port]] (two terminal) devices with [[negative resistance]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Chattopadhyay&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Garg&quot; /&gt; such as [[magnetron]] tubes, [[tunnel diode]]s, [[IMPATT diode]]s and [[Gunn diode]]s.  Negative-resistance oscillators are usually used at high frequencies in the [[microwave]] range and above, since at these frequencies feedback oscillators perform poorly due to excessive phase shift in the feedback path.

In negative-resistance oscillators, a resonant circuit, such as an [[LC circuit]], [[crystal oscillator|crystal]], or [[Resonator#Cavity resonators|cavity resonator]], is connected across a device with [[negative differential resistance]], and a DC bias voltage is applied to supply energy.  A resonant circuit by itself is &quot;almost&quot; an oscillator; it can store energy in the form of electronic oscillations if excited, but because it has electrical resistance and other losses the oscillations are [[Harmonic oscillator#Damped harmonic oscillator|damped]] and decay to zero.  The negative resistance of the active device cancels the (positive) internal loss resistance in the resonator, in effect creating a resonator with no damping, which generates spontaneous continuous oscillations at its [[resonant frequency]].

The negative-resistance oscillator model is not limited to one-port devices like diodes; feedback oscillator circuits with [[two-port network|two-port]] amplifying devices such as transistors and [[vacuum tube|tubes]] also have negative resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kung&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Relaxation oscillator==
{{Main|Relaxation oscillator}}
A nonlinear or [[relaxation oscillator]] produces a non-sinusoidal output, such as a [[square wave|square]], [[sawtooth wave|sawtooth]] or [[triangle wave]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Garg&quot; /&gt;  It consists of an energy-storing element (a [[capacitor]] or, more rarely, an [[inductor]]) and a nonlinear switching device (a [[Latch (electronics)|latch]], [[Schmitt trigger]], or negative-resistance element) connected in a [[feedback loop]]. The switching device periodically charges and discharges the energy stored in the storage element thus causing abrupt changes in the output waveform.

Square-wave relaxation oscillators are used to provide the [[clock signal]] for [[sequential logic]] circuits such as timers and [[digital counter|counters]], although crystal oscillators are often preferred for their greater stability. Triangle-wave or sawtooth oscillators are used in the timebase circuits that generate the horizontal deflection signals for [[cathode ray tube]]s in analogue [[oscilloscope]]s and [[television]] sets. They are also used in [[voltage-controlled oscillator]]s (VCOs), [[inverter]]s and [[switching power supply|switching power supplies]], [[dual-slope ADC|dual-slope analog to digital converter]]s (ADCs), and in [[function generator]]s to generate square and triangle waves for testing equipment. In general, relaxation oscillators are used at lower frequencies and have poorer frequency stability than linear oscillators.

[[Ring oscillator]]s are built of a ring of active delay stages.  Generally the ring has an odd number of inverting stages, so that there is no single stable state for the internal ring voltages. Instead, a single transition propagates endlessly around the ring.

Some of the more common relaxation oscillator circuits are listed below:

*[[Multivibrator]]
*[[Pearson–Anson effect|Pearson–Anson oscillator]]
*[[Ring oscillator]]
*[[Delay-line oscillator]]
*[[Royer oscillator]]

==Voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)==
{{Main|Voltage-controlled oscillator}}
An oscillator can be designed so that the oscillation frequency can be varied over some range by an input voltage or current. These [[voltage controlled oscillator]]s are widely used in [[phase-locked loop]]s, in which the oscillator's frequency can be locked to the frequency of another oscillator. These are ubiquitous in modern communications circuits, used in [[electronic filter|filters]], [[modulator]]s, [[demodulator]]s, and forming the basis of [[frequency synthesizer]] circuits which are used to tune radios and televisions.

Radio frequency VCOs are usually made by adding a [[varactor]] diode to the [[tuned circuit]] or resonator in an oscillator circuit. Changing the DC voltage across the varactor changes its [[capacitance]], which changes the [[resonant frequency]] of the tuned circuit. Voltage controlled relaxation oscillators can be constructed by charging and discharging the energy storage capacitor with a voltage controlled [[current source]]. Increasing the input voltage increases the rate of charging the capacitor, decreasing the time between switching events.

==History==
The first practical oscillators were based on [[electric arc]]s, which were used for lighting in the 19th century. The current through an [[arc lamp|arc light]] is unstable due to its [[negative resistance]], and often breaks into spontaneous oscillations, causing the arc to make hissing, humming or howling sounds&lt;ref name=&quot;Hong&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hong |first=Sungook |title=Wireless: From Marconi's Black-Box to the Audion |publisher=MIT Press |year=2001 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UjXGQSPXvIcC&amp;pg=PA165 |isbn=978-0262082983 |ref=harv}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;161&amp;ndash;165&lt;/ref&gt; which had been noticed by [[Humphry Davy]] in 1821, [[Benjamin Silliman]] in 1822,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/firstprinciples05sillgoog | page=[https://archive.org/details/firstprinciples05sillgoog/page/n653 629] | quote=Davy Silliman Hissing. |title = First Principles of Physics: Or Natural Philosophy, Designed for the Use of Schools and Colleges| publisher=H.C.

Vacuum-tube feedback oscillators became the basis of radio transmission by 1920.  However, the [[triode]] vacuum tube oscillator performed poorly above 300&amp;nbsp;MHz because of interelectrode capacitance.{{citation needed|reason=tune out capacitance; lighthouse tubes; transit time|date=April 2017}}  To reach higher frequencies, new &quot;transit time&quot; (velocity modulation) vacuum tubes were developed, in which electrons traveled in &quot;bunches&quot; through the tube.  The first of these was the [[Barkhausen–Kurz tube|Barkhausen–Kurz oscillator]] (1920), the first tube to produce power in the [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] range.  The most important and widely used were the [[klystron]] (R. and S. Varian, 1937) and the cavity [[magnetron]] (J. Randall and H. Boot, 1940).

Mathematical conditions for feedback oscillations, now called the [[Barkhausen stability criterion|Barkhausen criterion]], were derived by [[Heinrich Georg Barkhausen]] in 1921.  The first analysis of a nonlinear electronic oscillator model, the [[Van der Pol oscillator]], was done by [[Balthasar van der Pol]] in 1927.&lt;ref name=&quot;Van der Pol&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

He originated the term &quot;relaxation oscillation&quot; and was first to distinguish between linear and relaxation oscillators.
