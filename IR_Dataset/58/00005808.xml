&quot;'''Casey at the Bat: A Ballad of the Republic Sung in the Year 1888'''&quot; is a [[baseball]] poem written in 1888 by [[Ernest Thayer]]. First published in ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'' (then called ''The Daily Examiner'') on June 3, 1888, it was later popularized by [[DeWolf Hopper]] in many [[vaudeville]] performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Casey at the Bat|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_case.shtml|website=Baseball Almanac}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=catbird&gt;{{cite web|last1=Armenti|first1=Peter|title=The First Publication of &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot;|url=http://blogs.loc.gov/catbird/2013/06/the-first-publication-of-casey-at-the-bat/|website=From the Catbird Seat|publisher=Library of Congress|date=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has become one of the best-known poems in [[American literature]].  The poem was originally published anonymously (under the [[pen name]] &quot;Phin&quot;, based on Thayer's college nickname, &quot;Phinney&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardner&quot; /&gt;

==Synopsis==
A baseball team from the fictional town of &quot;Mudville&quot; (the home team) is losing by two [[Run (baseball)|runs]] in its last inning. Both the team and its fans, a crowd of 5,000, believe they can win if Casey, Mudville's star player, gets to bat. However, Casey is scheduled to be the fifth batter of the inning, and the first two batters (Cooney and Barrows) fail to get on base. The next two batters (Flynn and Jimmy Blake) are perceived to be weak hitters with little chance of reaching base to allow Casey a chance to bat.

Surprisingly, Flynn hits a single, and Blake follows with a double that allows Flynn to reach third base.  Both runners are now in scoring position and Casey represents the potential winning run. Casey is so sure of his abilities that he does not swing at the first two pitches, both called strikes. On the last pitch, the overconfident Casey [[Strikeout|strikes out swinging]], ending the game and sending the crowd home unhappy.

The text is filled with references to baseball as it was in 1888, which in many ways is not far removed from today's version. As a work, the poem encapsulates much of the appeal of baseball, including the involvement of the crowd. It also has a fair amount of baseball jargon that can pose challenges for the uninitiated.

This is the complete poem as it originally appeared in ''[[The San Francisco Examiner|The Daily Examiner]]''.  After publication, various versions with minor changes were produced.

|quote=No one imagines that 'Casey' is great in the sense that the poetry of [[Shakespeare]] or [[Dante]] is great; a comic [[ballad]] obviously must be judged by different standards. One doesn’t criticize a slice of superb apple pie because it fails to taste like [[Crepe Suzette|crepes suzette]]. Thayer was only trying to write a comic ballad, with clanking rhymes and a vigorous beat, that could be read quickly, understood at once, and laughed at by any newspaper reader who knew baseball. Somehow, in harmony with the curious laws of humor and popular taste, he managed to produce the [[United States|nation]]'s best-known piece of [[comic verse]]—a ballad that began a native [[legend]] as colorful and permanent as that of [[Johnny Appleseed]] or [[Paul Bunyan]].|author=Martin Gardner|source=[[American Heritage (magazine)|''American Heritage'']]&lt;ref name=Gardner&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gardner|first=Martin|title=Casey At The Bat|journal=American Heritage|date=October 1967|volume=18|issue=6|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/casey-bat|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville nine that day;
the score stood four to two, with but one inning more to play.
And then when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,
a sickly silence fell upon the patrons of the game.

A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest
clung to that hope which springs eternal in the human breast;
they thought, if only Casey could get but a whack at that –
they'd put up even money, now, with Casey at the bat.

But Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,
and the former was a lulu and the latter was a cake,
so upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,
for there seemed but little chance of Casey's getting to the bat.

But Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,
and Blake, the much despised, tore the cover off the ball;
and when the dust had lifted, and the men saw what had occurred,
there was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third.

Then from five thousand throats and more there rose a lusty yell;
it rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell;
it knocked upon the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,
for Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat.

There was ease in Casey's manner as he stepped into his place;
there was pride in Casey's bearing and a smile on Casey's face.
And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,
no stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas Casey at the bat.

Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt;
five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt.
Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,
defiance gleamed in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's lip.

And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,
and Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.
Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped—
&quot;That ain't my style,&quot; said Casey. &quot;Strike one,&quot; the umpire said.

From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,
like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore.
&quot;Kill him! Kill the umpire!&quot; shouted someone on the stand;
and it's likely they'd have killed him had not Casey raised his hand.

With a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone;
he stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;
he signaled to the pitcher, and once more the spheroid flew;
but Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said: &quot;Strike two.&quot;

&quot;Fraud!&quot; cried the maddened thousands, and Echo answered fraud;
but one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.
They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,
and they knew that Casey wouldn't let that ball go by again.

The sneer is gone from Casey's lip, his teeth are clenched in hate;
he pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate.
And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,
and now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow.

Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright;
the band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light,
and somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout;
but there is no joy in Mudville — mighty Casey has struck out.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==Inspiration==
Thayer said he chose the name &quot;Casey&quot; after a non-player of Irish ancestry he once knew, and it is open to debate who, if anyone, he modeled the character after. It has been reported that Thayer's best friend [[Samuel Winslow]], who played baseball at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], was the inspiration for Casey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Casey at the Bat|url=http://www.joslinhall.com/casey_at_the_bat.htm|accessdate=June 3, 2017|publisher=Joslin Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Martin|title=Casey At The Bat|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/casey-bat|accessdate=June 3, 2017|work=American Heritage|date=October 1967 |volume=18|issue=6|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Canale|first1=Larry|title=Casey Might Have Struck Out, But Related Memorabilia Does Not|url=http://www.sportscollectorsdigest.com/mudville-still-no-joy/|accessdate=June 3, 2017|work=Sports Collectors Digest|date=November 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another candidate is National League player [[King Kelly|Mike &quot;King&quot; Kelly]], who became famous when Boston paid Chicago a record $10,000 for him. He had a personality that fans liked to cheer or jeer. After the 1887 season, Kelly went on a playing tour to San Francisco. Thayer, who wrote &quot;Casey&quot; in 1888, covered the San Francisco leg for the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]''.

Thayer, in a letter he wrote in 1905, mentions Kelly as showing &quot;impudence&quot; in claiming to have written the poem. The author of the 2004 definitive bio of Kelly—which included a close tracking of his vaudeville career—did not find Kelly claiming to have been the author.&lt;ref name=rosenberg&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|first=Howard W.|title= Cap Anson 2: The Theatrical and Kingly Mike Kelly: U.S. Team Sport's First Media Sensation and Baseball's Original Casey at the Bat|publisher=Tile Books|year=2004|isbn=0-9725574-1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|rosenberg|page1=9}}

==Plagiarism==
A month after the poem was published, it was reprinted as &quot;Kelly at the Bat&quot; in the ''[[New York Sporting Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Aside from omitting the first five verses, the only changes from the original are substitutions of Kelly for Casey, and [[Boston]] for Mudville.&lt;ref name=moore&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=Jim|last2=Vermilyea|first2=Natalie|title=Ernest Thayer's &quot;Casey at the bat&quot; : background and characters of baseball's most famous poem|date=1994|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=9780899509976|page=[https://archive.org/details/ernestthayerscas0000moor/page/2 2]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ernestthayerscas0000moor/page/2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[King Kelly]], then of the [[History of the Boston Braves|Boston Beaneaters]], was one of baseball's two biggest stars at the time (along with [[Cap Anson]]).{{r|rosenberg|page1=9}}

In 1897, the magazine ''[[Current Literature]]'' noted the two versions and said, &quot;The locality, as originally given, is Mudville, not Boston; the latter was substituted to give the poem local color.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Casey at the Bat|journal=Current Literature|date=February 1897|volume=21|issue=2|page=129|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951000902843q;view=1up;seq=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-publication version==
Sportswriter [[Leonard Koppett]] claimed in a 1979 article that the published poem omits 18 lines penned by Thayer which change the entire theme of the poem. Koppett said the full version of the poem takes the pitch count on Casey to full as his uncle Arnold stirs up wagering action in the stands before a wink passes between them and Casey throws the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Koppett|first1=Leonard|title=Casey at Bat?

==Live performances==
[[Image:Dewolfhopper1.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.1|1909 theatrical poster with DeWolf Hopper in A Matinee Idol]]
[[DeWolf Hopper]] gave the poem's first stage [[recitation]] on August 14, 1888, at [[New York City|New York's]] [[Wallack Theatre]] as part of the [[comic opera]] ''[[Prinz Methusalem]]'' in the presence of the Chicago and New York baseball teams, the [[Chicago Cubs|White Stockings]] and the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]], respectively; August 14, 1888 was also Thayer's 25th birthday. Hopper became known as an orator of the poem, and recited it more than 10,000 times (by his count—some tabulations are as much as four times higher) before his death.&lt;ref name=Gardner /&gt;

|quote=&quot;It is as perfect an [[epitome]] of our national game today as it was when every player drank his coffee from a [[mustache cup]]. There are one or more Caseys in every [[Baseball league|league]], [[Bush league|bush]] or big, and there is no day in the playing season that this same supreme [[tragedy]], as stark as [[Aristophanes]] for the moment, does not befall on some field.&quot;&lt;ref name=Gardner /&gt;}}
On stage in the early 1890s, baseball star Kelly recited the original &quot;Casey&quot; a few dozen times and not the parody. For example, in a review in 1893 of a variety show he was in, the ''Indianapolis News'' said, &quot;Many who attended the performance had heard of Kelly's singing and his reciting, and many had heard De Wolf Hopper recite 'Casey at the Bat' in his inimitable way. Kelly recited this in a sing-song, school-boy fashion.&quot;  Upon Kelly's death, a writer would say he gained &quot;considerable notoriety by his ludicrous rendition of 'Casey at the Bat,' with which he concluded his `turn’ [act] at each performance.&quot;{{r|rosenberg|page1=229}}

During the 1980s, the magic/comedy team [[Penn &amp; Teller]] performed a version of &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot; with Teller (the &quot;silent&quot; partner) struggling to escape a [[straitjacket]] while suspended upside-down over a platform of sharp steel spikes. The set-up was that [[Penn Jillette]] would leap off his chair upon finishing the poem, releasing the rope which supported Teller, and send his partner to a gruesome death if he wasn't free by that time.  The drama of the performance was taken up a notch after the third or fourth stanza, when Penn Jillette began to read out the rest of the poem much faster than the opening stanzas, greatly reducing the time that Teller had left to work free from his bonds.

On July 4, 2008, Jack Williams recited the poem accompanied by the [[Boston Pops]] during the annual Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular at Boston's [[Fourth of July]] Celebration.

On July 14, 2013, the jam rock band [[Furthur (band)|Furthur]] performed the poem as part of a second-set medley in center field of Doubleday Field in Cooperstown, New York.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/furthur2013-07-14.AKGc1000s&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded version of &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot; was made by [[Russell Hunting]], speaking in a broad Irish accent, in 1893; an [http://cylinders.library.ucsb.edu/search.php?queryType=@attr+1=1020&amp;num=1&amp;start=1&amp;query=cylinder5348 1898 cylinder recording of the text made for the Columbia Graphophone label by Hunting] can be accessed from the [[Cylinder Preservation and Digitization Project]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] Library.

[[DeWolf Hopper]]'s more famous recorded recitation was released in October 1906.

In 1946, [[Walt Disney]] released a recording of the narration of the poem by [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]], which accompanied the studio's [[animated cartoon]] adaptation of the poem (see below).

In 1973, the [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]] commissioned its former Composer-in-Residence, [[Frank Proto]], to create a work to feature Baseball Hall-of-Famer [[Johnny Bench]] with the orchestra. The result &quot;Casey At The Bat – an American Folk Tale for Narrator and Orchestra&quot; was an immediate hit and recorded by Bench and the orchestra. It has since been performed more than 800 times by nearly every major and Metropolitan orchestra in the U.S. and Canada.

In 1980, baseball pitcher [[Tug McGraw]] recorded ''Casey at The Bat—an American Folk Tale for Narrator and Orchestra'' by [[Frank Proto]] with [[Peter Nero]] and the [[Philly Pops]].

In 1996, actor [[James Earl Jones]] recorded the poem with Arranger/Composer [[Steven Reineke]] and the [[Cincinnati Pops Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Casey At The Bat|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-2lXQQcXb8|work=Casey at the Bat – James Earl Jones|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1998 CD: Play Ball!  – Erich Kunzel – Cincinnati Pops Orchestra, Recorded 1996 with Arranger/Composer Steven Reineke and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra (insert credits) – https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000064U5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mudville==
A rivalry of sorts has developed between two cities claiming to be the Mudville described in the poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zezima|first1=Katie|title=Mudville Journal; In 'Casey' Rhubarb, 2 Cities Cry 'Foul!'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/31/us/mudville-journal-in-casey-rhubarb-2-cities-cry-foul.html|work=New York Times|date=31 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residents of [[Holliston, Massachusetts]], where there is a neighborhood called Mudville, claim it as the Mudville described in the poem. Thayer grew up in nearby [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], where he wrote the poem in 1888; his family owned a wool mill less than a mile from Mudville's baseball field.

However, residents of [[Stockton, California]]—which was known for a time as Mudville prior to incorporation in 1850—also lay claim to being the inspiration for the poem. In 1887, Thayer covered baseball for ''[[The San Francisco Examiner|The Daily Examiner]]''—owned by his Harvard classmate [[William Randolph Hearst]]—and is said to have covered the local [[California League]] team, the [[Stockton Ports]]. For the [[1902 in baseball|1902]] season, after the poem became popular, Stockton's team was renamed the Mudville Nine. The team reverted to the Mudville Nine moniker for the 2000 and 2001 seasons. The [[Visalia Rawhide]], another California League team, currently keep Mudville alive by playing in Mudville jerseys on June&amp;nbsp;3 each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stockton Mudville Nine|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Stockton_Mudville_Nine|website=Baseball Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the towns' rival claims, Thayer himself told the ''[[Syracuse Post-Standard]]'' that &quot;the poem has no basis in fact.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardner&quot; /&gt;

==Adaptations==

==Derivations==
For a relatively short poem apparently dashed off quickly (and denied by its author for years), &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot; had a profound effect on American popular culture. It has been [[#Live performances|recited]], re-enacted, [[#Adaptations|adapted]], dissected, parodied, and subjected to just about every other treatment one could imagine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardner&quot; /&gt;

===Sequels===
&quot;Casey's Revenge&quot;, by [[Grantland Rice]] (1907), gives Casey another chance against the pitcher who had struck him out in the original story. It was written in 1906, and its first known publication was in the quarterly magazine ''The Speaker'' in June 1907, under the pseudonym of James Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Martin|title=The Annotated Casey at the Bat: A Collection of Ballads About the Mighty Casey|year=1995|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=0-486-28598-7|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this version, Rice cites the nickname &quot;Strike-Out Casey&quot;, hence the influence on [[Casey Stengel]]'s name. Casey's team is down ''three'' runs by the last of the ninth, and once again Casey is down to two strikes—with the bases full this time. However, he connects, hits the ball so far that it is never found.

*In response to the popularity of the 1946 Walt Disney animated adaptation, Disney made a sequel, ''Casey Bats Again'' (1954), in which Casey's nine daughters redeem his reputation.
*In 1988, on the 100th anniversary of the poem, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' writer [[Frank Deford]] constructed a fanciful story (later expanded to book form) which posited Katie Casey, the subject of the song &quot;[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]&quot;, as being the daughter of the famous slugger from the poem.
*In 2010, Ken Eagle wrote &quot;The Mudville Faithful&quot;, covering a century of the Mudville nine's fortunes since Casey struck out. Faithful fans still root for the perpetually losing team, and are finally rewarded by a trip to the World Series, led by Casey's great-grandson who is also named Casey.

===Parodies===
Of the many [[parody|parodies]] made of the poem, some of the notable ones include:
*''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine republished the original version of the poem in the 1950s with artwork by [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]] and no alterations to the text. Later lampoons in ''Mad'' included &quot;'Cool' Casey at the Bat&quot; (1960), an interpretation of the poem in [[beatnik]] style, with artwork by [[Don Martin (cartoonist)|Don Martin]]; &quot;Casey at the Dice&quot; in 1969, about a professional gambler; &quot;Casey at the Talks&quot; in 1977, a &quot;modern&quot; version of the famed poem in which Mudville tries unsuccessfully to sign free agent Casey[the last line of which is &quot;Mighty Casey has held out&quot;]; &quot;Baseball at the Bat&quot;, a satire on baseball itself, &quot;Howard at the Mike&quot;, about [[Howard Stern]]; &quot;Casey at the Byte&quot; (1985), a tale of a cocky young computer expert who accidentally erases the White House Budget Plan; &quot;Clooney as the Bat&quot;, a mockery of [[George Clooney]]'s role as [[Batman]] in ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman and Robin]]''; and in 2006 as &quot;Barry at the Bat&quot;, poking fun at [[Barry Bonds]]' alleged involvement in the [[BALCO]] scandal, and in 2001, &quot;Jordan at the Hoop&quot;, satirizing [[Michael Jordan]]'s return to the NBA and his time with the [[Washington Wizards]]. A &quot;Poetry Round Robin&quot; where famous poems are rewritten in the style of the next poet in line, featured Casey at the Bat as written by [[Edgar Allan Poe]].
*[[Foster Brooks]] (&quot;the Lovable Lush&quot;) wrote &quot;Riley on the Mound&quot;, which recounts the story from the pitcher's perspective.

*Author Phil Bolsta penned a parody entitled &quot;Hrbek at the Bat&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_hrbek_at_the_bat.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; about Twins slugger [[Kent Hrbek]] which was published in 1987 in the Minneapolis Review of Baseball.
*Radio performer [[Garrison Keillor]]'s parodic version of the poem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keillor|first1=Garrison|title=Casey at the Bat (Road Game)|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_case7.shtml|website=Baseball Almanac}}&lt;/ref&gt; reimagines the game as a road game, instead of a home game, for the Mudville team. The same events occur with Casey striking out in the ninth inning as in the original poem, but with everything told from the perspective of other team.
*An episode of ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' featured a short titled &quot;Buster at the Bat&quot;, where [[Sylvester (Looney Tunes)|Sylvester]] provides narration as Buster goes up to bat. The poem was parodied again for an episode of ''[[Animaniacs]]'', this time with [[Yakko, Wakko, and Dot|Wakko]] as the title character and Yakko narrating. 
*In ''[[The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]'' episode &quot;Return of the Nanobots&quot;, Cindy's poem is identical to the ending of &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot; but replaces Mudville with Retroville and the last famed line with &quot;cause Jimmy is an idiot!&quot;
*[[The New York Times]] published a parody by Hart Seely and [[Frank Cammuso]] in which the poem was narrated by [[Phil Rizzuto]], a [[New York Yankees]] announcer who was known to veer off on tangents while calling the game. The poem was later published in Seely and Cammuso's book, ''2007 Eleven And Other American Comedies''.
*[[David Pogue]] penned a parody version titled 'A Desktop Critic: Steven Saves the Mac' for [[Macworld]] magazine that ran in their October 1999 issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pogue|first1=David|title=The Desktop Critic: Steven Saves the Mac|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/15358/1999/10/desktopcritic.html|work=Macworld|date=October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; It tells the story of [[Steve Jobs]]' triumphant return to a struggling [[Apple Inc]] and his early efforts to reverse the company's fortunes.
*[[Dick Flavin (poet)|Dick Flavin]] wrote a version titled Teddy at the Bat, after [[Boston Red Sox]] legend [[Ted Williams]] died in July, 2002. Flavin performed the poem at [[Fenway Park]] during the night-long tribute to Williams done at the park later that month. The poem replaced Flynn and Blake with [[Bobby Doerr]] and [[Johnny Pesky]], the batters who preceded Williams in the 1946 Red Sox lineup.
*In 2000, Michael J. Farrand adapted the [[rhyming scheme]], tone, and [[Literary theme|theme]] of the poem—while reversing the outcome—to create his poem &quot;The Man Who Gave All the Dreamers in Baseball Land Bigger Dreams to Dream&quot; about [[Kirk Gibson's 1988 World Series home run|Kirk Gibson's home run]] off [[Dennis Eckersley]] in Game 1 of the 1988 [[World Series]].  The poem appears at the [[Baseball Almanac]].
*Norman Jackman wrote a reversed-outcome version in 1951 called &quot;Bobby Thomson at the Bat,&quot; which went unknown for over 60 years until the [[San Francisco Giants]] published it in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sfgiantsphotos.mlblogs.com/bobby-thomson-at-the-bat-54859b06e729|title=Bobby Thomson at the Bat|last=MLB.com/blogs|first=|date=2 February 2012|website=SF Giants Photos|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's about [[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|Thomson's famous home run]] in a 1951 Giant-Dodger playoff game.  In 2016, the poem was accepted into the poetry files of the National Baseball Library and Archive of the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]].
*[[The New York Times]] best-selling author and poet laureate of The Ringer, [[Shea Serrano]], penned a loving tribute to [[NBA]] player [[Gordon Hayward]] in the vein of &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot; in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://theringer.com/gordon-hayward-utah-jazz-poem-nbshea-ea66d15584be&lt;/ref&gt;
*Canadian comedy duo [[Wayne and Shuster]] created &quot;Shakespearean Baseball&quot;, featuring [[William Shakespeare]]-esque characters and dialogue in a skit based upon the poem. They performed the play on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and on Canadian TV numerous times between the 1950s and 1980s.
*Baseball writer and [[Villanova University|Villanova]] professor Mitchell Nathanson updated the poem for contemporary times in 2019, publishing &quot;Casey @ the Bat&quot; in ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/10/01/casey-bat-poem-baseball-modern-era/?wpisrc=nl_ideas&amp;wpmm=1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Names===
[[Casey Stengel]] describes in his autobiography how his original nickname &quot;K.C.&quot; (for his hometown, [[Kansas City, Missouri]]) evolved into &quot;Casey&quot;. It was influenced not just by the name of the poem, which was widely popular in the 1910s, but also because he tended to strike out frequently in his early career so fans and writers started calling him &quot;strikeout Casey&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stengel|first1=Casey|last2=Paxton|first2=Harry T.|title=Casey at the Bat: The Story of My Life in Baseball|date=1962|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary culture==

A baseball-themed episode of [[The Twilight Zone]] was named [[The Mighty Casey]] in reference to the poem's lead character, though the plot is unrelated.

In the show [[Friends]], Ross clarifies how to spell &quot;Casey&quot; as in &quot;at the bat&quot; in the Season 2, episode 14 titled &quot;The One with the Prom Video.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://friends.tktv.net/Episodes2/summaries/14.html|title=Transcript of The One with the Prom Video|website=friends.tktv.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;
