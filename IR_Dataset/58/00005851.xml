'''Transport in the Czech Republic''' relies on several main modes, including [[Transportation|transport]] by road, rail, water and air.

==Railways==
{{see also|Rail transport in the Czech Republic}}

The Czech Republic has a total railway length of {{convert|9435|km|mi}}. The vast majority ({{convert|9341|km|mi}}) is standard gauge. Electrified railways generally have voltages of 3 kV DC or 25 kV AC. {{convert|94|km|mi}} of track is [[Narrow gauge railways in the Czech Republic|narrow gauge]]. The most prominent Czech railway company is the state-owned [[České dráhy]] (ČD) (English: ''Czech Railways''). [[Prague]] has an underground [[rapid transit]] system, the [[Prague Metro]].

The Czech Republic has, in total, {{convert|55653|km|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name=&quot;transtats&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iraptranstats.net/cz |title=Transport in Czech Republic |accessdate=2008-10-06 |date=2008-04-13 |work=International Transport Statistics Database |publisher=[[International Road Assessment Programme|IRAP]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; of roads. It has {{convert|1247|km|abbr=on|}}&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; of motorways. In the 1980s and 1990s there was a significant increase in passenger transport on the roads in the Czech Republic, which was associated with a sharp increase in the accident rate. Between 2007 and 2013, the death rate fell in every year, with a record low of 583 deaths in 2013, compared with the 1994 high of 1,473 casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/number-of-traffic-victims-in-czechrep-lowest-in-history-in-2013/1025609|title=Number of traffic victims in Czech Republic lowest in history in 2013|work=ceskenoviny.cz|date=1 January 2014|accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this however, the fatality rate per head of population is moderately high, comparable to the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;transtats&quot;/&gt;

The first modern highways in the Czech Republic was the motorway from [[Prague]] to the [[Slovakia|Slovak border]] through [[Brno]] whose construction was started on May 2, 1939.

ŘSD currently manages and maintains 1,247&amp;nbsp;km of motorways (''dálnice'').&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;http://www.ceskedalnice.cz&lt;/ref&gt;
