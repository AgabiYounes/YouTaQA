'''Confucius''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ən|ˈ|f|j|uː|ʃ|ə|s}} {{respell|kən|FEW|shəs}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary.com|Confucius}}&lt;/ref&gt; 551–479 BC)&lt;ref name=birth/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Riegel|2012|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2012/entries/confucius/ online]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese philosopher]] and politician of the [[Spring and Autumn period]].

The philosophy of Confucius, also known as [[Confucianism]], emphasized personal and governmental morality, correctness of social relationships, justice, kindness, and sincerity. His followers competed successfully with many other schools during the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] era only to be [[Suppression of monasteries|suppressed]] in favor of the [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalists]] during the [[Qin dynasty]]. Following the victory of [[Han dynasty|Han]] over [[Chu-Han Contention|Chu]] after the collapse of Qin, Confucius's thoughts received official sanction in the new government and were further developed into a system known in the West as [[Neo-Confucianism]], and later [[New Confucianism|New Confucianism (Modern Neo-Confucianism)]].

Confucius is traditionally credited with having authored or edited many of the [[Chinese classics|Chinese classic texts]] including all of the [[Five Classics]], but modern scholars are cautious of attributing specific assertions to Confucius himself. [[Aphorism]]s concerning his teachings were compiled in the ''[[Analects]]'', but only many years after his death.

Confucius's principles have commonality with Chinese tradition and belief. He championed strong family loyalty, [[Ancestor veneration in China|ancestor veneration]], and respect of elders by their children and of husbands by their wives, recommending family as a basis for ideal government. He espoused the well-known principle &quot;Do not do unto others what you do not want done to yourself&quot;, the [[Golden Rule]]. He is also a traditional deity in [[Daoism]].

Confucius is widely considered as one of the most important and influential individuals in shaping human history. His teaching and philosophy greatly impacted people around the world and remains influential today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Life and Significance of Confucius|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/confucius.htm|website=www.sjsu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China Confucianism: Life of Confucius, Influences, Development|url=https://www.travelchinaguide.com/intro/religion/confucianism/|website=www.travelchinaguide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
{{anchor|Etymology|Name|Titles}}
The name &quot;Confucius&quot; is a [[Latin]]ized form of the [[Mandarin Chinese]] &quot;Kǒng Fūzǐ&quot; ({{lang|zh|孔夫子}}, meaning &quot;Master Kǒng&quot;), and was coined in the late 16th century by the early [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries to China]].{{sfnp|Nivison|1999|p=752}} Confucius's clan name&lt;!-- NOT surname, as they had not yet been invented--&gt; was &quot;[[Kong (surname)|Kǒng]]&quot; ({{lang|zh|孔}}; [[Old Chinese]]: {{Old Chinese|[k]ʰˤoŋʔ}}), and his given name was &quot;Qiū&quot; ({{lang|zh|丘}}; OC: {{Old Chinese|[k]ʷʰə}}).  His &quot;capping name&quot;, given upon reaching adulthood and by which he would have been known to all but his older family members, was &quot;Zhòngní&quot; ({{Old Chinese|2=仲尼|N-‍truŋ-‍s nr[əj]|3=}}), the &quot;Zhòng&quot; indicating that he was the second son in his family.{{sfnp|Nivison|1999|p=752}}{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2015|p=133}}

Confucius was educated at schools for commoners, where he studied and learned the [[Six Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huang|first1=Yong|title=Confucius: A Guide for the Perplexed|date=2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black|pages=4–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1R9MAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416224536/https://books.google.com/books?id=1R9MAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4|archivedate=2017-04-16|df=|isbn=978-1-4411-9653-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucius was born into the class of ''[[Four occupations|shi]]'' (士), between the aristocracy and the common people.

In Confucius's time, the state of [[Lu (state)|Lu]] was headed by a ruling ducal house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=274–275}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the duke were [[Three Huan|three aristocratic families]], whose heads bore the title of viscount and held hereditary positions in the Lu bureaucracy.&lt;ref name=dubs49-275 /&gt; The Ji family held the position &quot;Minister over the Masses&quot;, who was also the &quot;Prime Minister&quot;; the Meng family held the position &quot;Minister of Works&quot;; and the Shu family held the position &quot;Minister of War&quot;.&lt;ref name=dubs49-275 /&gt; In the winter of 505 BC, Yang Hu—a retainer of the Ji family—rose up in rebellion and seized power from the Ji family.&lt;ref name=dubs49-275&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=275}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the summer of 501 BC, the three hereditary families had succeeded in expelling Yang Hu from Lu.&lt;ref name=dubs49-275 /&gt; By then, Confucius had built up a considerable reputation through his teachings, while the families came to see the value of proper conduct and righteousness, so they could achieve loyalty to a legitimate government.&lt;ref name=dubs49-275-6&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=275–276}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, that year (501 BC), Confucius came to be appointed to the minor position of governor of a town.&lt;ref name=dubs49-275-6 /&gt; Eventually, he rose to the position of Minister of Crime.&lt;ref name=dubs49-275-6 /&gt;

Confucius desired to return the authority of the state to the duke by dismantling the fortifications of the city—strongholds belonging to the three families.&lt;ref name=dubs49-277 /&gt; This way, he could establish a centralized government.&lt;ref name=dubs49-277 /&gt; However, Confucius relied solely on diplomacy as he had no military authority himself.&lt;ref name=dubs49-277 /&gt; In 500 BC, Hou Fan—the governor of Hou—revolted against his lord of the Shu family.&lt;ref name=dubs49-277&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=277}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Meng and Shu families unsuccessfully besieged Hou, a loyalist official rose up with the people of Hou and forced Hou Fan to flee to the [[Qi (state)|Qi state]].&lt;ref name=dubs49-277 /&gt; The situation may have been in favor for Confucius as this likely made it possible for Confucius and his disciples to convince the aristocratic families to dismantle the fortifications of their cities.&lt;ref name=dubs49-277 /&gt; Eventually, after a year and a half, Confucius and his disciples succeeded in convincing the Shu family to raze the walls of Hou, the Ji family in razing the walls of Bi, and the Meng family in razing the walls of Cheng.&lt;ref name=dubs49-277 /&gt; First, the Shu family led an army towards their city Hou and tore down its walls in 498 BC.&lt;ref name=dubs49-277 /&gt;

Soon thereafter, Gongshan Furao (also known as Gongshan Buniu), a retainer of the Ji family, revolted and took control of the forces at Bi.&lt;ref name=creel49-35-6&gt;{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=35–36}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=duuuu46-277-8 /&gt; He immediately launched an attack and entered the capital Lu.&lt;ref name=dubs49-277 /&gt; Earlier, Gongshan had approached Confucius to join him, which Confucius considered as he wanted the opportunity to put his principles into practice but he gave up on the idea in the end.&lt;ref name=creel49-35-6 /&gt; Confucius disapproved the use of a violent revolution by principle, even though the Ji family dominated the Lu state by force for generations and had exiled the previous duke.&lt;ref name=creel49-35-6 /&gt; Creel (1949) states that, unlike the rebel Yang Hu before him, Gongshan may have sought to destroy the three hereditary families and restore the power of the duke.&lt;ref name=creel49-35&gt;{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dubs (1946) is of the view that Gongshan was encouraged by Viscount Ji Huan to invade the Lu capital in an attempt to avoid dismantling the Bi fortified walls.&lt;ref name=duuuu46-277-8&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=277–278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the situation may have been, Gongshan was considered an upright man who continued to defend the state of Lu, even after he was forced to flee.&lt;ref name=creel49-35 /&gt;&lt;ref name=dubs49-278 /&gt;

During the revolt by Gongshan, [[Zhong You]] had managed to keep the duke and the three viscounts together at the court.&lt;ref name=dubs49-278&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhong You was one of the disciples of Confucius and Confucius had arranged for him to be given the position of governor by the Ji family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=278–279}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When Confucius heard of the raid, he requested that Viscount Ji Huan allow the duke and his court to retreat to a stronghold on his palace grounds.&lt;ref name=dubs49-279&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=279}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the heads of the three families and the duke retreated to the Ji's palace complex and ascended the Wuzi Terrace.&lt;ref name=chin07-30&gt;{{Harvnb|Chin|2007|loc=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Confucius ordered two officers to lead an assault against the rebels.&lt;ref name=chin07-30 /&gt; At least one of the two officers was a retainer of the Ji family, but they were unable to refuse the orders while in the presence of the duke, viscounts, and court.&lt;ref name=dubs49-279 /&gt; The rebels were pursued and defeated at Gu.&lt;ref name=chin07-30 /&gt; Immediately after the revolt was defeated, the Ji family razed the Bi city walls to the ground.&lt;ref name=chin07-30 /&gt;

The attackers retreated after realizing that they would have to become rebels against the state and their lord.&lt;ref name=dubs49-279 /&gt; Through Confucius' actions, the Bi officials had inadvertently revolted against their own lord, thus forcing Viscount Ji Huan's hand in having to dismantle the walls of Bi (as it could have harbored such rebels) or confess to instigating the event by going against proper conduct and righteousness as an official.&lt;ref name=dubs49-279 /&gt; Dubs (1949) suggests that the incident brought to light Confucius' foresight, practical political ability, and insight into human character.&lt;ref name=dubs49-279 /&gt;

When it was time to dismantle the city walls of the Meng family, the governor was reluctant to have his city walls torn down and convinced the head of the Meng family not to do so.&lt;ref name=chin07-30 /&gt; The ''[[Zuozhuan]]'' recalls that the governor advised against razing the walls to the ground as he said that it made Cheng vulnerable to the [[Qi (state)|Qi state]] and cause the destruction of the Meng family.&lt;ref name=&quot;dubs49-279&quot; /&gt; Even though Viscount Meng Yi gave his word not to interfere with an attempt, he went back on his earlier promise to dismantle the walls.&lt;ref name=&quot;dubs49-279&quot; /&gt;

Later in 498 BC, Duke Ding personally went with an army to lay siege to Cheng in an attempt to raze its walls to the ground, but he did not succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=280}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Confucius could not achieve the idealistic reforms that he wanted including restoration of the legitimate rule of the duke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=280–281}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He had made powerful enemies within the state, especially with Viscount Ji Huan, due to his successes so far.&lt;ref name=dubs46-281&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=281}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to accounts in the ''[[Zuozhuan]]'' and ''[[Shiji]]'', Confucius departed his homeland in 497 BC after his support for the failed attempt of dismantling the fortified city walls of the powerful Ji, Meng, and Shu families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Riegel|1986|loc=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He left the state of Lu without resigning, remaining in self-exile and unable to return as long as Viscount Ji Huan was alive.&lt;ref name=dubs46-281 /&gt;

===Exile===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
[[File:Journey of Confucius.png|thumb|450px|Map showing the journey of Confucius to various states between 497 BC and 484 BC.]]
The ''[[Shiji]]'' stated that the neighboring [[Qi (state)|Qi state]] was worried that Lu was becoming too powerful while Confucius was involved in the government of the Lu state. According to this account, Qi decided to sabotage Lu's reforms by sending 100 good horses and 80 beautiful dancing girls to the duke of Lu. The duke indulged himself in pleasure and did not attend to official duties for three days. Confucius was disappointed and resolved to leave Lu and seek better opportunities, yet to leave at once would expose the misbehavior of the duke and therefore bring public humiliation to the ruler Confucius was serving. Confucius therefore waited for the duke to make a lesser mistake. Soon after, the duke neglected to send to Confucius a portion of the sacrificial meat that was his due according to custom, and Confucius seized upon this pretext to leave both his post and the Lu state.

After Confucius's resignation, he began a long journey or set of journeys around the [[ancient Chinese states|principality states]] of north-east and central China including [[Wei (Spring and Autumn Period)|Wey]], [[Song (state)|Song]], [[Zheng (state)|Zheng]], [[Cao (state)|Cao]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]], [[Qi (state)|Qi]], [[Chen (state)|Chen]], and [[Cai (state)|Cai]] (and a failed attempt to go to [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]]). At the courts of these states, he expounded his political beliefs but did not see them implemented.

===Return home===
[[File:Confuciustombqufu.jpg|thumb|200px|Tomb of Confucius in [[Cemetery of Confucius|Kong Lin cemetery]], [[Qufu]], [[Shandong Province]]]]

According to the ''[[Zuozhuan]]'', Confucius returned home to his native Lu when he was 68, after he was invited to do so by [[Ji Kangzi]], the chief minister of Lu.&lt;ref name=return&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huang|first1=Yong|title=Confucius: A Guide for the Perplexed|date=2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black|pages=27–28|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1R9MAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=confucius+return+68+lu#v=onepage&amp;q=confucius%20return%2068%20lu&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 13, 2015|isbn=978-1-4411-9653-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Analects'' depict him spending his last years teaching 72 or 77 [[disciples of Confucius|disciples]] and transmitting the old wisdom via a set of texts called the [[Five Classics]].

During his return, Confucius sometimes acted as an advisor to several government officials in Lu, including [[Ji Kangzi]], on matters including governance and crime.&lt;ref name=return/&gt;

Burdened by the loss of both his son and his favorite disciples, he died at the age of 71 or 72. He died from natural causes. Confucius was buried in [[Cemetery of Confucius|Kong Lin cemetery]] which lies in the historical part of [[Qufu]] in the Shandong Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/704/|title=Temple and Cemetery of Confucius and the Kong Family Mansion in Qufu|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|language=en|access-date=2019-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original tomb erected there in memory of Confucius on the bank of the Sishui River had the shape of an axe. In addition, it has a raised brick platform at the front of the memorial for offerings such as sandalwood incense and fruit.

Although Confucianism is often followed in a religious manner by the Chinese, many argue that its values are secular and that it is, therefore, less a religion than a secular morality. Proponents argue, however, that despite the secular nature of Confucianism's teachings, it is based on a worldview that is religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Berger|first=Peter|url=http://www.the-american-interest.com/2012/02/15/is-confucianism-a-religion/|title=Is Confucianism a Religion?|magazine=The American Interest|date=February 15, 2012|accessdate=August 13, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150817062142/http://www.the-american-interest.com/2012/02/15/is-confucianism-a-religion/|archivedate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confucianism discusses elements of the [[Diyu|afterlife]] and views concerning [[Tian|Heaven]], but it is relatively unconcerned with some spiritual matters often considered essential to religious thought, such as the nature of [[Chinese soul|souls]]. However, Confucius is said to have believed in astrology, saying: &quot;Heaven sends down its good or evil symbols and wise men act accordingly&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parkers&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Parkers|Parkers (1983)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rongo Analects 02.jpg|thumb|The [[Analects]] of Confucius]]

In the ''[[Analects]]'', Confucius presents himself as a &quot;transmitter who invented nothing&quot;. He puts the greatest emphasis on the importance of study, and it is the [[Chinese character]] for study ({{linktext|學}}) that opens the text. Far from trying to build a systematic or [[Religious formalism|formalist]] theory, he wanted his disciples to master and internalize older classics, so that their deep thought and thorough study would allow them to relate the moral problems of the present to past political events (as recorded in the ''Annals'') or the past expressions of commoners' feelings and noblemen's reflections (as in the poems of the ''[[Shi Jing|Book of Odes]]'').

===Ethics===
One of the deepest teachings of Confucius may have been the superiority of personal exemplification over explicit rules of behavior. His moral teachings emphasized self-cultivation, emulation of moral exemplars, and the attainment of skilled judgment rather than knowledge of rules. Confucian ethics may, therefore, be considered a type of [[virtue ethics]]. His teachings rarely rely on reasoned argument, and ethical ideals and methods are conveyed indirectly, through [[allusion]], [[innuendo]], and even [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]]. His teachings require examination and context to be understood. A good example is found in this famous anecdote:

::{{lang|zh|廄焚。子退朝，曰：“傷人乎？” 不問馬。}}
::''When the stables were burnt down, on returning from court Confucius said, &quot;Was anyone hurt?&quot; He did not ask about the horses.''
:::::::''Analects'' X.11 (tr. [[Arthur Waley|Waley]]), 10–13 (tr. [[James Legge|Legge]]), or X-17 (tr. [[D.C. Lau|Lau]])

By not asking about the horses, Confucius demonstrates that the sage values human beings over property; readers are led to reflect on whether their response would follow Confucius's and to pursue self-improvement if it would not have. Confucius serves not as an all-powerful deity or a universally true set of abstract principles, but rather the ultimate model for others. For these reasons, according to many commentators, Confucius's teachings may be considered a Chinese example of [[humanism]].

One of his teachings was a variant of the [[Golden Rule]], sometimes called the &quot;[[Silver Rule]]&quot; owing to its negative form:

::{{lang|zh|己所不欲，勿施於人。}}
::''&quot;What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others.&quot;''

::{{lang|zh|子貢問曰：“有一言而可以終身行之者乎？”子曰：“其恕乎！己所不欲、勿施於人。”}}
::''Zi Gong [a disciple] asked: &quot;Is there any one word that could guide a person throughout life?&quot; &lt;br /&gt;The Master replied: &quot;How about 'reciprocity'! Never impose on others what you would not choose for yourself.&quot;''
:::::::''Analects'' XV.24, tr. David Hinton

Often overlooked in Confucian ethics are the virtues to the self: sincerity and the cultivation of knowledge. Virtuous action towards others begins with virtuous and sincere thought, which begins with knowledge. A virtuous disposition without knowledge is susceptible to corruption, and virtuous action without sincerity is not true righteousness. Cultivating knowledge and sincerity is also important for one's own sake; the superior person loves learning for the sake of learning and righteousness for the sake of righteousness.

The Confucian theory of ethics as exemplified in ''[[Li (Confucian)|lǐ]]'' ({{lang|zh|禮}}) is based on three important conceptual aspects of life: (a) ceremonies associated with sacrifice to ancestors and deities of various types, (b) social and political institutions, and (c) the etiquette of daily behavior. It was believed by some that ''lǐ'' originated from the heavens, but Confucius stressed the development of ''lǐ'' through the actions of sage leaders in human history. His discussions of ''lǐ'' seem to redefine the term to refer to all actions committed by a person to build the ideal society, rather than those simply conforming with canonical standards of ceremony.

In the early Confucian tradition, ''lǐ'' was doing the proper thing at the proper time, balancing between maintaining existing norms to perpetuate an ethical social fabric, and violating them in order to accomplish ethical good. Training in the ''lǐ'' of past sages cultivates in people virtues that include ethical judgment about when ''lǐ'' must be adapted in light of situational contexts.

In Confucianism, the concept of ''li'' is closely related to ''yì'' ({{lang|zh|義}}), which is based upon the idea of reciprocity. ''Yì'' can be translated as [[righteousness]], though it may simply mean what is ethically best to do in a certain context. The term contrasts with action done out of [[selfishness|self-interest]]. While pursuing one's own self-interest is not necessarily bad, one would be a better, more righteous person if one's life was based upon following a path designed to enhance the greater good. Thus an outcome of ''yì'' is doing the right thing for the right reason.

Just as action according to ''[[Li (Confucian)|lǐ]]'' should be adapted to conform to the aspiration of adhering to ''yì'', so ''yì'' is linked to the core value of ''rén'' ({{lang|zh|仁}}).''[[Ren (Confucianism)|Rén]]'' consists of five basic virtues: seriousness, generosity, sincerity, diligence and kindness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bonevac09-40&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bonevac|Phillips|2009|loc=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rén'' is the virtue of perfectly fulfilling one's responsibilities toward others, most often translated as &quot;benevolence&quot; or &quot;humaneness&quot;; translator [[Arthur Waley]] calls it &quot;Goodness&quot; (with a capital ''G''), and other translations that have been put forth include &quot;authoritativeness&quot; and &quot;selflessness.&quot; Confucius's moral system was based upon [[empathy]] and understanding others, rather than divinely ordained rules. To develop one's spontaneous responses of ''rén'' so that these could guide action intuitively was even better than living by the rules of ''yì''. Confucius asserts that virtue is a mean between extremes. For example, the properly generous person gives the right amount—not too much and not too little.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bonevac09-40&quot; /&gt;

===Politics===
Confucius's political thought is based upon his ethical thought. He argued that the best government is one that rules through &quot;rites&quot; (''lǐ'') and people's [[natural morality]], and ''not'' by using bribery and coercion. He explained that this is one of the most important analects: &quot;If the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, they will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of shame. If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of the shame, and moreover will become good.&quot; (Translated by [[James Legge]]) in the [[Great Learning]] ({{lang|zh|大學}}). This &quot;sense of shame&quot; is an internalisation of [[duty]], where the punishment precedes the evil action, instead of following it in the form of laws as in [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]].

Confucius looked nostalgically upon earlier days, and urged the Chinese, particularly those with political power, to model themselves on earlier examples. In times of division, chaos, and endless wars between feudal states, he wanted to restore the [[Mandate of Heaven]] ({{lang|zh|天命}}) that could unify the &quot;world&quot; ({{lang|zh|天下}}, &quot;all under Heaven&quot;) and bestow peace and prosperity on the people. Because his vision of personal and social perfections was framed as a revival of the ordered society of earlier times, Confucius is often considered a great proponent of [[conservatism]], but a closer look at what he proposes often shows that he used (and perhaps twisted) past institutions and rites to push a new political agenda of his own: a revival of a unified royal state, whose rulers would succeed to power on the basis of their moral merits instead of lineage. These would be rulers devoted to their people, striving for personal and social [[perfection]], and such a ruler would spread his own virtues to the people instead of imposing proper behavior with laws and rules.

Confucius did not believe in the concept of &quot;[[democracy]]&quot;, which is itself an [[Athens|Athenian]] concept unknown in ancient China, but could be interpreted by Confucius's principles recommending against individuals electing their own political leaders to govern them, or that anyone is capable of self-government. He expressed fears that the masses lacked the intellect to make decisions for themselves, and that, in his view, since not everyone is created equal, not everyone has a right of self-government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schuman|first1=Michael|title=Confucius: And the World He Created|date=2015|publisher=Basic Books|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wb6DBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT123&amp;lpg=PT123&amp;dq=confucius+everyone+equal#v=onepage&amp;q=confucius%20everyone%20equal&amp;f=false|isbn =978-0-465-04057-5|accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While he supported the idea of government ruling by a virtuous king, his ideas contained a number of elements to limit the power of rulers. He argued for representing [[truth]] in language, and [[honesty]] was of paramount importance. Even in [[facial expression]], truth must always be represented. Confucius believed that if a ruler is to lead correctly, by action, that orders would be unnecessary in that others will follow the proper actions of their ruler. In discussing the relationship between a king and his subject (or a father and his son), he underlined the need to give due respect to superiors. This demanded that the subordinates must advise their superiors if the superiors are considered to be taking a course of action that is wrong. Confucius believed in ruling by example, if you lead correctly, orders by force or punishment are not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Violatti|first=Cristian|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Confucianism/|title=Confucianism|publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia|date=August 31, 2013|accessdate=August 17, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818150049/http://www.ancient.eu/Confucianism/|archivedate=August 18, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucius's teachings were later turned into an elaborate set of rules and practices by his numerous disciples and followers, who organized his teachings into the Analects.{{sfnp|Knechtges|Shih|2010|p=645}}{{sfnp|Kim|Csikszentmihalyi|2010|p=25}} Confucius's disciples and his only grandson, [[Zisi]], continued his philosophical school after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Focusing the Familiar: A Translation and Philosophical Interpretation of the Zhongyong|author=Ames, Roger T. and David L. Hall|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-8248-2460-0|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts spread Confucian ideals to students who then became officials in many of the royal courts in China, thereby giving Confucianism the first wide-scale test of its [[dogma]].

Two of Confucius's most famous later followers emphasized radically different aspects of his teachings. In the centuries after his death, [[Mencius]] ({{lang|zh|孟子}}) and [[Xun Zi]] ({{lang|zh|荀子}}) both composed important teachings elaborating in different ways on the fundamental ideas associated with Confucius. [[Mencius]] (4th century BC) articulated the innate goodness in human beings as a source of the ethical intuitions that guide people towards ''rén'', ''yì'', and ''lǐ'', while [[Xun Zi]] (3rd century BC) underscored the realistic and materialistic aspects of Confucian thought, stressing that morality was inculcated in society through tradition and in individuals through training. In time, their writings, together with the ''Analects'' and other core texts came to constitute the philosophical corpus of Confucianism.

This realignment in Confucian thought was parallel to the development of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], which saw filial piety as self-interest and not a useful tool for a ruler to create an effective state. A disagreement between these two political philosophies came to a head in 223 BC when the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] conquered all of China. [[Li Si]], Prime Minister of the [[Qin dynasty]], convinced [[Qin Shi Huang]] to abandon the Confucians' recommendation of awarding fiefs akin to the [[Zhou Dynasty]] before them which he saw as being against to the Legalist idea of centralizing the state around the ruler. When the Confucian advisers pressed their point, Li Si had many Confucian scholars killed and their books burned—considered a huge blow to the philosophy and Chinese scholarship.

Under the succeeding [[Han dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties, Confucian ideas gained even more widespread prominence. Under [[Emperor Wu of Han|Wudi]], the works of Confucius were made the official imperial philosophy and required reading for civil service examinations in 140 BC which was continued nearly unbroken until the end of the 19th century. As [[Mohism]] lost support by the time of the Han,  the main philosophical contenders were Legalism, which Confucian thought somewhat absorbed, the teachings of [[Laozi]], whose focus on more spiritual ideas kept it from direct conflict with Confucianism, and the new [[Buddhist]] religion, which gained acceptance during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] era. Both Confucian ideas and Confucian-trained officials were relied upon in the [[Ming Dynasty]] and even the [[Yuan Dynasty]], although Kublai Khan distrusted handing over provincial control to them.

During the [[Song dynasty]], the scholar [[Zhu Xi]] (AD 1130–1200) added ideas from [[Daoism]] and [[Buddhism]] into Confucianism. In his life, Zhu Xi was largely ignored, but not long after his death, his ideas became the new orthodox view of what Confucian texts actually meant. Modern historians view Zhu Xi as having created something rather different and call his way of thinking ''[[Neo-Confucianism]]''. Neo-Confucianism held sway in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam until the 19th century.

The works of Confucius were first translated into European languages by [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries]] in the 16th century during the late [[Ming dynasty]]. The first known effort was by [[Michele Ruggieri]], who returned to Italy in 1588 and carried on his translations while residing in [[Salerno]]. [[Matteo Ricci]] started to report on the thoughts of Confucius, and a team of Jesuits—[[Prospero Intorcetta]], [[Philippe Couplet]], and two others—published a translation of several [[Confucian canon|Confucian works]] and an overview of [[history of China|Chinese history]] in Paris in 1687.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://archive.org/stream/confuciussinarum00conf_0#page/n5/mode/2up |title=Confucius Sinarum Philosophus, sive, Scientia Sinensis Latine Exposita ''[''Confucius, Philosopher of the Chinese, or, Chinese Knowledge Explained in Latin'']'' |editor-last=Intorcetta |editor-first=Prospero |editor2=Philippe Couplet |editor3=Chrétien Herdtrich |editor4=François Rougemont |display-editors=1 |ref={{harvid|Intorcetta &amp; al.|1687}} |date=1687 |location=Paris |publisher=Daniel Horthemels }}. {{in lang|la}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=parker77-25&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|1977|loc=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[François Noël (missionary)|François Noël]], after failing to persuade [[Pope Clement XI|Clement{{nbsp}}XI]] that [[Chinese ancestral veneration|Chinese veneration of ancestors]] and [[Confucianism|Confucius]] [[Chinese Rites controversy|did not constitute idolatry]], completed the Confucian canon at [[Prague]] in 1711, with more scholarly treatments of the other works and the first translation of the [[Mengzi (book)|collected works]] of [[Mencius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |editor-last=Noël |editor-first=François |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=A0K0bjBLmMYC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Sinensis Imperii Libri Classici Sex ''[''The Six Classic Books of the Chinese Empire'']'' |location=Prague |publisher=Charles-Ferdinand University Press |date=1711 }}. {{in lang|la}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that such works had considerable importance on European thinkers of the period, particularly among the [[Deists]] and other philosophical groups of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] who were interested by the integration of the system of morality of Confucius into [[western world|Western civilization]].&lt;ref name=parker77-25 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hobson|2004|loc=194–195}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era Confucian movements, such as [[New Confucianism]], still exist, but during the [[Cultural Revolution]], Confucianism was frequently attacked by leading figures in the [[Communist Party of China]]. This was partially a continuation of the condemnations of Confucianism by intellectuals and activists in the early 20th century as a cause of the ethnocentric close-mindedness and refusal of the [[Qing Dynasty]] to modernize that led to the tragedies that befell China in the 19th century.

Confucius's works are studied by scholars in many other Asian countries, particularly those in the [[Chinese cultural sphere]], such as Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Many of those countries still hold the traditional memorial ceremony every year.

{{main|Disciples of Confucius}}

Confucius began teaching after he turned 30, and taught more than 3,000 students in his life, about 70 of whom were considered outstanding. His disciples and the early Confucian community they formed became the most influential intellectual force in the [[Warring States period]].{{sfnp|Shen|2013|p=86}} The [[Han dynasty]] historian [[Sima Qian]] dedicated a chapter in his ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' to the biographies of Confucius's disciples, accounting for the influence they exerted in their time and afterward. Sima Qian recorded the names of 77 disciples in his collective biography, while ''[[Kongzi Jiayu]]'', another early source, records 76, not completely overlapping. The two sources together yield the names of 96 disciples.{{sfnp|Shen|2013|p=87}} 22 of them are mentioned in the ''[[Analects]]'', while the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'' records 24.&lt;ref name=creel49-30&gt;{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucius did not charge any tuition, and only requested a symbolic gift of a bundle of dried meat from any prospective student. According to his disciple [[Duanmu Ci|Zigong]], his master treated students like doctors treated patients and did not turn anybody away.{{sfnp|Shen|2013|p=87}} Most of them came from [[Lu (state)|Lu]], Confucius's home state, with 43 recorded, but he accepted students from all over China, with six from the state of [[Wey (state)|Wey]] (such as Zigong), three from [[Qin (state)|Qin]], two each from [[Chen (state)|Chen]] and [[Qi (state)|Qi]], and one each from [[Cai (state)|Cai]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]], and [[Song (state)|Song]].{{sfnp|Shen|2013|p=87}} Confucius considered his students' personal background irrelevant, and accepted noblemen, commoners, and even former criminals such as Yan Zhuoju and [[Gongye Chang]].{{sfnp|Shen|2013|p=88}} His disciples from richer families would pay a sum commensurate with their wealth which was considered a ritual donation.{{sfnp|Shen|2013|p=87}}

Confucius's favorite disciple was [[Yan Hui]], most probably one of the most impoverished of them all.&lt;ref name=creel49-30 /&gt; Sima Niu, in contrast to Yan Hui, was from a hereditary noble family hailing from the Song state.&lt;ref name=creel49-30 /&gt; Under Confucius's teachings, the disciples became well-learned in the principles and methods of government.&lt;ref name=creel49-32 /&gt; He often engaged in discussion and debate with his students and gave high importance to their studies in history, poetry, and ritual.&lt;ref name=creel49-32 /&gt; Confucius advocated loyalty to principle rather than to individual acumen, in which reform was to be achieved by persuasion rather than violence.&lt;ref name=creel49-32&gt;{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Confucius denounced them for their practices, the aristocracy was likely attracted to the idea of having trustworthy officials who were studied in morals as the circumstances of the time made it desirable.&lt;ref name=creel49-32 /&gt; In fact, the disciple [[Zhong You|Zilu]] even died defending his ruler in [[Wey (state)|Wey]].&lt;ref name=creel49-32 /&gt;

Yang Hu, who was a subordinate of the Ji family, had dominated the Lu government from 505 to 502 and even attempted a coup, which narrowly failed.&lt;ref name=creel49-32 /&gt; As a likely consequence, it was after that that the first disciples of Confucius were appointed to government positions.&lt;ref name=creel49-32 /&gt; A few of Confucius's disciples went on to attain official positions of some importance, some of which were arranged by Confucius.&lt;ref name=creel49-31&gt;{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Confucius was 50 years old, the Ji family had consolidated their power in the Lu state over the ruling ducal house.&lt;ref name=creel49-33&gt;{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the Ji family had practices with which Confucius disagreed and disapproved, they nonetheless gave Confucius's disciples many opportunities for employment.&lt;ref name=creel49-33 /&gt; Confucius continued to remind his disciples to stay true to their principles and renounced those who did not, all the while being openly critical of the Ji family.&lt;ref name=creel49-32-3&gt;{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=32–33}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual portraits===
No contemporary painting or sculpture of Confucius survives, and it was only during the [[Han Dynasty]] that he was portrayed visually. Carvings often depict his legendary meeting with [[Laozi]]. Since that time there have been many portraits of Confucius as the ideal philosopher. The oldest known portrait of Confucius has been unearthed in the tomb of the [[Han dynasty]] ruler [[Marquis of Haihun]] (died 59 BC). The picture was painted on the wooden frame to a polished bronze mirror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/News/New_discoveries/2017/0221/57185.html |title=Confucius depicted on mirror |date= |language=English |website=The Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences |accessdate=22 February 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222200723/http://www.kaogu.cn/en/News/New_discoveries/2017/0221/57185.html |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In former times, it was customary to have a portrait in [[Temple of Confucius|Confucius Temples]]; however, during the reign of [[Hongwu Emperor]] (Taizu) of the [[Ming dynasty]], it was decided that the only proper portrait of Confucius should be in the [[Temple of Confucius, Qufu|temple]] in his home town, [[Qufu]] in Shandong. In other temples, Confucius is represented by a memorial tablet. In 2006, the China Confucius Foundation commissioned a standard portrait of Confucius based on the [[Tang dynasty]] portrait by [[Wu Daozi]].

===Fictional portrayals===
There have been two film adaptations of Confucius' life: [[Confucius (1940 film)|''Confucius'' (1940)]] starring Tang Huaiqiu, and [[Confucius (2010 film)|''Confucius'' (2010)]] starring [[Chow Yun-fat]].

In music, [[Tori Amos]] imagines Confucius as working on a [[crossword puzzle]] in her [[1992]] song &quot;Happy Phantom.&quot;

===Memorials===
[[File:First Entrance Gate of the Temple of Confucius, Ching-hai.jpg|thumb|left|First entrance gate of the [[Temple of Confucius]] in [[Zhenhai]]]]

Soon after Confucius's death, [[Qufu]], his home town, became a place of devotion and remembrance. The [[Han dynasty]] ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' records that it had already become a place of pilgrimage for ministers. It is still a major destination for cultural tourism, and many people visit his grave and the surrounding temples. In Sinic cultures, there are many temples where representations of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Laozi]], and Confucius are found together. There are also many [[Temple of Confucius|temples]] dedicated to him, which have been used for Confucian ceremonies.

Followers of Confucianism have a tradition of holding spectacular memorial ceremonies of Confucius ({{lang|zh|祭孔}}) every year, using ceremonies that supposedly derived from Zhou Li ({{lang|zh|周禮}}) as recorded by Confucius, on the date of Confucius's birth. In the 20th century, this tradition was interrupted for several decades in mainland China, where the official stance of the Communist Party and the State was that Confucius and Confucianism represented reactionary [[Feudalism|feudalist]] beliefs which held that the subservience of the people to the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] is a part of the natural order. All such ceremonies and rites were therefore banned. Only after the 1990s did the ceremony resume. As it is now considered a veneration of Chinese history and tradition, even Communist Party members may be found in attendance.

In Taiwan, where the Nationalist Party ([[Kuomintang]]) strongly promoted Confucian beliefs in ethics and behavior, the tradition of the memorial ceremony of Confucius (祭孔) is supported by the government and has continued without interruption. While not a national holiday, it does appear on all printed calendars, much as [[Father's Day]] or [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] do in the Western world.

In [[South Korea]], a grand-scale memorial ceremony called [[Seokjeon Daeje]] is held twice a year on Confucius's birthday and the anniversary of his death, at [[Hyanggyo|Confucian academies]] across the country and [[Sungkyunkwan]] in Seoul.

===Descendants===
{{See also|Family tree of Confucius in the main line of descent}}

Confucius's descendants were repeatedly identified and honored by successive imperial governments with titles of nobility and official posts. They were honored with the rank of a [[marquess|marquis]] 35 times since [[Gaozu of Han|Gaozu]] of the [[Han dynasty]], and they were promoted to the rank of [[duke]] 42 times from the [[Tang dynasty]] to the [[Qing dynasty]]. [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] first bestowed the title of &quot;Duke Wenxuan&quot; on Kong Suizhi of the 35th generation.

In [[1351]], during the reign of Emperor [[Toghon Temür]] of the [[Yuan dynasty]], 93rd-generation descendant Kong Huan (孔浣)'s 2nd son Kong Shao (孔昭) moved from China to Korea during the [[Goryeo|Goryeo Dynasty]], and was received courteously by [[Queen Noguk|Princess Noguk]] (the Mongolian-born wife of the future king [[Gongmin of Goryeo|Gongmin]]). After being naturalized as a Korean citizen, he changed the [[hanja]] of his name from &quot;昭&quot; to &quot;紹&quot; (both pronounced ''so'' in Korean),&lt;ref&gt;Due to a [[naming taboo]] regarding the birth name of the 4th king of Goryeo [[Gwangjong of Goryeo|Gwangjong]], born &quot;Wang So&quot; ({{Korean|왕소|王昭}}).&lt;/ref&gt; married a Korean woman and bore a son (Gong Yeo ({{Korean|공여|孔帤}}), 1329–1397), therefore establishing the Changwon Gong clan ({{Korean|창원 공씨|昌原 孔氏}}), whose ancestral seat was located in [[Changwon]], [[South Gyeongsang Province]].
The clan then received an [[Korean nobility|aristocratic rank]] during the succeeding [[Joseon|Joseon Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.qz.gov.cn/English/Recent/201405/t20140519_278510.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20150204113943/http://www.qz.gov.cn/English/Recent/201405/t20140519_278510.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2015-02-04|title=Descendants of Confucius in South Korea Seek Roots in Quzhou|date=2014-05-19|website=Quzhou.China|accessdate=February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.people.cn/90001/90777/90851/6355971.html|title=South Korea home to 80,000 descendants of Confucius – People's Daily Online|last=english@peopledaily.com.cn|website=en.people.cn|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828231834/http://en.people.cn/90001/90777/90851/6355971.html|archivedate=2016-08-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/china/features/content_16696029_4.htm|title=New Confucius Genealogy out next year |website=www.china.org.cn|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010172506/http://www.china.org.cn/china/features/content_16696029_4.htm|archivedate=2016-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/china/Off_the_Wire/2016-03/11/content_37999541.htm|title=China Exclusive: Korean Confucius descendants trace back to ancestor of family tree |website=www.china.org.cn|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601040417/http://www.china.org.cn/china/Off_the_Wire/2016-03/11/content_37999541.htm|archivedate=2016-06-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-03/11/c_135179011.htm|title=China Exclusive: Korean Confucius descendants trace back to ancestor of family tree |website=www.news.xinhuanet.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729171433/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-03/11/c_135179011.htm|archivedate=2016-07-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1794, during the reign of King [[Jeongjo of Joseon|Jeongjo]], the clan then changed its name to [[Qufu Kong clan|Gokbu Gong clan]] ({{Korean|곡부 공씨|曲阜 孔氏}}) in honor of Confucius's birthplace [[Qufu]] ({{ko-hhrm|곡부|曲阜|Gokbu}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=|date=|title=Doosan Encyclopedia 공 孔|publisher=[[Doosan Encyclopedia]]|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1062982&amp;cid=200000000&amp;categoryId=200000185&amp;mobile}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Famous descendants include actors such as [[Gong Yoo]] (real name Gong Ji-cheol (공지철)) &amp; [[Gong Hyo-jin]] (공효진); and artists such as male idol group [[B1A4]] member [[Gongchan]] (real name Gong Chan-sik (공찬식)), singer-songwriter [[Minzy]] (real name Gong Min-ji (공민지)), as well as her great-aunt traditional folk dancer [[:ko:공옥진|Gong Ok-jin]] (공옥진).

Despite repeated dynastic change in China, the title of Duke Yansheng was bestowed upon successive generations of descendants until it was abolished by the [[Nationalist Government]] in 1935. The last holder of the title, [[Kung Te-cheng]] of the 77th generation, was appointed [[Sacrificial Official to Confucius]]. Kung Te-cheng died in October 2008, and his son, Kung Wei-yi, the 78th lineal descendant, had died in 1989.

Because of the huge interest in the Confucius family tree, there was a project in China to test the DNA of known family members of the collateral branches in mainland China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ministry of Commerce of the PRC|2006|loc=[http://ye2.mofcom.gov.cn/aarticle/chinanews/200606/20060602462372.html online]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, this would allow scientists to identify a common Y chromosome in male descendants of Confucius. If the descent were truly unbroken, father-to-son, since Confucius's lifetime, the males in the family would all have the same Y chromosome as their direct male ancestor, with slight mutations due to the passage of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/culture/171840.htm | title=DNA Testing Adopted to Identify Confucius Descendants | publisher=China Internet Information Center | date=19 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the genetic test was the help members of collateral branches in China who lost their genealogical records to prove their descent. However, in 2009, many of the collateral branches decided not to agree to DNA testing.&lt;ref name=seedmagazine&gt;{{Harvnb|Qiu|2008|loc=[http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/inheriting_confucius/ online]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bryan Sykes]], professor of genetics at [[Oxford University]], understands this decision: &quot;The Confucius family tree has an enormous cultural significance,&quot; he said. &quot;It's not just a scientific question.&quot;&lt;ref name=seedmagazine /&gt;  The DNA testing was originally proposed to add new members, many of whose family record books were lost during 20th-century upheavals, to the Confucian family tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bandao|2007|loc=[http://eng.bandao.cn/newsdetail.asp?id=4644 online]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The main branch of the family which fled to Taiwan was never involved in the proposed DNA test at all.

In 2013 a DNA test performed on multiple different families who claimed descent from Confucius found that they shared the same Y chromosome as reported by [[Fudan University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Chen |first= Stephen |date= 13 November 2013|title= Study finds single bloodline among self-claimed Confucius descendants |url= http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/technology/article/1354787/study-finds-single-bloodline-among-self-claimed-confucius |newspaper= South China Morning Post |location=  |access-date=  |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150403044929/http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/technology/article/1354787/study-finds-single-bloodline-among-self-claimed-confucius |archivedate= 3 April 2015 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
