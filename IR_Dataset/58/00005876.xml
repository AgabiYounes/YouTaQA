==Signs and symptoms==
[[Chest pain]] that occurs regularly with activity, after eating, or at other predictable times is termed stable [[angina]] and is associated with [[stenosis|narrowings]] of the [[artery|arteries]] of the [[heart]].

Angina that changes in intensity, character or frequency is termed unstable. [[Unstable angina]] may precede [[myocardial infarction]].

Limitation of blood flow to the heart causes [[ischemia]] (cell starvation secondary to a lack of oxygen) of the heart's [[myocardium|muscle cells]]. The heart's muscle cells may die from lack of [[oxygen]] and this is called a [[myocardial infarction]] (commonly referred to as a heart attack). It leads to damage, death, and eventual scarring of the heart muscle without regrowth of heart muscle cells. Chronic high-grade [[stenosis|narrowing]] of the coronary arteries can induce transient [[ischemia]] which leads to the induction of a [[ventricular arrhythmia]], which may terminate into a dangerous heart rhythm known as [[ventricular fibrillation]], which often leads to death.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmbroseSingh2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ambrose JA, Singh M | title = Pathophysiology of coronary artery disease leading to acute coronary syndromes | journal = F1000prime Reports | volume = 7 | pages = 08 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25705391 | pmc = 4311268 | doi = 10.12703/P7-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, coronary artery disease occurs when part of the smooth, elastic lining inside a [[coronary artery]] (the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle) develops [[atherosclerosis]]. With atherosclerosis, the artery's lining becomes hardened, stiffened, and accumulates deposits of calcium, fatty lipids, and abnormal inflammatory [[Cell (biology)|cells]] – to form a [[Atheromatous plaque|plaque]]. Calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) deposits in the muscular layer of the blood vessels appear to play a significant role in stiffening the arteries and inducing the early phase of coronary [[arteriosclerosis]]. This can be seen in a so-called metastatic mechanism of [[calciphylaxis]] as it occurs in [[chronic kidney disease]] and [[hemodialysis]] (Rainer Liedtke 2008). Although these people suffer from a kidney dysfunction, almost fifty percent of them die due to coronary artery disease. Plaques can be thought of as large &quot;pimples&quot; that protrude into the channel of an artery, causing a partial obstruction to blood flow. People with coronary artery disease might have just one or two [[Atheromatous plaque|plaques]], or might have dozens distributed throughout their [[coronary arteries]]. {{anchor|CTO}}A more severe form is ''chronic total occlusion'' (CTO) when a coronary artery is completely obstructed for more than 3 months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aziz2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Aziz S, Ramsdale DR|date=June 2005|title=Chronic total occlusions--a stiff challenge requiring a major breakthrough: is there light at the end of the tunnel?|journal=Heart|volume=91 Suppl 3|issue=suppl_3|pages=iii42-8|doi=10.1136/hrt.2004.058495|pmc=1876352|pmid=15919653}}&lt;!--|access-date=26 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The diagnosis of &quot;Cardiac Syndrome X&quot; – the rare coronary artery disease that is more common in women, as mentioned, is a diagnosis of exclusion. Therefore, usually the same tests are used as in any person with the suspected of having coronary artery disease:
* [[Baseline (medicine)|Baseline]] [[electrocardiography]] (ECG)
* Exercise ECG – [[Cardiac stress test|Stress test]]
* Exercise radioisotope test (nuclear stress test, myocardial [[scintigraphy]])
* [[Echocardiography]] (including stress echocardiography)
* [[Coronary angiography]]
* [[Intravascular ultrasound]]
* [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI)

The diagnosis of coronary disease underlying particular symptoms depends largely on the nature of the symptoms. The first investigation is an [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG/EKG), both for &quot;stable&quot; angina and acute coronary syndrome. An [[Chest X-ray|X-ray of the chest]] and [[blood test]]s may be performed.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Stable angina===
{{main|Angina pectoris}}
In &quot;stable&quot; angina, chest pain with typical features occurring at predictable levels of exertion, various forms of [[cardiac stress test]]s may be used to induce both symptoms and detect changes by way of electrocardiography (using an ECG), [[echocardiography]] (using [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] of the heart) or [[scintigraphy]] (using uptake of [[radionuclide]] by the heart muscle). If part of the heart seems to receive an insufficient blood supply, [[Coronary catheterization|coronary angiography]] may be used to identify [[stenosis]] of the coronary arteries and suitability for [[angioplasty]] or [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coronary Angiography|url=https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/ca|website=National Heart, Blood, and Lung Institute|access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acute coronary syndrome===
{{main|Acute coronary syndrome}}
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
Diagnosis of [[acute coronary syndrome]] generally takes place in the [[emergency department]], where ECGs may be performed sequentially to identify &quot;evolving changes&quot; (indicating ongoing damage to the heart muscle). Diagnosis is clear-cut if ECGs show elevation of the &quot;[[Electrocardiogram#ST segment|ST segment]]&quot;, which in the context of severe typical chest pain is strongly indicative of an acute [[myocardial infarction]] (MI); this is termed a STEMI (ST-elevation MI) and is treated as an emergency with either urgent [[Coronary catheterization|coronary angiography]] and [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] (angioplasty with or without [[stent]] insertion) or with [[thrombolysis]] (&quot;clot buster&quot; medication), whichever is available. In the absence of ST-segment elevation, heart damage is detected by [[cardiac marker]]s (blood tests that identify heart muscle damage). If there is evidence of damage ([[infarction]]), the chest pain is attributed to a &quot;non-ST elevation MI&quot; (NSTEMI). If there is no evidence of damage, the term &quot;unstable angina&quot; is used. This process usually necessitates hospital admission and close observation on a [[coronary care unit]] for possible complications (such as [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s – irregularities in the heart rate). Depending on the risk assessment, stress testing or angiography may be used to identify and treat coronary artery disease in patients who have had an NSTEMI or unstable angina.

===Risk assessment===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
There are various risk assessment systems for determining the risk of coronary artery disease, with various emphasis on different variables above. A notable example is [[Framingham Score]], used in the [[Framingham Heart Study]]. It is mainly based on age, gender, diabetes, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, tobacco smoking and systolic blood pressure.

==Prevention==
Up to 90% of cardiovascular disease may be preventable if established risk factors are avoided.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McGill HC, McMahan CA, Gidding SS | title = Preventing heart disease in the 21st century: implications of the Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth (PDAY) study | journal = Circulation | volume = 117 | issue = 9 | pages = 1216–27 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18316498 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.717033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McNeal CJ, Dajani T, Wilson D, Cassidy-Bushrow AE, Dickerson JB, Ory M | title = Hypercholesterolemia in youth: opportunities and obstacles to prevent premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease | journal = Current Atherosclerosis Reports | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–8 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20425267 | doi = 10.1007/s11883-009-0072-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prevention involves adequate physical [[exercise]], decreasing [[obesity]], treating [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], eating a [[healthy diet]], decreasing [[cholesterol]] levels, and [[smoking cessation|stopping smoking]].

Most guidelines recommend combining these preventive strategies. A 2015 Cochrane Review found some evidence that counselling and education in an effort to bring about behavioral change might help in high risk groups. However, there was insufficient evidence to show an effect on mortality or actual cardiovascular events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ebrahim S, Taylor F, Ward K, Beswick A, Burke M, Davey Smith G | title = Multiple risk factor interventions for primary prevention of coronary heart disease | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 1 | pages = CD001561 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21249647 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd001561.pub3 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[diabetes mellitus]], there is little evidence that very tight [[blood sugar]] control improves cardiac risk although improved sugar control appears to decrease other problems such as [[kidney failure]] and [[blindness]]. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recommends &quot;low to moderate alcohol intake&quot; to reduce risk of coronary artery disease while high intake increases the risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/5_population_nutrient/en/index12.html|title=5.
