'''Canada Day''' ({{lang-fr|Fête du Canada}}) is the [[national day]] of [[Canada]]. A [[Public holidays in Canada|federal statutory holiday]], it celebrates the anniversary of July 1, 1867, the effective date of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' (then called the ''British North America Act, 1867''), which united the three separate colonies of the Province of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick into a single Dominion within the British Empire called Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www1.canadiana.org/citm/themes/constitution/constitution13_e.html| title=Canada in the Making &gt; Constitutional History &gt; 1867–1931: Becoming a Nation| publisher=Canadiana| accessdate=June 16, 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209071528/http://www.canadiana.org/citm/themes/constitution/constitution13_e.html| archivedate=February 9, 2010| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gmgBsaRJbTQC&amp;pg=PT215| last=Moore| first=Christopher| title=1867: How the Fathers Made a Deal | year=2011| page=215| publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart| isbn=978-1-55199-483-3| accessdate=June 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally called '''Dominion Day''' ({{lang-fr|Le Jour de la Confédération}}), the holiday was renamed in 1982, the year the ''Canada Act'' was passed.&lt;ref name=&quot;HaydayBlake2017&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Matthew Hayday|author2=Raymond B.

In 1946, [[Philéas Côté]], a Quebec member of the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]], introduced a [[private member's bill]] to rename Dominion Day as ''Canada Day''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Carnegie| first=R.K.| title=Drew Right: Provinces Have Say-So On Holidays| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| page=15| date=April 19, 1946| ref=harv| postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was passed quickly by the lower chamber but was stalled by the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]], which returned it to the Commons with the recommendation that the holiday be renamed ''The National Holiday of Canada'', an amendment that effectively killed the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Editorial Board| title=A New Low in Compromise| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| page=6| date=August 10, 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ottawa fireworks 49 (27768773120).jpg|thumb|Fireworks in [[Ottawa]] during Canada Day. Official celebrations at [[Parliament Hill]] includes a fireworks display.]]
Beginning in 1958, the Canadian government began to orchestrate Dominion Day celebrations.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} That year, then Prime Minister [[John Diefenbaker]] requested that Secretary of State [[Ellen Fairclough]] put together appropriate events, with a budget of $14,000. Parliament was traditionally in session on July 1, but Fairclough persuaded Diefenbaker and the rest of the [[Cabinet of Canada|federal Cabinet]] to attend.&lt;ref name=Levine/&gt; Official celebrations thereafter consisted usually of [[Trooping the Colour]] ceremonies on [[Parliament Hill]] in the afternoon and evening, followed by a mass band concert and fireworks display. Fairclough, who became [[Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (Canada)|Minister of Citizenship and Immigration]], later expanded the bills to include performing folk and ethnic groups. The day also became more casual and family oriented.&lt;ref name=Levine/&gt; [[Canadian Centennial|Canada's centennial]] in 1967 is often seen as an important milestone in the history of Canadian nationalism and in Canada's maturing as a distinct, independent country, after which Dominion Day became more popular with average Canadians. Into the late 1960s, nationally televised, multi-cultural concerts held in [[Ottawa]] were added and the fête became known as ''Festival Canada''. After 1980, the Canadian government began to promote celebrating Dominion Day beyond the national capital, giving grants and aid to cities across the country to help fund local activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/funding/celebrate-canada.html|title=Celebrate Canada|first=Canadian|last=Heritage|date=June 17, 2019|website=aem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Canadians were, by the early 1980s, informally referring to the holiday as ''Canada Day'',{{refn|Numerous references to ''Canada Day'' may be found in issues of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' published in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=Sibley /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Across Canada/Pro-Canada sign painter has brush with law| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| page=12| date=November 19, 1977| ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Cherry| first=Zena| title=Protocol chiefs gather to discuss their trade| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| page=27| date=February 20, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Stevens| first=Geoffrey| title=With many tongues| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| page=6| date=March 2, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Canadian Press| title=Federal support for new festival| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| page=16| date=March 30, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n|name=Name}} a practice that caused some controversy:&lt;ref name=CBC/&gt; Proponents argued that the name ''Dominion Day'' was a holdover from the colonial era, an argument given some impetus by the [[patriation]] of the [[Canadian constitution]] in 1982, and others asserted that an alternative was needed as the term does not translate well into French.&lt;ref name=Sibley/&gt; Conversely, numerous politicians, journalists, and authors, such as [[Robertson Davies]],&lt;ref name=Mnemographia/&gt; decried the change at the time and some continue to maintain that it was illegitimate and an unnecessary break with tradition.&lt;ref name=Sibley/&gt; Others claimed ''Dominion'' was widely misunderstood and conservatively inclined commenters saw the change as part of a much larger attempt by [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] to &quot;re-brand&quot; or re-define Canadian history.&lt;ref name=Sibley/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mnemographia&gt;{{cite journal| last=Bentley| first=D.M.R.| title=Essay 11: Parading Past| journal=Mnemographia Canadensis| year=1999| volume=1| issue=Muse and Recall| url=http://www.uwo.ca/english/canadianpoetry/architexts/mnemographia_canadensis/index.htm| accessdate=July 11, 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702052517/http://www.uwo.ca/english/canadianpoetry/architexts/mnemographia_canadensis/index.htm| archive-date=July 2, 2013| url-status=dead| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=We should be celebrating Dominion Day| url=https://nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=26cb959a-54c2-46e9-9aa2-d5738fae183b&amp;k=22894| archive-url=https://archive.today/20120907165540/http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=26cb959a-54c2-46e9-9aa2-d5738fae183b&amp;k=22894| url-status=dead| archive-date=September 7, 2012| accessdate=July 11, 2011| newspaper=National Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columnist [[Andrew Cohen (journalist)|Andrew Cohen]] called ''Canada Day'' a term of &quot;crushing banality&quot; and criticized it as &quot;a renunciation of the past [and] a misreading of history, laden with political correctness and historical ignorance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=glcBcaMC6doC&amp;pg=PA90| last=Cohen| first=Andrew| title=The Unfinished Canadian: The People We Are| year=2008| publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart Limited| page=90| isbn=978-0-7710-2286-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most communities across the country will host organized celebrations for Canada Day, typically outdoor public events, such as parades, carnivals, festivals, barbecues, air and maritime shows, fireworks, and free musical concerts,&lt;ref name=Heritage96&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/newsroom/index_e.cfm?fuseaction=displayDocument&amp;DocIDCd=6NR110| author=Department of Canadian Heritage| authorlink=Department of Canadian Heritage| title=British Columbia and Yukon invited to participate to &quot;Celebrate Canada!&quot; Days| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=May 31, 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109190402/http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/newsroom/index_e.cfm?fuseaction=displayDocument&amp;DocIDCd=6NR110| archive-date=November 9, 2013| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Oath of Citizenship (Canada)|citizenship ceremonies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/English/citizenship/cit-ceremony.asp| last=Citizenship and Immigration Canada| authorlink=Citizenship and Immigration Canada| title=Applying for citizenship &gt; The citizenship ceremony| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rsscanadaimmigration.com/en/citizenship/citizenshipoath.php| title=Canadian Citizenship Oath| publisher=Robinson Sheppard Shapiro| accessdate=July 1, 2009| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101025405/http://www.rsscanadaimmigration.com/en/citizenship/citizenshipoath.php| archivedate=January 1, 2009| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no standard mode of celebration for Canada Day; [[Jennifer Welsh]], a professor of International Relations at the [[University of Oxford]], said about this: &quot;Canada Day, like the country, is endlessly decentralized.

Given the federal nature of the anniversary, celebrating Canada Day can be a cause of friction in the province of [[Quebec]], where the holiday is overshadowed by Quebec's [[National Holiday (Quebec)|National Holiday]], on June 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Fedio |first=Chloe |title=Canada Day Parade organizers bemoan lack of political support |newspaper=The Gazette |date=June 17, 2010 |url=https://montrealgazette.com/health/Canada+Parade+organizers+bemoan+lack+political+support/3164763/story.html |accessdate=July 1, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621051355/http://www.montrealgazette.com/health/Canada%2BParade%2Borganizers%2Bbemoan%2Black%2Bpolitical%2Bsupport/3164763/story.html |archivedate=June 21, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the federal government funds Canada Day events at the [[Old Port of Montreal]]—an area run by a federal [[Crown corporations of Canada|Crown corporation]]—while the National Holiday parade is a [[grassroots]] effort that has been met with pressure to cease, even from federal officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Hustake| first=Aalan| title=Proud Canadian, proud Quebecer who loved a parade| newspaper=The Gazette| date=May 25, 2008| url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/insight/story.html?id=069c09a6-3deb-4246-8e2e-a7d5324b8b26| accessdate=May 25, 2008| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628214622/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/insight/story.html?id=069c09a6-3deb-4246-8e2e-a7d5324b8b26| archivedate=June 28, 2011| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of the event has also been met with criticism outside of Quebec, such as that given by ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' columnist David Warren, who said in 2007: &quot;The Canada of the government-funded paper flag-waving and painted faces—the 'new' Canada that is celebrated each year on what is now called 'Canada Day'—has nothing controversially Canadian about it. You could wave a different flag, and choose another face paint, and nothing would be lost.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Warren| first=David| title=Sea to sea| newspaper=Ottawa Citizen| date=July 1, 2007| url=http://www.davidwarrenonline.com/index.php?id=750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada Day also coincides with Quebec's [[Moving Day (Quebec)|Moving Day]], when many fixed-lease apartment rental terms expire.
