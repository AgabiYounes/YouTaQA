The geography of the Czech Republic is quite varied. Bohemia, at the west part of [[Czech Republic]], consists of a [[river basin]], drained by the [[Elbe]] (Czech: ''Labe'') and [[Vltava]] rivers. It is surrounded by mostly low mountains such as the [[Sudetes]] with its part [[Krkonoše]], containing the highest point in the country, the [[Sněžka-Śnieżka|Sněžka]] at {{convert|1603|m|ft|0}}. Moravia, the eastern part, is also quite hilly and is drained predominantly by the [[Morava (river)|Morava river]], but also contains the source of the [[Oder River|Oder]] (Czech: ''Odra'') river. Water from the landlocked Czech Republic flows to three different seas: the [[North Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Black Sea]]. The [[Czech Republic]] also possesses [[Moldauhafen]], a {{convert|30,000|m2|acre|adj=on}} [[enclave]] in the middle of [[Hamburg]] docks, which was awarded to [[Czechoslovakia]] by Article 363 of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] to allow the landlocked country a place where goods transported downriver could be transferred to seagoing ships; this territory reverts to [[Germany]] in 2028.
