The '''history of Colombia''' includes the settlements and society by [[indigenous peoples in Colombia|indigenous peoples]], most notably, the [[Muisca Confederation]], [[Quimbaya civilization|Quimbaya Civilization]], and [[Tairona|Tairona Chiefdoms]]; the Spanish arrived in 1499 and initiated a period of annexation and colonization, most noteworthy being [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca]]; ultimately creating the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]], with its capital at [[Bogotá]]. Independence from [[Spain]] was won in 1819, but by 1830 the &quot;[[Gran Colombia]]&quot; Federation was dissolved. What is now Colombia and [[Panama]] emerged as the [[Republic of New Granada]]. The new nation experimented with federalism as the [[Granadine Confederation]] (1858), and then the [[United States of Colombia]] (1863), before the Republic of Colombia was finally declared in 1886. [[Panama–Colombia separation|Panama seceded]] in 1903. Since the 1960s, the country has suffered from an [[Asymmetric warfare|asymmetric]] [[Low intensity conflict|low-intensity]] [[Colombian armed conflict (1964–present)|armed conflict]], which escalated in the 1990s, but then decreased from 2005 onward. The legacy of Colombia's history has resulted in one of the most ethnically and [[Languages of Colombia|linguistically]] diverse countries in the world giving rise to a rich cultural heritage; while varied [[Geography of Colombia|geography]], and the imposing [[landscape]] of the country has resulted in the development of very strong regional identities.

From approximately 12,000 years [[Before Present|BP]] onwards, [[hunter-gatherer]] societies existed near present-day Bogotá (at [[El Abra]] and [[Tequendama]]), and they traded with one another and with cultures living in the [[Magdalena River]] valley. Due to its location, the present territory of Colombia was a corridor of early human migration from [[Mesoamerica]] and the [[Caribbean]] to the [[Andes]] and the [[Amazon basin]]. The oldest archaeological finds are from the Pubenza archaeological site and El Totumo archaeological site in the Magdalena Valley {{convert|100|km|mi}} southwest of Bogotá.&lt;ref name=Correal1993&gt;{{cite journal|last=Correal|first=Urrego G.|title=Nuevas evidencias culturales pleistocénicas y megafauna en Colombia|journal=Boletin de Arqueologia|year=1993|issue=8|pages=3–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sites date from the [[Paleoindian]] period (18,000–8000 BCE). At Puerto Hormiga archaeological site and other sites, traces from the Archaic period in South America (~8000–2000 BCE) have been found. Vestiges indicate that there was also early occupation in the regions of [[El Abra]], [[Tibitó]] and [[Tequendama]] in [[Cundinamarca Department (1820)|Cundinamarca]]. The oldest pottery discovered in the Americas, found at San Jacinto archaeological site, dates to 5000–4000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;

Between 5000 and 1000 BCE, hunter-gatherer tribes transitioned to agrarian societies; fixed settlements were established, and pottery appeared. Beginning in the 1st millennium BCE, groups of [[Amerindian]]s including the [[Muisca people|Muisca]], [[Quimbaya civilization|Quimbaya]], [[Tairona]], [[Calima culture|Calima]], [[Zenú]], [[Tierradentro]], [[San Agustín Archaeological Park|San Agustín]], [[Panche people|Tolima]], and Urabá became skilled in farming, mining, and metalcraft; and some developed the political system of ''[[cacicazgo]]s'' with a pyramidal structure of power headed by [[cacique]]s. The Muisca inhabited mainly the area of what is now the [[Departments of Colombia|Departments]] of [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]] and [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] high plateau (''[[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]]'') where they formed the [[Muisca Confederation]]. The Muisca had one of the most developed political systems ([[Muisca Confederation]]) in [[South America]], surpassed only by the [[Inca civilization|Incas]].&lt;ref name=Ocampo_p27&gt;Ocampo López, 2007, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; They farmed maize, potato, quinoa and cotton, and traded gold, [[Colombian emeralds|emeralds]], blankets, ceramic handicrafts, coca and especially [[Nemocón|salt]] with neighboring nations. The Tairona inhabited northern Colombia in the isolated [[Andes]] mountain range of [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]].&lt;ref name=Broadbent&gt;Broadbent, Sylvia 1965: Los Chibchas: organización socio-política.

Colombia's indigenous culture evolved from three main groups—the [[Quimbaya culture|Quimbaya]], who inhabited the western slopes of the [[Cordillera Central (Colombia)|Cordillera Central]]; the Chibchas; and the [[Kalina people|Kalina]] (Caribs). When the Spanish arrived in 1509, they found a flourishing and heterogeneous [[Amerindian]] population that numbered between 1.6 million and 7 million, belonged to several hundred tribes, and largely spoke mutually unintelligible dialects. The two most advanced cultures of Amerindian peoples at the time were the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] and [[Taironas]], who belonged to the Chibcha group and were skilled in farming, mining, and metalcraft. The Muisca lived mainly in the present departments of [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] and [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]], where they had fled centuries earlier after raids by the warlike Caribs, some of whom eventually migrated to Caribbean islands near the end of the first millennium. The Taironas, who were divided into two subgroups, lived in the Caribbean lowlands and the highlands of the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]]. The Muisca civilization was well organized into distinct provinces governed by communal land laws and powerful [[caciques]], who reported to one of the two supreme leaders.

The territory that became Colombia was first visited by Europeans when the first expedition of [[Alonso de Ojeda]] arrived at the [[Cabo de la Vela]] in 1499. The [[Spain|Spanish]] made several attempts to settle along the north coast of today's Colombia in the early 16th century, but their first permanent settlement, at [[Santa Marta]], was not established until 1525. [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] was founded on June 1, 1533, by Spanish commander Pedro de Heredia, in the former location of the indigenous Caribbean Calamarí village. Cartagena grew rapidly, fueled first by the gold in the tombs of the [[Zenú|Sinú]] Culture, and later by trade. The thirst for gold and land resulted in Spanish explorers to visit Chibchan speaking areas; resulting in the [[Spanish conquest of the Chibchan Nations]] refers to the [[conquest (military)|conquest]] by the [[Spanish monarchy]] of the [[Chibcha language]]-speaking nations, mainly the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] and [[Tairona]] that inhabited present-day [[Colombia]], beginning the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]].&lt;ref name=EREMITE&gt;[http://www.eremite.demon.co.uk/Tairona/1pages/seca/a2tsatconq.html Tairona Heritage Trust: Tairona history to the time of the Spanish Invasion] Tairona Heritage Trust Accessed 21 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish advance inland from the Caribbean coast began independently from three different directions, under [[Jimenéz de Quesáda]], [[Sebastián de Benalcázar]] (known in Colombia as Belalcázar) and [[Nikolaus Federmann]]. Although all three were drawn by the Indian treasures, none intended to reach [[Muisca people|Muisca]] territory, where they finally met.&lt;ref&gt;Lonely Planet, &quot;History of Colombia&quot;, http://www.lonelyplanet.com/colombia/history. Accessed 6 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1538, Quesáda founded Santa Fe de [[Bogotá]] on the site of Muisca village of Bacatá.

In 1549, the institution of the Spanish Royal [[Audiencia Real|Audiencia]] in Bogotá gave that city the status of capital of [[New Kingdom of Granada|New Granada]], which comprised in large part what is now the territory of Colombia. In 1717, the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] was originally created, and then it was temporarily removed, to finally be reestablished in 1739. The Viceroyalty had Santa Fé de Bogotá as its capital. This Viceroyalty included some other provinces of northwestern South America which had previously been under the jurisdiction of the [[New Spain|Viceroyalties of New Spain]] or [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]] and correspond mainly to today's [[Venezuela]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Panama]]. So, [[Bogotá]] became one of the principal administrative centers of the Spanish possessions in the New World, along with [[Lima, Peru|Lima]] and [[Mexico City]].

From then on, the long independence struggle was led mainly by [[Simón Bolívar|Bolívar]] and [[Francisco de Paula Santander]] in neighboring Venezuela. Bolívar returned to New Granada only in 1819 after establishing himself as leader of the pro-independence forces in the Venezuelan ''[[Los Llanos, Venezuela|llanos]]''. From there he led an army over the Andes and captured New Granada after a quick campaign that ended at the [[Battle of Boyacá]], on August 7, 1819. (''For more information, see [[Military career of Simón Bolívar]]''.)

That year, the [[Congress of Angostura]] established the Republic of Gran Colombia, which included all territories under the jurisdiction of the former Viceroyalty of New Granada.

As the Federation of Gran Colombia was dissolved in 1830, the Department of Cundinamarca (as established in Angostura) became a new country, the Republic of New Granada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Viceroyalty-of-New-Granada|title=Viceroyalty of New Granada {{!}} historical territory, South America|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
In 1863 the name of the Republic was changed officially to &quot;[[United States of Colombia]]&quot;, and in 1886 the country adopted its present name: &quot;Republic of Colombia&quot;.

Two political parties grew out of conflicts between the followers of Bolívar and Santander and their political visions—the [[Colombian Conservative Party|Conservatives]] and the [[Colombian Liberal Party|Liberals]] – and have since dominated Colombian politics. Bolívar's supporters, who later formed the nucleus of the Conservative Party, sought strong centralized government, alliance with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and a limited franchise. Santander's followers, forerunners of the Liberals, wanted a decentralized government, state rather than church control over education and other civil matters, and a broadened suffrage.

Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, each party held the presidency for roughly equal periods of time. Colombia maintained a tradition of civilian government and regular, free elections. The military has seized power three times in Colombia's history: in 1830, after the dissolution of Great Colombia; again in 1854 (by General [[José María Melo]]); and from 1953 to 1957 (under General [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla]]). Civilian rule was restored within one year in the first two instances.

Not withstanding the country's commitment to democratic institutions, Colombia's history has also been characterized by widespread, violent conflict. Two civil wars resulted from bitter rivalry between the Conservative and Liberal parties. The [[Thousand Days' War]] (1899–1902) cost an estimated 100,000 lives, and up to 300,000 people died during &quot;[[La Violencia]]&quot; of the late 1940s and 1950s, a bipartisan confrontation which erupted after the assassination of Liberal popular candidate [[Jorge Eliécer Gaitán]]. [[United States]] activity to influence the area (especially the [[Panama Canal]] construction and control) led to a military uprising in the [[Isthmus Department]] in 1903, which resulted in the [[Panama–Colombia separation|separation]] and independence of [[Panama]].

A military coup in 1953 toppled the right-wing government of Conservative [[Laureano Gómez]] and brought General [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla|Gustavo Rojas]] to power. Initially, Rojas enjoyed considerable popular support, due largely to his success in reducing &quot;[[La Violencia]]&quot;. When he did not restore democratic rule and occasionally engaged in open repression, however, he was overthrown by the military in 1957 with the backing of both political parties, and a provisional government was installed.

== The National Front regime (1958–1974) ==
{{Main|National Front (Colombia)}}
In July 1957, former Conservative President Laureano Gómez (1950–1953) and former Liberal President [[Alberto Lleras Camargo|Alberto Lleras]] (1945–1946, 1958–1962) issued the &quot;Declaration of Sitges,&quot; in which they proposed a &quot;National Front,&quot; whereby the Liberal and Conservative parties would govern jointly. The presidency would be determined by an alternating conservative and liberal president every 4 years for 16 years; the two parties would have parity in all other elective offices.

The National Front ended &quot;[[La Violencia]]&quot;, and National Front administrations attempted to institute far-reaching social and economic reforms in cooperation with the Alliance for Progress. In particular, the Liberal president [[Alberto Lleras Camargo]] (1958–1962) created the [[Colombian Institute for Agrarian Reform]] (INCORA), and [[Carlos Lleras Restrepo]] (1966–1970) further developed land entitlement. In 1968 and 1969 alone, the INCORA issued more than 60,000 land titles to farmers and workers.

In the end, the contradictions between each successive Liberal and Conservative administration made the results decidedly mixed. Despite the progress in certain sectors, many social and political injustices continued.

The National Front system itself eventually began to be seen as a form of political repression by dissidents and even many mainstream voters, and many protesters was victimized in this time. Especially, after what was apparently later confirmed as the fraudulent election of [[Colombian Conservative Party|Conservative]] candidate [[Misael Pastrana Borrero|Misael Pastrana]] in 1970, which resulted in the defeat of the relatively populist candidate [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla|Gustavo Rojas]], [[Gabriel Garcia Marquez]]. The [[19th of April Movement|M-19]] guerrilla movement, &quot;Movimiento 19 de Abril&quot; (19 April Movement), would eventually be founded in part as a response to this particular event. The [[FARC]] was formed in 1964 by [[Manuel Marulanda Vélez]] and other Marxist–Leninist supporters, after a military attack on the community of [[Marquetalia, Caldas|Marquetalia]].

Although the system established by the Sitges agreement was phased out by 1974, the 1886 Colombian constitution — in effect until 1991—required that the losing political party be given adequate and equitable participation in the government which, according to many observers and later analysis, eventually resulted in some increase in corruption and legal relaxation. The current 1991 constitution does not have that requirement, but subsequent administrations have tended to include members of opposition parties.

== Post-National Front ==
From 1974 until 1982, different presidential administrations chose to focus on ending the persistent [[Insurgency|insurgencies]] that sought to undermine Colombia's traditional political system. Both groups claimed to represent the poor and weak against the rich and powerful classes of the country, demanding the completion of true land and political reform, from an openly [[Communist]] perspective.

By 1974, another challenge to the state's authority and legitimacy had come from [[19th of April Movement]] (M-19), a mostly urban guerrilla group founded in response to an alleged electoral fraud during the final National Front election of [[Misael Pastrana Borrero|Misael Pastrana]] (1970–1974) and the defeat of former dictator [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla|Gustavo Rojas]].&lt;ref name=pedraja&gt;{{cite book|last1=René De La Pedraja|title=Wars of Latin America, 1948–1982: The Rise of the Guerrillas|date=2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476602936|page=223|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-FChAqNQgjwC&amp;lpg=PA223&amp;dq=m-19%20gustavo%20rojas&amp;pg=PA223#v=onepage&amp;q=m-19%20gustavo%20rojas&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the M-19 attracted a degree of attention and sympathy from mainstream Colombians that the [[FARC]] and [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|National Liberation Army (ELN)]] had found largely elusive earlier due to extravagant and daring operations, such as stealing a sword that had belonged to Colombia's Independence hero [[Simon Bolívar]]. At the same time, its larger profile soon made it the focus of the state's counterinsurgency efforts.

The ELN guerrilla had been seriously crippled by military operations in the region of Anorí by 1974, but it managed to reconstitute itself and escape destruction, in part due to the administration of [[Alfonso López Michelsen]] (1974–1978) allowing it to escape encirclement, hoping to initiate a peace process with the group.

By 1982, the perceived passivity of the [[FARC]], together with the relative success of the government's efforts against the M-19 and ELN, enabled the administration of the Liberal Party's [[Julio César Turbay Ayala|Julio César Turbay]] (1978–1982) to lift a state-of-siege decree that had been in effect, on and off, for most of the previous 30 years. Under the latest such decree, president Turbay had implemented security policies that, though of some military value against the M-19 in particular, were considered highly questionable both inside and outside Colombian circles due to numerous accusations of military [[human rights abuse]]s against suspects and captured guerrillas.

Citizen exhaustion due to the conflict's newfound intensity led to the election of president [[Belisario Betancur]] (1982–1986), a Conservative who won 47% of the popular vote, directed peace feelers at all the insurgents, and negotiated a 1984 cease-fire with the FARC and M-19 after a 1982 release of many guerrillas imprisoned during the previous effort to overpower them. The ELN rejected entering any negotiation and continued to recover itself through the use of extortions and threats, in particular against foreign oil companies of European and U.S. origin.

As these events were developing, the growing [[illegal drug trade]] and its consequences were also increasingly becoming a matter of widespread importance to all participants in the Colombian conflict. Guerrillas and newly wealthy drug lords had mutually uneven relations and thus numerous incidents occurred between them. Eventually, the kidnapping of drug cartel family members by guerrillas led to the creation of the 1981 ''Muerte a Secuestradores'' (MAS) death squad (&quot;Death to Kidnappers&quot;). Pressure from the U.S. government and critical sectors of Colombian society was met with further violence, as the [[Medellín Cartel]] and its hitmen, bribed or murdered numerous public officials, politicians and others who stood in its way by supporting the implementation of [[extradition]] of Colombian nationals to the U.S. Victims of cartel violence included Justice Minister [[Rodrigo Lara Bonilla|Rodrigo Lara]], whose assassination in 1984 made the Betancur administration begin to directly oppose the drug lords.

The first negotiated cease-fire with the M-19 ended when the guerrillas resumed fighting in 1985, claiming that the cease-fire had not been fully respected by official security forces, saying that several of its members had suffered threats and assaults, and also questioning the government's real willingness to implement any accords. The Betancur administration, in turn, questioned the M-19's actions and its commitment to the peace process, as it continued to advance high-profile negotiations with the FARC, which led to the creation of the [[Patriotic Union (Colombia)]] (UP), a legal and non-clandestine political organization.

On November 6, 1985, the M-19 [[Palace of Justice siege|stormed the Colombian Palace of Justice]] and held the Supreme Court magistrates hostage, intending to put president Betancur on trial. In the ensuing crossfire that followed the military's reaction, scores of people lost their lives, as did most of the guerrillas, including several high-ranking operatives. Both sides blamed each other for the outcome.

Meanwhile, individual FARC members initially joined the UP leadership in representation of the guerrilla command, though most of the guerrilla's chiefs and militiamen did not demobilize nor disarm, as that was not a requirement of the process at that point in time. Tension soon significantly increased, as both sides began to accuse each other of not respecting the cease-fire. Political violence against FARC and UP members (including presidential candidate [[Jaime Pardo Leal|Jaime Pardo]]) was blamed on drug lords and also on members of the security forces (to a much lesser degree on the argued inaction of Betancur administration). Members of the government and security authorities increasingly accused the FARC of continuing to recruit guerrillas, as well as kidnapping, extorting and politically intimidating voters even as the UP was already participating in politics.

The [[Virgilio Barco Vargas|Virgilio Barco]] (1986–1990) administration, in addition to continuing to handle the difficulties of the complex negotiations with the guerrillas, also inherited a particularly chaotic confrontation against the drug lords, who were engaged in a campaign of [[terrorism]] and murder in response to government moves in favor of their extradition overseas. The UP also suffered an increasing number of losses during this term (including the assassination of presidential candidate [[Bernardo Jaramillo Ossa|Bernardo Jaramillo]]), which stemmed both from private proto-[[paramilitary]] organizations, increasingly powerful drug lords and a number of would-be paramilitary-sympathizers within the armed forces.

== Post-1990 ==
Following administrations had to contend with the guerrillas, paramilitaries, narcotics traffickers and the violence and corruption that they all perpetuated, both through force and negotiation. Narcoterrorists assassinated three presidential candidates before [[César Gaviria Trujillo|César Gaviria]] was elected in 1990. Since the death of [[Medellín]] cartel leader [[Pablo Escobar]] in a police shootout during December 1993, indiscriminate acts of violence associated with that organization have abated as the &quot;cartels&quot; have broken up into multiple, smaller and often-competing trafficking organizations. Nevertheless, violence continues as these drug organizations resort to violence as part of their operations but also to protest government policies, including extradition.

The M-19 and several smaller guerrilla groups were successfully incorporated into a peace process as the 1980s ended and the 1990s began, which culminated in the elections for a [[Constituent Assembly of Colombia]] that would write a new constitution, which took effect in 1991. The new Constitution, brought about a considerable number of institutional and legal reforms based on principles that the delegates considered as more modern, humanist, democratic and politically open than those in the 1886 constitution. Practical results were mixed and mingled emerged (such as the debate surrounding the constitutional prohibition of extradition, which later was reversed), but together with the reincorporation of some of the guerrilla groups to the legal political framework, the new Constitution inaugurated an era that was both a continuation and a gradual, but significant, departure from what had come before.

Contacts with the FARC, which had irregularly continued despite the generalized [[de facto]] interruptions of the ceasefire and the official 1987 break from negotiations, were temporarily cut off in 1990 under the presidency of [[César Gaviria Trujillo|César Gaviria]] (1990–1994). The Colombian Army's assault on the FARC's ''Casa Verde'' sanctuary at [[La Uribe]], [[Meta Department|Meta]], followed by a FARC offensive that sought to undermine the deliberations of the Constitutional Assembly, began to highlight a significant break in the uneven negotiations carried over from the previous decade.

President [[Ernesto Samper Pizano|Ernesto Samper]] assumed office in August 1994. However, a political crisis relating to large-scale contributions from drug traffickers to Samper's presidential campaign diverted attention from governance programs, thus slowing, and in many cases, halting progress on the nation's domestic reform agenda. The military also suffered several setbacks in its fight against the guerrillas, when several of its rural bases began to be overrun and a record number of soldiers and officers were taken prisoner by the FARC (which since 1982 was attempting to implement a more &quot;conventional&quot; style of warfare, seeking to eventually defeat the military in the field).

On August 7, 1998, [[Andrés Pastrana Arango|Andrés Pastrana]] was sworn in as the President of Colombia. A member of the Conservative Party, Pastrana defeated Liberal Party candidate Horacio Serpa in a run-off election marked by high voter turnout and little political unrest. The new president's program was based on a commitment to bring about a peaceful resolution of Colombia's longstanding civil conflict and to cooperate fully with the United States to combat the trafficking of illegal drugs.

While early initiatives in the Colombian peace process gave reason for optimism, the Pastrana administration also has had to combat high unemployment and other economic problems, such as the fiscal deficit and the impact of global financial instability on Colombia. During his administration, unemployment has risen to over 20%. Additionally, the growing severity of countrywide guerrilla attacks by the FARC and ELN, and smaller movements, as well as the growth of drug production, corruption and the spread of even more violent paramilitary groups such as the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia ([[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia|AUC]]) has made it difficult to solve the country's problems.

Although the FARC and ELN accepted participation in the peace process, they did not make explicit commitments to end the conflict. The FARC suspended talks in November 2000, to protest what it called &quot;paramilitary terrorism&quot; but returned to the negotiating table in February 2001, following 2 days of meetings between President Pastrana and FARC leader Manuel Marulanda. The Colombian Government and ELN in early 2001 continued discussions aimed at opening a formal peace process.

== Recent developments ==
[[File:Marchapaz.jpg|thumb|Colombia's peace protests, 2007.]]
By 2004, the security situation of Colombia had shown some measure of an improvement and the economy, while still fragile, had also shown some positive signs. On the other hand, relatively little had been accomplished in structurally solving most of the country's other grave problems, in part due to legislative and political conflicts between the administration and the Colombian Congress (including those over the controversial 2006 project to give President [[Álvaro Uribe]] the right to be re-elected), and a relative lack of freely allocated funds and credits.

Some critical observers consider in retrospect that Uribe's policies, while admittedly reducing crime and guerrilla activity, were too slanted in favor of a military solution to Colombia's internal war, neglecting grave social and human rights concerns to a certain extent. They hoped that Uribe's government would make serious efforts towards improving the human rights situation inside the country, protecting civilians and reducing any abuses committed by the armed forces.

Uribe's supporters in turn believed that increased military action was a necessary prelude to any serious negotiation attempt with the guerrillas and that the increased security situation would help the government, in the long term, to focus more actively on reducing most wide-scale abuses and human rights violations on the part of both the armed groups and any rogue security forces that might have links to the paramilitaries. In short, these supporters maintained that the security situation needed to be stabilized in favor of the government before any other social concerns could take precedence. Uribe left the presidency in 2010.

In 2010 [[Juan Manuel Santos]] was elected president; he was supported by ex-president Uribe, and, in fact, he owed his election mainly through having won over former Uribe supporters. But two years after winning the presidential election, Santos (to widespread surprise) began peace talks with FARC, which took place in Havana. Re-elected in 2014, Santos revived an important infrastructure program, which in fact had been planned during the Uribe administration. Focused mainly on the provision of national highways, the program was led by former vice-president Germán Vargas Lleras.

Talks between the government and the guerrillas resulted in the announcement of a peace agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.altocomisionadoparalapaz.gov.co/mesadeconversaciones/index.html |title= Colombia's peace deals|publisher= altocomisionadoparalapaz.gov.co|accessdate= 6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a [[Colombian peace agreement referendum, 2016|referendum]] to ratify the deal was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-37537252 |title=Colombia referendum: Voters reject Farc peace deal |work=[[BBC News]] |date=3 October 2016 |accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Plebiscito 2 octubre 2016 – Boletín Nacional No. 53 |url=http://plebiscito.registraduria.gov.co/99PL/DPLZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ_L1.htm |publisher=Registraduría Nacional de Estado Civil |date=2 October 2016 |accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, the Colombian government and the FARC signed a revised [[Colombian peace process|peace deal]] in November 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-38096179 |title=Colombia signs new peace deal with Farc |date=24 November 2016 |work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the [[Colombian congress]] approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/colombian-congress-approves-historic-peace-deal/2016/11/30/9b2fda92-b5a7-11e6-939c-91749443c5e5_story.html |title= Colombia's congress approves historic peace deal with FARC rebels |date= 30 November 2016 |newspaper= Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, President Santos was awarded the [[2016 Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2016/santos-lecture_en.html|title= Nobel Lecture by Juan Manuel Santos, Oslo, 10 December 2016 |publisher= nobelprize.org|accessdate= 10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government began a process of attention and comprehensive reparation for victims of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unidadvictimas.gov.co/normatividad/LEY+DE+VICTIMAS.pdf |title=The Victims and Land Restitution Law |publisher=unidadvictimas.gov.co |accessdate=21 December 2014 |language=Spanish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925110822/http://www.unidadvictimas.gov.co/normatividad/LEY%2BDE%2BVICTIMAS.pdf |archivedate=25 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.restituciondetierras.gov.co/inicio |title= the Land Restitution Unit|publisher=restituciondetierras.gov.co |accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colombia under President Santos showed some progress in the struggle to defend human rights, as expressed by [[Human Rights Watch|HRW]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://colombiareports.co/colombia-has-improved-under-santos-human-rights-watch/ The country has improved its political climate, public debate, in all manner of things including obviously in the subject of human rights: Human Rights Watch]. colombiareports.co (12 October 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Special Jurisdiction of Peace]] was created to investigate, clarify, prosecute and punish serious human rights violations and grave breaches of [[international humanitarian law]] which occurred during the armed conflict and to satisfy victims' right to [[justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABC Jurisdicción Especial para la Paz|url=http://www.altocomisionadoparalapaz.gov.co/Documents/informes-especiales/abc-del-proceso-de-paz/abc-jurisdiccion-especial-paz.html|publisher=Oficina del Alto Comisionado para la Paz|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his visit to Colombia, [[Pope Francis]] paid tribute to the victims of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2017/09/08/pope_at_colombia_prayer_meeting_for_reconciliation_weeps_wit/1335635 |title=Pope at Colombia prayer meeting for reconciliation weeps with victims |date=2017-09-08 |website=radiovaticana.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;
