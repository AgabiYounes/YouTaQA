{{trading blocs}}
A '''customs union''' is generally defined as a type of [[trade bloc]] which is composed of a [[free trade area]] with a [[common external tariff]].&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;GATT, [https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/region_e/region_art24_e.htm Article 24], s. 8 (a)&lt;/ref&gt; Customs unions are established through [[trade pact]]s where the participant countries set up [[common external trade policy]] (in some cases they use different [[import quota]]s). Common [[competition policy]] is also helpful to avoid ''[[competition]] deficiency''.&lt;ref name=&quot;International Economics, Volume IV&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aYBoUpj4xTMC&amp;pg=PA177 | title=International Economics, Volume IV | publisher=Routledge | author=Winters, Alan L | year=1991 | pages=528 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purposes for establishing a customs union normally include increasing [[economic efficiency]] and establishing closer political and cultural ties between the member countries. It is the third stage of [[economic integration]].

Every [[economic union]], [[customs and monetary union]] and [[economic and monetary union]] includes a customs union.

== WTO Definition ==

The [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]], part of the [[World Trade Organization]] framework defines a customs union in the following way:&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

{{quote|text=(a)    A customs union shall be understood to mean the substitution of a single customs territory for two or more customs territories, so that

(i)     duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce (except, where necessary, those permitted under Articles XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV and XX) are eliminated with respect to substantially all the trade between the constituent territories of the union or at least with respect to substantially all the trade in products originating in such territories, and,

(ii)    subject to the provisions of paragraph 9, substantially the same duties and other regulations of commerce are applied by each of the members of the union to the trade of territories not included in the union;}}

Additionally, the [[List of autonomous areas by country|autonomous]] and [[dependent territory|dependent]] territories such as some of the [[Special member state territories and the European Union|EU member state special territories]] are sometimes treated as separate [[customs territory|customs territories]] from their mainland states or have varying arrangements of formal or de facto customs union, [[common market]] and [[currency union]] (or combinations thereof) with the mainland and in regards to third countries through the [[trade pact]]s signed by the mainland state.&lt;ref&gt;EU [[Overseas Countries and Territories|Overseas countries]] and some other territories participate partially in the EU single market per [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/12002E/htm/C_2002325EN.003301.html part four of the Treaty Establishing the European Community]; some EU Outermost Regions and other territories use the [[Euro]] of the [[currency union]], others are part of the [[European Union Customs Union|customs union]]; some participate in both unions and some in neither. [[Territories of the United States]], [[Australian External Territories]] and [[Realm of New Zealand]] territories share the [[Currency union|currency]] and mostly also the [[Single market|market]] of their respective mainland state, but are generally not part of its [[customs territory]].&lt;/ref&gt;
