The '''Army of the Czech Republic''' ({{lang-cs|Armáda České republiky}}, AČR), also known as the '''Czech Army''' or '''Czech Armed Forces''', is the [[military]] service responsible for the defence of the [[Czech Republic]] in compliance with international obligations and treaties on [[Collective security|collective defence]]. It is also set to support [[peacekeeping]], rescue and [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian]] operations both within the national territory and abroad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Professional Army&quot; /&gt; Armed Forces consist of the [[Staff (military)|General Staff]], the [[Czech Land Forces|Land Forces]], the [[Czech Air Force|Air Force]] and support units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organisational Structure of the General Staff of ACR|url=http://www.army.cz/en/armed-forces/organisational-structure/general-staff/organisational-structure-of-the-general-staff-114454/|website=Ministry of Defence &amp; Armed Forces of the Czech Republic|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 1940s to 1989, the extensive [[Czechoslovak People's Army]] (about 200,000) formed one of the pillars of the [[Warsaw Pact]] military alliance. After the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]], the Czech Republic is completing a major reorganisation and reduction of the armed forces, which intensified after the Czech Republic joined [[NATO]] on 12 March 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europe&quot;&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/04597222.2011.559835&quot;Military Balance in Europe 2011&quot;.], March 07, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

As defined by the [[Law of the Czech Republic|Czech Law]] No. 219/1999 Coll., the [[Armed Forces of the Czech Republic]] ({{lang-cs|ozbrojené síly České republiky}}) are the military forces of the Czech Republic. They consist of the Army of the Czech Republic, the Military Office of [[President of the Czech Republic|President of the Republic]] and the [[Prague Castle Guard|Castle Guard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Professional Army&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Armed Forces » Professional Army|url=http://www.army.cz/scripts/detail.php?id=5762|website=Ministry of Defence &amp; Armed Forces of the Czech Republic|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Czech lands ===
Military history of the [[Czechs|Czech people]] dates back to the [[Middle Ages]] and the creation of [[Duchy of Bohemia]] and [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]. During the [[Hussite Wars]], [[Jan Žižka]] became a military leader of such skill and eminence that the Hussite legacy became an important and lasting part of the Czech military traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gawdiak&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Gawdiak|editor1-first=Ihor|title=Czechoslovakia: a country study|date=1989|publisher=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress|pages=218–219|edition=3rd|url=http://www.marines.mil/News/Publications/MCPEL/Electronic-Library-Display/Article/898249/country-study-czechoslovakia/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matuška|first1=Matěj|last2=Syka|first2=Jan|title=Husitský válečník: Kdo byli boží bojovníci...|date=2015|publisher=Grada Publishing|isbn=978-80-247-5156-6|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[European wars of religion]] once again wrecked the [[Czech lands]], and at the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 1620, Czech freedom was lost to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. Throughout the centuries of foreign rule, the Czechs were subjected, at times, to intense [[Germanization]]. Nevertheless, Czechs maintained their ethnic identity and seized the opportunity for independence during [[World War I]]. Czechs and [[Slovaks]] deserted the armies of [[Austria-Hungary]] in large numbers to form the [[Czechoslovak Legion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gawdiak&quot; /&gt;

=== Czechoslovakia ===
{{Main|Czechoslovak Army|Czechoslovak People's Army}}
The [[Czechoslovak Army|Czechoslovak Armed Forces]] were originally formed on 30 June 1918 when 6,000 members of the [[Czechoslovak Legion in France]], which had been established in 1914, took oath and received a battle banner in [[Darney]], [[France]], thus preceding the official [[History of Czechoslovakia (1918–38)|declaration of Czechoslovak independence]] by four months. In Russia was more than 50 000 soldiers in legions in that time. The military achievements of the Czechoslovak legions on the [[Czechoslovak Legion in France|French]], [[Czechoslovak Legion in Italy|Italian]] and especially [[Czechoslovak Legion|Russian]] front became one of the main arguments that the Czechoslovak pro-independence leaders, especially for [[T. G. Masaryk]] in America,&lt;ref&gt;PRECLÍK, Vratislav. Masaryk a legie (Masaryk and legions), váz. kniha, 219 pages, first issue - vydalo nakladatelství Paris Karviná, Žižkova 2379 (734 01 Karviná, CZ) ve spolupráci s Masarykovým demokratickým hnutím (Masaryk Democratic Movement, Prague), 2019, {{ISBN|978-80-87173-47-3}}, pp.17 - 25, 33 - 45, 70 – 96, 100- 140, 159 – 184, 187 - 199&lt;/ref&gt;  could use to gain the support for the country's independence by the [[Allies of World War I]].

In 1938, [[Serviceman|servicemen]] of the Czechoslovak Army and the [[State Defense Guard (Czechoslovakia)|State Defense Guard]] fought in an undeclared border war against the German-backed [[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps]] as well as [[Second Polish Republic|Polish]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungarian]] paramilitary forces. As a result of the [[Munich Agreement]], areas heavily populated by ethnic [[Sudeten Germans|German speaking people]] were incorporated into the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] and military aged men living there were subject to being drafted into the [[Wehrmacht]]. Following the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia's complete annexation]] in 1939 and creation of the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], the Protectorate's government possessed its own armed force, the [[Government Army]] (6,500 men), tasked with public security and [[rearguard]] duties. On the other side of the conflict, a number of Czechoslovak units and formations served with the [[Polish Army]] ([[Czechoslovak Legion (1939)|Czechoslovak Legion]]), the [[French Army]], the [[Royal Air Force]], the [[British Army]] (the [[1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade]]), and the [[Red Army]] ([[I Corps (Czechoslovakia)|I Corps]]). Four Czech and Slovak-manned RAF squadrons were transferred to Czechoslovak control in late 1945.

From 1954&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burian|first1=Michal|last2=Rýc|first2=Jiří|date=2007|title=Historie spojovacího vojska|trans-title=History of [Czechoslovak] Signal Corps|language=Czech|location=Prague|publisher=Ministerstvo obrany – Agentura vojenských informací a služeb|isbn=978-80-7278-414-1|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 1990, the Army was known as the [[Czechoslovak People's Army]] (ČSLA).&lt;ref&gt;For more information on the Czechoslovak Army during the Cold War, see Gordon L. Rottman, ''Warsaw Pact Ground Forces'', [[Osprey Publishing]], 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ČSLA, as formed in 1945, included both Soviet- and British-equipped/trained expatriate troops, the &quot;Western&quot; soldiers had been purged from the ČSLA after 1948 when the [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948|communists took power]]. The ČSLA offered no resistance to the invasion mounted by the Soviets in 1968 in reaction to the &quot;[[Prague Spring]]&quot;, and was extensively reorganized by the Soviets following the re-imposition of communist rule in Prague.

Of the approximately 201,000 personnel on active duty in the ČSLA in 1987, about 145,000, or about 72 percent, served in the ground forces (commonly referred to as the [[army]]). About 100,000 of these were conscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress Country Study: Czechoslovakia, [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+cs0133) Ground Forces], 1987&lt;/ref&gt; There were two military districts, [[Western Military District (Czechoslovakia)|Western]] and [[Eastern Military District (Czechoslovakia)|Eastern]]. A 1989 listing of forces shows two Czechoslovak armies in the west, the [[1st Army (Czechoslovakia)|1st Army]] at [[Příbram]] with one tank division and three motor rifle divisions, the [[4th Army (Czechoslovakia)|4th Army]] at [[Písek]] with two tank divisions and two motor rifle divisions. In the Eastern Military District, there were two tank divisions, the [[13th Tank Division (Czechoslovakia)|13th]] and [[14th Tank Division (Czechoslovakia)|14th]], with a supervisory headquarters at [[Trenčín]] in the Slovak part of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Orbat.com, [http://www.orbat.com/site/history/historical/nato/warsawpact.html Warsaw Pact Order of Battle 1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230623/http://www.orbat.com/site/history/historical/nato/warsawpact.html |date=2016-03-03 }}, accessed 2 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cold War]], the ČSLA was equipped primarily with Soviet arms, although certain arms like the [[OT-64 SKOT]] armored personnel carrier, the [[L-29|L-29 ''Delfín'']] and [[Aero L-39 Albatros|L-39 ''Albatros'']] aircraft, the [[P-27 (weapon)|P-27 ''Pancéřovka'']] antitank rocket launcher, the [[vz. 58]] assault rifle or the [[Uk vz. 59]] machine gun were of Czechoslovak design.

===After 1992 (dissolution of Czechoslovakia)===

The Army of the Czech Republic was formed after the Czechoslovak Armed Forces split after the 1 January 1993 dissolution of [[Czechoslovakia]]. Czech forces stood at 90,000 in 1993. They were reduced to around 65,000 in 11 combat brigades and the Air Force in 1997, to 63,601 in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenceandstrategy.eu/filemanager/files/file.php?file=6406|title=Starting points for professionalization of the armed forces|language=Czech|year=2000|accessdate=2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to 35,000 in 2005. At the same time, the forces were modernized and reoriented towards a defensive posture. In 2004, the army transformed itself into a fully professional organization and compulsory military service was abolished. The Army maintains an active reserve.

The [[Czech Republic]] is a member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]].  At the [[1999 Washington summit]], the Czech Republic joined [[Enlargement of NATO#Vilnius Group|NATO]]. Since 1990, the ACR and the Czech Armed Forces have contributed to numerous peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, including [[IFOR]], [[SFOR]], and [[EUFOR Althea]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Desert Shield]]/[[Desert Storm]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Kosovo]], [[Albania]], [[Turkey]], [[Pakistan]] and with the Coalition forces in [[Iraq]].

==Structure==
Many of the duties of the [[President of the Czech Republic]] can be said to be ceremonial to one degree or another, especially since the President has relatively few powers independent of the will of the [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic|Prime Minister]]. One of those is the status as [[commander in chief]] of the military; no part of these duties can take place but through the assent of the Prime Minister. In matters of war, he is in every sense merely a [[figurehead]], since the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|Constitution]] gives all substantive constitutional authority over the use of the armed forces to the [[Parliament of the Czech Republic|Parliament]].&lt;ref name=Forty3&gt;Constitution of the Czech Republic, Art. 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thirty9&gt;Constitution of the Czech Republic, Art. 39&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the only specific thing the constitution allows the President to do with respect to the military is to appoint its generals{{spaced ndash}}but even this must be done with the signature of the Prime Minister.&lt;ref name=Sixty3&gt;Constitution of the Czech Republic, Art. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

The 153rd Engineer Battalion based in Olomouc was created on 15 October 2008 and is subordinated to the 15th Engineer Regiment. The unit is stationed in the outskirts of the city of Olomouc, in place of the canceled 156th Rescue Battalion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.153zpr.army.cz - webové stránky praporu www.153zpr.army.cz&lt;/ref&gt;

===Active reserves===
'''Active Reserve''' (in [[Czech language|Czech]] ''Aktivní záloha'') is a part of the otherwise professional Army of the Czech Republic. This service was created to allow the participation of citizens with a positive attitude to the military.

A volunteer needs either to have completed the compulsory military service (which ended in 2004) or to attend 6 week training. Then the reservists have to serve up to three weeks a year and can be called up to serve two weeks during a non-military crisis. They are not intended to serve abroad. The Reserve presents itself on events like [[BAHNA]], a military show.

==Equipment==
{{Main|Military equipment of the Czech Republic}}
The Army of the Czech Republic is, to a large extent, using inventory dating back to the times of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. During the [[Cold War]], Czechoslovakia was a major supplier of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, military trucks and trainer aircraft – the bulk of military exports went to its [[Comecon]] partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiss|first1=Yudit|title=The Defence Industry in East-Central Europe: Restructuring and Conversion|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-829280-7|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Replacement of the obsolete equipment, or making it at least compliant with the [[NATO]] standards, is urgently required. Modernization plans include acquisition of new multi-role helicopters, transport aircraft, infantry fighting vehicles or air defence radars and missiles. If possible, the Czech Ministry of Defence selects products that are manufactured or co-produced in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sabak|first1=Juliusz|title=Czech Republic Doubles Its Defence Expenditure. &quot;Modernization, More Troops, New Units&quot;|url=http://www.defence24.com/298176,czech-republic-doubles-its-defence-expenditure-modernization-more-troops-new-units|website=Defence24|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes firearms of the [[Česká zbrojovka Uherský Brod]], namely the [[CZ 75]] pistols, [[CZ Scorpion Evo 3]] submachine guns, [[CZ 805 BREN]] and [[CZ 805 BREN#CZ BREN 2|BREN 2]] assault rifles. Moreover, the Czech Army is equipped with about 3000 [[Tatra 810|T810]] and [[Tatra 815|T815]] vehicles of various modifications produced by the Czech [[Tatra (company)|Tatra Trucks]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Casey|first1=Nuala|last2=Holeček|first2=Oldřich|title=Minister of Defence receives shipment of Tatra trucks|url=http://www.army.cz/en/ministry-of-defence/newsroom/news/minister-of-defence-receives-shipment-of-tatra-trucks-129729/|website=Ministry of Defence|publisher=Ministerstvo obrany|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tatra Defence Vehicle factory ensures licensed production of [[Pandur II]] and [[Nexter Titus|Titus]] armoured vehicles. Aircraft such as the [[Aero L-39 Albatros]], [[Aero L-159 Alca]] and [[Let L-410 Turbolet]] have been produced domestically as well.

At the beginning of 2019 Czech Ministry of Defence announced its modernization program consisting of acquiring 210 new modern IFVs as a replacement for aging [[BMP-2|BVP-2]]. MoD approached four manufacturers: [[BAE Systems]] ([[Combat Vehicle 90 (CV90)|CV90]]), [[General Dynamics|GDELS]] ([[ASCOD]]), [[Rheinmetall]] ([[Lynx (Rheinmetall armoured fighting vehicle)|Lynx]]) and PSM ([[Puma (IFV)|Puma]]). Cost of the program should exceed 50 billions [[Czech crown|CZK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ministerstvo obrany podepsalo s VOP CZ memorandum o spolupráci v projektu největší armádní zakázky v |url=https://www.armadninoviny.cz/ministerstvo-obrany-podepsalo-s-vop-cz-memorandum-o-spolupraci-v-projektu-nejvetsi-armadni-zakazky-v-novodobe-historii.html |website=armadninoviny.cz |accessdate=1 February 2019 |language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt;
