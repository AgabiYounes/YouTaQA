'''County Fermanagh''' ({{IPAc-en|f|ər|ˈ|m|æ|n|ə}} {{respell|fər|MAN|ə}}; {{Irish derived place name|Fir Manach or Fear Manach|men of Manach}}) is one of the six [[counties of Northern Ireland]] and one of the traditional thirty-two [[counties of Ireland]]. The county covers an area of 1,691&amp;nbsp;km² (653 sq mi) and has a population of 61,805 as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fermanagh.gov.uk/statistics.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708132321/https://www.fermanagh.gov.uk/statistics.html |archivedate=8 July 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enniskillen]] is the county town and largest in both size and population.

Fermanagh is one of four counties of Northern Ireland to have a majority of its population from a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] background, according to the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]].  Unusually for an area of Northern Ireland, there are few Presbyterians in Fermanagh.  Most Protestants are members of the Church of Ireland and there is also a Methodist community.&lt;ref&gt;http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/ni/religion.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Cuilcagh Stairway.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Cuilcagh]] range, on the Cavan/Fermanagh border.]]
[[File:Lower Lough Erne - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|Lower [[Lough Erne]]]]
Fermanagh is by far the least populous of Northern's Ireland's six counties, with just over one-third of the population of Northern Ireland's second least populous county, [[County Armagh|Armagh]]. It is the second smallest county in Northern Ireland by area and is ranked 25th in Ireland by size. Fermanagh borders [[County Tyrone]] to the north-east, [[County Monaghan]] to the south-east, [[County Cavan]] to the south-west, [[County Leitrim]] to the west and [[County Donegal]] to the north-west. The county town, Enniskillen, is the largest settlement in Fermanagh, situated in the middle of the county.

It is mainly rural, with a population density of 36.1 people per km2, and is situated largely in the basin of the [[River Erne]]. It is dominated by two connected lakes: Upper and Lower [[Lough Erne]], and, including water, spans an area of 1,851&amp;nbsp;km² (715&amp;nbsp;sq;&amp;nbsp;mi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/County+Fermanagh |title=County Fermanagh - definition of County Fermanagh by The Free Dictionary |website=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is approximately {{convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Belfast]] and {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Dublin]].

In the [[Köppen climate classification]], Fermanagh experiences a [[temperate]] [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb''') with cool winters, mild humid summers, and a lack of temperature extremes. Fermanagh accounts for 13.2% of the land mass of Northern Ireland and 30% of Fermanagh is covered with lakes and waterways. With 24,000 hectares of forest cover, or approximately 14% of total land area, Fermanagh is well above both the UK and Irish national averages. Due to its expansive lakelands and scenic rural countryside, much of the county is set to be designated an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]].

===Geology===
The county is situated over a sequence of prominent faults, primarily the [[Killadeas – Seskinore Fault]], the [[Tempo – Sixmilecross Fault]], the [[Belcoo Fault]] and the [[Clogher Valley Fault]] which cross-cuts Lough Erne. To the north of Lough Erne, the oldest rocks in the county are found. These are [[red beds]] that were formed approximately 550 million years ago. In eastern Fermanagh there are extensive [[sandstones]] that were laid down during the Devonian, 400 million years ago. Much of the rest of the county's bedrock geology dates from the [[Carboniferous]], 354 to 298 million years ago. These rocks are primarily marine muds, shales and [[limestones]], which have produced extensive cave systems such as the [[Shannon Cave]], the [[Marble Arch Caves]] and the [[Caves of the Tullybrack and Belmore hills]]. These carboniferous shales aggregate across several counties in the northwest of Ireland - known colloquially as the [[Lough Allen]] basin - and are estimated to contain 9.4 trillion cubic metres of [[natural gas]], equivalent to 1.5 billion [[Barrel (unit)|barrels of oil]] (approximately $115 billion at 2018 prices).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irishtimes.com/news/what-s-your-fracking-problem-1.594199 The Irish Times, 2011 - &quot;What's your fracking problem?&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The county has three prominent upland areas, the expansive [[Knockmore|West Fermanagh Scarplands]] to the southwest of Lough Erne, which rise to some 350m, the [[Sliabh Beagh]] hills to the east on the Monaghan border, and the Cuilcagh mountain range along Fermanagh's southern border, which contain [[Cuilcagh]], the county's highest point, at 665m.

==History==
The Menapii are the only known Celtic tribe specifically named on [[Ptolemy]]’s 150 AD map of [[Ireland]], where they located their first colony—Menapia—on the [[Leinster]] coast circa 216 BC. They later settled around [[Lough Erne]], becoming known as the Fir Manach, and giving their name to [[Fermanagh]] and [[Monaghan]]. [[Mongán mac Fiachnai]], a 7th-century King of [[Ulster]], is the protagonist of several legends linking him with [[Manannán mac Lir]]. They spread across [[Ireland]], evolving into historic Irish (also Scottish and Manx) clans.

The [[Annals of Ulster]] which cover medieval Ireland between AD 431 to AD 1540 were written at Belle Isle on [[Lough Erne]] near [[Lisbellaw]].

Fermanagh was a stronghold of the [[Maguire of Fermanagh|Maguire clan]] and Donn Carrach Maguire (died 1302) was the first of the chiefs of the Maguire dynasty. However, on the confiscation of lands relating to [[Hugh Maguire (Lord of Fermanagh)|Hugh Maguire]], Fermanagh was divided in similar manner to the other five escheated counties among Scottish and English undertakers and native Irish. The baronies of [[Knockninny]] and [[Magheraboy]] were allotted to Scottish undertakers, those of [[Clankelly]], [[Magherastephana]] and [[Lurg]] to English undertakers and those of [[Clanawley]], [[Coole (barony)|Coole]], and [[Tirkennedy|Tyrkennedy]], to servitors and natives. The chief families to benefit under the new settlement were the families of Cole, Blennerhasset, Butler, Hume, and Dunbar.

Fermanagh was made into a county by statute of Elizabeth I, but it was not until the time of the [[Plantation of Ulster]] that it was finally brought under civil government.

The closure of all the lines of [[Great Northern Railway (Ireland)]] within County Fermanagh in 1957 left the county as the first non-island county in the UK without a railway service.

The county was administered by [[Fermanagh County Council]] from 1899 until the abolition of county councils in Northern Ireland in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/apni/1972/9/contents|title=Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972|publisher=Legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=29 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the creation of Northern Ireland's district councils, [[Fermanagh District Council]] the only one of the 26 that contained all of the county from which it derived its name. After the re-organisation of local government in 2015, Fermanagh was still the only county wholly within one council area, namely [[Fermanagh and Omagh District Council]], albeit that it constituted only a part of that entity.

For the purposes of elections to the UK Parliament, the territory of Fermanagh is part of the [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and South Tyrone Parliamentary Constituency]]. This constituency elected [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] [[hunger strike|hunger-striker]] [[Bobby Sands]] as a member of parliament in the [[April 1981 Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election]], shortly before his death.

==Industry and tourism==
Agriculture and tourism are two of the most important industries in Fermanagh. The main types of farming in the area are beef, dairy, sheep, pigs and some poultry. Most of the agricultural land is used as grassland for grazing and silage or hay rather than for other crops.

The waterways are extensively used by cabin cruisers, other small pleasure craft and anglers. The main town of Fermanagh is [[Enniskillen]] ({{lang|ga|Inis Ceithleann}}, 'Ceithleann's island'). The island town hosts a range of attractions including the [[Castle Coole]] Estate and [[Enniskillen Castle]], which is home to the museum of The [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]] and the [[5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards]]. Fermanagh is also home to The Boatyard Distillery, a distillery producing [[gin]].

==Railways==
The railway lines in County Fermanagh connected [[Enniskillen railway station]] with Derry from 1854, [[Dundalk]] from 1861, [[Bundoran]] from 1868 and [[Sligo]] from 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hajducki |first=S.

The railway companies that served the county, prior to the establishment by merger of [[Londonderry and Enniskillen Railway]], [[Enniskillen and Bundoran Railway]] the [[Dundalk and Enniskillen Railway]] which was later named the  [[Irish North Western Railway]], thus forming the [[Great Northern Railway (Ireland)]].
