{{Politics of the Czech Republic}}
[[File:Diplomatic missions of the Czech Republic.png|thumbnail|right|Embassies (not consulates) of the Czech Republic in the world.]]
The '''Czech Republic''' is a Central European country, a member of the [[European Union]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OSCE), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO]]), the [[United Nations]] (and all of its main specialized agencies and boards). It entertains diplomatic relations with 191 countries of the world, around half of which maintain a resident [[embassy]] in the Czech capital city, Prague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mzv.cz/file/955338/The_Czech_Republic_s_Foreign_Policy_in_2011___A_Brief_Overview.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Czech Republic’s Foreign Policy in 2011 : A Brief Overview |website=Mzv.cz |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the years 1948-1989, the foreign policy of [[Czechoslovakia]] had followed that of the [[Soviet Union]]. Since the revolution and the subsequent mutually-agreed [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|peaceful dissolution]] of Czechoslovakia into the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], the [[Czechs]] have made reintegration with Western institutions their chief foreign policy objective. This goal was rapidly met with great success, as the nation joined [[NATO]] in 1999 and the European Union in 2004, and held the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency of the European Union]] during the first half of 2009.

==International disputes==
===Liechtenstein===
Throughout the past decades, Liechtenstein continuously claimed restitution for {{convert|1600|km2|abbr=on}}, or an area roughly ten times the size of Liechtenstein, of land currently located in the Czech Republic. The land was partially confiscated from the Liechtenstein family in 1918 with the rest of the property being confiscated in 1945 after the expulsion of Germans and confiscation of German property. The Czech Republic insisted that it could not acknowledge or be responsible for claims going back to before February 1948, when the Communists had seized power.

As a result, Liechtenstein did not diplomatically recognize the existence of the Czech Republic as a new state (and, for that matter, also that of the Slovak Republic) until 2009.

In July 2009, the Prince of Liechtenstein announced he was resigning to the previous unsuccessful claims to property located in the Czech Republic, and on 13 July 2009, after politically recognizing one another, the Czech Republic and Liechtenstein formally established diplomatic relations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liechtenstein1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Liechtenstein and the Czech Republic establish diplomatic relations |url=http://88.82.102.51/fileadmin/_pm.liechtenstein.li/en/090713_PM_Beziehungen_CzFl_en.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Government Spokesperson's Office, the Principality of Liechtenstein |date=13 July 2009 |accessdate=6 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511222932/http://88.82.102.51/fileadmin/_pm.liechtenstein.li/en/090713_PM_Beziehungen_CzFl_en.pdf |archivedate=11 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Liechtenstein2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Navázání diplomatických styků České republiky s Knížectvím Lichtenštejnsko |url=http://www.mzv.cz/jnp/cz/udalosti_a_media/prohlaseni_a_stanoviska/x2009_07_13_lilchtejnstejnsko_navazani_diplomatickych_vztahu.html |publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Czech Republic)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic]] |language=Czech |date=13 July 2009 |accessdate=13 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213011215/http://www.mzv.cz/jnp/cz/udalosti_a_media/prohlaseni_a_stanoviska/x2009_07_13_lilchtejnstejnsko_navazani_diplomatickych_vztahu.html |archivedate=13 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Placement of US National Missile Defense base==
In February 2007, the US started formal negotiations with Czech Republic and Poland concerning construction of missile shield installations in those countries for a [[Ground-based Midcourse Defense]] System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6704669.stm | title = Europe diary: Missile defence |work=BBC News | date = 31 May 2007 | first = Mark | last = Mardell | authorlink = Mark Mardell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government of the Czech Republic agrees (while 67% Czechs disagree and only about 22% support it)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url=http://www.cvvm.cas.cz/upl/zpravy/100761s_pm80306.pdf |trans-title=Citizens on U.S. Anti-Missile Radar Base in Czech Republic |title=Občané o americké radarové základně v ČR |format=PDF |language=Czech |publisher=Centrum pro výzkum veřejného mínění |date=6 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081130053315/http://www.cvvm.cas.cz/upl/zpravy/100761s_pm80306.pdf |archivedate=30 November 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; to host a missile defense radar on its territory while a base of missile interceptors is supposed to be built in Poland. The objective is reportedly to protect another parts of US National Missile Defense from long-range missile strikes from Iran and North Korea, but Czech PM [[Mirek Topolánek]] said the main reason is to avoid Russian influence and strengthen ties to US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ods.cz/akce/kongresy/18.kongres/projev.php?ID=721&amp;podsekce=532 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531075236/http://www.ods.cz/akce/kongresy/18.kongres/projev.php?ID=721&amp;podsekce=532 | archivedate = 31 May 2008 | publisher=[[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]] | first = Mirek | last = Topolánek | authorlink = Mirek Topolánek | title = 18.

The main government supporter [[Alexandr Vondra]], Deputy Prime Minister for European affairs, used to be an ambassador to the USA. More problematic is that between 2004 and 2006 he was an executive director of a lobbying company Dutko Worldwide Prague. Dutko's and its strategic partner AMI Communications (PR company) customers are Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Nortrop Grumman, which are largest contractors for NMD development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nenasili.cz/cs/2026_kdo-prosazuje-radar-v-cr | title = Kdo prosazuje radar v ČR? | publisher = Hnutí Nenásilí | date = 16 October 2008 | language = Czech | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100528062322/http://www.nenasili.cz/cs/2026_kdo-prosazuje-radar-v-cr | archivedate = 28 May 2010 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.greenpeace.org/czech/protiraketova-obrana/protiraketova_lobby | title = Protiraketová lobby v USA a České republice | publisher = [[Greenpeace]] | language = Czech | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081228205918/http://www.greenpeace.org/czech/protiraketova-obrana/protiraketova_lobby | archivedate = 28 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; AMI Communications also received (without a formal selection procedure) a government contract to persuade Czechs to support US radar base.

The government of Czechoslovakia recognised independence of Israel 5 days after its declaration on 19 May 1948. Diplomatic relations between both countries were established on 3 July 1948. Czechoslovakia [[Arms shipments from Czechoslovakia to Israel 1947–1949|supported with military aircraft and weapons]] [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|newly created]] Israeli state for several months, however then-new communist government ceased this support and in few years even the diplomatic relations were broken. Communist regime did spread anti-Israeli [[propaganda]], like all then socialist countries. After the [[Velvet revolution]], the relations were renewed. The Czech Republic has an embassy in [[Tel Aviv]] and 4 honorary consulates (in [[Eilat]], [[Haifa]], [[Jerusalem]] and [[Ramat Gan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mzv.cz/telaviv/en/index.html |title=Czech embassy in Tel Aviv |publisher=Mzv.cz |date= |accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel has an embassy in Prague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prague.mfa.gov.il/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820161945/http://prague.mfa.gov.il/ |archivedate=20 August 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
