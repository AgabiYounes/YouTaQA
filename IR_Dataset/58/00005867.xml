'''Continental''' or '''mainland Europe''' is the contiguous [[continent]] of [[Europe]], excluding its surrounding islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite dictionary |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com-archive-datasets.eu/dictionary/europe |dictionary=[[Merriam Webster Dictionary]] |title=Europe |access-date=5 May 2019 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140422145420/http://www.merriam-webster.com-archive-datasets.eu/dictionary/europe |archive-date=April 22, 2014 |url-status=dead |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be referred to ambiguously as the '''European continent''' – which can conversely mean the whole of Europe – and by some, simply '''the Continent'''.

The most common definition of continental Europe excludes [[Island#Continental islands|continental islands]], encompassing the [[list of islands of Greece|Greek Islands]], [[Cyprus]], [[Malta]], [[Sicily]], [[Sardinia]], [[Corsica]], the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]] and surrounding islands, [[Novaya Zemlya]] and the Nordic archipelago, as well as nearby [[Island#Oceanic islands|oceanic islands]], including the [[Canary Islands]], [[Madeira]], the [[Azores]], [[Iceland]], the [[Faroe Islands]], and [[Svalbard]].

The [[Scandinavian Peninsula]] is sometimes also excluded, as even though it is technically part of &quot;mainland Europe&quot;, the ''[[de facto]]''  connections to the rest of the continent are across the [[Baltic Sea]] or [[North Sea]] (rather than via the lengthy land route that involves travelling to the north of the peninsula where it meets Finland, and then south through north-east Europe).

The old notion of [[Europe]] as a cultural and European unification term was centred on '''core Europe''' (''Kerneuropa''), the continental territory of the  historical [[Carolingian Empire]], corresponding to modern [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]] (or [[geographical distribution of German speakers|German-speaking Europe]]) and the [[Benelux]] states (historical [[Austrasia]]).

[[File:Francia 814.svg|thumb|Extent of Carolingian Europe]]

This historical core of &quot;Carolingian Europe&quot; was consciously invoked in the 1950s as the historical ethno-cultural basis for the prospective [[European integration]] (see also [[Multi-speed Europe]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Marc |last=Trachtenberg |author-link=Marc Trachtenberg |title=Between Empire and Alliance: America and Europe During the Cold War |year=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yltz0aCPaM4C&amp;pg=PA67 |page=67 |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |isbn=9780742521773 |editor-first=Francis J. |editor-last=Gavin |editor-link=Francis J.

==Use==
===Great Britain and Ireland===
In both [[Great Britain]] and Ireland, ''the Continent'' is widely and generally used to refer to the mainland of Europe. An amusing British newspaper headline supposedly once read, &quot;Fog in [[English Channel|Channel]]; Continent Cut Off&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/04/19/oakley.blog.dayten/index.html |title=Europe no star as election issue |publisher=CNN |first=Robin |last=Oakley |date=April 19, 2005 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been claimed that this was a regular weather forecast in Britain in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fog in Channel?: Exploring Britain's Relationship with Europe|first=search|last=results|editor-first=Tom|editor-last=Sykes|date=September 2, 2009|publisher=Shoehorn Publishing|id= {{ASIN|1907149066|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the word ''Europe'' itself is also regularly used to mean Europe excluding the islands of Great Britain, Iceland, and Ireland (although the term is often used to refer to the [[European Union]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-14525705 |title=Britain pushes hard choices for Europe's hard core |work=BBC News |first=Douglas |last=Fraser |date=August 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The term ''mainland Europe'' is also sometimes used. Usage may reflect political or cultural allegiances. Pro-European UK citizens are much less likely to use &quot;Europe&quot; in ways that exclude the UK and Ireland.

Derivatively, the adjective ''continental'' refers to the social practices or fashion of continental Europe. Examples include  [[continental breakfast|breakfast]], topless sunbathing and, historically, long-range driving (before Britain had [[motorways]]) often known as [[Grand tourer|''Grand Touring'']].{{citation needed|date = April 2012}} Differences include electrical plugs, time zones for the most part, the use of [[Right- and left-hand traffic|left-hand traffic]], and for the United Kingdom, currency and the continued use of imperial units alongside metric.

Britain is physically connected to continental Europe through the undersea [[Channel Tunnel]] (the longest undersea tunnel in the world), which accommodates both the [[Getlink]] (passenger and vehicle use – vehicle required) and [[Eurostar]] (passenger use only) services. These services were established to transport passengers and vehicles through the tunnel on a 24/7 basis between [[England]] and continental Europe, while still maintaining passport and immigration control measures on both sides of the tunnel. This route is popular with refugees and migrants seeking to enter the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-33709244|title=France boosts Calais tunnel security|date=July 29, 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scandinavia===
[[File:Ptolemaios 1467 Scandinavia.jpg|thumb|Map of the Scandiae islands by [[Nicolaus Germanus]] for a 1467 publication of ''Cosmographia Claudii Ptolomaei Alexandrini''.]]
Especially in [[Germanic studies]], ''continental'' refers to the European continent excluding the [[Scandinavian peninsula]], Britain, Ireland, and Iceland. The reason for this is that although the Scandinavian peninsula is attached to continental Europe, and accessible via a land route along the [[66th parallel north]], it is usually reached by sea.

{{lang|sw|Kontinenten}} (&quot;the Continent&quot;) is a vernacular Swedish expression that refers to an area excluding Sweden, Norway, and Finland but including Denmark (even the [[Danish archipelago]] which is technically not a part of continental Europe) and the rest of continental Europe. In Norway, similarly, one speaks about {{lang|no|Kontinentet}} as a separate entity. In Denmark, Jutland is referred to as the mainland and thereby a part of continental Europe.

The Scandinavian peninsula is now connected to the Danish mainland (the [[Jutland]] peninsula) by several bridges and tunnels.

==Mediterranean and Atlantic islands==
''The Continent'' may sometimes refer to the continental part of [[Italy]] (excluding [[Sardinia]], [[Sicily]], etc.), the continental part of [[Spain]] (excluding the [[Balearic islands]], the [[Canary Islands]], [[Alboran]], etc.), the continental part of France (excluding [[Corsica]], etc.), the continental part of Portugal (excluding the [[Madeira Islands|Madeira]] and [[Azores]] islands), or the continental part of Greece (excluding the [[Ionian Islands]], the [[Aegean Islands]], and [[Crete]]). The term is used from the perspective of the island residents of each country to describe the continental portion of their country or the continent (or mainland) as a whole.

Continental France is also known as ''l'Hexagone'', &quot;the Hexagon&quot;, referring to its approximate shape on a map.
