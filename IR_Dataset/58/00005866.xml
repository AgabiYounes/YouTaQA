The '''Council of the European Union''', often referred to in the treaties and other official documents simply as the '''Council'''{{efn|In the treaties and legislative documents, the institution is referred to simply as &quot;the Council&quot;,{{Citation needed span|date=June 2018|text=though &quot;Council of the European Union&quot; is increasingly used in explanatory documents.}}{{Citation needed span|date=June 2018|text=The pre-1993 term &quot;Council of Ministers&quot; may sometimes still be used informally.}} The Latin word ''{{Lang|la|consilium}}'' is also found as a &quot;language-neutral&quot; name in signage, website names, etc.}} and informally known as '''Council of Ministers''', is the third of the seven [[Institutions of the European Union]] (EU) as listed in the [[Treaty on European Union]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eur-lex.europa.eu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C:2016:202:TOC|title=EUR-Lex - C:2016:202:TOC - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of two [[legislature of the European Union|legislative bodies]] and together with the [[European Parliament]] serves to amend and approve the proposals of the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/about-parliament/en/powers-and-procedures/legislative-powers|work=European Parliament|title=Legislative powers|accessdate=13 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Library of European Parliament&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2013/130619/LDM_BRI(2013)130619_REV2_EN.pdf|work=Library of the European Parliament|title=Parliament's legislative initiative|date=24 October 2013|accessdate=13 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-making-process/planning-and-proposing-law_en|work=European Commission|title=Planning and proposing law|date=20 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Council of the European Union and the [[European Council]] are the only [[Institutions of the European Union|EU institutions]] that are explicitly [[intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]], that is forums whose attendees express and represent the position of their member state's [[Executive (government)|executive]], be they ambassadors, ministers or heads of state/government.

The Council meets in 10 different configurations of {{EUnum}} [[Minister (government)|national ministers]] (one per [[Member state of the European Union|state]]). The precise membership of these configurations varies according to the topic under consideration; for example, when discussing [[Common Agricultural Policy|agricultural policy]] the Council is formed by the {{EUnum}} national ministers whose portfolio includes this policy area (with the related [[European Commissioner]]s contributing but not voting).

== Composition ==
The [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency]] of the Council rotates every six months among the governments of EU member states, with the relevant ministers of the respective country holding the Presidency at any given time ensuring the smooth running of the meetings and setting the daily agenda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Consilium - Council&quot;/&gt; The continuity between presidencies is provided by an arrangement under which three successive presidencies, known as ''Presidency trios'', share common political programmes. The [[Foreign Affairs Council]] (national foreign ministers) is however chaired by the Union's [[High Representative]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Const Info&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=The Union's institutions: The Council of Ministers|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/constitution/council_en.htm|doi=|accessdate=1 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its decisions are made by [[qualified majority voting]] in most areas, unanimity in others, or just simple majority for procedural issues. Usually where it operates unanimously, it only needs to consult the Parliament. However, in most areas the [[ordinary legislative procedure]] applies meaning both Council and Parliament share legislative and budgetary powers equally, meaning both have to agree for a proposal to pass. In a few limited areas the Council may initiate new [[European Union law|EU law]] itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Consilium - Council&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|title = Council of the European Union|url=https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/institutions-bodies/council-eu_en|accessdate = 19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union]], also known as ''Council Secretariat'', assists the Council of the European Union, the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]], the [[European Council]] and the [[President of the European Council]]. The Secretariat is headed by the [[Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union]]. The Secretariat is divided into seven [[list of directorates-general of the Council of the European Union|directorates-general]], each administered by a [[director-general]].

== History ==
{{Further information|History of the European Union}}

The Council first appeared in the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC) as the &quot;Special Council of Ministers&quot;, set up to counterbalance the High Authority (the supranational executive, now the Commission). The original Council had limited powers: issues relating only to coal and steel were in the Authority's domain, and the Council's consent was only required on decisions outside coal and steel. As a whole, the Council only scrutinised the [[High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community|High Authority]] (the executive). In 1957, the [[Treaties of Rome]] established two new communities, and with them two new Councils: the Council of the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (EAEC) and the Council of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC). However, due to objections over the supranational power of the Authority, their Councils had more powers; the new executive bodies were known as &quot;Commissions&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ENA history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[European NAvigator]]|title = Council of the European Union|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&amp;doc=5604|accessdate = 24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 the Council was hit by the &quot;empty chair crisis&quot;. Due to disagreements between [[French President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]] and the Commission's agriculture proposals, among other things, France boycotted all meetings of the Council. This halted the Council's work until the impasse was resolved the following year by the [[Luxembourg compromise]]. Although initiated by a gamble of the President of the Commission, [[Walter Hallstein]], who later on lost the Presidency, the crisis exposed flaws in the Council's workings.&lt;ref name=&quot;LSE Chair&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Ludlow|first=N|year=2006|publisher=[[London School of Economics]]|title = De-commissioning the Empty Chair Crisis : the Community institutions and the crisis of 1965–6|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2422/01/Decommisioningempty.pdf|accessdate = 24 September 2007|format=PDF|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071025203706/http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2422/01/Decommisioningempty.pdf |archivedate = 25 October 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Merger Treaty]] of 1967, the ECSC's Special Council of Ministers and the Council of the EAEC (together with their other independent institutions) were merged into the '''Council of the EEC''', which would act as a single Council of the [[European Communities]]. In 1993, the Council adopted the name 'Council of the European Union', following the establishment of the European Union by the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. That treaty strengthened the Council, with the addition of more intergovernmental elements in the [[Three pillars of the European Union|three pillars]] system. However, at the same time the Parliament and Commission had been strengthened inside the [[European Community|Community pillar]], curtailing the ability of the Council to act independently.&lt;ref name=&quot;ENA history&quot;/&gt;

The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] abolished the pillar system and gave further powers to Parliament. It also merged the Council's [[High Representative]] with the [[European Commissioner for External Relations|Commission's foreign policy head]], with this new figure chairing the foreign affairs Council rather than the rotating presidency. The [[European Council]] was declared a separate institution from the Council, also chaired by a permanent president, and the different Council configurations were mentioned in the treaties for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Const Info&quot;/&gt;

The development of the Council has been characterised by the rise in power of the Parliament, with which the Council has had to share its legislative powers. The Parliament has often provided opposition to the Council's wishes. This has in some cases led to clashes between both bodies with the Council's system of intergovernmentalism contradicting the developing parliamentary system and supranational principles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoskyns&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Hoskyns | first = Catherine |author2=Michael Newman | title = Democratizing the European Union: Issues for the twenty-first Century (Perspectives on Democratization | publisher = [[Manchester University Press]] | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-7190-5666-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Powers and functions ==
The primary purpose of the Council is to act as one of two vetoing bodies of the [[Legislature of the European Union|EU's legislative branch]], the other being the [[European Parliament]]. Together they serve to amend, approve or disapprove the proposals of the [[European Commission]], which has the sole power to propose laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/about-parliament/en/powers-and-procedures/legislative-powers|work=European Parliament|title=Legislative powers|accessdate=13 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-making-process/planning-and-proposing-law_en|work=European Commission|title=Planning and proposing law|date=20 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jointly with the Parliament, the Council holds the budgetary power of the Union and has greater control than the Parliament over the more intergovernmental areas of the EU, such as foreign policy and macroeconomic co-ordination. Finally, before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, it formally held the executive power of the EU which it conferred upon the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Legislative power&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|title=Legislative power|url = http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=46&amp;pageRank=2&amp;language=EN|accessdate = 11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Treaty&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|title = Treaty on the European Union (Nice consolidated version)|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/ce321/ce32120061229en00010331.pdf|accessdate = 24 June 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered by some to be equivalent to  an [[upper house]] of the EU legislature, although it's not described as such in the treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=A.

=== Legislative procedure ===
{{Main article|European Union legislative procedure}}
[[File:Ordinary legislative procedure majorityrules.svg|thumb|300px|Simplified illustration of the voting rules that apply within the ordinary legislative procedure. The actual procedure involves various stages of consultations aimed at achieving compromise between the positions of the two legislative chambers.]]
The EU's legislative authority is divided between the Council, the Parliament and the Commission. As the relationships and powers of these institutions have developed, various legislative procedures have been created for adopting laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;Legislative power&quot;/&gt; In early times, the ''avis facultatif'' maxim was: &quot;The Commission proposes, and the Council disposes&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/highlights/en/103.html|title=News - Archives - Highlights - Codecision and other procedures|website=www.europarl.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; but now the vast majority of laws are now subject to the [[ordinary legislative procedure]], which works on the principle that consent from both the Council and Parliament are required before a law may be adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = The Codecision Procedure|url=http://ec.europa.eu/codecision/procedure/index_en.htm|accessdate = 11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this procedure, the Commission presents a proposal to Parliament and the Council. Following its first [[Reading (legislature)|reading]] the Parliament may propose amendments. If the Council accepts these amendments then the legislation is approved. If it does not then it adopts a &quot;common position&quot; and submits that new version to the Parliament. At its second reading, if the Parliament approves the text or does not act, the text is adopted, otherwise the Parliament may propose further amendments to the Council's proposal. It may be rejected out right by an [[absolute majority]] of MEPs. If the Council still does not approve the Parliament's position, then the text is taken to a &quot;Conciliation Committee&quot; composed of the Council members plus an equal number of MEPs. If a Committee manages to adopt a joint text, it then has to be approved in a third reading by both the Council and Parliament or the proposal is abandoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parliament's powers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Codecision procedure|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=46&amp;pageRank=4&amp;language=EN|accessdate = 12 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The few other areas that operate the ''special legislative procedures'' are justice &amp; home affairs, budget and taxation and certain aspects of other policy areas: such as the fiscal aspects of environmental policy. In these areas, the Council or Parliament decide law alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;lisbon explain&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;decision making&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Decision-making in the European Union|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://www.europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|accessdate=18 September 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011040316/http://europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|archivedate=11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure used also depends upon which type of [[European Union law#Legislation|institutional act]] is being used. The strongest act is a [[Regulation (European Union)|regulation]], an [[Act of Parliament|act]] or [[Statutory law|law]] which is directly applicable in its entirety. Then there are [[Directive (European Union)|directives]] which bind members to certain goals which they must achieve, but they do this through their own laws and hence have room to manoeuvre in deciding upon them. A [[European Union decision|decision]] is an instrument which is focused at a particular person or group and is directly applicable. Institutions may also issue [[European Union recommendation|recommendations and opinions]] which are merely non-binding declarations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community legal instruments|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/community_legal_instruments_en.htm|accessdate=18 September 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708114002/http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/community_legal_instruments_en.htm|archivedate=8 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council votes in one of three ways; [[unanimity]], [[Majority|simple majority]], or [[qualified majority]]. In most cases, the Council votes on issues by [[Voting in the Council of the European Union|qualified majority voting]], meaning that there must be a minimum of 55% of member states agreeing (at least 15) who together represent at least 65% of the EU population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Voting system|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/voting-system/|doi=|accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 'blocking minority' can only be formed by at least 4 member states representing at least 35% of the EU population.

=== Foreign affairs ===
{{one source|section|date=December 2015}}
The legal instruments used by the Council for the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] are different from the legislative acts. Under the CFSP they consist of &quot;common positions&quot;, &quot;joint actions&quot;, and &quot;common strategies&quot;. Common positions relate to defining a European foreign policy towards a particular third-country such as the promotion of human rights and democracy in [[Myanmar]], a region such as the stabilisation efforts in the [[African Great Lakes]], or a certain issue such as support for the [[International Criminal Court]]. A common position, once agreed, is binding on all EU states who must follow and defend the policy, which is regularly revised. A joint action refers to a co-ordinated action of the states to deploy resources to achieve an objective, for example for mine clearing or to combat the spread of [[small arms]]. Common strategies defined an objective and commits the EUs resources to that task for four years.&lt;ref name=&quot;FR instru&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[French Foreign Ministry]]|title = Joint actions, common positions and common strategies|url = http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/european-union_157/eu-in-the-world_1491/common-foreign-and-security-policy_5463/operation-of-the-cfsp_5467/cfsp-decision-making-processes-and-instruments_5473/joint-actions-common-positions-and-common-strategies_8752.html|accessdate = 14 October 2007|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071018111907/http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/european-union_157/eu-in-the-world_1491/common-foreign-and-security-policy_5463/operation-of-the-cfsp_5467/cfsp-decision-making-processes-and-instruments_5473/joint-actions-common-positions-and-common-strategies_8752.html|archivedate = 18 October 2007|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Budgetary authority ===
Furthermore, the legislative branch officially holds the Union's budgetary authority. The [[Budget of the European Union|EU's budget]] (which is around 155 billion [[euro]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/budget/mff/figures/index_en.cfm|title=Multiannual Financial Framework-European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; is subject to a form of the ordinary legislative procedure with a single reading giving Parliament power over the entire budget (prior to 2009, its influence was limited to certain areas) on an equal footing to the Council. If there is a disagreement between them, it is taken to a conciliation committee as it is for legislative proposals. But if the joint conciliation text is not approved, the Parliament may adopt the budget definitively.&lt;ref name=&quot;lisbon explain&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Explaining the Treaty of Lisbon|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa website]]|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/09/531|accessdate = 4 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the budget, the Council coordinates the economic policy of members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Consilium - Council&quot;/&gt;

== Organisation ==
The Council's rules of procedure contain the provisions necessary for its organisation and functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=URISERV:o10003|title=EUR-Lex - o10003 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Presidency ===
{{Main article|Presidency of the Council of the European Union}}
The Presidency of the Council is not a single post, but is held by a member state's government. Every six months the presidency rotates among the states, in an order predefined by the Council's members, allowing each state to preside over the body. From 2007, every three member states co-operate for their combined eighteen months on a common agenda, although only one formally holds the presidency for the normal six-month period. For example, the President for the second half of 2007, Portugal, was the second in a trio of states alongside Germany and [[Slovenia]] with whom Portugal had been co-operating. The Council meets in various configurations (as outlined below) so its membership changes depending upon the issue. The person chairing the Council will always be the member from the state holding the Presidency. A delegate from the following Presidency also assists the presiding member and may take over work if requested.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pres DE&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher = 2007 German Presidency website|title = What is the Presidency?|url = http://www.eu2007.de/en/The_Council_Presidency/What_is_the_Presidency/index.html|accessdate = 24 June 2007|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070701001206/http://www.eu2007.de/en/The_Council_Presidency/What_is_the_Presidency/index.html|archivedate = 1 July 2007|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pres PT&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher = 2007 Portuguese Presidency website|title = The Presidency|url=http://www.eu2007.pt/UE/vEN/Presidencia_Conselho/A_Presidencia/default_.htm|accessdate = 14 October 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071020220019/http://www.eu2007.pt/UE/vEN/Presidencia_Conselho/A_Presidencia/default_.htm |archivedate = 20 October 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exception however is the foreign affairs council, which has been chaired by the [[High Representative]] since the entry into force of the [[Lisbon Treaty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Const Info&quot;/&gt;

The role of the Presidency is administrative and political. On the administrative side it is responsible for procedures and organising the work of the Council during its term. This includes summoning the Council for meetings along with directing the work of [[COREPER]] and other committees and working groups. The political element is the role of successfully dealing with issues and mediating in the Council. In particular this includes setting the agenda of the council, hence giving the Presidency substantial influence in the work of the Council during its term. The Presidency also plays a major role in representing the Council within the EU and representing the EU internationally, for example at the United Nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pres PT&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pres FI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher = 2007 Finnish Presidency website|title = The presidency in general|url=http://www.eu2006.fi/the_presidency/en_GB/the_presidency_in_general/|accessdate = 14 October 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061003140815/http://www.eu2006.fi/the_presidency/en_GB/the_presidency_in_general/ |archivedate = 3 October 2006|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = Council Decision of 15 September 2006 adopting the Council's Rules of Procedure |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:285:0047:0048:EN:PDF|format=PDF|accessdate = 26 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Configurations ===
Legally speaking, the Council is a single entity (this means that technically any Council configuration can adopt decisions that fall within the remit of any other Council configuration)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/decision-making/|title=The decision-making process in the Council - Consilium|website=www.consilium.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is in practice divided into several different council configurations (or ‘(con)formations’). Article 16(6) of the [[Treaty on European Union]] provides:
{{quote|The Council shall meet in different configurations, the list of which shall be adopted in accordance with Article 236 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

The General Affairs Council shall ensure consistency in the work of the different Council configurations. It shall prepare and ensure the follow-up to meetings of the European Council, in liaison with the President of the European Council and the Commission.

The Foreign Affairs Council shall elaborate the Union's external action on the basis of strategic guidelines laid down by the European Council and ensure that the Union's action is consistent.}}

Each council configuration deals with a different functional area, for example agriculture and fisheries. In this formation, the council is composed of ministers from each state government who are responsible for this area: the agriculture and fisheries ministers. The [[Chair (official)|chair]] of this council is held by the member from the state holding the presidency (see section above). Similarly, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council is composed of national finance ministers, and they are still one per state and the chair is held by the member coming from the presiding country. The Councils meet irregularly throughout the year except for the three major configurations (top three below) which meet once a month. {{As of|2020}}, there are ten formations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|title = Council configurations|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/configurations/|accessdate = 24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Council Booklet&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Information handbook of the Council of the European Union|publisher=Office of Official Publications of the European Communities|year=2007|location =Brussels|pages=|url=|doi=|id=|isbn=978-92-824-2203-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[General Affairs Council|General Affairs]] (GAC): General affairs co-ordinates the work of the Council, prepares for [[European Council]] meetings and deals with issues crossing various council formations.
;[[Foreign Affairs Council|Foreign Affairs]] (FAC): Chaired by the [[High Representative]], rather than the Presidency, it manages the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|CFSP]], [[Common Security and Defence Policy|CSDP]], trade and development co-operation. It sometimes meets in a '''defence configuration'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eu2008.fr/impression8f11.html?url=%2FPFUE%2Flang%2Fen%2Faccueil%2FPFUE-10_2008%2FPFUE-31.10.2008%2Fpid%2F17038 |title=Report from the conference on crisis management, French presidency, 2008 |publisher=Eu2008.fr |date=31 October 2008 |accessdate=22 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320233009/http://www.eu2008.fr/impression8f11.html?url=%2FPFUE%2Flang%2Fen%2Faccueil%2FPFUE-10_2008%2FPFUE-31.10.2008%2Fpid%2F17038 |archivedate=20 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Economic and Financial Affairs Council|Economic and Financial Affairs]] (Ecofin): Composed of economics and finance ministers of the member states. It includes [[EU budget|budgetary]] and [[eurozone]] matters via an informal group composed only of eurozone member ministers.&lt;ref name=&quot;CER Treaty&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The CER guide to the EU's constitutional treaty|publisher=Centre for European Reform|date=July 2004|url=http://www.cer.org.uk/pdf/policybrief_constitution_july04.pdf|accessdate=24 June 2007|format=PDF|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703022118/http://www.cer.org.uk/pdf/policybrief_constitution_july04.pdf|archivedate=3 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Agriculture and Fisheries Council|Agriculture and Fisheries]] (Agrifish): Composed of the agriculture and fisheries ministers of the member states. It considers matters concerning the [[Common Agricultural Policy]], the [[Common Fisheries Policy]], forestry, organic farming, food and feed safety, seeds, pesticides, and fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Consilium - Agriculture and Fisheries|accessdate=18 January 2014|publisher=Council of the European Union|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/policies/council-configurations/agriculture-and-fisheries?lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Justice and Home Affairs Council|Justice and Home Affairs]] (JHA): This configuration brings together Justice ministers and Interior Ministers of the Member States. Includes civil protection.
;[[Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council|Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs]] (EPSCO): Composed of employment, social protection, consumer protection, health and equal opportunities ministers.
;[[Competitiveness Council (COMPET)|Competitiveness]] (COMPET): Created in June 2002 through the merging of three previous configurations (Internal Market, Industry and Research). Depending on the items on the agenda, this formation is composed of ministers responsible for areas such as European affairs, industry, tourism and scientific research. With the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the EU acquired competence in space matters,&lt;ref&gt;Art.4 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU.http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0047:0200:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; and space policy has been attributed to the Competitiveness Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/configurations/compet/ |title=Competitiveness Council configuration (COMPET) |publisher=Council of the European Union |accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council|Transport, Telecommunications and Energy]] (TTE): Created in June 2002, through the merging of three policies under one configuration, and with a composition varying according to the specific items on its agenda. This formation meets approximately once every two months.
;[[Environment Council|Environment]] (ENV): Composed of environment ministers, who meet about four times a year.
;[[Education, Youth, Culture and Sport Council|Education, Youth, Culture and Sport]] (EYC): Composed of education, culture, youth, communications and sport ministers, who meet around three or four times a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/configurations/eycs/ |title=Education, Youth, Culture and Sport Council configuration (EYCS) |publisher=Council of the European Union |accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Includes audiovisual issues.

Complementing these, the Political and Security Committee (PSC) brings together ambassadors to monitor international situations and define policies within the CSDP, particularly in crises.&lt;ref name=&quot;Council Booklet&quot;/&gt; The [[European Council]] is similar to a configuration of the Council and operates in a similar way, but is composed of the national leaders ([[head of government|heads of government]] [[head of state|or state]]) and has its own President,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/european-council/ |title=European Council – The institution |publisher=Council of the European Union |accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; since 2019, [[Charles Michel]]. The body's purpose is to define the general &quot;impetus&quot; of the Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|title = European Council|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/european-council/|accessdate = 24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Council deals with the major issues such as the appointment of the [[President of the European Commission]] who takes part in the body's meetings.&lt;ref name=&quot;CP app&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = European Commission|url = http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm|accessdate = 2 October 2007|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070623104055/http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm|archivedate = 23 June 2007|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Economic and Financial Affairs Council|Ecofin]]'s Eurozone component, the [[Euro group]], is also a formal group with its own President.&lt;ref name=&quot;CER Treaty&quot;/&gt; Its European Council counterpart is the [[Euro summit]] formalized in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/125644.pdf|title=26 October 2011 Euro summit conclusions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union|TSCG]].

Following the entry into force of a framework agreement between the EU and [[European Space Agency|ESA]] there is a '''Space Council''' configuration—a joint and concomitant meeting of the EU Council and of the ESA Council at ministerial level dealing with the implementation of the [[European Space Policy|ESP]] adopted by both organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/Pr_21_2007_p_EN.html |title=ESA PR: N° 21-2007: Europe’s Space Policy becomes a reality today |publisher=Esa.int |date=22 May 2007 |accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/App/accords/Default.aspx?command=details&amp;id=297&amp;lang=EN&amp;aid=2003099&amp;doclang=EN |title=Framework Agreement between the European Community and the European Space Agency |publisher=Council of the European Union |accessdate=22 March 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Administration ===

The [[General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union|General Secretariat of the Council]] provides the continuous infrastructure of the Council, carrying out preparation for meetings, draft reports, translation, records, documents, agendas and assisting the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|title = General Secretariat of the Council|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/general-secretariat/|accessdate = 24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union|Secretary General of the Council]] is head of the Secretariat. The Secretariat is divided into seven directorates-general, each administered by a director-general.

The [[Committee of Permanent Representatives]] (COREPER) is a body composed of representatives from the states (ambassadors, civil servants etc.) who meet each week to prepare the work and tasks of the Council. It monitors and co-ordinates work and deals with the Parliament on co-decision legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = Glossary|url=http://ec.europa.eu/codecision/stepbystep/glossary_en.htm|accessdate = 24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is divided into two groups of the representatives (Coreper II) and their deputies (Coreper I). Agriculture is dealt with separately by the [[Special Committee on Agriculture]] (SCA). The numerous working groups submit their reports to the Council through Coreper or SCA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Council Booklet&quot;/&gt;

==Governments represented in the Council==
{{Further information|Voting in the Council of the European Union}}
The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] mandated a change in voting system from 1 November 2014 for most cases to double majority [[Qualified Majority Voting]], replacing the voting weights system. Decisions made by the council have to be taken by 55% of member states representing at least 65% of the EU's population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Const Info&quot;/&gt;

Almost all members of the Council are members of a political party at national level, and most of these are members of a [[European political party|European-level political party]]. However the Council is composed to represent the Member States rather than political parties&lt;ref name=&quot;Consilium - Council&quot;/&gt; and the nature of coalition governments in a number of states means that party breakdown at different configuration of the Council vary depending on which domestic party was assigned the portfolio. However, the broad ideological alignment of the government in each state does influence the nature of the law the Council produces and the extent to which the link between domestic parties puts pressure on the members in the European Parliament to vote a certain way.

== Location ==
{{Further information|Location of European Union institutions|Europa building|Justus Lipsius building}}

By a decision of the European Council at Edinburgh in December 1992, the Council has its seat in Brussels but in April, June, and October, it holds its meetings in [[Luxembourg City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = European Council|title = European Council in Edinburgh: 11–12 December 1992, Annex 6 to Part A| date=12 December 1992|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/summits/edinburgh/a6_en.pdf|accessdate = 24 June 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1952 and 1967 the ECSC Council held its Luxembourg City meetings in the Cercle Municipal on Place d’Armes. Its secretariat moved on numerous occasions but between 1955 and 1967 it was housed in the Verlorenkost district of the city. In 1957, with the creation of two new Communities with their own Councils, discretion on location was given to the current Presidency. In practice this was to be in the [[Château of Val-Duchesse]] until the autumn of 1958, at which point it moved to 2 Rue Ravensteinstraat in Brussels.&lt;ref name=&quot;ENA Council seat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=|title=Seat of the Council of the European Union|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&amp;doc=5631|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|accessdate=11 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1965 agreement (finalised by the Edinburgh agreement and annexed to the treaties) on the location of the newly merged institutions, the Council was to be in Brussels but would meet in Luxembourg City during April, June, and October. The ECSC secretariat moved from Luxembourg City to the merged body Council secretariat in the Ravenstein building of Brussels. In 1971 the Council and its secretariat moved into the [[Charlemagne building]], next to the Commission's [[Berlaymont]], but the Council rapidly ran out of space and administrative branch of the Secretariat moved to a building at 76 Rue Joseph II/Jozef II-straat and during the 1980s the language divisions moved out into the Nerviens, Frère Orban, and Guimard buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;ENA Council seat&quot;/&gt;

In 1995 the Council moved into the [[Justus Lipsius building]], across the road from Charlemagne. However, its staff was still increasing, so it continued to rent the Frère Orban building to house the Finnish and Swedish language divisions. Staff continued to increase and the Council rented, in addition to owning Justus Lipsius, the Kortenberg, Froissart, Espace Rolin, and Woluwe Heights buildings. Since acquiring the [[Lex building]] in 2008, the three aforementioned buildings are no longer in use by the Council services.

When the Council is meeting in Luxembourg City, it meets in the Kirchberg Conference Centre&lt;ref name=&quot;ENA Council seat&quot;/&gt; and its offices are based at the European Centre on the plateau du Kirchberg.&lt;ref name=&quot;Council Booklet&quot;/&gt; The Council has also met occasionally in Strasbourg, in various other cities, and also outside the Union: for example in 1974 when it met in Tokyo and Washington, D. C. while trade and energy talks were taking place. Under the Council's present rules of procedures the Council can, in extraordinary circumstances, hold one of its meetings outside Brussels and Luxembourg.&lt;ref name=&quot;ENA Council seat&quot;/&gt;

From 2017, both the Council of the European Union and the [[European Council]] adopted the purpose built [[Europa building]] as their official headquarters, although they continue to utilise the facilities afforded by the adjacent [[Justus Lipsius building]]. The focal point of the new building, the distinctive multi-storey &quot;lantern&quot; shaped structure in which the main meeting room is located, is utilised in both EU institutions' new official logos.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/new-hq-new-logo/|title=New HQ, new logo|date=15 January 2014|work=POLITICO|access-date=7 May 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
