==Etymology==
The name Anguilla is from the Italian ''{{lang|it|anguilla}}'' meaning &quot;[[eel]]&quot; (in turn from the Latin ''anguilla'', diminutive of ''anguis'', snake) in reference to the island's shape.{{sfnp|Martin|1839}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/av.html |title=CIA World Factbook- Anguilla|accessdate= 11 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed by most sources to have been named by [[Christopher Columbus]].{{sfnp|Law|1999}} For similar reasons, it was also known as ''Snake'' or ''Snake Island''.{{sfnp|Martin|1839}}{{sfnp|EB|1878}}{{sfnp|EB|1911}}

== History ==
{{Main|History of Anguilla}}
[[File:Wallblake House, The Valley.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wallblake House]], a plantation house thought to be the oldest building in Anguilla]]
Anguilla was first settled by Indigenous Amerindian peoples who migrated from South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Anguilla-island-West-Indies |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – Anguilla|accessdate= 12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest Native American artefacts found on Anguilla have been dated to around 1300&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}; remains of settlements date from {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;600.&lt;ref&gt;''Caribbean Islands'', Sarah Cameron (Footprint Travel Guides), p. 466 ([https://books.google.com/?id=G74-rZzX64cC Google Books])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gov&gt;{{citation |contribution=Anguilla's History |contribution-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813051037/http://gov.ai/elections/anguillahistory.htm |publisher=Government of Anguilla |title=The Anguilla House of Assembly Elections&lt;!--sic--&gt; |date=2007 |accessdate=9 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The native [[Arawak]] name for the island was ''Malliouhana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Anguilla-island-West-Indies |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – Anguilla|accessdate= 12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Precisely when Anguilla was first seen by Europeans is uncertain: some sources claim that [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] sighted the island during his second voyage in 1493, while others state that the first European explorer was the [[Kingdom of France|French]] Huguenot nobleman and merchant [[René Goulaine de Laudonnière]] in 1564.&lt;ref name=gov/&gt; The [[Dutch West India Company]] established a fort on the island in 1631.  However, the Company later withdrew after its fort was destroyed by the Spanish in 1633.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://www.atlasofmutualheritage.nl/nl/Anguilla.1009p Atlas of Mutual Heritage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129004331/http://www.atlasofmutualheritage.nl/nl/Anguilla.1009p |date=29 January 2018 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional accounts state that Anguilla was first colonised by [[Kingdom of England|English]] settlers from [[Saint Kitts]] beginning in 1650.{{sfnp|Martin|1839}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Historical Geography of the British Colonies: The West Indies|author=Charles Prestwood Lucas|page=143|isbn=978-1-4590-0868-7|publisher=General Books LLC|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Anguilla-island-West-Indies |title=Encyclopedia Britannica - Anguilla|accessdate= 12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlers focused on planting tobacco, and to a lesser extent cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Anguilla-island-West-Indies |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – Anguilla|accessdate= 12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The French temporarily took over the island in 1666 but returned it to English control under the terms of the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] the next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Anguilla-island-West-Indies |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – Anguilla|accessdate= 12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A Major John Scott who visited in September 1667, wrote of leaving the island &quot;in good condition&quot; and noted that in July 1668, &quot;200 or 300 people fled thither in time of war&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;British Colonial and State Papers 1661–1668, 16 November 1667 and 9 July 1668.&lt;/ref&gt; The French latter attacked again in 1688, [[Battle of Anguilla|1745]] and 1798, causing much destruction but failing to capture the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Anguilla-island-West-Indies |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – Anguilla|accessdate= 12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gov/&gt;

It is likely that the early Europeans settlers brought enslaved Africans with them. Historians confirm that [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]] lived in the region in the early 17th century' for example, Africans from [[Senegal]] were living on St Kitts in 1626.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} By 1672 a slave depot existed on the island of [[Nevis]], serving the [[Leeward Islands]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} While the time of African arrival in Anguilla is difficult to place precisely, archival evidence indicates a substantial African presence of at least 100 enslaved people by 1683; these seem to have come from Central Africa as well as West Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walicek, Don E 2009. pp. 349-372&quot;&gt;Walicek, Don E.

(Creole Language Library Series 34), Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp. 349–372.&lt;/ref&gt; The slaves were forced to work on the sugar plantations which had begun to replace tobacco as Anguilla's main crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Anguilla-island-West-Indies |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – Anguilla|accessdate= 12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time the African slaves and their descendants came to vastly outnumber the white settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Anguilla-island-West-Indies |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – Anguilla|accessdate= 12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The African slave trade was eventually terminated within the British Empire in 1807, and slavery outlawed completely in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Anguilla-island-West-Indies |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – Anguilla|accessdate= 12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many planters subsequently sold up or left the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Anguilla-island-West-Indies |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – Anguilla|accessdate= 12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the early colonial period, Anguilla was administered by the British through Antigua; in 1825, it was placed under the administrative control of nearby Saint Kitts.&lt;ref name=gov/&gt; Anguilla was federated with St Kitts and Nevis in 1882, against the wishes of many Anguillians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Anguilla-island-West-Indies |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – Anguilla|accessdate= 12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic stagnation, and the severe effects of several droughts in the 1890s and later the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s led many Anguillians to emigrate for better prospects elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Anguilla-island-West-Indies |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – Anguilla|accessdate= 12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Flag of Anguilla (1967-1969).svg|thumb|right|Flag of the short-lived Republic of Anguilla]]
Full adult suffrage was introduced to Anguilla in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Anguilla-island-West-Indies |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – Anguilla|accessdate= 12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief period as part of the [[West Indies Federation]] (1958–62), the island of Anguilla became part of the [[associated state]] of [[Saint Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla]] with full internal autonomy in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Saint-Kitts-and-Nevis |title=Enclopedia Britannica – St Kitts and Nevis |accessdate= 10 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However many Anguillians had no wish to be a part of this union, and resented the dominance of St Kitts within it. On 30 May 1967 Anguillians forcibly ejected the St Kitts police force from the island and declared their separation from St Kitts following a [[1967 Anguillan separation referendum|referendum]].&lt;ref name=DD&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=ai011967 Anguilla, 11 July 1967: Separation from St Kitts and Nevis; Peace Committee as Government] Direct Democracy {{in lang|de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Anguilla-island-West-Indies |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – Anguilla|accessdate= 12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://amerika21.de/analyse/160106/anguilla-kolonie-separatisten David X.

With negotiations failing to break the deadlock, a [[1969 Anguillan constitutional referendum|second referendum]] confirming Anguillians' desire for separation from St Kitts was held and the [[Republic of Anguilla]] was declared unilaterally, with Ronald Webster as President. Efforts by British envoy [[William Whitlock (politician)|William Whitlock]] failed to break the impasse and 300 British troops were subsequently sent in March 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Anguilla-island-West-Indies |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – Anguilla|accessdate= 12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; British authority was restored, and confirmed by the Anguilla Act of July 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Anguilla-island-West-Indies |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – Anguilla|accessdate= 12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 Anguilla was finally allowed to formally secede from Saint Kitts and Nevis and become a separate British [[Crown colony]] (now a [[British overseas territory]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Minahan |first=James |date=2013 |title= The Complete Guide to National Symbols and Emblems |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=jfrWCQAAQBAJ| pages=656–657|isbn=9780313344978 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hubbard&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hubbard|first1=Vincent|title=A History of St. Kitts|date=2002|publisher=Macmillan Caribbean|isbn=9780333747605|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofstkitts00vinc/page/147 147–149]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofstkitts00vinc/page/147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Saint-Kitts-and-Nevis |title=Enclopedia Britannica - St Kitts and Nevis |accessdate= 10 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Introduction ::Anguilla&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Anguilla-island-West-Indies |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – Anguilla|accessdate= 12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then Anguilla has been politically stable, and has seen a large growth in its tourism and offshore financing sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Anguilla-island-West-Indies |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – Anguilla|accessdate= 12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The territory's constitution is the Anguilla Constitutional Order 1 April 1982 (amended 1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/av.html |title=CIA World Factbook- Anguilla|accessdate= 11 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government, with [[legislative power]] being vested in both the government and the [[Anguilla House of Assembly|House of Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/av.html |title=CIA World Factbook- Anguilla|accessdate= 11 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Anguilla-island-West-Indies |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – Anguilla|accessdate= 12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defence===
As a dependency of the UK, the UK is responsible for Anguilla's military defence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Anguilla-island-West-Indies |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – Anguilla|accessdate= 12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/av.html |title=CIA World Factbook- Anguilla|accessdate= 11 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;, although there are no active [[garrisons]] or armed forces present. Anguilla has a small [[marine police]] force, comprising around 32 personnel, which operates one [[VT Group|VT Halmatic]] M160-class 52-foot fast [[patrol boat]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

== Population ==
=== Demographics ===
{{Main|Demographics of Anguilla}}
The majority of residents (90.08%) are black, most of whom are the descendants of slaves transported from Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Anguilla-island-West-Indies |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – Anguilla|accessdate= 12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Minorities include whites at 3.74% and people of mixed race at 4.65% (figures from 2001 census).

72% of the population is Anguillian while 28% is non-Anguillian (2001 census). Of the non-Anguillian population, many are citizens of the United States, United Kingdom, [[St Kitts &amp; Nevis]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Nigeria]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

2006 and 2007 saw an influx of large numbers of Chinese, Indian and [[Mexican people|Mexican]] workers, brought in as labour for major tourist developments due to the local population not being large enough to support the labour requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.ai/documents/statistics/Anguilla_CPA_-_Main_Report_Final_(Submitted).pdf|title=Anguilla Country Poverty Assessment 2007/2009|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
Christian churches did not have a consistent or strong presence during the initial period of English colonisation; spiritual and religious practices of Europeans and Africans tended to reflect their regional origins. As early as 1813, Christian ministers formally ministered to enslaved Africans and promoted literacy among converts.&lt;ref&gt;Walicek, Don E. 2011. &quot;Christianity, Literacy, and Creolization in Nineteenth-Century Anguilla.&quot; In Anansi's Defiant Webs, Contact, Continuity, Convergence, and Complexity in the Language, Literatures and Cultures of the Greater Caribbean, ed. by N.

According to the 2001 census, [[Christianity]] is Anguilla's predominant religion, with 29% of the population practising [[Anglicanism]] and another 23.9% are [[Methodist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Anguilla-island-West-Indies |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – Anguilla|accessdate= 12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other churches on the island include [[Seventh-day Adventist]], [[Baptist]], [[Roman Catholic]] (served by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint John's–Basseterre|Diocese of Saint John's–Basseterre]], with the See at Saint John on [[Antigua and Barbuda]]) and a small community of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (0.7%).&lt;ref name=&quot;statistics census&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gov.ai/statistics/census/Demography%20&amp;%20Culture%20tables.htm|title=Persons by Religion, Census 1992 and 2001 (Table 14)|publisher=Statistics Department of Anguilla|accessdate=16 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124150450/http://gov.ai/statistics/census/Demography%20%26%20Culture%20tables.htm|archive-date=24 November 2007|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1992 and 2001 the number of followers of the [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)|Church of God]] and [[Pentecostals]] increased considerably.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} There are at least 15 churches on the island.

=== Languages ===
{{Main|Anguillian Creole}}
[[File:Sandy Ground Anguilla.jpg|thumb|Overlooking [[Sandy Ground, Anguilla|Sandy Ground]], Anguilla]]
Today most people in Anguilla speak a British-influenced variety of standard [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/av.html |title=CIA World Factbook- Anguilla|accessdate= 11 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other languages are also spoken on the island, including varieties of Spanish, Chinese and the languages of other immigrant communities. However, the most common language other than Standard English is the island's own English-lexifier Creole language (not to be confused with [[Antillean Creole]] ('French Creole'), spoken in French islands such as [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]]). It is referred to locally by terms such as &quot;dialect&quot; (pronounced &quot;dialek&quot;), Anguilla Talk or &quot;Anguillian&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whatwedoinanguilla.com/language/ |title=Anguillian Language 101
|accessdate= 11 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has its main roots in early varieties of English and West African languages, and is similar to the dialects spoken in English-speaking islands throughout the Eastern Caribbean in terms of its structural features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=aig|title=Antigua and Barbuda Creole English|work=Ethnologue|access-date=11 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019010527/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=aig|archive-date=19 October 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists who are interested in the origins of Anguillian and other Caribbean Creoles point out that some of its grammatical features can be traced to African languages while others can be traced to European languages. Three areas have been identified as significant for the identification of the linguistic origins of those forced migrants who arrived before 1710: the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]], the [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]] and the Windward Coast.&lt;ref&gt;Singler, John. 1993. African influence upon Afro-American language varieties: A consideration of sociohistorical factors. In Africanisms in Afro-American language varieties, S. Mufwene and n. Condon (eds.), 235–253. Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociohistorical information from Anguilla's archives suggest that Africans and Europeans formed two distinct, but perhaps overlapping speech communities in the early phases of the island's colonisation. &quot;Anguillian&quot; is believed to have emerged as the language of the masses as time passed, slavery was abolished and locals began to see themselves as &quot;belonging&quot; to Anguillian society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walicek, Don E 2009. pp. 349-372&quot;/&gt;

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Anguilla}}
[[File:Tree map export 2009 Anguilla.jpeg|thumb|300px|2009 export percentages]]
Anguilla's thin arid soil being largely unsuitable for agriculture, the island has few land-based [[natural resources]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/av.html |title=CIA World Factbook- Anguilla|accessdate= 11 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main industries are tourism, [[offshore companies|offshore incorporation and management]], [[offshore bank]]ing, [[captive insurance]] and fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/av.html |title=CIA World Factbook- Anguilla|accessdate= 11 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Anguilla-island-West-Indies |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – Anguilla|accessdate= 12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;

Anguilla's currency is the [[East Caribbean dollar]], though the US dollar is also widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Anguilla-island-West-Indies |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – Anguilla|accessdate= 12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exchange rate is fixed to the US dollar at US$1 = EC$2.70.

The economy, and especially the tourism sector, suffered a setback in late 1995 due to the effects of [[Hurricane Luis]] in September. Hotels were hit particularly hard but a recovery occurred the following year. Another economic setback occurred during the aftermath of [[Hurricane Lenny]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=South America, Central America and the Caribbean 2003|publisher=Routledge|page=52|year=2002|isbn=978-1-85743-138-4|edition=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 2008 worldwide crisis the economy of Anguilla was growing strongly, especially the tourism sector which was driving major new developments in partnerships with multi-national companies. Anguilla's tourism industry received a major boost when it was selected to host the [[World Travel Awards]] in December 2014. Known as &quot;the Oscars of the travel industry&quot;, the awards ceremony was held at the [[CuisinArt Resort and Spa]] and was hosted by [[Vivica A. Fox]]. Anguilla was voted the World's Leading Luxury Island Destination from a short list of top-tier candidates such as St. Barts, the Maldives and Mauritius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/17/vivica-a-fox-world-leading-luxury-island-destination_n_6342824.html|title=Vivica A.

Anguilla's financial system comprises seven banks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thebanks.eu/banks-by-country/Anguilla|title=List of Banks in Anguilla|access-date=29 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507123233/https://thebanks.eu/banks-by-country/Anguilla|archive-date=7 May 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; two money services businesses, more than 40 company managers, more than 50 insurers, 12 brokers, more than 250 captive intermediaries, more than 50 mutual funds and eight trust companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsc.org.ai/market.shtml|title=Market Participants|access-date=3 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006114801/http://www.fsc.org.ai/market.shtml|archive-date=6 October 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anguilla has become a popular [[tax haven]], having no capital gains, estate, profit, sales, or corporate taxes. In April 2011, faced with a mounting deficit, it introduced a 3% &quot;Interim Stabilisation Levy&quot;, Anguilla's first form of [[income tax]]. Anguilla also has a 0.75% property tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= KPMG |website= kpmg.com |url= http://www.kpmg.com/global/en/issuesandinsights/articlespublications/taxation-international-executives/anguilla/pages/default.aspx |title= Tax TIES: Anguilla – Overview and introduction |accessdate= 1 April 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180928164218/https://www.kpmg.com/global/en/issuesandinsights/articlespublications/taxation-international-executives/anguilla/pages/default.aspx |archivedate= 2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anguilla aims to obtain 15% of its energy from [[solar power]] to become less reliant on expensive imported diesel. The [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]] is helping the government gather the information it needs to change the territory's legislation, so that it can integrate renewables into its grid. [[Barbados]] has also made good progress in switching to renewables, but many other [[Small Island Developing States]] are still at the early stages of planning how to integrate renewable energy into their grids. &quot;For a small island we're very far ahead,&quot; said Beth Barry, Coordinator of the Anguilla Renewable Energy Office. &quot;We've got an Energy Policy and a draft Climate Change policy and have been focussing efforts on the question of [[sustainable energy]] supply for several years now. As a result, we have a lot of information we can share with other islands.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Carolyn. 28 June 2012. [http://cdkn.org/2012/06/interview-with-beth-barry-on-anguilla-renewable-energy/ Anguilla moves towards cleaner energy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729101506/http://cdkn.org/2012/06/interview-with-beth-barry-on-anguilla-renewable-energy/ |date=29 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air===
[[File:Wallblake Airport (Anguilla).jpg|thumb|left|Clayton J. Lloyd International Airport]]
Anguilla is served by [[Clayton J. Lloyd International Airport]] (prior to 4 July 2010 known as Wallblake Airport). The primary runway at the airport is {{convert|5462|ft|m}} in length and can accommodate moderate-sized aircraft. Services connect to various other Caribbean islands via regional carrier [[LIAT]], local charter airlines and others. Although there are no direct scheduled flights to or from continental America or Europe, [[Tradewind Aviation]] and [[Cape Air]] provide scheduled air service to [[Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport|San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]]. The airport can handle large [[narrow-body]] jets such as the [[Boeing 727]], [[Boeing 737]] and [[Boeing 757]].

===Road===
Aside from taxis, there is no public transport on the island. Cars drive on the left.

===Boat===
There are regular ferries from [[Saint Martin]] to Anguilla. It is a 20-minute crossing from [[Marigot, Saint Martin|Marigot]], St. Martin to Blowing Point, Anguilla. Ferries commence service from 7:00&amp;nbsp;am. There is also a charter service, from [[Blowing Point]], Anguilla to [[Princess Juliana Airport]] to make travel easier. This way of travel is the most common method of transport between Anguilla and St. Martin.
