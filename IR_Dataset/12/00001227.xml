==Geography==
The Territory comprises Ashmore Reef, which includes West, Middle, and [[East Island (Ashmore and Cartier Islands)|East Islands]], and two [[lagoon]]s, and Cartier Reef, which includes [[Cartier Islands|Cartier Island]]. Ashmore Reef covers approximately {{convert|583|km2|1|abbr=on}} and Cartier Reef {{convert|167|km2|0|abbr=on}}, both measurements extending to the limits of the reefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Australia |first1=Geoscience |title=Ashmore and Cariter Islands |url=http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/national-location-information/dimensions/remote-offshore-territories/ashmore-and-cartier-islands |website=Australian Government Geoscience Australia |publisher=Australian Government |accessdate=21 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

West, Middle, and East Islands have a combined land area variously reported as 54 ha, 93 ha, and 112 ha (1 [[hectare]] is 0.01&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or about 2.5 [[acres]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carter|first1=Mike|last2=Clarke|first2=Rohan|last3=Pierce|first3=Frank|last4=Dooley|first4=Sean|last5=Swann|first5=George|last6=Grant|first6=Murray|title=Lesser Coucal 'Centropus bengalensis' on Ashmore Reef: First Record for Australia|issn=1448-0107|work=Australian Field Ornithology|volume=27|issue=3|year=2010|quote=Within the reef are three small islands: West, Middle and east Islands (total land area 54 ha).

==History==
According to Australian literature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sajjacob.blogspot.com/2015/02/pulau-pasir-ashmore-reef-belongs-to.html |title=Pulau Pasir (Ashmore Reef) belongs to Indonesia |access-date={{date|13 August 2019|ISO}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Cartier Island was discovered by Captain Nash in 1800, and named after his ship ''Cartier''. Ashmore Island was discovered by Captain Samuel Ashmore in 1811 from his ship {{HMS|Hibernia|1804|6}} and named after him. Ashmore Island was annexed by the United Kingdom in 1878, as was Cartier Island in 1909.&lt;ref name=&quot;lus19&quot;&gt;{{cite web

A British [[order-in-council]] dated 23 July 1931 stated that Ashmore and Cartier Islands would be placed under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia when Australia passed legislation to accept them. The Commonwealth's resulting ''Ashmore and Cartier Islands Acceptance Act 1933'' came into operation on 10 May 1934, when the islands formally became a territory. The act authorised the [[Governor of Western Australia]] to make ordinances for the territory. In July 1938 the territory was annexed to the [[Northern Territory]], then also administered by the Commonwealth, whose{{Which?|Commonwealth or NT?|date=August 2019}} laws, ordinances and regulations applied to the Territory{{which?|NT or islands?|date=August 2019}}. When [[self-government]] was granted to the Northern Territory [[Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978|on 1 July 1978]], administration of Ashmore and Cartier Islands was retained by the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name=DIRD/&gt;&lt;ref name=YrBk1981&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=MVc4-noHRpIC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=Authorities+close+off+Cartier+Island&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GAWhQNcmeV&amp;sig=Hjw9iTjJA0CN1RASyjxCV9uiGys&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiXoKH338LNAhXGoJQKHSv5BjYQ6AEIVjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Authorities%20close%20off%20Cartier%20Island&amp;f=false Year Book Australia, 1981, p.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 the territory was declared a nature reserve under the ''National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975'',&lt;ref name=DIRD/&gt; now replaced by the [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/epabca1999588/ Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]''&lt;/ref&gt;

After the islands became a first point of contact with the [[Australian migration zone]], in September 2001, the Australian government excised the Ashmore and Cartier Islands from the Australian migration zone.&lt;ref name=DIRD/&gt;

===Indonesian heritage and memorandum===
Ashmore has been regularly visited and fished by Indonesian fishermen since the early eighteenth century. A 1974 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Australia and Indonesia sets out arrangements by which traditional fishers can access resources in Australia's territorial sea in the region. This allows traditional Indonesian fishermen to access parts of Ashmore for shelter, freshwater and to visit grave sites. The area, known as the [[MOU Box]], contains the Ashmore and Cartier Islands Territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/69f1fee5-5dfb-4da8-93ac-99f2eb9ea65c/files/visitors-information-brochureashmore-cartier.pdf |title=Ashmore Reef and Cartier Island Commonwealth Marine Reserves: Information for visitors |access-date=17 August 2018 |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Indonesian groups claim Ashmore Reef to be part of [[Rote Ndao Regency]] of [[East Nusa Tenggara]] province.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Governance==
Today, the Territory is administered from [[Canberra]] by the [[Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities]], which is also responsible for the administration of the territories of [[Christmas Island]], [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]], the [[Coral Sea Islands]], [[Jervis Bay Territory]] and [[Norfolk Island]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AussieAG&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author =  Assistant Director, Territories and Disaster Reconstruction Division | title = Territories of Australia | url = http://www.regional.gov.au/territories | publisher= Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport | date= 16 June 2012 | accessdate = 7 February 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110211125655/http://www.regional.gov.au/territories/| archivedate=11 February 2011| url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Attorney-General's Department (Australia)|Attorney-General's Department]] had been responsible for the administration of Australian territories until the [[2010 Australian federal election|2010 federal election]]. In that year the responsibility for Australian territories was transferred to the then [[Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport]],&lt;ref name=DIRD/&gt; and from 18 September 2013 the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development has administered Australian territories.

Defence of Ashmore and Cartier Islands is the responsibility of Australia, with periodic visits by the [[Royal Australian Navy]], [[Royal Australian Air Force]] and [[Australian Customs and Border Protection Service]].

Nearby Hibernia Reef, {{convert|42|km|0|abbr=on}} northeast of Ashmore Reef, is not part of the Territory, but belongs to [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|page=Administrative Divisions of Countries|url=http://www.statoids.com/uau.html |title=States of Australia|access-date=2011-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has no permanently dry land area, although large parts of the reef become exposed during low tide.

*The [[Ashmore Reef Marine Park]] and [[Cartier Island Marine Park]] are both classed as strict nature reserves (IUCN Ia) and protect biodiverse areas of significant and international importance, as well as cultural heritage.

==Economy==
There is no economic activity in the Territory, Ashmore and Cartier Islands being uninhabited. Cartier Island is an unvegetated [[sand island]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa2004&quot;/&gt; Access to Cartier Island is prohibited because of the risk of [[unexploded ordnance]]s. There are no ports or harbours, only offshore anchorage. The customs vessel [[ACV Ashmore Guardian|ACV ''Ashmore Guardian'']] is stationed off the reef for up to 330 days per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;FactSheet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.customs.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/FS_AshmoreGuardian.pdf|title=Australian Customs Vessel ''Ashmore Guardian''|publisher=Australian Customs and Border Protection Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands are also visited by seasonal caretakers and occasional scientific researchers.

The area has been a traditional fishing ground of Indonesian fishermen for centuries, and continues. In the 1850s, American whalers operated in the region. Mining of phosphate deposits took place on Ashmore Island in the latter half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=DIRD/&gt; Today, all the [[water well|well]]s in the Territory are infected with [[cholera]] or contaminated and [[potable water|undrinkable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Petroleum extraction activities take place at the [[Jabiru oil field|Jabiru]] and [[Challis oil field]]s, which are adjacent to the Territory, and which are administered by the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy on behalf of the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name=DIRD/&gt;

==Migration==
As Ashmore Reef is the closest point of Australian territory to Indonesia, it was a popular target for [[people smugglers]] transporting [[asylum seekers]] en route to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Roberts [https://web.archive.org/web/20080830045428/http://www.insideindonesia.org/edit66/anita4.htm &quot;Don't let them drown&quot;] ''Inside Indonesia'' Apr–Jun 2001, vol. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Once they had landed on Ashmore Island, asylum seekers could claim to have entered Australian migration zone and request to be processed as refugees. The use of Ashmore Island for this purpose created great notoriety during late 2001, when refugee arrivals became a major political issue in Australia. The Australian Government argued that as Australia was not the country of first asylum for these &quot;[[boat people]]&quot;, Australia did not have a responsibility to accept them.

A number of things were done to discourage the use of the Territory for this purpose, such as attempting to have the people smugglers arrested in Indonesia; the so-called [[Pacific Solution]] of processing them in third countries; the boarding and forced turnaround of the boats by Australian military forces; and finally excising the Territory and many other small islands from the [[Australian migration zone]].

Two boatloads of asylum seekers were each detained for several days in the lagoon at Ashmore Island after failed attempts by the [[Royal Australian Navy]] to turn them back to Indonesia in October 2001.
