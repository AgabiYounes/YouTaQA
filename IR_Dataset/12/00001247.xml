==Career==
{{More citations needed section|date=February 2019}}

===Early career===
[[File:Alfonso_Cuarón_(1998).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Alfonso at the [[Festival Internacional de Cine en Guadalajara]] in 1998.]]
Cuarón began working on television in Mexico, first as a technician and then as a director. His television work led to assignments as an assistant director for several film productions including ''[[La Gran Fiesta]]'', ''[[Gaby: A True Story]]'' and ''[[Romero (film)|Romero]]'', and in 1991, he landed his first big-screen directorial assignment.

===''Sólo con Tu Pareja''===
''[[Sólo con Tu Pareja]]'' is a sex comedy about a womanizing businessman (played by [[Daniel Giménez Cacho]]) who, after having sex with an attractive nurse, is fooled into believing he's contracted [[AIDS]]. In addition to writing, producing and directing, Cuarón co-edited the film with Luis Patlán.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=A. O.|last1=Scott|accessdate=2019-12-23|title=Sólo Con Tu Pareja - Review - Movies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/20/movies/20solo.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=20 September 2006|issn=0362-4331|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film, which also starred cabaret singer [[Astrid Hadad]] and model/actress [[Claudia Ramírez]] (with whom Cuarón was linked between 1989 and 1993), was a big hit in Mexico. After this success, director [[Sydney Pollack]] hired Cuarón to direct an episode of ''[[Fallen Angels (American TV series)|Fallen Angels]]'', a series of [[neo-noir]] stories produced for the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] premium cable network in 1993; other directors who worked on the series included [[Steven Soderbergh]], [[Jonathan Kaplan]], [[Peter Bogdanovich]] and [[Tom Hanks]].

===American debut, ''Y Tu Mamá También'' and international success===
[[File:Alfonso_Cuarón_y_Clive_Owen_(Children_of_men).jpg|left|thumb|250px|Alfonso Cuarón and [[Clive Owen]], who worked together on '' Children of Men''.]]
In 1995, Cuarón released his first feature film produced in the United States, ''[[A Little Princess (1995 film)|A Little Princess]]'', an adaptation of [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]]'s classic novel. Cuarón's next feature was also a literary adaptation, a modernized version of [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Great Expectations (1998 film)|Great Expectations]]'' starring [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] and [[Robert De Niro]].

Cuarón's next project found him returning to Mexico with a Spanish-speaking cast to film ''[[Y Tu Mamá También]]'', starring [[Gael García Bernal]], [[Diego Luna]] and [[Maribel Verdú]]. It was a provocative and controversial road comedy about two sexually obsessed teenagers who take an extended road trip with an attractive married woman who is much older than them. The film's open portrayal of sexuality and frequent rude humor, as well as the politically and socially relevant asides, made the film an international hit and a major success with critics. Cuarón shared an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] with co-writer and brother [[Carlos Cuarón]].

In 2004, Cuarón directed the third film in the successful ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' series, ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]''. Cuarón faced criticism from some ''[[Harry Potter]]'' fans for his approach to the film. At the time of the movie's release, however, author [[J. K. Rowling]], who had seen and loved Cuarón's film ''Y Tu Mamá También'', said that it was her personal favorite from the series so far.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=76 J.K. Rowling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204052946/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=76 |date=4 February 2007}} Accessed 17 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Critically, the film was also better received than the first two installments, with some critics remarking its new tone and for being the first ''Harry Potter'' film to truly capture the essence of the novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban/|title=Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuarón's feature ''[[Children of Men]]'', an adaptation of the [[P. D. James]] [[The Children of Men|novel]] starring [[Clive Owen]], [[Julianne Moore]] and [[Michael Caine]], received wide critical acclaim, including three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations. Cuarón himself received two nominations for his work on the film in [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] (with [[Alex Rodríguez (film editor)|Alex Rodríguez]]) and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (with several collaborators).

He created the production and distribution company [[Esperanto Filmoj]] (''Esperanto Films'', named because of his support for the international language [[Esperanto]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://esperantodocumentary.com/blog/an-interview-with-director-alfonso-cuaron Interview] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702024121/http://esperantodocumentary.com/blog/an-interview-with-director-alfonso-cuaron |date=2 July 2014 }} by [[Sam Green]] with Cuarón.&lt;/ref&gt;), which has credits in the films ''[[Duck Season]]'', ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'', and ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]''.

Cuarón also directed the controversial public service announcement &quot;I Am Autism&quot; for [[Autism Speaks]] that was criticized by disability rights groups for its negative portrayal of autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asansouthwestohio.blogspot.com/2009/09/autistic-community-condemns-autism.html|title=Autistic Self Advocacy Network, SW Ohio: Autistic Community Condemns Autism Speaks|last=Asansouthwestohio|date=23 September 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
