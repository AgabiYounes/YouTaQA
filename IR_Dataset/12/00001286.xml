The '''Governor of Alabama''' is the [[head of government]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alabama]]. The [[Governor (United States)|governor]] is the head of the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] of [[Government of Alabama|Alabama's state government]] and is charged with enforcing state laws.

There have officially been 54 governors of the state of Alabama; this official numbering skips acting and military governors.&lt;ref name=&quot;adah&quot; /&gt; The first governor, [[William Wyatt Bibb]], served as the only governor of the [[Alabama Territory]]. 5 people have served as acting governor, bringing the total number of people serving as governor to 59, spread over 63 distinct terms. Four governors have served multiple non-consecutive terms: [[Bibb Graves]], [[Jim Folsom]], and [[Fob James]] each served two, and [[George Wallace]] served three non-consecutive periods. Officially, these non-consecutive terms are numbered only with the number of their first term. [[William D. Jelks]] also served non-consecutive terms, but his first term was in an acting capacity.

The longest-serving governor was George Wallace, who served 16 years over four terms. The shortest term for a non-acting governor was that of [[Hugh McVay]], who served four and a half months after replacing the resigning [[Clement Comer Clay]]. [[Lurleen Wallace]], wife of George Wallace, was the first woman to serve as governor of Alabama, and the third woman to serve as governor of any state. The current governor is Republican [[Kay Ivey]], who took office on April 10, 2017 following Governor [[Robert J. Bentley]]'s court-mandated resignation following a guilty plea-deal amidst a corruption scandal. She is the second female governor of Alabama.

===Governor of the Territory of Alabama===
[[Alabama Territory]] was formed on March 3, 1817, from [[Mississippi Territory]]. It had only one governor appointed by the [[President of the United States]] before it became a state; he became the first state governor.

Alabama was [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]] on December 14, 1819. It seceded from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] on January 11, 1861, and was a founding member of the [[Confederate States of America]] on February 4, 1861. Following the end of the [[American Civil War]], Alabama during [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]] was part of the [[Third Military District]], which exerted some control over governor appointments and elections. Alabama was readmitted to the Union on July 14, 1868.

The first [[Constitution of Alabama|Alabama Constitution]], ratified in 1819, provided that a governor be elected every two years, limited to serve no more than 4 out of every 6 years.&lt;ref&gt;1819 Const. art. IV, § 4&lt;/ref&gt; This limit remained in place until the constitution of 1868, which simply allowed governors to serve terms of two years.&lt;ref&gt;1868 Const. art. V, § 2&lt;/ref&gt; The current constitution of 1901 increased terms to four years,&lt;ref name=&quot;const-art5sec114&quot;&gt;AL Const. art. V, § 114&lt;/ref&gt; but prohibited governors from succeeding themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;const-art5sec116&quot;&gt;AL Const. art. V, § 116&lt;/ref&gt; Amendment 282 to the constitution, passed in 1968, allowed governors to succeed themselves once; a governor serving two consecutive terms can run again after waiting out the next term.&lt;ref&gt;AL Const. amendment 282&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution had no set date for the commencement of a governor's term until 1901, when it was set at the first Monday after the second Tuesday in the January following an election.&lt;ref name=&quot;const-art5sec116&quot; /&gt; However, the [[Supreme Court of Alabama|Alabama Supreme Court]] ruled in 1911 that a governor's term ends at midnight at the end of Monday, and the next governor's term begins the next day, regardless of if they were sworn in on Monday.&lt;ref name=&quot;oberhaus&quot; /&gt;

The office of [[List of lieutenant governors of Alabama|lieutenant governor]] was created in 1868,&lt;ref name=&quot;1868const-art5sec1&quot;&gt;1868 Const. art. V, § 1&lt;/ref&gt; abolished in 1875,&lt;ref name=&quot;1875const-art5sec1&quot;&gt;1875 Const. art. V, § 1&lt;/ref&gt; and recreated in 1901.&lt;ref name=&quot;const-art5sec112&quot;&gt;AL Const. art. V, § 112&lt;/ref&gt; According to the current constitution, should the governor be out of the state for more than 20 days, the lieutenant governor becomes [[acting governor]], and if the office of governor becomes vacant the lieutenant governor ascends to the governorship.&lt;ref&gt;AL Const. art. V, § 127&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier constitutions said the powers of the governor devolved upon the successor, rather than them necessarily becoming governor,&lt;ref&gt;1819 Const. art. IV, § 18; 1861 Const. art. IV, § 18; 1865 Const. art V, § 19; 1868 Const. art. V, § 15; 1875 Const. art. V § 15&lt;/ref&gt; but the official listing includes these as full governors.&lt;ref name=&quot;adah&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.state.al.us/govslist.html |title=Alabama Governors |publisher=[[Alabama Department of Archives and History]] |accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The governor and lieutenant governor are not elected on the same [[ticket (election)|ticket]].

Alabama was a strongly [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] state before the Civil War, electing only candidates from the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] and Democratic parties. It had two [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] governors following Reconstruction, but after the Democratic Party re-established control, 112 years passed before voters chose another Republican.
