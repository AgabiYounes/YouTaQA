'''Ahuitzotl''' ({{lang-nah|[[wikt:ahuitzotl|āhuitzotl]]}}, {{IPA-nah|aːˈwit͡sot͡ɬ|-|Awisotl.ogg}}) was the eighth Aztec ruler, the ''[[Tlatoani|Hueyi Tlatoani]]'' of the city of [[Tenochtitlan]], son of princess [[Atotoztli II]]. His name literally means &quot;Water Thorny&quot; and was also applied to the otter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ahuítzotl, “El espinoso del agua” (1486-1502)|url=https://arqueologiamexicana.mx/mexico-antiguo/ahuitzotl-el-espinoso-del-agua-1486-1502|website=Archeologia Mexicana|language=Spanish |accessdate=June 4, 2019|trans-title=Ahuítzotl, &quot;Thorny Water&quot; (1486-1502)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was responsible for much of the expansion of the Mexica domain, and consolidated the empire's power after emulating his predecessor. He took power as [[Tlatoani]] in the year [[Aztec calendar|7 Rabbit]] (1486), after the death of his predecessor and brother, [[Tizoc]].

He had two sons, the kings [[Chimalpilli II]] and [[Cuauhtémoc]], and one daughter.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

==Biography==
Perhaps the greatest known military leader of [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]], Ahuizotl began his reign by suppressing a [[Huastec civilization|Huastec]] rebellion, and then swiftly more than doubled the size of lands under Aztec dominance. He conquered the [[Mixtec]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], and other peoples from [[Pacific Coast of Mexico]] down to the western part of [[Guatemala]]. Ahuizotl also supervised a major rebuilding of Tenochtitlan on a grander scale including the expansion of the Great Pyramid or [[Templo Mayor]] in the year [[Aztec calendar|8 Reed]] (1487).

He presided over the introduction of the [[great-tailed grackle]] into the Valley of Mexico, the earliest documented case of human-mediated bird introduction in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Introduction of the Great-tailed Grackle (''Quiscalus mexicanus'') by Aztec Emperor Auitzotl: Provenance of the historical account (La Introducción de la Quiscalus mexicanus por el Emperador Azteca Auitzotl: Origen del Relato Histórico)|first=Paul D.|last=Haemig|work=The Auk|volume=129|number=1|date=January 2012|pages=70–75|publisher=University of California Press|jstor=10.1525/auk.2011.11058|doi=10.1525/auk.2011.11058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahuizotl died in the year [[Aztec calendar|10 Rabbit]] (1502) and was succeeded by his nephew, [[Moctezuma II]].

Ahuizotl took his name from the [[Ahuizotl (mythology)|animal ahuizotl]], which the Aztecs considered to be a legendary creature in its own right rather than a mere mythical representation of the king.

==In popular culture==
Under the name Teomitl, Ahuitzotl is a primary character in the ''Obsidian and Blood'' series by [[Aliette de Bodard]], which are set in the last year of the reign of [[Axayacatl]] and the first years of the reign of [[Tizoc]].
In the historical fiction novel, &quot;Aztec&quot; by Gary Jennings, Ahuitzotl is a prominent character. Set in the time just before the arrival of the Spanish Conquistadors, it accounts his construction of the many expansions of Tenochtitlan, and wars of conquest, trade, and proclivities.
