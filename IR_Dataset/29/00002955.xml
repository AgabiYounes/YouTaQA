In [[chemistry]], an '''alkali''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|k|əl|aɪ}}; from [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''al-qaly'' &quot;ashes of the [[saltwort]]&quot;) is a [[base (chemistry)|basic]], [[ionic compound|ionic]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of an [[alkali metal]] or [[alkaline earth metal]] [[chemical element]]. An alkali also can be defined as a base that dissolves in [[water]]. A solution of a soluble base has a [[pH]] greater than 7.0. The [[adjective]] '''alkaline''' is commonly, and  '''alkalescent''' less often, used in [[English language|English]] as a [[synonym]] for basic, especially for bases soluble in water. This broad use of the term is likely to have come about because alkalis were the first bases known to obey the [[acid-base reaction theories#Arrhenius theory|Arrhenius]] definition of a base, and they are still among the most common bases.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;alkali&quot; is derived from Arabic ''al qalīy'' (or ''alkali''),&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated148&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Chambers's encyclopaedia]]: a dictionary of universal knowledge, Volume 1|publisher=J.B. Lippincott &amp; Co|year=1888|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning ''the calcined ashes'' (see [[calcination]]), referring to the original source of alkaline substances. A water-extract of burned plant ashes, called [[potash]] and composed mostly of potassium carbonate, was mildly basic. After heating this substance with [[calcium hydroxide]] (''slaked lime''), a far more strongly basic substance known as ''caustic potash'' ([[potassium hydroxide]]) was produced. Caustic potash was traditionally used in conjunction with animal fats to produce soft [[soap]]s, one of the caustic processes that rendered soaps from fats in the process of [[saponification]], one known since antiquity. Plant potash lent the name to the element [[potassium]], which was first derived from caustic potash, and also gave potassium its chemical symbol '''K''' (from the German name Kalium), which ultimately derived from al'''k'''ali.

==Common properties of alkalis and bases==
Alkalis are all Arrhenius bases, ones which form hydroxide ions (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) when dissolved in water. Common properties of alkaline aqueous [[solution]]s include:
* Moderately concentrated solutions (over 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; M) have a pH of 7.1 or greater. This means that they will turn [[phenolphthalein]] from colorless to pink.
* Concentrated solutions are [[Caustic (substance)|caustic]] (causing chemical burns).
* Alkaline solutions are slippery or soapy to the touch, due to the [[saponification]] of the fatty substances on the surface of the skin.
* Alkalis are normally [[solubility|water-soluble]], although some like [[barium carbonate]] are only soluble when reacting with an acidic aqueous solution.

==Difference between alkali and base==
The terms &quot;base&quot; and &quot;alkali&quot; are often used interchangeably, particularly outside the context of [[chemistry]] and [[chemical engineering]].

There are various more specific definitions for the concept of an alkali. Alkalis are usually defined as a subset of the bases. One of two subsets is commonly chosen.
* A basic salt of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=alkali Alkali | Define Alkali at Dictionary.com]. Dictionary.reference.com. Retrieved on 2012-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt; (This includes Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but excludes NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.)
* Any base that is soluble in water and forms hydroxide ions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/alkali alkali – definition of alkali by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia]. Thefreedictionary.com. Retrieved on 2012-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chung, L.H.M. (1997) [https://web.archive.org/web/20061124183909/http://www.wahyan.edu.hk/paulsir/handout/form4/4-05_Characteriscs_of_alkali.pdf &quot;Characteristics of Alkali&quot;], pp. 363–365 in ''Integrated Chemistry Today''. {{ISBN|9789623722520}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the solution of a base in water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krysstal.com/acidbase.html Acids, Bases and Salts]. KryssTal. Retrieved on 2012-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt; (This includes Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.)

The second subset of bases is also called an &quot;[[Acid–base reaction#Arrhenius theory|Arrhenius base]]&quot;.

==Alkali salts==

Alkali salts are soluble hydroxides of [[alkali metals]] and [[alkaline earth metals]], of which common examples are:

* [[Sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH) &amp;ndash; often called &quot;caustic soda&quot;
* [[Potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) &amp;ndash; commonly called &quot;caustic potash&quot;
* [[Lye]] &amp;ndash; generic term for either of two previous salts or their mixture
* [[Calcium hydroxide]] (Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;ndash; saturated solution known as &quot;[[limewater]]&quot;
* [[Magnesium hydroxide]] (Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;ndash; an atypical alkali since it has low solubility in water (although the dissolved portion is considered a strong base due to complete dissociation of its ions)

==Alkaline soil==
{{main|Alkali soil}}
Soils with pH values that are higher than 7.3 are usually defined as being alkaline. These soils can occur naturally, due to the presence of alkali salts. Although many plants do prefer slightly basic soil (including vegetables like [[cabbage]] and fodder like [[buffalo grass]]), most plants prefer a mildly acidic soil (with pHs between 6.0 and 6.8), and [[alkaline soil]]s can cause problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated148&quot;/&gt;

==Alkali lakes==

In [[Soda lake|alkali lake]]s (also called ''soda lakes''), evaporation concentrates the naturally occurring carbonate salts, giving rise to an alkalic and often saline lake.
