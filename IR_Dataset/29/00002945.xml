      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Sexual orientation}}
'''Romantic orientation''', also called '''affectional orientation''', indicates the [[sex]] or [[gender]] with which a person is most likely to have a [[romance (love)|romantic relationship]] or [[Falling in love|fall in love]]. It is used both alternatively and side-by-side with the term ''[[sexual orientation]]'', and is based on the perspective that [[sexual attraction]] is but a single component of a larger dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;Crethar, H. C. &amp; Vargas, L. A. (2007). ''Multicultural intricacies in professional counseling.'' In J. Gregoire &amp; C. Jungers (Eds.), The counselor’s companion: What every beginning counselor needs to know. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. {{ISBN|0-8058-5684-6}}. p.61.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, although a [[pansexuality|pansexual]] person may feel sexually attracted to people regardless of gender, they may experience romantic attraction and intimacy with women only.

For [[Asexuality|asexual]] people, romantic orientation is often considered a more useful measure of attraction than sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richards and Barker&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first1=Christina|last1= Richards|first2= Meg|last2= Barker|title=Sexuality and Gender for Mental Health Professionals: A Practical Guide|isbn=978-1-4462-9313-3|publisher=[[Sage Publications|SAGE]]|year=2013|pages=124–127|accessdate=July 3, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uSiXAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cerankowski and Milks&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first1=Karli June|last1=Cerankowski|first2= Megan|last2=Milks|title=Asexualities: Feminist and Queer Perspectives|isbn=978-1-134-69253-8|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2014|pages=89–93|accessdate=July 3, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zLgTAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between sexual attraction and romantic attraction is still under debate, and is not fully understood.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Houdenhove|first=Ellen Van|last2=Gijs|first2=Luk|last3=T'Sjoen|first3=Guy|last4=Enzlin|first4=Paul|date=April 21, 2014|title=Asexuality: A Multidimensional Approach|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|volume=52|issue=6|pages=669–678|doi=10.1080/00224499.2014.898015|issn=0022-4499|pmid=24750031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romantic identities==
People may or may not engage in purely emotional [[Romance (love)|romantic]] relationships. The main identities relating to this are:&lt;ref name=&quot;Richards and Barker&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cerankowski and Milks&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lgbtqia.ucdavis.edu/educated/glossary|title=LGBTQIA Resource Center Glossary {{!}} LGBTQIA Resource Center|website=lgbtqia.ucdavis.edu|access-date=2019-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthline.com/health/panromantic|title=Is Being Panromantic The Same Thing As Being Pansexual?|website=Healthline|access-date=2019-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with sexual orientation and asexuality==
The implications of the distinction between romantic and sexual orientations have not been fully recognized, nor have they been studied extensively.{{sfn|Bogaert|2012|p=14}} It is common for sources to describe sexual orientation as including components of both sexual and romantic (or romantic equivalent) attractions.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Bogaert|2012|p=14}} Publications investigating the relationship between sexual orientation and romantic orientation are limited.

==Aromanticism==
{{Redirect|Aromanticism|the album by Moses Sumney|Aromanticism (album)}}[[File:Aromantic Pride Flag.svg|thumb|Aromantic flag]]
One of the attributes of aromantic people is that, despite feeling no romantic attraction, they may still enjoy sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a9644122/aromantic-definition-meaning/ |title=What is Aromantic - Asexual vs. Aromantic Definition, Explained |publisher=Cosmopolitan.com |date=2017-05-12 |accessdate=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2019}} Aromantic people are not necessarily incapable of feeling love. For example, they may still feel familial love, or the type of [[platonic love]] that is expressed between friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.them.us/story/facts-you-should-know-about-aromantic-people|title=7 Facts You Should Know About Aromantic People|last=Plonski|first=Logan|website=them.|language=en|access-date=2020-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some aromantic people may claim that they are able to appreciate the type of love or romance that exists in popular culture, such as in movies, romantic books or songs, but only vicariously, and that they do not intuitively experience these feelings themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2018/02/12/youtuber-connie-glynn-aka-noodlerella-reveals-aromantic-7306105/ |title=YouTuber Connie Glynn aka Noodlerella reveals she's aromantic &amp;#124; Metro News |publisher=Metro.co.uk |date=2018-02-12 |accessdate=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some publications have argued that there is an underrepresentation of asexual and aromantic people in media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.themarysue.com/pop-culture-denies-aro-ace/ |title=How Pop Culture Denies Aromantic Asexual Existence |publisher=The Mary Sue |date=2016-02-19 |accessdate=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nicola Pardy |url=https://www.refinery29.uk/2016/06/113484/what-is-asexual-definition-experiences |title=What Is Asexual - People Share Asexuality Experiences |publisher=Refinery29.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that they are often misunderstood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Yeow Kai Chai |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/singer-songwriter-moses-sumney-does-not-mind-flying-the-freak-flag |title=Singer-songwriter Moses Sumney does not mind flying the freak flag, Entertainment News &amp; Top Stories |newspaper=The Straits Times |date=2017-10-04 |accessdate=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aromantic people often face stigma and are stereotyped with labels such as being afraid of intimacy, heartless, or deluded.&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Nivea Serrao |url=http://ew.com/books/2017/07/10/tash-hearts-tolstoy-interview/ |title=Tash Hearts Tolstoy author on depicting asexuality in YA fiction |magazine=EW.com |date=2017-07-10 |accessdate=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amatonormativity]], a concept that elevates romantic relationships over non-romantic relationships, has been said to be damaging to aromantics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wearyourvoicemag.com/more/culture/romance-not-universal-necessary |title=Romance is Not Universal, Nor is it Necessary |publisher=Wearyourvoicemag.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many aromantic people are [[asexuality|asexual]],&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian&quot;/&gt; but the term ''aromantic'' can be used in relation to various [[sexual identities]], such as aromantic bisexual, aromantic heterosexual, aromantic lesbian, aromantic gay man or aromantic asexual.&lt;ref&gt;Youth, Gender Creative. &quot;GLOSSARY OF TERMS: DEFINING A COMMON QUEER LANGUAGE.&quot; TEACHING, AFFIRMING, AND RECOGNIZING TRANS AND GENDER CREATIVE YOUTH: 299.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because aromanticism primarily deals with romantic attraction rather than with sexuality or with the [[libido]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pinto | first1 = Stacy Anne | year = 2014 | title = ASEXUally: On being an ally to the asexual community | url = | journal = Journal of LGBT Issues in Counseling | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 331–343 | doi = 10.1080/15538605.2014.960130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The antonym of aromanticism is alloromanticism, the state of experiencing romantic love or romantic attraction to others, while such a person is called an alloromantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/im-tired-of-my-queer-identity-being-ignored-erased-on-tv-66215 |title=I'm Tired Of My Queer Identity Being Ignored &amp; Erased On TV |publisher=Bustle.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; An informal term for an aromantic person is ''aro''.&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Josh Salisbury |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/11/meet-the-aromantics-not-cold-dont-have-romantic-feelings-sex |title=Meet the aromantics: 'I'm not cold – I just don't have any romantic feelings' &amp;#124; Life and style |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter &quot;A&quot; in the expanded [[LGBT]] acronym LGBTQIA+ stands for asexual, aromantic and agender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/equinox-gyms-pride-video-the-lgbtqalphabet-leaves-out-important-letter-63252|title=Equinox Gym's Pride Video 'The LGBTQ Alphabet' Leaves Out An Important Letter|last=Mercado|first=Mia|date=June 8, 2017|website=Bustle|publisher=Bustle.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/06/15/lgbtq-glossary-slang-ally-learn-language/101200092/ |title=LGBTQ definitions every good ally should know |publisher=Usatoday.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/04/16/what-does-lgbtqia-stand-for-the-inclusive-term-which-includes-questioning-intersex-and-asexual-and-allied-people/|title=This is what LGBTQIA actually stands for|date=2018-04-16|website=PinkNews - Gay news, reviews and comment from the world's most read lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans news service|access-date=2019-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
