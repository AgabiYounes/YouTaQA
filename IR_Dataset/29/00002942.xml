'''''A Little Night Music''''' is a [[Musical theatre|musical]] with music and lyrics by  [[Stephen Sondheim]] and book by [[Hugh Wheeler]]. Inspired by the [[Ingmar Bergman]] film ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]'', it involves the romantic lives of several couples. Its title is a literal English translation of the German name for [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Eine kleine Nachtmusik|Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major]], ''Eine kleine Nachtmusik''. The musical includes the popular song &quot;[[Send In the Clowns]]&quot;.

Since its original 1973 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, the musical has enjoyed professional productions in the [[West End theatre|West End]], by opera companies, in a 2009 Broadway revival, and elsewhere, and it is a popular choice for regional groups. It was [[A Little Night Music (film)|adapted for film in 1977]], with [[Harold Prince]] directing and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Lesley-Anne Down]], and [[Diana Rigg]] starring.

==Synopsis==
===Act One===
The setting is [[Sweden]], around the year 1900. One by one, the Quintet – five singers who comment like a [[Greek chorus]] throughout the show – enter, tuning up. Gradually, their vocalizing becomes an overture blending fragments of &quot;Remember&quot;, &quot;Soon&quot; and &quot;The Glamorous Life&quot;, leading into the first &quot;Night Waltz&quot;. The other characters enter [[waltz]]ing, each uncomfortable with her partner. After they drift back off, the aging and sardonic Madame Armfeldt and her solemn granddaughter, Fredrika, enter. Madame Armfeldt tells the child that the summer night &quot;smiles&quot; three times: first on the young, second on fools, and third on the old. Fredrika vows to watch the smiles occur. Middle-aged Fredrik Egerman is a successful lawyer. He has recently married an 18-year-old [[trophy wife]], Anne, a naive girl who loves Fredrik but is too immature to grasp the concept of marriage. The two have been married for eleven months, but Anne still protects her [[virginity]]. Fredrik plots how he might [[seduce]] his wife (&quot;Now&quot;). Meanwhile, his son Henrik, a [[seminary]] student a year older than his stepmother, is frustrated and ignored (&quot;Later&quot;). Anne promises her husband that shortly she will consent to have sex (&quot;Soon&quot;), which leads into all three of them lamenting at once. Anne's [[maidservant]] Petra, an experienced and forthright girl, slightly older than the teen herself, offers her worldly but crass advice.

Desiree Armfeldt is a prominent and glamorous actress who is now reduced to touring in small towns. Madam Armfeldt, Desiree's mother, has taken over the care of Desiree's daughter Fredrika. Fredrika misses her mother, but Desiree continually delays going to see her, preferring, somewhat ironically, &quot;The Glamorous Life&quot;. She is performing near Fredrik's home, and Fredrik brings Anne to see the play. While there, Desiree notices Fredrik in the audience; the two had been lovers years earlier. Anne, suspicious and annoyed at Desiree's amorous glances, demands that Fredrik take her home immediately. Meanwhile, Petra tries to seduce a nervous and petulant Henrik.

That night, as Fredrik remembers his past with Desiree, he sneaks out to see her; the two have a happy but strained reunion as they &quot;Remember&quot;. They reflect on their new lives, and Fredrik tries to explain how much he loves Anne (&quot;You Must Meet My Wife&quot;). Desiree responds sarcastically and boasts of her own adultery, as she has been seeing the married [[dragoon]], Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm. Upon learning that Fredrik has gone for eleven months without sex, she agrees to accommodate him as a favor for an old friend.

Madam Armfeldt offers advice to young Fredrika. The elderly woman reflects poignantly on her own checkered past, and wonders what happened to her refined &quot;Liaisons&quot;. Back in Desiree's apartment, Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm proclaims his unannounced arrival in his usual booming tones. Fredrik and Desiree fob off the Count with an innocent explanation for their disheveled appearance, but he is still suspicious. He instantly dislikes Fredrik and returns to his wife, Countess Charlotte. Charlotte is quite aware of her husband's infidelity, but Carl-Magnus is too absorbed in his suspicions of Desiree to talk to her (&quot;In Praise of Women&quot;). When she persuades him to blurt out the whole story, a twist is revealed&amp;mdash;Charlotte's little sister is a schoolfriend of Anne's.

Charlotte visits Anne and describes Fredrik's tryst with Desiree. Anne is shocked and saddened, but Charlotte explains that such is the lot of a wife, and love brings pain (&quot;Every Day a Little Death&quot;). Meanwhile, Desiree asks Madame Armfeldt to host a party for Fredrik, Anne and Henrik. Though reluctant, Madam Armfeldt agrees. She sends out a personal invitation; its receipt sends Anne into a frenzy, imagining &quot;A Weekend in the Country&quot; with the Armfeldts. Anne does not want to accept the invitation, but Charlotte convinces her to do so to heighten the contrast between the older woman and the young and beautiful teenager. Charlotte relates this to the Count, who (much to her chagrin) decides to visit the Armfeldts uninvited. Carl-Magnus plans to challenge Fredrik to a [[duel]], while Charlotte hopes to seduce the lawyer to make her husband jealous and end his philandering. The act ends as all characters set off to Madam Armfeldt's estate.

===Act Two===
Madam Armfeldt's country estate is bathed in the golden glow of perpetual summer sunset at this high latitude (&quot;Night Waltz One and Two&quot;). Everyone arrives, each with their own amorous purposes and desires—even Petra, who catches the eye of Armfeldt's fetching [[manservant]], Frid. The women begin to quarrel with one another. Fredrik is astonished to learn the name of Desiree's daughter. Henrik meets Fredrika, and confesses his deep love for Anne to her. Meanwhile, in the garden, Fredrik and Carl-Magnus reflect on how difficult it is to be annoyed with Desiree, agreeing &quot;It Would Have Been Wonderful&quot; had she not been quite so wonderful. Dinner is served, and the characters' &quot;Perpetual Anticipation&quot; enlivens the meal.

At dinner, Charlotte attempts to flirt with Fredrik, and trades insults with Desiree. Soon, everyone is shouting and scolding everyone else, except for Henrik, who finally speaks up. He accuses the whole company of being [[amorality|amoral]], and flees the scene. Stunned, everyone reflects on the situation and wanders away. Fredrika tells Anne of Henrik's secret love, and the two dash off searching for him. Meanwhile, Desiree meets Fredrik and asks if he still wants to be &quot;rescued&quot; from his life. Fredrik answers honestly that he loves Desiree, but cannot bring himself to part with Anne. Hurt and bitter, Desiree can only reflect on the nature of her life and relationship to Fredrik (&quot;[[Send In the Clowns]]&quot;). Anne finds Henrik, who is attempting to commit suicide. The clumsy boy cannot complete the task, and Anne tells him that she loves him, too. The pair begins to kiss, which leads to Anne's first sexual encounter. Meanwhile, not far away, Frid sleeps in Petra's lap. The maid imagines advantageous marriages, but concludes that in the meantime, &quot;a girl ought to celebrate what passes by&quot; (&quot;The Miller's Son&quot;). Charlotte confesses her plan to Fredrik, and both watch as Henrik and Anne, happy together, run away to start their new life. The two commiserate on a bench. Carl-Magnus, preparing to romance Desiree, sees this and challenges Fredrik to [[Russian Roulette]], at which a nervous Fredrik misfires and simply grazes his own ear. Victorious, Carl-Magnus begins to romance Charlotte, granting her wish at last.

After the Count and Countess leave, Fredrika and Madam Armfeldt discuss the chaos of the recent turns-of-events. The elderly woman then asks Fredrika a surprising question: &quot;What is it all for?&quot; Fredrika thinks about this, and decides that love, for all of its frustrations, &quot;must be worth it&quot;. Madam Armfeldt is surprised, ruefully noting that she rejected love for material wealth at Fredrika's age. She praises her granddaughter and remembers true love's fleeting nature.

Fredrik finally confesses his love for Desiree, acknowledging that Fredrika is his daughter, and the two promise to start a new life together (&quot;Send in the Clowns&quot; (Reprise)). Madam Armfeldt sits alone with Fredrika. Fredrika tells her grandmother that she has watched carefully, but still has not seen the night smile. Madam Armfeldt laughs and points out that the night has indeed smiled twice: first on Henrik and Anne, the young, and second on Desiree and Fredrik, the fools. As the two wait for the &quot;third smile... on the old&quot;, it occurs: Madam Armfeldt closes her eyes, and dies peacefully with Fredrika beside her.

The cast starred  [[Angela Lansbury]] as Madame Armfeldt and, in her Broadway debut, [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] as Desiree. Also featured were Alexander Hanson as Frederik,&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez, Ernio and Gans, Andrew.

===Europe===
[[Zarah Leander]] played Madame Armfeldt in the original Austrian staging (in 1975) as well as in the original Swedish staging in [[Stockholm]] in 1978 (here with [[Jan Malmsjö]] as Fredrik Egerman), performing &quot;Send In The Clowns&quot; and &quot;Liaisons&quot; in both stagings. The successful Stockholm staging was directed by [[Stig Olin]]. In 2010 the musical was scheduled to return to [[Stockholm]] and the Stockholm Stadsteater. The cast included [[Pia Johansson]], [[Dan Ekborg]], [[Yvonne Lombard]] and Thérese Andersson.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Opera companies===
The musical has also become part of the repertoire of a few opera companies. [[Michigan Opera Theatre]] was the first major American opera company to present the work in 1983, and again in November 2009. Light Opera Works (Evanston, IL) produced the work in August 1983. [[New York City Opera]] staged it in 1990, 1991 and 2003, the [[Houston Grand Opera]] in 1999, the [[Los Angeles Opera]] in 2004, and Hartford Opera Theater in 2014. New York City Opera's production in August 1990 and July 1991 (a total of 18 performances) won the 1990 [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival]] and was telecast on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] show ''Live at Lincoln Center'' on November 7, 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0359610/?ref_=rvi_tt |title=Imdb|accessdate=2014-11-20 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609214139/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0359610/?ref_=rvi_tt |archivedate=2015-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cast included both stage performers: [[Sally Ann Howes]] and George Lee Andrews as Desiree and Frederick and opera regular [[Regina Resnik]] as Madame Armfeldt (in 1991).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sondheimguide.com/night.html#1990NYCO 1990 New York City Opera Production] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513233106/http://www.sondheimguide.com/night.html |date=2017-05-13 }} sondheimguide.com, accessed October 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The 2003 production featured a young [[Anna Kendrick]] as Fredrika Armfeldt, alongside [[Jeremy Irons]] as Frederick, [[Juliet Stevenson]] as Desiree, [[Claire Bloom]] as Madame Armfeldt, [[Danny Gurwin]] as Henrik, [[Michele Pawk]] as Charlotte, and [[Marc Kudisch]] as Carl-Magnus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sondheimguide.com/night.html#2003NYCO 2003 New York City Opera Production] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513233106/http://www.sondheimguide.com/night.html |date=2017-05-13 }} sondheimguide.com, accessed October 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The production returned in 2010 at the Sydney Opera House with [[Anthony Warlow]] taking on the role of Fredrik Egerman. The production was directed by Stuart Maunder, designed by Roger Kirk, and conducted by Andrew Greene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opera-australia.org.au/scripts/nc.dll?OPRA:PRODUCTION:0:pc=PC_90107 ''A Little Night Music''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303061205/http://www.opera-australia.org.au/scripts/nc.dll?OPRA:PRODUCTION:0:pc=PC_90107 |date=2012-03-03 }}, [[Opera Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Opera Theatre of Saint Louis]] performed the musical in June 2010.

==Film adaptation==
{{Main|A Little Night Music (film)}}
A film version of ''[[A Little Night Music (1977 film)|A Little Night Music]]'' was released in 1977, starring [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Lesley-Anne Down]] and [[Diana Rigg]], with [[Len Cariou]], [[Hermione Gingold]] and [[Laurence Guittard]] reprising their Broadway roles. The setting for the film was moved from Sweden to Austria. [[Stephen Sondheim]] wrote lyrics for the &quot;Night Waltz&quot; theme (&quot;Love Takes Time&quot;) and wrote an entirely new version of &quot;The Glamorous Life&quot;, which has been incorporated into several subsequent productions of the stage musical. However, other songs, including &quot;In Praise of Women&quot;, &quot;The Miller's Son&quot; and &quot;Liaisons&quot;, were cut and remain heard only as background orchestrations. The film marked Broadway director [[Hal Prince]]'s second time as a motion picture director. Critical reaction to the film was mostly negative, with much being made of Taylor's wildly fluctuating weight from scene to scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Canby|first=Vincent|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/08/archives/film-a-little-night-musicbergmaninspired.html|title=Film: 'A Little Night Music': Bergman-Inspired|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 8, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics talked more positively of the film, with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' calling it &quot;an elegant looking, period romantic charade&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/1976/film/reviews/a-little-night-music-4-1200424049/|title=A Little Night Music|magazine=Variety|accessdate=May 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was praise for Diana Rigg's performance, and orchestrator [[Jonathan Tunick]] received an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for his work on the score. A soundtrack recording was released on LP, and a DVD release was issued in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0076319|title=A Little Night Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music analysis==
The score for ''A Little Night Music'' has elements not often found in musical theater, presenting challenges for performers, with complex meters, pitch changes, polyphony, and high notes for both males and females. The difficulty is heightened when songs merge, as in &quot;Now&quot;/&quot;Later&quot;/&quot;Soon&quot;, because all three have to be performed in the same key, limiting the ability to pick a comfortable key for each singer. Critic [[Rex Reed]] noted that &quot;The score of 'Night Music' ...contains patter songs, contrapuntal duets and trios, a quartet, and even a dramatic double quintet to puzzle through. All this has been gorgeously orchestrated by Jonathan Tunick; there is no rhythm section, only strings and woodwinds to carry the melodies and harmonies aloft.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, Didier C.[http://www.masterworksbroadway.com/music/a-little-night-music &quot;'A Little Night Music' Liner Notes, Song List and Synopsis&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105094459/http://www.masterworksbroadway.com/music/a-little-night-music |date=2011-01-05 }} masterworksbroadway.com, retrieved June 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Sondheim's engagement with threes extends to his lyrics. He organizes trios with the singers separated, while his duets are sung together, about a third person.&lt;ref name=&quot;tunick&quot; /&gt;

The work is performed as an [[operetta]] in many professional opera companies. For example, it was added to the [[New York City Opera]] Company repertoire in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Kay. &quot;Broadway Musicals, Show By Show&quot; (1996).

===Counterpoint and polyphony===
At several points, Sondheim has multiple performers each sing a different song simultaneously. This use of [[counterpoint]] maintains coherence even as it extends the notion of a [[round (music)|round]], familiar in songs such as the traditional &quot;[[Frère Jacques]]&quot;, into something more complex. Sondheim said: &quot;As for the three songs ... going together well, I might as well confess. In those days I was just getting into contrapuntal and choral writing...and I wanted to develop my technique by writing a trio. What I didn't want to do is the [[quodlibet]] method...wouldn't it be nice to have three songs you don't think are going to go together, and they do go together ... The trick was the little [[vamp (music)|vamp]] on &quot;Soon&quot; which has five-and six-note chords.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;swayne&quot;&gt;Swayne, Steve. ''How Sondheim Found His Sound'', University of Michigan Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-472-03229-1}}, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Swayne comments that the &quot;contrapuntal episodes in the extended ensembles ... stand as testament to his interest in Counterpoint.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;swayne&quot; /&gt;

===&quot;Send In The Clowns&quot;===
The show's best-known and Sondheim's biggest hit song was almost an afterthought, written several days before the start of out-of-town tryouts.&lt;ref&gt;Citron, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; Sondheim initially conceived Desiree as a role for a more or less non-singing actress. When he discovered that the original Desiree, [[Glynis Johns]], was able to sing (she had a &quot;small, silvery voice&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;secrest&quot;&gt;Secrest, Meryle. &quot;Stephen Sondheim: A Life&quot; (1998). Dell Publishing. {{ISBN|0-385-33412-5}}, pp. 251–252&lt;/ref&gt; but could not &quot;sustain a phrase&quot;, he devised the song &quot;[[Send in the Clowns]]&quot; for her in a way that would work around her vocal weakness, e.g., by ending lines with consonants that made for a short cut-off.&lt;ref name=&quot;secrest&quot; /&gt; &quot;It is written in short phrases in order to be acted rather than sung ... tailor-made for Glynis Johns, who lacks the vocal power to sustain long phrases.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sondheim, S., Shevelove, B., Gelbart, L., Wheeler, H., and Lapine, J.  &quot;Four by Sondheim, Wheeler, Lapine, Shevelove and Gelbart&quot; (2000). Hal Leonard Corporation. {{ISBN|1-55783-407-5}}, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

In analyzing the text of the song, [[Max Cryer]] wrote that it &quot;is not intended to be sung by the young in love, but by a mature performer who has seen it all before. The song remains an anthem to regret for unwise decisions in the past and recognition that there's no need to send in the clowns – they're already here.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cryer, Max. ''Love Me Tender: The Stories Behind the World's Best-loved Frances Lincoln Ltd, 2008, {{ISBN|0-7112-2911-2}}, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham Wolfe has argued, &quot;What Desirée is referring to in the famous song is a conventional device to cover over a moment when something has gone wrong on stage. Midway through the second Act she has deviated from her usual script by suggesting to Fredrik the possibility of being together seriously and permanently, and, having been rejected, she falters ''as'' a show-person, finds herself bereft of the capacity to improvise and wittily cover. If Desirée could perform at this moment – revert to the innuendos, one-liners and blithe self-referential humour that constitutes her normal character – all would be well. She cannot, and what follows is an exemplary manifestation of Sondheim’s musico-dramatic complexity, his inclination to write music that performs drama. That is, what needs to be covered over (by the clowns sung about in the song) is the very intensity, ragged emotion and utter vulnerability that comes forward through the music and singing itself, a display protracted to six minutes, wrought with exposed silences, a shocked Fredrik sitting so uncomfortably before Desirée while something much too real emerges in a realm where he – and his audience – felt assured of performance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Graham. &quot;Sondheim's ''A Little Night Music'': Reconciling the Comic and the Sublime.&quot; ''Studies in Musical Theatre'' 8.2 (2014): 143–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===
There is a [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] reference in the title&amp;mdash;''A Little Night Music'' is an occasionally-used translation of ''[[Eine kleine Nachtmusik]]'', the nickname of Mozart's [[Serenade No. 13 (Mozart)|Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major]], [[Köchel catalogue|K.]] 525. The elegant, [[harmony|harmonically]]-advanced music in this musical pays indirect homage to the compositions of [[Maurice Ravel]], especially his ''[[Valses nobles et sentimentales (Ravel)|Valses nobles et sentimentales]]''&lt;ref&gt;Citron, Stephen. pp. 200, 203&lt;/ref&gt; (whose opening chord is borrowed for the opening chord of the song &quot;Liaisons&quot;); part of this effect stems from the style of orchestration that [[Jonathan Tunick]] used. There is also a direct quotation in 'A Weekend in the Country' (just as it moves to A{{music|b}} major) of Octavian's theme from Strauss' 'Der Rosenkavalier', another comedy of manners with partner-swapping at its heart.

In his review of the original 1973 Broadway production, [[Clive Barnes]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the musical &quot;heady, civilized, sophisticated and enchanting.&quot; He noted that &quot;the real triumph belongs to Stephen Sondheim...the music is a celebration of 3/4 time, an orgy of plaintively memorable waltzes, all talking of past loves and lost worlds...There is a peasant touch here.&quot; He commented that the lyrics are &quot;breathtaking&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Clive, &quot;The Theater:'A Little Night Music&quot;, ''The New York Times'', February 26, 1973, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

In its review of the 1989 London revival, the reviewer for ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that the &quot;production also strikes me as infinitely superior to Harold Prince's 1975 version at the Adelphi. Mr Judge's great innovation is to transform the Liebeslieder Singers from the evening-dressed, after-dinner line-up into 18th century ghosts weaving in and out of the action...But Mr Judge's other great realisation is that, in Sondheim, the lyrics are not an adornment to a song but their very essence: understand them and the show will flow. Thus Dorothy Tutin as Desiree, the touring thesp eventually reunited with her quondam lover, is not the melting romantic of previous productions but a working mother with the sharpness of a hat-pin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Billington, Michael. &quot;Arts: Night of the short memories - 'A Little Night Music'&quot;, ''The Guardian'' (London)., October 23, 1989 (no page number)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'' review of the 1995 National Theatre revival praised the production, writing &quot;For three hours of gloriously barbed bliss and bewitchment, Sean Mathias's production establishes the show as a minor miracle of astringent worldly wisdom and one that is haunted by less earthy intimations.&quot; The review went on to state that &quot;The heart of the production, in both senses, is Judi Dench's superb Desiree Armfeldt...Her husky-voiced rendering of &quot;Send in the Clowns&quot; is the most moving I've ever heard.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Paul and Seckerson, Edward.[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/double-take-reviews-a-little-night-music-1603205.html &quot;Double Take: Reviews: 'A Little Night Music'&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116184311/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/double-take-reviews-a-little-night-music-1603205.html |date=2017-01-16 }}''Independent', September 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing the 2008 Menier Chocolate Factory production, the ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]]'' reviewer wrote that &quot;Sondheim's lyrics are often superbly witty, his music here, mostly in haunting waltz-time, far more accessible than is sometimes the case. The score positively throbs with love, regret and desire.&quot; But of the specific production, the reviewer went on to note: &quot;But Nunn's production, on one of those hermetic sets largely consisting of doors and tarnished mirrors that have become such a cliché in recent years, never penetrates the work's subtly erotic heart. And as is often the case with this director's work, the pace is so slow and the mood so reverent, that initial enchantment gives way to bored fidgeting.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph&quot; /&gt;

In his ''New York Times'' review of the 2009 Broadway production, [[Ben Brantley]] noted that &quot;the expression that hovers over Trevor Nunn's revival...feels dangerously close to a smirk...It is a smirk shrouded in shadows. An elegiac darkness infuses this production.&quot; The production is &quot;sparing on furniture and heavy on shadows&quot;, with &quot;a scaled-down orchestra at lugubriously slowed-down tempos...&quot; He goes on to write that &quot;this somber, less-is-more approach could be effective were the ensemble plugged into the same rueful sensibility. But there is only one moment in this production when all its elements cohere perfectly. That moment, halfway through the first act, belongs to Ms. Lansbury, who has hitherto been perfectly entertaining, playing Madame Armfeldt with the overripe aristocratic condescension of a Lady Bracknell. Then comes her one solo, &quot;Liaisons&quot;, in which her character thinks back on the art of love as a profession in a gilded age, when sex 'was but a pleasurable means to a measurable end.' Her face, with its glamour-gorgon makeup, softens, as Madame Armfeldt seems to melt into memory itself, and the wan stage light briefly appears to borrow radiance from her. It's a lovely example of the past reaching out to the present...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/14/theater/reviews/14little.html|title=A Weekend in the Country With Eros and Thanatos|last=Brantley|first=Ben|date=2009-12-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313085109/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/14/theater/reviews/14little.html|archivedate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Suskin, reviewing the new Broadway cast for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', wrote &quot;What a difference a diva makes. Bernadette Peters steps into the six-month-old revival of ''A Little Night Music'' with a transfixing performance, playing it as if she realizes her character's onstage billing -- &quot;the one and only Desiree Armfeldt&quot;—is cliched hyperbole. By figuratively rolling her eyes at the hype, Peters gives us a rich, warm and comedically human Desiree, which reaches full impact when she pierces the facade with a nakedly honest, tears-on-cheek 'Send in the Clowns.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2010/legit/news/a-little-night-music-1117943265/|title=Review: 'A Little Night Music'|last=Suskin|first=Steven|date=2010-08-02|work=Variety|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en-US|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180209025532/https://variety.com/2010/legit/news/a-little-night-music-1117943265/|archivedate=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
