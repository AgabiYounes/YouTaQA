The [[ethnogenesis]] of the [[Origin of the Albanians|Albanians]] and their [[Albanian language|language]] is a matter of controversy among [[historian]]s and [[ethnologist]]s.

The history of the [[Albanian diaspora]] is centuries old and has its roots in migration from the [[Middle Ages]] initially established in [[Southern Europe]] and subsequently on across other parts of Europe and the [[New World]]. Between the 13th and 18th centuries, sizeable numbers of Albanians migrated to escape either various social, economic or political difficulties.{{efn|See:&lt;ref name=&quot;Riehl238&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Riehl|2010|p=238}}. &quot;Other interesting groups in the context of European migration include the Albanians who from the thirteenth century immigrated to Greece (i.e., the so-called &quot;Arvanites&quot;, see Sasse 1998) and to Southern Italy (Calabria, Sicily, cf Breu 2005).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nasse2426&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gogonas3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall2829&quot;/&gt;}}

One population, the [[Arvanites]], settled [[Southern Greece]] between the 13th and 16th centuries assimilating into and now [[Hellenization|self-identifying]] as Greeks.{{efn|See:&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall2829&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bintliff137138&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Liakos230&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Liakos|2012|p=230}}. &quot;The term &quot;Arvanite&quot; is the medieval equivalent of &quot;Albanian.&quot; it is retained today for the descendants of the Albanian tribes that migrated to the Greek lands during a period covering two centuries, from the thirteenth to the fifteenth.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Liotta198&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pappas28&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Pappas}}. para. 28. &quot;While the bulk of stradioti rank and file were of Albanian origin from Greece, by the middle of the 16th century there is evidence that many had become Hellenized or even Italianized... Hellenization was perhaps well on its way prior to service abroad, since Albanian stradioti had settled in Greek lands for two generations prior to their emigration to Italy. Since many served under Greek commanders and served together with Greek stradioti, the process continued. Another factor in this assimilative process was the stradioti's and their families' active involvement and affiliation with the Greek Orthodox or Uniate Church communities in Naples, Venice and elsewhere. Hellenization thus occurred as a result of common service and church affiliation.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VeremisKolipoulos2425&quot;/&gt;}} Another population who emerged as the [[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]] settled [[Sicily]] and [[Southern Italy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nasse2426&quot;/&gt; Smaller populations such as the [[Arbanasi people|Arbanasi]] whose migration dates back to the 18th century are located in [[Dalmatia|Southern Croatia]] and scattered across [[Ukraine|Southern Ukraine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barancic551&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Barančić|2008|p=551}}. &quot;Možemo reći da svi na neki način pripadamo nekoj vrsti etničke kategorije, a često i više nego jednoj. Kao primjer navodim slučaj zadarskih Arbanasa. Da bismo shvatili Arbanase i problem njihova etnojezičnog (etničkog i jezičnog) identiteta, potrebno je ići u povijest njihova doseljenja koje seže u početak 18. st., tj. točnije: razdoblje od prve seobe 1726., razdoblje druge seobe od 1733., pa sve do 1754. godine koja se smatra završnom godinom njihova doseljenja. Svi su se doselili iz tri sela s područja Skadarskog jezera – Briske, Šestana i Livara. Bježeći od Turaka, kuge i ostalih nevolja, generalni providur Nicola Erizzo II dozvolio im je da se nasele u područje današnjih Arbanasa i Zemunika. Jedan dio stanovništva u Zemuniku se asimilirao s ondašnjim stanovništvom zaboravivši svoj jezik. To su npr. današnji Prenđe, Šestani, Ćurkovići, Paleke itd. Drugi dio stanovništva je nastojao zadržati svoj etnički i jezični identitet tijekom ovih 280 godina. Dana 10. svibnja 2006. godine obilježena je 280. obljetnica njihova dolaska u predgrađe grada Zadra. Nije bilo lako, osobito u samom početku, jer nisu imali svoju crkvu, škole itd., pa je jedini način održavanja njihova identiteta i jezika bio usmenim putem. We can say that all in some way belong to a kind of ethnic category, and often more than one. As an example, I cite the case of Zadar Arbanasi. To understand the problem of the Albanians and their ethnolinguistic (ethnic and linguistic) identity, it is necessary to go into the history of their immigration that goes back to the beginning of the 18th century., etc more precisely: the period from the first migration of 1726, the period of the second migration of 1733, and until 1754, which is considered to be the final year of their immigration. All they moved from three villages from the area of Lake Scutari – Briska, Šestan and Livara. Fleeing from the Ottomans, plague and other troubles, the general provider Nicola Erizzo II allowed them to settle in the area of today's Arbanasa and Zemunik. One part of the population in Zemunik became assimilated with the local population, forgetting their language. These are for example, today's Prenda, Šestani, Ćurkovići, Paleke etc. The second part of the population tried to maintain their ethnic and linguistic identity during these 280 years. On May 10, 2006 marked the 280th anniversary of their arrival in the suburb of Zadar. It was not easy, especially in the beginning, because they did not have their own church, school, etc., and is the only way to maintain their identity and language was verbally.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Novik261262&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Novik|2015|pp=261–262}}. &quot;Historical Facts. Four villages with Albanian population are located in the Ukraine: Karakurt (Zhovtnevoe) set up in 1811 (Odessa region), Tyushki (Georgievka), Dzhandran (Gammovka) and Taz (Devninskoe) set up in 1862 (Zaporizh’a region). Before migrating to the territory of the Russian empire, Albanians had moved from the south-east of the present day Albania into Bulgaria (Varna region) because of the Osmanli invasion (Державин, 1914, 1926, 1933, 1948, pp. 156–169). Three hundred years later they had moved from Bulgaria to the Russian empire on account of Turkish-Russian opposition in the Balkan Peninsula. Ethnic Albanians also live in Moldova, Odessa and St. Petersburg. Present Day Situation. Nowadays, in the Ukraine and Russia there are an estimated 5000 ethnic Albanians. They live mainly in villages situated in the Odessa and Zaporizh’a regions. The language and many elements of traditional culture are still preserved and maintained in four Albanian villages (Будина, 2000, pp. 239–255; Иванова, 2000, pp. 40–53). From the ethnolinguistic and linguistic point of view these Albanian villages are of particular interest and value since they are excellent examples of a &quot;melting pot&quot; (Иванова, 1995, 1999). Bulgarians and Gagauzes live side by side with Albanians in Karakurt; Russians and Ukrainians share the same space with Albanians in the Azov Sea region. It is worth mentioning that in these multi-lingual environments, the Albanian patois retains original Balkan features.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[Great Schism of 1054]] formalised the break of communion between the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Western Catholic Church]] and was instantly reflected in Albania through the emergence of a Catholic north and Orthodox south. Inhabiting the west of [[Lake Ochrida]] and the upper valley of [[Shkumbin|River Shkumbin]], the Albanians established the [[Principality of Arbanon]] in 1190 with the capital in [[Krujë]]. In the 13th century, the [[Ghegs]] converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] in larger numbers from [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] as a means to resist the [[Slavs|Slavic]] [[Serbs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stavrianos498&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm1910&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramet381&quot;/&gt;

In the 15th century, the [[Fall of Constantinople|expanding]] [[Ottoman Empire]] overpowered the Balkan Peninsula and so the Albanians. Their consequent [[Albania under the Ottoman Empire|resistance]] to Ottoman expansion into Europe led by [[Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg]] won them acclaim all over Europe. In the 17th and 18th centuries, a substantial number of Albanians [[Islamisation of Albania|converted]] to [[Islam]] offering them equal opportunities and advancement within the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vickers2011&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Giakoumis8788&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Myhill 2006 232&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Koti1617&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramet203204&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Skendi1956321323&quot;/&gt; Hence, they attained significant positions and culturally contributed to the broader [[Muslim world]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clayer&quot;/&gt;

The Ottomans had cut the Albanians off from significant European intellectual [[Cultural movement|movement]]s, amongst them the [[Renaissance]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and these ideas together with the ideals of [[Nationalism]] traditionally began to penetrate the Albanians through the [[Albanian diaspora]] conclusively leading to the [[Albanian Renaissance]] which was also incorporated with the influences of [[Romanticism]].

During the [[Balkan Wars]], the Albanians were [[Partition (politics)|partitioned]] between [[Independent Albania]], Greece, Montenegro, and Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bell|first1=Imogen |title=Central and South-Eastern Europe 2003|date=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781857431360|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4CrpzRJCbckC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Second World War]] until the [[Fall of communism in Albania|Revolutions of 1991]], Albania was governed by a [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|communist government]] launching the Albanians on a path of oppression and decades of isolation. Though in neighbouring [[Yugoslavia]], Albanians underwent periods of [[discrimination]] that concluded with the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia]] and eventually the [[Independence of Kosovo]].

The Albanians ({{lang-sq|Shqiptarët}}) and their country Albania ({{lang-sq|Shqipëria}}) have been identified by many [[ethnonym]]s. The most common native [[ethnonym]] is &quot;Shqiptar&quot;, plural &quot;Shqiptarë&quot;; the name &quot;Albanians&quot; ([[Byzantine Greek]]: ''Albanoi/Arbanitai/Arbanites''; [[Latin]]: ''Albanenses/Arbanenses'') was used in medieval documents, that gradually entered [[European Languages|European languages]] from which other similar derivative names emerged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsie200534&quot;/&gt;

From these ethnonyms, names for Albanians were also derived in other languages, that were or still are in use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloshi277&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BardhylDemiraj534&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kamusella241&quot;/&gt; In [[English language|English]] &quot;Albanians&quot;; [[Italian language|Italian]] &quot;Albanesi&quot;; [[German language|German]] &quot;Albaner&quot;; [[Greek language|Greek]] &quot;Arvanites&quot;, &quot;Alvanitis&quot; (Αλβανίτης) plural: &quot;Alvanites&quot; (Αλβανίτες), &quot;Alvanos&quot; (Αλβανός) plural: &quot;Alvanoi&quot; (Αλβανοί); [[Turkish language|Turkish]] &quot;Arnaut&quot;, &quot;Arnavut&quot;; [[South Slavic languages]] &quot;Arbanasi&quot; (Арбанаси), &quot;Albanci&quot; (Албанци); [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] &quot;Arbineş&quot; and so on.{{efn|See:&lt;ref name=&quot;Liotta198&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Liotta|2001|p=198}}. &quot;Among Greeks, the term &quot;Alvanitis&quot;—or &quot;Arvanitis&quot;—means a Christian of Albanian ancestry, one who speaks both Greek and Albanian, but possesses Greek &quot;consciousness.&quot; Numerous &quot;Arvanites&quot; live in Greece today, although the ability to speak both languages is shrinking as the differences (due to technology and information access and vastly different economic bases) between Greece and Albania increase. The Greek communities of Elefsis, Marousi, Koropi, Keratea, and Markopoulo (all in the Attikan peninsula) once held significant Arvanite communities. &quot;Arvanitis&quot; is not necessarily a pejorative term; a recent Pan Hellenic socialist foreign minister spoke both Albanian and Greek (but not English).

Among the neighbouring peoples and elsewhere the denomination of the Albanians is based upon the root arb/alb, cp.

The term &quot;Albanoi&quot; (Αλβανοί) is first encountered twice in the works of Byzantine historian [[Michael Attaliates]], and the term &quot;Arvanitai&quot; (Αρβανίται) is used once by the same author.

The ethnonym ''Albanian'' has been hypothesized to be connected to and stem from the ''[[Albanoi]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Vasiliev613&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Vasiliev|1958|p=613}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jelavich25&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Jelavich|1983|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ShabanDemiraj481&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Demiraj|1998|p=481}}.&lt;/ref&gt; an Illyrian tribe mentioned by [[Ptolemy]] with their centre at the city of [[Albanopolis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloshi277&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MënikuCampos2&quot;/&gt; Linguists believe that the ''alb'' part in the root word originates from an Indo-European term for a type of mountainous topography, from which other words such as ''[[alps]]'' are derived.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm29&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Malcolm|1998|p=29}}. &quot;Linguists believe that the ‘Alb-’ element comes from the Indo-European word for a type of mountainous terrain, from which the word ‘Alps’ is also derived.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Through the root word ''alban'' and its rhotacized equivalents ''arban'', ''albar'', and ''arbar'', the term in Albanian became rendered as ''Arbëneshë/Arbëreshë'' for the people and ''Arbënia/Arbëria'' for the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsie200534&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2005|pp=3–4}}. &quot;Their traditional designation, based on a root *''alban''- and its rhotacized variants *''arban''-, *''albar''-, and *''arbar''-, appears from the eleventh century onwards in Byzantine chronicles (''Albanoi'', ''Arbanitai'', ''Arbanites''), and from the fourteenth century onwards in Latin and other Western documents (''Albanenses'', ''Arbanenses'').&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloshi277&quot;/&gt; The Albanian language was referred to as ''Arbnisht'' and ''Arbërisht''.&lt;ref name=&quot;MënikuCampos2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Mëniku|Campos|2012|p=2}}. &quot;Albanian is an Indo-European language, but like modern Greek and Armenian, it does not have any other closely related living language. Within the Indo-European family, it forms a group of its own. In Albanian, the language is called shqip. Albania is called ''Shqipëri'', and the Albanians call themselves ''shqiptarë''. Until the fifteenth century the language was known as ''Arbërisht'' or ''Arbnisht'', which is still the name used for the language in Italy and Greece. The Greeks refer to all the varieties of Albanian spoken in Greece as Arvanitika. In the second century AD, Ptolemy, the Alexandrian mathematician, astronomer and geographer, used the name ''Albanoi'' to refer to an Illyrian tribe that used to live in what is now central Albania. During the Middle Ages the population of that area was referred to as ''Arbanori'' or ''Albanon''. It is clear that the words ''Arbëresh'', ''Arvanitika'', and even ''Albanian'' and ''Albania'' are all related to the older name of the language.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[exonym]] Albania for the general region inhabited by the Albanians does have connotations to Classical Antiquity, the Albanian language employs a different ethnonym, with modern Albanians referring to themselves as ''Shqip(ë)tarë'' and to their country as ''Shqipëria''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloshi277&quot;/&gt; Two etymologies have been proposed for this ethnonym: one, derived from the etymology from the Albanian word for eagle (shqipe, var., shqiponjë).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kamusella241&quot;/&gt; In Albanian [[folk etymology]], this word denotes a bird [[totem]], dating from the times of Skanderbeg as displayed on the [[Albanian flag]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kamusella241&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ej2-s&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=ALBANCI | encyclopedia =[[Enciklopedija Jugoslavije]] 2nd ed. | volume=Supplement | pages=1 | publisher=[[JLZ]] | location=[[Zagreb]] | year=1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is within scholarship that connects it to the verb 'to speak' (''me shqiptue'') from the Latin &quot;''excipere''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kamusella241&quot;/&gt; In this instance the Albanian endonym like ''[[Slav (ethnonym)|Slav]]'' [[Endonym#Tendencies in the development of exonyms|and others]] would originally have been a term connoting &quot;those who speak [intelligibly, the same language]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kamusella241&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kamusella|2009|p=241}}. &quot;Prior to the emergence of the modern self-ethnonym ''Shqiptarë'' in the mid-16th century (for the first time it was recorded in 1555 by the Catholic Gheg, Gjon Buzuku, in his missal), North Albanians (Ghegs) referred to themselves as ''Arbën'', and South Albanians (Tosks) ''Arbër''. Hence, the self-ethnonym ''Arbëreshë'' of the present-day Italo-Albanians (numbering about 100,000) in southern Italy and Sicily, whose ancestors, in the wake of the Ottoman wars, emigrated from their homeland in the 14th century. These self-ethnonyms perhaps influenced the Byzantine Greek Arvanites for ‘Albanians,’ which was followed by similar ones in Bulgarian and Serbian (''Arbanasi''), Ottoman (''Arnaut''), Romanian (''Arbănas''), and Aromanian (''Arbineş''). It is clear that scholars and Albanians themselves agree that they do not agree on any single etymology of the ethnonym ‘Albanian.’ A similar predicament is faced by the self-ethnonym ''Shqiptarë''. The most popular scholarly explanation is that it was formed by analogy to ‘Slavs’ (*''Slovene''), believed to be derived from ''slovo'' (‘word’), and by extension, from *''sluti'' (‘to speak clearly.’) The last explanation semantically contrasts with Slavic ''Niemiec'' (‘mute,’‘stammering,’‘babbling’), and Greek ‘barbarian’ (from ''barbaros'' ‘those who stammer, babble’). Hence, ''Shqiptarë'' could be derived from Albanian ''shqipoi'' (from Latin ''excipere'') for ‘to speak clearly, to understand.’ The Albanian public favors the belief that their self-ethnonym stems from ''shqipe'' (‘eagle’) found on the Albanian national flag.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The words ''Shqipëri'' and ''Shqiptar'' are attested from 14th century onward,&lt;ref name=Matasović&gt;{{cite book|last=Matasović|first=Ranko|year=2019|title=A Grammatical Sketch of Albanian for Students of Indo European|url=http://mudrac.ffzg.unizg.hr/~rmatasov/Albanian.pdf|place=Zagreb|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was only at the end of 17th and beginning of the early 18th centuries that the placename ''Shqipëria'' and the ethnic demonym ''Shqiptarë'' gradually replaced ''Arbëria'' and ''Arbëreshë'' amongst [[Albanian language|Albanian]] speakers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloshi277&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Matasović /&gt; That era brought about religious and other sociopolitical changes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloshi277&quot;/&gt; As such a new and generalised response by Albanians based on ethnic and linguistic consciousness to this new and different [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman world]] emerging around them was a change in ethnonym.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloshi277&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Lloshi|1999|p=277}}. &quot;The Albanians of today call themselves ''shqiptarë'', their country ''Shqipëri'', and their language ''shqipe''. These terms came into use between the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th centuries. Foreigners call them ''albanesi'' (Italian), ''Albaner'' (German), ''Albanians'' (English), ''Alvanos'' (Greek), and ''Arbanasi'' (old Serbian), the country ''Albania'', ''Albanie'', ''Albanien'', ''Alvania'', and ''Albanija'', and the language ''Albanese'', ''Albanisch'', ''Albanian'', ''Alvaniki'', and ''Arbanashki'' respectively. All these words are derived from the name ''Albanoi'' of an Illyrian tribe and their center ''Albanopolis'', noted by the astronomer of Alexandria, Ptolemy, in the 2nd century AD. ''Alban'' could be a plural of ''alb''- ''arb''-, denoting the inhabitants of the plains (ÇABEJ 1976). The name passed over the boundaries of the Illyrian tribe in central Albania, and was generalised for all the Albanians. They called themselves ''arbënesh'', ''arbëresh'', the country ''Arbëni'', ''Arbëri'', and the language ''arbëneshe'', ''arbëreshe''. In the foreign languages, the Middle Ages denominations of these names survived, but for the Albanians they were substituted by ''shqiptarë'', ''Shqipëri'' and ''shqipe''. The primary root is the adverb ''shqip'', meaning &quot;clearly, intelligibly&quot;. There is a very close semantic parallel to this in the German noun ''Deutsche'', &quot;the Germans&quot; and &quot;the German language&quot; (Lloshi 1984) Shqip spread out from the north to the south, and ''Shqipni/Shqipëri'' is probably a collective noun, following the common pattern of ''Arbëni'', ''Arbëri''. The change happened after the Ottoman conquest because of the conflict in the whole line of the political, social, economic, religious, and cultural spheres with a totally alien world of the Oriental type. A new and more generalised ethnic and linguistic consciousness of all these people responded to this.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical records ===
{{see also|Origin of the Albanians}}

Little is known about the Albanian people prior to the 11th century, though a text compiled around the beginning of the 11th century in the [[Bulgarian language]] contains possibly a reference to the Albanian people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsie3&quot;/&gt; It is preserved in a [[manuscript]] written in the [[Serbo-Croatian Language|Serbo-Croatian language]] traced back to the 17th century but published in the 20th century by Radoslav Grujic. It is a fragment of a once longer text that endeavours to explain the origins of peoples and languages in a question-and-answer form similar to a [[catechism]].

The fragmented manuscript differentiated the world into seventy-two languages and three religious categories including [[Christians]], half-believers and non-believers. Grujic dated it to the early 11th century and if this and the identification of the Arbanasi, as Albanians, are correct it would be the earliest written document referring to the Albanian people as a people or language group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsie3&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2003|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It can be seen that there are various languages on earth. Of them, there are five Orthodox languages: [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], Syrian, Iberian ([[Georgian language|Georgian]]) and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Three of these have Orthodox alphabets: Greek, Bulgarian and Iberian. There are twelve languages of half-believers: Alamanians, [[Franks]], Magyars ([[Hungarians]]), Indians, Jacobites, [[Armenians]], [[Saxons]], Lechs ([[Poles]]), '''Arbanasi''' (Albanians), [[Croatians]], Hizi and [[Germans]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first undisputed mention of Albanians in the historical record is attested in Byzantine source for the first time in 1079–1080, in a work titled ''History'' by Byzantine historian [[Michael Attaliates]], who referred to the ''Albanoi'' as having taken part in a revolt against [[Constantinople]] in 1043 and to the ''Arbanitai'' as subjects of the duke of [[Durrës|Dyrrachium]]. It is disputed, however, whether the &quot;Albanoi&quot; of the events of 1043 refers to Albanians in an ethnic sense or whether &quot;Albanoi&quot; is a reference to [[Normans]] from [[Sicily]] under an archaic name (there was also a tribe in Italy by the name of &quot;Albanoi&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;MadgearuGordon25b&quot;/&gt; However a later reference to Albanians from the same Attaleiates, regarding the participation of Albanians in a rebellion around 1078, is undisputed.&lt;ref name=&quot;MadgearuGordon25&quot;/&gt; At this point, they are already fully Christianized, although [[Albanian mythology]] and folklore are part of the [[Paleo-Balkan mythology|Paleo-Balkan]] pagan mythology,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bonnefoy253&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bonnefoy|1993|p=253}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular showing Greek influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;EliadeAdams179&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Eliade|Adams|1987|p=179}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the Albanian people speak the [[Albanian language]] which comprises an independent branch within the [[Indo-European language|Indo-European]] family of [[language]]s. It is a [[language isolate]] to any other known living language in [[Europe]] and indeed no other language in the world has been conclusively associated to its branch. Its origin remains conclusively unknown but it is believed it has descended from an ancient [[Paleo-Balkan languages|Paleo-Balkan language]].
  
The Albanian language is spoken by approximately 5 million people throughout the [[Balkan Peninsula]] as well as by a more substantial number by [[Albanian diaspora|communities]] around the [[Americas]], [[Europe]] and [[Oceania]]. Numerous variants and dialects of Albanian are used as an [[official language]] in [[Albania]], [[Kosovo]] and [[North Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] |title=Constitution of the Republic of Albania |url=https://www.osce.org/albania/41888 |website=osce.org |language=Albanian, English |quote=The official language in the Republic of Albania is Albanian.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Kryeministria e Kosovës |title=Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo |url=http://www.kryeministri-ks.net/repository/docs/Constitution1Kosovo.pdf |website=kryeministri-ks.net |page=8 |language=English |quote=The official languages in the Republic of Kosovo are Albanian and Serbian.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA |url=https://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/mk/mk014en.pdf |website=wipo.int |page=2 |language=English }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Albanian becomes the second official language in Macedonia |url=https://europeanwesternbalkans.com/2019/01/15/albanian-becomes-second-official-language-macedonia/ |website=europeanwesternbalkans.com |language=English |date=15 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language is also spoken in other countries whence it is officially recognised as a [[minority language]] in such countries as [[Croatia]], [[Italy]], [[Montenegro]], [[Romania]] and [[Serbia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Minority language in Croatia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=THE CONSTITUTION OF MONTENEGRO |url=https://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/me/me004en.pdf |website=wipo.int |page=6 |language=English }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Linguistic diversity among foreign citizens in Italy|url=http://www.istat.it/en/archive/129304|publisher=Statistics of Italy|accessdate=1 April 2015|date=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Albanians in Albania and the [[Former Yugoslavia]] are [[Polyglotism|polyglot]] and have the ability to understand, speak, read, or write a [[foreign language]]. As defined by the [[Institute of Statistics (Albania)|Institute of Statistics of Albania]], 39.9% of the 25 to 64 years old Albanians in Albania are able to use at least one foreign language including [[English language|English]] (40%), [[Italian language|Italian]] (27.8%) and [[Greek language|Greek]] (22.9%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.instat.gov.al/media/4028/adult-education-survey-2017.pdf|title=Press release of the Adult Education Survey|last=|first=|date=10 May 2018|work=Albanian Institute of Statistics|access-date=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the Albanian language remains a contentious subject that has given rise to numerous [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]]. The hypothesis of Albanian being one of the descendant of the [[Illyrian languages]] is based on [[Geography of Albania|geography]] where the languages were spoken however not enough archaeological evidence is left behind to come therefore to a definite conclusion. Another hypothesis associates the Albanian language with the [[Thracian language]]. This theory takes exception to the territory, since the language was spoken in an area distinct from Albania, and no significant population movements have been recorded in the period when the shift from one language to the other is supposed to have occurred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hock54&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hock|Joseph|1996|p=54}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Albanian people maintain a very chequered and tumultuous history behind them, a fact explained by their geographical position in the [[Southeast Europe|Southeast of]] [[Europe]] at the cultural and political crossroad between the east and west, even though they have often been isolated from the mainstream [[history of Europe]].

The issue surrounding the [[Origin of the Albanians|origin of the Albanian people]] has been long debated by [[historian]]s and [[linguist]]s for centuries. Many scholars consider the Albanians, in terms of [[linguistic]] evidences, the descendant population of ancient populations of the [[Balkan Peninsula]], either the [[Illyrians]], [[Thracians]] or another [[Paleo-Balkan languages|Paleo-Balkan]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/general/ie-lg/Albanian.html|title=Indo-European Languages: Balkan Group: Albanian|last=Simmons|first=Austin|author2=Jonathan Slocum|publisher=Linguistics Research Center of the University of Texas at Austin|accessdate=21 October 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916055123/http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/general/ie-lg/Albanian.html|archivedate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are insufficient evidences to derive an accurate conclusion and therefore [[Albanian origins]] still remain a mystery.
 
Historically known as the ''Arbër'' or ''Arbën'' by the 11th century and onwards, they  traditionally inhabited the mountainous area to the west of [[Lake Ochrida]] and the upper valley of the [[Shkumbin|River Shkumbin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Norris35&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|1993 |p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicol160&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Nicol|1986|p=160}}. &quot;The geographical location of the mysterious 'Arbanon' has at last no doubt been settled by the researches of Alain Ducellier. In the 11th century at least it was the name given to the mountainous area to the west of Lake Ohrid and the upper valley of the river Shkumbin...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Though it was in 1190 when they established their first independent [[Principality of Arbër|entity]] with their seat based in [[Krujë]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ducellier780a&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ducellier|1995|p=780}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the decline of the [[House of Progon|Progon dynasty]] in 1216, the principality came under [[Grigor Kamona]] and [[Gulam of Albania]]. Finally the Principality was dissolved in 1255.

In 1271 [[Charles I of Naples|Charles of Anjou]] created the [[Kingdom of Albania (medieval)|Kingdom of Albania]], after he captured a part of the [[Despotate of Epirus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Historia e popullit shqiptar në katër vëllime (in Albanian)|last = Prifti|first = Skënder|publisher = Botimet Toena|year = 2002|isbn = 978-99927-1-622-9|location = |page = 207}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major attempt to advance further in direction of Constantinople failed at the [[Siege of Berat (1280–1281)]]. A Byzantine counteroffensive soon ensued, which drove the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]] out of the interior by 1281. The [[Sicilian Vespers]] further weakened the position of Charles, and the Kingdom was soon reduced by the [[Epirus (region)|Epirotes]] to a small area around [[Durrës]]. The kingdom however held out until 1368, when the city was captured by [[Karl Topia|Karl Thopia]]. The presence of the kingdom reinforced the influence of Catholicism and the conversion to its rite, not only in the region of Durrës but in other parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Lala, Etleva (2008), Regnum Albaniae, the Papal Curia, and the Western Visions of a Borderline Nobility (PDF), Central European University, Department of Medieval Studies|last = Lala|first = Eleva|publisher = Central European University, Department of Medieval Studies|year = 2008|isbn = |location = Budapest, Hungary|pages = 52|url = http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2009/mphlae01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new wave of Catholic dioceses, churches and monasteries were founded, a number of different religious orders began spreading into the country, and papal missionaries also reached the territories of the Kingdom of Albania.

In the 14th century a number of [[Albanian principalities]] were created. These included [[Principality of Kastrioti]], [[Principality of Dukagjini]], [[Principality of Albania (medieval)|Princedom of Albania]], and [[Principality of Gjirokastër]]. At the beginning of the 15th century these principalities became stronger, especially because of the fall of the [[Serbian Empire]]. Some of these principalities were united in 1444 under the military alliance called [[League of Lezhë|League of Lezha]].

Albanians were recruited all over Europe as a light cavalry known as [[stratioti]]. The stratioti were pioneers of light cavalry tactics during the 15th century. In the early 16th century heavy cavalry in the European armies was principally remodeled after Albanian stradioti of the Venetian army, Hungarian [[hussar]]s and German mercenary cavalry units (Schwarzreitern).&lt;ref&gt;Downing 1992, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[Albania under the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman conquest of Albania]], the political situation of the Albanian people was characterised by a fragmented conglomeration of scattered [[realm|kingdom]]s and [[Principalities of albania|principalities]] such as the [[Principality of Arbanon|Principalities of Arbanon]], [[Principality of Kastrioti|Kastrioti]] and [[Principality of Albania (medieval)|Thopia]]. However, after the [[fall of Constantinople]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] continued an extended period of conquest and expansion with its borders going deep into the [[Ottoman conquest of the Balkans|Southeast Europe]]. As a consequence thousands of Albanians from [[Albania]], [[Epirus]] and [[Peloponnese]] escaped to [[Western Europe]], particularly to [[Calabria]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]] and [[Kingdom of Sicily (Medieval and Early Modern)|Sicily]], whereby others sought protection at the often inaccessible [[Geography of Albania|Mountains of Albania]].

Under the leadership of [[Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg]], a prosperous and longstanding revolution erupted with the formation of the [[League of Lezhë|Assembly of Lezhë]] up until the [[Siege of Shkodra|Siege of Shkodër]], multiple times defeating the mightiest power of the time led by [[Sultan]]s [[Murad II]] and [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]]. Skanderbeg managed to gather several of the Albanian principals, amongst them the [[Arianiti family|Arianiti]]s, [[Dukagjini family|Dukagjini]]s, [[Zaharia family|Zaharia]]s and [[Thopia family|Thopia]]s, and establish a centralised authority over most of the non-conquered territories instantly becoming the [[Skanderbeg|Lord of Albania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;League of Lezhë&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Rob Pickard |title=Analysis and Reform of Cultural Heritage Policies in South-East Europe |date=2008 |isbn=92-871-6265-4 |page=16 |edition=Europarat |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Skanderbeg consistently pursued the aim relentlessly but rather unsuccessfully to create a European coalition against the Ottomans. He defeated every attempt by the Ottomans to regain Albania which they envisioned as a springboard for the invasion of Italy and [[Western Europe]]. His unequal fight against them won the esteem of Europe also among others financial and military aid from the [[Papacy]] and [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12472/Albania/42646/The-decline-of-Byzantium|title=Albania :: The decline of Byzantium – Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=britannica.com|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barletius, Marinus.

The Albanians, predominantly a Christian people, were considered as an [[Rayah|inferior class]] of people and as such they were subjected to heavy [[Jizya|tax]]es such as the [[Devshirme]] system that allowed the [[Sultan]] to collect a requisite percentage of Christian adolescents from the [[Balkans]] and elsewhere to compose the [[Janissary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Raymond Zickel and Walter R.

They were therefore to be found within the imperial services as vital military and administrative retainers from [[Egypt]] to [[Algeria]] and the rest of [[Maghreb]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Norris196&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|1993|p=196}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the late 18th century, [[Ali Pasha Tepelena]] created the autonomous region of the [[Pashalik of Yanina]] within the [[Ottoman Empire]] which was never recognised as such by the [[High Porte]]. The territory he properly governed incorporated most of southern [[Albania]], [[Epirus]], [[Thessaly]] and southwestern [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. During his rule, the town of [[Janina]] blossomed into a cultural, political and economic hub for both Albanians and Greeks.

The ultimate goal of Ali Pasha Tepelena seems to have been the establishment of an independent rule in Albania and Epirus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2010|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he obtained control of [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] and took control over the ports of [[Butrint]], [[Preveza]] and [[Vonitsa]]. He also gained control of the [[pashalik]]s of [[Elbasan]], [[Sanjak of Delvina|Delvina]], [[Pashalik of Berat|Berat]] and [[Sanjak of Avlona|Vlorë]]. His relations with the High Porte were always tense though he developed and maintained relations with the [[British Empire|British]], [[First French Empire|French]] and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] people and formed an alliance with them through various times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Türkiye Tarihi İslam, Milliyetçilik ve Modernlik 1789-2007|last=Findley|first=Carter V.|publisher=Timaş Yayınları|year=2012|isbn=978-605-114-693-5|location=İstanbul|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These records show that the magnitude of banditry involving Albanians grew through the 1770s and 1780s to reach crisis proportions in the 1790s and 1800s.&quot;; p.107. &quot;In light of the recent violent troubles in Kosovo and Macedonia and the strong emotions tied to them, readers are urged most emphatically not to draw either of two unwarranted conclusions from this article:  that Albanians are somehow inherently inclined to banditry, or that the extent of Ottoman &quot;Albania&quot; or ''Arnavudluk'' (which included parts of present-day northern Greece, western Macedonia, southern Montenegro, Kosovo, and southern Serbia) gives any historical &quot;justification&quot; for the creation of a &quot;Greater Albania&quot; today.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anscombe772&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Anscombe|2006b|p=772}}. &quot;In this case, however, Ottoman records contain useful information about the ethnicities of the leading actors in the story. Records of Ottoman Empire refer to ‘Albanians’ more frequently than most other cultural or linguistic groups. The term ‘Arnavud’ was used to denote persons who spoke one of the dialects of Albanian, came from mountainous country in the western Balkans (referred to as ‘Arnavudluk’, and including not only the area now forming the state of Albania but also neighbouring parts of Greece, Macedonia, Kosovo, and Montenegro), organized society on the strength of blood ties (family, clan, tribe), engaged predominantly in a mix of settled agriculture and livestock herding, and were notable fighters — a group, in short, difficult to control. Other peoples, such as Georgians, Ahkhaz, Circassians, Tatars, Kurds, and Bedouin Arabs who were frequently identified by their ethnicity, shared similar cultural traits.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolovos41&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kolovos|2007|p=41}}. &quot;Anscombe (ibid., 107 n. 3) notes that Ottoman &quot;Albania&quot; or ''Arnavudluk''... included parts of present-day northern Greece, western Macedonia, southern Montenegro, Kosovo, and southern Serbia&quot;; see also ''El2''. s.v. &quot;Arnawutluk. 6.

The [[Albanian Renaissance]] characterised a period wherein the Albanian people gathered both [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[intellectual]] strength to establish their rights for an independent [[political]] and [[social]] life, [[culture]] and [[education]]. By the late 18th century and the early 19th century, its foundation arose within the [[Albanian diaspora|Albanian communities]] in [[Albanians in Italy|Italy]] and [[Albanians in Romania|Romania]] and was frequently linked to the influences of the [[Romanticism]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sarah Amsler |title=Theorising Social Change in Post-Soviet Countries: Critical Approaches |publisher=Peter Lang, 2007 |isbn=9783039103294 |pages=96105 |edition=Balihar Sanghera, Sarah Amsler, Tatiana Yarkova |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MzXP_r6oAxwC&amp;pg=PA96 |language=English|year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Albania was under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]] for almost five centuries and the Ottoman authorities suppressed any expression of unity or national conscience by the Albanian people. A number of thoroughly intellectual Albanians, among them [[Naum Veqilharxhi]], [[Girolamo de Rada]], [[Dora d'Istria]], [[Thimi Mitko]], [[Naim Frashëri|Naim]] and [[Sami Frashëri]], made a conscious effort to awaken feelings of pride and unity among their people by working to develop [[Albanian literature]] that would call to mind the rich history and hopes for a more decent future.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsie6593&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2005|pp=65–93}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The Albanians had poor or often no [[school]]s or other institutions in place to protect and preserve their [[cultural heritage]]. The need for schools was preached initially by the increasing number of Albanians educated abroad. The Albanian communities in Italy and elsewhere were particularly active in promoting the Albanian cause, especially in education which finally resulted with the foundation of the [[Mësonjëtorja]] in [[Korçë]], the first [[secular school]] in the [[Albanian language]].

The [[Rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire|Turkish yoke]] had become fixed in the nationalist mythologies and psyches of the people in the [[Balkans]], and their march toward [[independence]] quickened. Due to the more substantial of Islamic influence, the Albanians internal social divisions, and the fear that they would lose their Albanian territories to the emerging neighbouring states, [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Greece]], were among the last peoples in the Balkans to desire division from the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birth of Albania&quot;&gt;{{cite web|editor1=Raymond Zickel|editor2=Walter R.

The national awakening as a coherent political movement emerged after the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], according to which Albanian-inhabited territories were to be ceded to the neighbouring states, and focused on preventing that partition.&lt;ref name=Kaser&gt;Karl Kaser, Frank Kressing.

[[Enver Hoxha]] of the [[Party of Labour of Albania|Party of Labour]] took immediate and forceful measures for the total power over the [[nation state]] of the Albanian people, [[Albania]] in 1946. As the regimes strength began to increase, Enver Hoxha established an [[alliance]] with the [[Eastern Bloc]] which provided Albania with many advantages in the form of economic assistance and military protection from the [[Western Bloc]] during the [[Cold War]].

The Albanians experienced a period of several beneficial political and economic changes. The [[People's Republic of Albania|government]] defended the territorial [[integrity]] and [[sovereignty]] of Albania, diversified the economy through a programme of [[industrialisation]] which led to a higher [[standard of living]] and followed improvements in areas such as [[health]], [[education]] and [[infrastructure]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Albanian Nationalism&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Albanian Nationalism|url=https://www.britannica.com/pla…/Albania/Albanian-nationalism|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It subsequently followed a period wherein the Albanians lived within an extreme isolation from the rest of the world for the next four decades. By 1967, the established government had officially proclaimed Albania to be the first [[atheistic state]] in the world as they beforehand confiscated [[Christian Church|church]]es, [[monasteries]] and [[mosque]]s, and any religious expression instantly became grounds for imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-186.html|title=Albania - Hoxha's Antireligious Campaign|website=www.country-data.com|access-date=13 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective protests with the emerging [[revolutions of 1989]] began to break out in various cities throughout Albania including [[Shkodër]] and [[Tirana]] which eventually caused the [[Fall of communism in Albania|fall of communism]]. Finally as the communism came to a violent end in 1992, both internal and large external migration waves of Albanians, in such countries as [[Greece]] and [[Italy]], has taken place on a massive scale over the forthcoming years in Albania.

The [[bunkerisation]] is arguably the most visible and memorable legacy of the communism in Albania. Nearly 175.000 reinforced concrete [[bunker]]s were built on strategic locations across [[Geography of Albania|Albania's territory]] including near borders, within towns, on the seashores or mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bunkers of Albania|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bunkers-of-albania|website=Atlas Obscura|ref=AO|access-date=21 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312044555/http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bunkers-of-albania|archive-date=12 March 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bunkers were never used for their intended purpose or for sheltered the population from attacks or an invasion by a neighbor.

[[Kosovo]] declared [[Independence of Kosovo|independence]] from Serbia on 17 February 2008, after years of strained relations between the Serb and predominantly [[Albanians in Kosovo|Albanian]] population of Kosovo. It has been officially recognised by [[Australia]], [[Canada]], the [[United States]] and major [[European Union]] countries, while Serbia and its ally [[Russia]] refuse to recognise Kosovo's sovereignty.
 
The overwhelming majority of Kosovo's population is ethnically Albanian with nearly 1.7 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecmikosovo.org/wp-content/Publications/Policy_briefs/2012-12_ECMI_Kosovo_Policy_Brief_-_Minority_Communities_in_the_2011_Kosovo_Census_Results_Analysis_and_Recommendations/eng.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=3 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103200754/http://www.ecmikosovo.org/wp-content/Publications/Policy_briefs/2012-12_ECMI_Kosovo_Policy_Brief_-_Minority_Communities_in_the_2011_Kosovo_Census_Results_Analysis_and_Recommendations/eng.pdf |archivedate=3 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their presence as well as in the adjacent regions of [[Toplica District|Toplica]] and [[Moravac|Morava]] is recorded since the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Anscombe767774785788&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Anscombe|2006b|pp=767–774}}, 785–788. &quot;While the ethnic roots of some settlements can be determined from the Ottoman records, Serbian and Albanian historians have at times read too much into them in their running dispute over the ethnic history of early Ottoman Kosovo. Their attempts to use early Ottoman provincial surveys (tahrir defterleri) to gauge the ethnic make—up of the population in the fifteenth century have proved little. Leaving aside questions arising from the dialects and pronunciation of the census scribes, interpreters, and even priests who baptized those recorded, no natural law binds ethnicity to name. Imitation, in which the customs, tastes, and even names of those in the public eye are copied by the less exalted, is a time—tested tradition and one followed in the Ottoman Empire. Some Christian sipahis in early Ottoman Albania took such Turkic names as Timurtaş, for example, in a kind of cultural conformity completed later by conversion to Islam. Such cultural mimicry makes onomastics an inappropriate tool for anyone wishing to use Ottoman records to prove claims so modern as to have been irrelevant to the pre—modern state. The seventeenth—century Ottoman notable arid author Evliya Çelebi, who wrote a massive account of his travels around the empire and abroad, included in it details of local society that normally would not appear in official correspondence; for this reason his account of a visit to several towns in Kosovo in 1660 is extremely valuable. Evliya confirms that western and at least parts of central Kosovo were ‘Arnavud’. He notes that the town of Vučitrn had few speakers of ‘Boşnakca’; its inhabitants spoke Albanian or Turkish. He terms the highlands around Tetovo (in Macedonia), Peć, and Prizren the ‘mountains of Arnavudluk’. Elsewhere, he states that ‘the mountains of Peć’ lay in Arnavudluk, from which issued one of the rivers converging at Mitrovica, just north-west of which he sites Kosovo's border with Bosna. This river, the Ibar, flows from a source in the mountains of Montenegro north—north—west of Peć, in the region of Rozaje to which the Këlmendi would later be moved. He names the other river running by Mitrovica as the Kılab and says that it, too, had its source in Aravudluk; by this he apparently meant the Lab, which today is the name of the river descending from mountains north—east of Mitrovica to join the Sitnica north of Priština. As Evliya travelled south, he appears to have named the entire stretch of river he was following the Kılab, not noting the change of name when he took the right fork at the confluence of the Lab and Sitnica. Thus, Evliya states that the tomb of Murad I, killed in the battle of Kosovo Polje, stood beside the Kılab, although it stands near the Sitnica outside Priština. Despite the confusion of names, Evliya included in Arnavudluk not only the western fringe of Kosovo, but also the central mountains from which the Sitnica (‘Kılab’) and its first tributaries descend. Given that a large Albanian population lived in Kosovo, especially in the west and centre, both before and after the Habsburg invasion of 1689–90, it remains possible, in theory, that at that time in the Ottoman Empire, one people emigrated en masse and another immigrated to take its place.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Serbs expelled many Albanians from the wider Toplica and Morava regions in Southern Serbia, which the 1878 [[Congress of Berlin]] had given to the [[Principality of Serbia]], many of them settled in Kosovo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jagodic&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Jagodić|1998}}. para. 1–71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Uka525354&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Uka|2004d|p=52}}. &quot;Pra, këtu në vazhdim, pas dëbimit të tyre me 1877–1878 do të shënohen vetëm disa patronime (mbiemra) të shqiptarëve të Toplicës dhe viseve tjera shqiptare të Sanxhakut të Nishit.

Centuries later in the end of the 20th century occurred another and simultaneously the largest migration cycle of Albanians to Italy surpassing the earlier migration of the Arbëreshë.

An estimated 275,000–600,000 (Includes dual citizens, temporary migrants, and undocumented) Albanians live in [[Greece]], forming the largest immigrant community in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vathi|first=Zana|title=Migrating and Settling in a Mobile World: Albanian Migrants and Their Children in Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rV11CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22|date=18 May 2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-13024-8|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are economic migrants whose migration began in 1991, following the collapse of the [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania]].

The [[Arvanites]] and [[Albanian-speakers of Western Thrace]] are a group descended from [[Tosks]] who migrated to southern and central Greece between the 13th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gogonas3&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gogonas|2010|p=3}}. &quot;Arvanites originate from Albanian settlers who moved south at different times between the 14th and the 16th centuries from areas in what is today southern Albania The reasons for this migration are not entirely clear and may be manifold. In many instances the Arvanites were invited by the Byzantine and Latin rulers of the time. They were employed to resettle areas that had been largely depopulated through wars, epidemics and other reasons, and they were employed as soldiers. Some later movements are also believed to have been motivated to evade Islamisation after the Ottoman conquest. The main waves of the Arvanite migration into southern Greece started around 1300, reached a peak some time during the 14th century, and ended around 1600. Arvanites first reached Thessaly, then Attica and finally the Peloponnese (Clogg. 2002). Regarding the number of Arvanites in Greece, the 1951 census (the last census in Greece that included a question about language) gives a figure of 23.000 Arvaiithka speakers. Sociohinguistic research in the 1970s in the villages of Attica and Biotia alone indicated a figure of at least 30.000 speakers (Trudgill and Tzavaras 1977), while Lunden (1993) suggests 50.000 for Greece as a whole.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; They are Greek Orthodox Christians, and though they traditionally speak a dialect of [[Tosk Albanian]] known as [[Arvanitika]], they have fully assimilated into the Greek nation and do not identify as Albanians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall2829&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1997|pp=28–29}}. &quot;The permeability of ethnic boundaries is also demonstrated in many of the Greek villages of Attiki and Viotia (ancient Attika and Boiotia), where Arvanites often form a majority) These Arvanites are descended from Albanians who first entered Greece between the eleventh and fifteenth centuries (though there was a subsequent wave of immigration in the second half of the eighteenth century). Although still regarded as ethnically distinct in the nineteenth century, their participation in the Greek War of Independence and the Civil War has led to increasing assimilation: in a survey conducted in the 1970s, 97 per crnt of Arvanite informants despite regularly speaking in Arvanitika, considered themselves to be Greek. A similar concern with being identified as Greek is exhibited by the bilingual Arvanites of the Eastern Argolid.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bintliff137138&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bintliff|2003|pp=137–138}}. &quot;First, we can explain the astonishing persistence of Albanian village culture from the fourteenth to the nineteenth centuries through the ethnic and religious tolerance characteristic of Islamic empires and so lacking in their Christian equivalents. Ottoman control rested upon allowing local communities to keep their religion, language, local laws, and representatives, provided that taxes were paid (the millet system). There was no pressure for Greeks and Albanians to conform to each other's language or other behavior.
Clear signs of change are revealed in the travel diaries of the German scholar Ludwig Ross (1851), when he accompanied the Bavarian Otto, whom the Allies had foisted as king upon the newly freed Greek nation in the aftermath of the War of Independence in the 1830s. Ross praises the well-built Greek villages of central Greece with their healthy, happy, dancing inhabitants, and contrasts them specifically with the hovels and sickly inhabitants of Albanian villages. In fact, recent scholarship has underlined how far it was the West that built modem Greece in its own fanciful image as the land of a long-oppressed people who were the direct descendants of Pericles.
Thus from the late nineteenth century onward the children of the inhabitants of the new &quot;nation-state&quot; were taught in Greek, history confined itself to the episodes of pure Greekness, and the tolerant Ottoman attitude to cultural diversity yielded to a deliberate policy of total Hellenization of the populace—effective enough to fool the casual observer. One is rather amazed at the persistence today of such dual-speaking populations in much of the Albanian colonization zone. However, apart from the provinciality of this essentially agricultural province, a high rate of illiteracy until well into this century has also helped to preserve Arvanitika in the Boeotian villagers (Meijs 1993).&quot;; p. 140. &quot;In contrast therefore to the more openly problematic issue of Slav speakers in northern Greece, Arvanitic speakers in central Greece lack any signs of an assertive ethnicity. I would like to suggest that they possess what we might term a ''passive ethnicity''. As a result of a number of historical factors, much of the rural population in central Greece was Albanian-speaking by the time of the creation of the modern Greek state in the 1830s. Until this century, most of these people were illiterate and unschooled, yet there existed sufficient knowledge of Greek to communicate with officials and townspeople, itinerant traders, and so on, to limit the need to transform rural language usage. Life was extremely provincial, with just one major carriage-road passing through the center of the large province of Boeotia even in the 1930s (beyond which horseback and cart took over; van Effenterre 1989). Even in the 1960s, Arvanitic village children could be figures of fun for their Greek peers in the schools of Thebes (One of the two regional towns) (K. Sarri, personal communication, 2000). It was not a matter of cultural resistance but simple conservatism and provinciality, the extreme narrowness of rural life, that allowed Arvanitic language and local historic memories to survive so effectively to the very recent period.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VeremisKolipoulos2425&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Veremis|Kolipoulos|2003|pp=24–25}}. &quot;For the time being, the Greeks of free Greece could indulge in defining their brethren of unredeemed Greece, primarily the Slav Macedonians and secondarily the Orthodox Albanians and the Vlachs. Primary school students were taught, in the 1880s, that ‘Greeks [are] our kinsmen, of common descent, speaking the language we speak and professing the religion we profess’.&quot; But this definition, it seems, was reserved for small children who could not possibly understand the intricate arguments of their parents on the question of Greek identity. What was essential to understand at that tender age was that modern Greeks descended from the ancient Greeks. Grown up children, however, must have been no less confused than adults on the criteria for defining modern Greek identity. Did the Greeks constitute a ‘race’ apart from the Albanians, the Slavs and the Vlachs? Yes and no. High school students were told that the ‘other races’, i.e. the Slavs, the Albanians and the Vlachs, ‘having been Hellenized with the years in terms of mores and customs, are now being assimilated into the Greeks’. On the Slavs of Macedonia there seems to have been no consensus. Were they Bulgars, Slavicized Greeks or early Slavs? They ‘were’ Bulgars until the 1870s and Slavicized Greeks, or Hellenized Slavs subsequently, according to the needs of the dominant theory. There was no consensus, either, on the Vlachs. Were they Latinized Greek mountaineers of late immigrants from Vlachia? As in the case of the Slavs of Macedonia, Vlach descent shifted from the southern Balkans to the Danube, until the Romanians claimed the Vlachs for their brethren; which made the latter irrevocably indigenous to the southern Balkan mountains. The Albanians or ‘Arvanites’, were readily ‘adopted’ as brethren of common descent for at least three reasons. Firstly, the Albanians had been living in southern Greece, as far south as the Peloponnese, in considerable numbers. Secondly, Christian Albanians had fought with distinction and in considerable numbers in the War of Independence. Thirdly, credible Albanian claims for the establishment of an Albanian nation state materialized too Late for Greek national theorists to abandon well-entrenched positions. Commenting on a geography textbook for primary schools in 1901, a state committee found it inadequate and misleading. One of its principal shortcomings concerned the Albanians, who were described as ‘close kinsmen of the Greeks’. ‘These are unacceptable from the point of view of our national claims and as far as historical truth is concerned’, commented the committee. ‘it must have been maintained that they are of common descent with the Greeks (Pelasgians), that they speak a language akin to that of the Greeks and that they participated in all struggles for national liberation of the common fatherland.’&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Arvanitika is in a state of attrition due to language shift towards Greek and large-scale internal migration to the cities and subsequent intermingling of the population during the 20th century.

The [[Cham Albanians]] were a group that formerly inhabited a region of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] known as [[Chameria]], nowadays [[Thesprotia]] in northwestern Greece. Many Cham Albanians converted to Islam during the Ottoman era. [[Islam|Muslim]] Chams were [[Expulsion of Cham Albanians|expelled]] from Greece during [[World War II]], by an [[EDES|anti-communist resistance group]], as a result of their participation in a [[EAM-ELAS|communist resistance group]] and the [[Axis-Cham Albanian collaboration|collaboration]] with the [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Axis occupation]], while Orthodox Chams have largely assimilated into the Greek nation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The Albanian diaspora in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], in such countries as [[Egypt]], [[Syria]] or [[Turkey]], was predominantly formed during the Ottoman period through economic [[Human migration|migration]] and early years of the [[Republic of Turkey]] through migration due to sociopolitical discrimination and violence experienced by Albanians in [[Balkans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GenisMaynard553555&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Geniş|Maynard|2009|pp=553–555}}. &quot;Taking a chronological perspective, the ethnic Albanians currently living in Turkey today could be categorized into three groups: Ottoman Albanians, Balkan Albanians, and twentieth century Albanians. The first category comprises descendants of Albanians who relocated to the Marmara and Aegean regions as part of the Ottoman Empire's administrative structure. Official Ottoman documents record the existence of Albanians living in and around Istanbul (Constantinople), Iznik (Nicaea), and Izmir (Smyrna). For example, between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries Albanian boys were brought to Istanbul and housed in Topkapı Palace as part of the ''devşirme'' system (an early Ottoman practice of human tribute required of Christian citizens) to serve as civil servants and Janissaries. In the 1600s Albanian seasonal workers were employed by these Albanian Janissaries in and around Istanbul and Iznik, and in 1860 Kayserili Ahmet, the governor of Izmir, employed Albanians to fight the raiding Zeybeks. Today, the descendants of Ottoman Albanians do not form a community per se, but at least some still identify as ethnically Albanian. However, it is unknown how many, if any, of these Ottoman Albanians retain Albanian language skills. The second category of ethnic Albanians living in modern Turkey is composed of people who are the descendants of refugees from the Balkans who because of war were forced to migrate inwards towards Eastern Thrace and Anatolia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as the Ottoman Empire dissolved. These Balkan Albanians are the largest group of ethnic Albanians living in Turkey today, and can be subcategorized into those who ended up in actual Albanian-speaking communities and those who were relocated into villages where they were the only Albanian-speaking migrants. Not surprisingly, the language is retained by some of the descendants from those of the former, but not those of the latter. The third category of ethnic Albanians in Turkey comprises recent or twentieth century migrants from the Balkans. These recent migrants can be subcategorized into those who came from Kosovo in the 1950s–1970s, those who came from Kosovo in 1999, and those who came from the Republic of Albania after 1992. All of these in the third category know a variety of modern Albanian and are mostly located in the western parts of Turkey in large metropolitan areas. Our research focuses on the history of migration and community formation of the Albanians located in the Samsun Province in the Black Sea region around 1912–1913 who would fall into the second category discussed above (see Figure 1). Turkish census data between 1927 and 1965 recorded the presence of Albanian speakers in Samsun Province, and the fieldwork we have been conducting in Samsun since September 2005 has revealed that there is still a significant number of Albanians living in the city and its surrounding region. According to the community leaders we interviewed, there are about 30,000–40,000 ethnic Albanian Turkish citizens in Samsun Province. The community was largely rural, located in the villages and engaged in agricultural activities until the 1970s. After this time, gradual migration to urban areas, particularly smaller towns and nearby cities has been observed. Long-distance rural-to-urban migration also began in later years mostly due to increasing demand for education and better jobs. Those who migrated to areas outside of Samsun Province generally preferred the cities located in the west of Turkey, particularly metropolitan areas such as Istanbul, Izmir and Bursa mainly because of the job opportunities as well as the large Albanian communities already residing in these cities. Today, the size of the Albanian community in Samsun Province is considered to be much smaller and gradually shrinking because of outward migration. Our observation is that the Albanians in Samsun seem to be fully integrated into Turkish society, and engaged in agriculture and small trading businesses. As education becomes accessible to the wider society and modernization accelerates transportation and hence communication of urban values, younger generations have also started to acquire professional occupations. Whilst a significant number of people still speak Albanian fluently as the language in the family, they have a perfect command of the Turkish language and cannot be distinguished from the rest of the population in terms of occupation, education, dress and traditions. In this article, we are interested in the history of this Albanian community in Samsun. Given the lack of any research on the Albanian presence in Turkey, our questions are simple and exploratory. When and where did these people come from? How and why did they choose Samsun as a site of resettlement? How did the socio- cultural characteristics of this community change over time? It is generally believed that the Albanians in Samsun Province are the descendants of the migrants and refugees from Kosovo who arrived in Turkey during the wars of 1912–13. Based on our research in Samsun Province, we argue that this information is partial and misleading. The interviews we conducted with the Albanian families and community leaders in the region and the review of Ottoman history show that part of the Albanian community in Samsun was founded through three stages of successive migrations. The first migration involved the forced removal of Muslim Albanians from the Sancak of Nish in 1878; the second migration occurred when these migrants’ children fled from the massacres in Kosovo in 1912–13 to Anatolia; and the third migration took place between 1913 and 1924 from the scattered villages in Central Anatolia where they were originally placed to the Samsun area in the Black Sea Region. Thus, the Albanian community founded in the 1920s in Samsun was in many ways a reassembling of the demolished Muslim Albanian community of Nish. This trajectory of the Albanian community of Nish shows that the fate of this community was intimately bound up with the fate of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans and the socio-cultural composition of modern Turkey still carries on the legacy of its historical ancestor.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Turkey]], the exact numbers of the Albanian population of the country are difficult to correctly estimate. According to a 2008 report, there were approximately 1.300,000 people of Albanian descent living in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;Milliyet, Türkiyedeki Kürtlerin Sayısı. 6 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; As of that report, more than 500,000 Albanian descendants still recognise their [[ancestry]] and or their language, culture and traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zamanheritage&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.todayszaman.com/national_albanians-in-turkey-celebrate-their-cultural-heritage_254383.html Albanians in Turkey celebrate their cultural heritage] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031102644/http://www.todayszaman.com/national_albanians-in-turkey-celebrate-their-cultural-heritage_254383.html |date=31 October 2015 }}&quot;.

Italy's [[Italian invasion of Albania|annexation]] of Albania and its alliance with [[Nazi Germany]] against the allies marked a difficult time for Albanian and Italian Australians as they were thought by Australian authorities to pose a fascist threat. However, the number of Albanian immigrants slowed consequently during that time but also due to immigration restrictions placed by the [[Communism in Albania|communist regime]] in Albania.

The most recent Albanian immigrants came mostly from [[Kosovo]] and the former [[Ex-Yugoslavian countries|Yugoslavian countries]] inclusively [[North Macedonia]] and [[Serbia and Montenegro]]. The immigrants were mostly Muslims but also Orthodox and Catholics among them the relatives of the renowned Albanian nun and missionary [[Mother Teresa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

Albanian cuisine is different from region to another and each Albanian speaking territory preserves a distinctive [[regional cuisine]] characterised by local specialties and different styles within the Albanian cuisine. There is a considerable diversity between the [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] and [[Greek cuisine|Greek]]-influenced cuisines of the [[Arbëreshë people#Cuisine|Arbëreshë]]s and [[Cham Albanians#Cuisine|Cham]]s as well as of the [[Mediterranean cuisine|Mediterranean]] and [[Balkan cuisine|Balkan]]-influenced cuisines of the Albanians in the [[Balkans]].
 
Among the essential characteristics in Albanian cuisine is undoubtedly the generous use of a wide range of ingredients and spices specific to their locations. It includes many varieties of [[fruit]]s such as [[Lemon (fruit)|lemon]]s, [[Orange (fruit)|orange]]s, [[Figs (fruit)|fig]]s and [[Olive (fruit)|olive]]s. [[Spice]]s and other [[herb]]s such as [[Basil (herb)|basil]], [[lavender]], [[Spearmint|mint]], [[oregano]], [[rosemary]] and [[thyme]] are also used, as are [[vegetable]]s such as [[garlic]]s, [[onion]]s, [[Bell pepper|pepper]]s, [[potato]]es and [[tomato]]es.

The Albanian diet, for those Albanians who lives closer to the sea and lakes, are able to complement their diet with fresh and saltwater [[fish]], [[shellfish]] and other [[seafood]] specialities from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Ohrid Lake]]. Otherwise, [[Lamb (food)|lamb]] is often considered as the traditional [[meat]] for different [[religious festival]]s and [[poultry]], [[beef]] and [[pork]] are also in plentiful supply.

In Albania, [[Tavë Kosi]] is a national dish consisting of garlicky lamb and rice baked under a thick, tart veil of [[yogurt]]. Fërgesë is another national dish and is made up with peppers, tomatoes and [[cottage cheese]]. Another beloved dish in Albania and other Albanian-speaking territories is called Pite which is generally a filled and baked pastry with a filling of a mixture of [[spinach]] and [[curd|gjizë]] or [[Ground meat|mish]]. Also famous is [[Flia]] consisting of multiple crepe-like layers brushed with crea. Petulla, a traditionally fried dough, and Krofne, similar to [[Berliner (doughnut)|Berliner]], constitute as well a popular speciality in Albanian cuisine.

In the 17th and onwards, important contributions to Albanian literature were made by the [[Arbëreshë people]] of [[Southern Italy]] who played an influential role in encouraging the [[Albanian Renaissance]]. Notable among them was figures such as [[Demetrio Camarda]], [[Gabriele Dara]], [[Girolamo de Rada]], [[Giulio Variboba]] and [[Giuseppe Serembe]] who produced inspiring nationalist literature and worked to systematise the [[Albanian language]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsie4464&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2005|pp=44–64}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dora d'Istria]], [[Girolamo de Rada]], [[Naim Frashëri]], [[Naum Veqilharxhi]], [[Sami Frashëri]] and [[Pashko Vasa]] maintained this movement and are remembered today for composing series of prominent works.
   
The 20th century was centred on the principles of [[Modernism]] and [[Realist literature|Realism]] and characterised by the development to a more distinctive and expressive form of Albanian literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsie94161&quot;/&gt; Pioneers of the time include [[Asdreni]], [[Faik Konica]], [[Fan Noli]], [[Lasgush Poradeci]], [[Migjeni]] who chose to portray themes of contemporary life and most notably [[Gjergj Fishta]] who created the epic masterpiece [[Lahuta e Malcís]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsie94161&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2005|pp=94–161}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Albanian people have incorporated various natural materials from their local [[agriculture]] and [[livestock]] as a vital source for [[attire]], [[clothing]] and [[fabric]]s. Their [[Albanian national clothing|traditional apparel]] was primarily influenced by [[nature]], the [[Lifestyle (sociology)|way of life]] and has been continuously changed since ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lazWAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=brez+clothing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZlMDggfvJAhVMdD4KHQY_DpUQ6AEIMTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=moons%2C%20stars%2C%20and%20snakes&amp;f=false| page=16| title=Encyclopedia of National Dress: Traditional Clothing Around the World| chapter=Albania| publisher=ABC-CLIO| year=2013|isbn= 9780313376368}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the Albanian regions possesses their own exceptional clothing traditions and peculiarities varied occasionally in colour, material and shape.
 
The [[traditional costume]] of Albanian men includes a white [[Skirt (garment)|skirt garment]] called [[Fustanella]], a white shirt with wide [[sleeve]]s, and a thin black [[jacket]] or [[vest]], such as the [[Xhamadan]] or Xhurdia. In winter, they add a warm [[woolen]] coat or [[fur]] coat known as Flokata or Dollama made from [[sheepskin]] or [[goat]] fur. Another authentic piece is called Tirq which is a tight pair of felt [[trousers]] mostly white, sometimes dark brown or black.

The Albanian women's costumes are much more complicated, more colorful, richer in ornamentation and elaborate than that costume of the Albanian men. In all the Albanian regions the women's clothing often has been decorated with [[filigree]] [[ironwork]], colorful embroidery, a lot of symbols and vivid accessories. A unique and ancient dress is called [[Xhubleta]], a bell shaped skirt reaching down to the calves and worn from the shoulders with two shoulder straps at the upper part.&lt;ref name=&quot;dtk.rks-gov.net&quot;&gt;http://dtk.rks-gov.net/tkk_objekti_en.aspx?id=9827&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PulahaMansaku1982&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Selami Pulaha|author2=Seit Mansaku|author3-link=Andromaqi Gjergji|author3=Andromaqi Gjergji|title=Shqiptarët dhe trojet e tyre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WZ9IAQAAIAAJ|year=1982|publisher=8 Nëntori|pages=136–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional Albanian [[headdress]]es remain a contrasting and recognisable feature of Albanian traditional clothing. Albanian men traditionally wore hats of various designs, shape and size. A very common headgear is a [[Qeleshe|Plis]] and Qylafë, in contrast, Albanian women wore a Kapica adorned with jewels or embroidery on the forehead, and a Lëvere or Kryqe which usually covers the head, shoulders and neck. Wealthy Albanian women wore headdresses embellished with gems, gold or silver.

Different traditional handmade [[shoe]]s and [[sock]]s were worn by the Albanian people. The leather shoes called [[Opinga]] were made from rough animal skin and worn with knitted woolen socks known as [[Çorape]] worked either in wool or cotton.

For the Albanian people, [[Albanian music|music]] is a vital component to their [[Albanian culture|culture]] and characterised by its own peculiar features and diverse melodic pattern reflecting the [[Albanian history|history]], [[Albanian language|language]] and [[Lifestyle (sociology)|way of life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=SPIRO J.

Hence, their geographic position in [[Southeast Europe]] in combination with cultural, political and social issues is frequently expressed through [[music]] along with the accompanying [[Musical instrument|instruments]] and [[dance]]s.

There are a number of international acclaimed singers of Albanian origin across the world such as [[Action Bronson]], [[Ava Max]], [[Bebe Rexha]], [[Dua Lipa]], [[Era Istrefi]], [[Gashi (rapper)|Gashi]] and [[Rita Ora]].
 
In international competitions, [[Albania in the Eurovision Song Contest|Albania]] participated in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] for the first time in 2004.

Many different [[Spirituality|spiritual]] traditions, [[Religion|religious]] [[faith]]s and [[belief]]s are practised by the Albanian people who historically have succeeded to coexist peacefully over the centuries in [[Southeast Europe]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} They are traditionally both [[Christianity|Christians]] and [[Islam|Muslims]], [[Catholicism|Catholic]]s and [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]], [[Bektashism|Bektashi]]s and [[Sunnism|Sunni]]s but also to a lesser extant [[Evangelicalism|Evangelists]], [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and [[Judaism|Jews]], perhaps constituting the most religiously diverse people of [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BogdaniLoughlin2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bogdani|first1=Mirela|last2=Loughlin|first2=John|authorlink2=John Loughlin (political scientist)|title=Albania and the European Union: The Tumultuous Journey Towards Integration and Accession|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=32Wu8H7t8MwC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=16 April 2017|year=2007|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-308-7|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In the [[medieval era]], prior to the arrival of [[Islam in Albania|Islam]] into the Albanian inhabited lands, Christianity was the predominant religion among the Albanians. They were mostly following [[Orthodoxy in Albania|Orthodox]] traditions and practices until the middle of the 13th century as [[Gheg Albanian]]s began to convert to [[Catholicism in Albania|Catholicism]] as a mean to resist the oppression of the [[Slavs]].{{efn|See:&lt;ref&gt;Comnena, Anna. The Alexiad, Book IV.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stavrianos498&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Stavrianos|2000|p=498}}. &quot;Religious differences also existed before the coming of the Turks.

Then the Ghegs in the North adopted in order to better resist the pressure of Orthodox Serbs.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm1910&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh Chisholm|title=Encyclopædia Britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0PgtAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 July 2013|year=1910|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|page=485|quote= The Roman Catholic Ghegs appear to have abandoned the Eastern for the Western Church in the middle of the 13th century}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramet381&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ramet|1989|p=381}}. &quot;Prior to the Turkish conquest, the ghegs (the chief tribal group in northern Albania) had found in Roman Catholicism a means of resisting the Slavs, and though Albanian Orthodoxy remained important among the tosks (the chief tribal group in southern Albania), ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;}} During the [[Ottoman conquest of the Balkans|Ottoman conquest]] of the [[Balkans]], Christianity began to be overtaken by Islam, and Catholicism and Orthodoxy continued to be practiced with less frequency.

During the [[modern era]], the [[monarchy]] and [[communism]] in [[Albania]] as well as the [[socialism]] in Kosovo, historically part of [[Yugoslavia]], followed a systematic [[secularisation]] of its people. This policy was chiefly applied within the borders of both territories and produced a secular majority of its population.

All forms of [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and other religious practices were prohibited except for old non-institutional [[pagan]] practices in the rural areas, which were seen as identifying with the national culture. The current Albanian state has revived some pagan festivals, such as the [[Spring Day|Spring]] festival ({{lang-sq|Dita e Verës}}) held yearly on 14 March in the city of [[Elbasan]]. It is a national holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://theculturetrip.com/europe/albania/articles/how-to-celebrate-dita-e-veres-in-albania-like-a-local/|website = Culture Trip|title  = How to Celebrate Dita e Verës in Albania Like a Local|last = Masotti|first = Francesca|date = 9 March 2018|accessdate = 29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The communist regime which ruled Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions, and entirely banned religion to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first [[state atheism|atheist state]]. Religious freedom returned to Albania following the regime's change in 1992. Albanian Sunni Muslims are found throughout the country, [[Albanian Orthodox Church|Albanian Orthodox Christians]] as well as [[Bektashi]]s are concentrated in the south, while Roman Catholics are found primarily in the north of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;International Religious Freedom Report 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90160.htm |title=Albania: International Religious Freedom Report 2007 |publisher=State.gov|date=14 September 2007 |accessdate=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Albania, 58.79% of the population adheres to Islam, making it the largest religion in the country. Christianity is practiced by 16.99% of the population, making it the second largest religion in the country.

For part of its history, [[History of the Jews in Albania|Albania has also had a Jewish community]].
