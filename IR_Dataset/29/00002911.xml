== Film career ==

Diab's fame in the music industry has led him to experiment with other forms of media, such as film. Amr played himself in his first film, ''El Afareet'', which was released in 1989. It also starred Madiha Kamel. His second film ''Ice Cream in Gleam'' (''Ays Krim fi Glym''), in which Diab starred in 1992, was chosen as one of the best five Egyptian musical films by the [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television]]. The film was featured in the UCLA Film and Television Archive's new program &quot;Music on the Nile: Fifty Years of Egyptian Musical Films&quot; at James Bridges Theater at UCLA on 6, 8 and  10 April 1999. David Chute of the ''Los Angeles Weekly'' termed it &quot;observant&quot; and &quot;a big leap&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= David |last= Chute |author2=Irene G. Behnan |title= All Singing!
