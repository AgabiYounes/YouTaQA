'''Amputation''' is the removal of a limb by [[Physical trauma|trauma]], [[medical illness]], or [[surgery]]. As a surgical measure, it is used to control pain or a disease process in the affected limb, such as [[cancer|malignancy]] or [[gangrene]]. In some cases, it is carried out on individuals as a preventive surgery for such problems. A special case is that of [[congenital amputation]], a [[congenital disorder]], where [[fetus|fetal]] limbs have been cut off by constrictive bands. In some countries, amputation of the hands, feet or other body parts is or was used as a form of [[punishment]] for people who committed crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/16854023|title=Proceedings of the 14th Annual History of Medicine Days| vauthors = Whitelaw WA |date=March 2005|website=Research Gate|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kocharkarn|first=Wachira | name-list-format = vanc |date=Summer 2000|title=Traumatic amputation of the penis|url=http://brazjurol.com.br/pdf/kochakarn_385_389.pdf|journal=Brazilian Journal of Urology|volume=26|pages=385–389|via=Official Journal of the Brazilian Society of Urology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Im95I7FjrvwC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=amputation+punishment#v=onepage&amp;q=amputation%20punishment&amp;f=false|title=Crime and Punishment in Islamic Law: Theory and Practice from the Sixteenth to the Twenty-First Century|last=Peters|first=Rudolph| name-list-format = vanc |date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521792264 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amputation has also been used as a tactic in war and acts of terrorism; it may also occur as a war injury.

When done by a person, the person executing the amputation is an amputator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/amputator|title=Definition of AMPUTATOR|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amputated person is called an amputee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/amputee|title=Definition of AMPUTEE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, the majority of new amputations occur due to complications of the vascular system (the blood vessels), especially from diabetes. Between 1988 and 1996, there were an average of 133,735 hospital discharges for amputation per year in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amputee-coalition.org/fact_sheets/amp_stats_cause.html |title=Amputee Coalition Factsheet |publisher=Amputee-coalition.org |date=2012-07-23 |access-date=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, just in the US, there were 1.6 million amputees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ziegler-Graham K, MacKenzie EJ, Ephraim PL, Travison TG, Brookmeyer R | title = Estimating the prevalence of limb loss in the United States: 2005 to 2050 | journal = Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 422–9 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18295618 | doi = 10.1016/j.apmr.2007.11.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, the US has 2.1 million amputees.

==Types==

=== Leg ===
Lower limb amputations can be divided into two broad categories: minor and major amputations. Minor amputations generally refer to the amputation of [[toe|digits]]. Major amputations are commonly below-knee- or above-knee amputations Common partial foot amputations include the [[François Chopart|Chopart]], [[Tarsometatarsal articulations|Lisfranc]], and ray amputations.

Common forms of ankle [[disarticulation]]s include Pyrogoff, Boyd, and Syme amputations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Pinzur|first = M. S.|displayauthors = etal|date = Sep 2003|title = Syme ankle disarticulation in patients with diabetes|journal = [[J. Bone Joint Surg. Am.]]|volume = 85|issue = 9|pages = 1667–1672|pmid = 12954823|doi = 10.2106/00004623-200309000-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt; A less common major amputation is the [[Van Nes rotation]], or rotationplasty, i.e. the turning around and [[replantation|reattachment]] of the foot to allow the ankle joint to take over the function of the knee.

Types of amputations include:
[[File:Diagram showing an above knee amputation CRUK 094.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|An above-knee amputation]]
; partial foot amputation: amputation of the lower limb distal to the ankle joint
; ankle disarticulation: amputation of the lower limb at the ankle joint
; trans-tibial amputation: amputation of the lower limb between the knee joint and the ankle joint, commonly referred to as a below-knee amputation
; knee disarticulation:{{anchor|BKA}} amputation of the lower limb at the knee joint
; trans-femoral amputation: amputation of the lower limb between the hip joint and the knee joint, commonly referred to an above-knee amputation
; hip disarticulation: amputation of the lower limb at the hip joint
; trans-pelvic disarticulation: amputation of the whole lower limb together with all or part of the pelvis, also known as a hemipelvectomy or hindquarter amputation

===Arm===
[[File:Amputations 18c.jpg|thumb|250px|The 18th century guide to amputations]]Types of upper extremity amputations include:

* partial hand amputation
* wrist disarticulation
* trans-radial amputation, commonly referred to as below-elbow or forearm amputation
* elbow disarticulation
* trans-humeral amputation, commonly referred to as above-elbow amputation
* shoulder disarticulation 
* [[forequarter amputation]]
A variant of the trans-radial amputation is the [[Krukenberg procedure]] in which the radius and ulna are used to create a stump capable of a pincer action.

===Other===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
* Facial amputations include but are not limited to:
** amputation of the ears
** amputation of the nose ([[rhinotomy]])
** amputation of the tongue ([[glossectomy]]).
** amputation of the eyes ([[enucleation of the eye|enucleation]]).
** amputation of the teeth.  Removal of teeth, mainly incisors, is or was practiced by some cultures for ritual purposes (for instance in the [[Iberomaurusian]] culture of [[Prehistoric Central North Africa|Neolithic North Africa]]).
* Breasts:
** amputation of the breasts ([[mastectomy]]).
*[[Genitals]]:
** amputation of the testicles ([[castration]]).
** amputation of the penis ([[penectomy]]).
** amputation of the [[foreskin]] ([[circumcision]]).
** amputation of the clitoris ([[clitoridectomy]]).

[[Hemicorporectomy]], or amputation at the waist, and [[decapitation]], or amputation at the neck, are the most radical amputations.

[[Genital modification and mutilation]] may involve amputating tissue, although not necessarily as a result of injury or disease.

===Self-amputation===
{{See also|Autotomy|Body integrity identity disorder}}

In some rare cases when a person has become trapped in a deserted place, with no means of communication or hope of rescue, the victim has amputated his or her own limb. The most notable case of this is [[Aron Ralston]], a hiker who amputated his own right forearm after it was pinned by a boulder in a hiking accident and he was unable to free himself for over five days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/2003/07/climber-ralston-amputate-arm-utah/|title=Did Climber Have to Cut Off Arm to Save Life?|last=|first=|date=|website=National Geographic|access-date=5 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Body integrity identity disorder]] is a psychological condition in which an individual feels compelled to remove one or more of their body parts, usually a limb.  In some cases, that individual may take drastic measures to remove the offending appendages, either by causing irreparable damage to the limb so that medical intervention cannot save the limb, or by causing the limb to be severed.

==Causes==

===Circulatory disorders===
* [[Diabetes|Diabetic]] vasculopathy
* [[Sepsis]] with peripheral necrosis
* [[Peripheral artery disease]] which can lead to [[Gangrene]]

===Neoplasm===
[[Image:1daypost.jpg|thumb|right|Transfemoral amputation due to [[liposarcoma]]]]
* Cancerous bone or soft tissue tumors (e.g. [[osteosarcoma]], [[chondrosarcoma]], [[fibrosarcoma]], [[epithelioid sarcoma]], [[Ewing's sarcoma]], [[synovial sarcoma]], [[sacrococcygeal teratoma]], [[liposarcoma]]), [[melanoma]]

===Trauma===
[[Image:World War I radiography amputee.jpg|thumb|Three fingers from a soldier's right hand were traumatically amputated during [[World War I]].]]

* Severe limb [[injury|injuries]] in which the limb cannot be saved or efforts to save the limb fail.
* [[Physical trauma|Traumatic]] amputation (an unexpected amputation that occurs at the scene of an accident, where the limb is partially or entirely severed as a direct result of the accident, for example, a finger that is severed from the blade of a table saw)
* Amputation in utero ([[Amniotic band]])

===Congenital anomalies===
* Deformities of digits and/or limbs (e.g., [[proximal femoral focal deficiency]], [[Fibular hemimelia]])
* Extra digits and/or limbs (e.g., [[polydactyly]])

===Infection===
* Bone infection ([[osteomyelitis]]) and/or diabetic foot infections
* [[Gangrene]]

=== Frostbite ===

===Athletic performance===
Sometimes professional [[Sportsperson|athletes]] may choose to have a non-essential digit amputated to relieve chronic pain and impaired performance. 
* Australian Rules footballer [[Daniel Chick]] elected to have his left [[ring finger]] amputated as chronic pain and injury was limiting his performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/2002/0122/aussierules.html |title=RTE: Aussie Rules star has finger removed |access-date=2007-10-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214022643/http://www.rte.ie/sport/2002/0122/aussierules.html |archive-date=2007-12-14 |url-status=bot: unknown }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Rugby union]] player [[Jone Tawake]] also had a finger removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Australian Rugby Union |url=http://www.sportsaustralia.com/articles/oct06/artid6659.html |title=Tawake undergoes surgery to remove finger |publisher=SportsAustralia.com |date=2006-10-17 |access-date=2013-04-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501093242/http://sportsaustralia.com/articles/oct06/artid6659.html |archive-date=2013-05-01 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[National Football League]] [[Safety (American and Canadian football position)|safety]] [[Ronnie Lott]] had the tip of his little finger removed after it was damaged in the [[1985 NFL season]].

===Legal punishment {{anchor|As a punishment in Islam}}===
* Amputation is used as a [[physical punishment|legal punishment]] in a number of countries, among them [[Legal system of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]], [[Legal system of Yemen|Yemen]], [[Legal system of the United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates]], and [[Judicial system of Iran#Law|Iran]].

===Method===
{{howto|date=May 2018}}
[[File:Curvy amputation knife DSC09451.jpg|thumb|200px|Curved knives such as this one were used, in the past, for some kinds of amputations.]]
The first step is [[ligature (medicine)|ligating]] the supplying [[artery]] and [[vein]], to prevent [[hemorrhage]] (bleeding). The muscles are transected, and finally, the [[bone]] is sawed through with an [[oscillating saw]]. Sharp and rough edges of the bone(s) are filed down, skin and muscle flaps are then transposed over the stump, occasionally with the insertion of elements to attach a [[prosthesis]].

Distal stabilisation of muscles is recommended. This allows effective muscle contraction which reduces atrophy, allows functional use of the stump and maintains soft tissue coverage of the remnant bone. The preferred stabilisation technique is myodesis where the muscle is attached to the bone or its periosteum. In joint disarticulation amputations tenodesis may be used where the muscle tendon is attached to the bone. Muscles should be attached under similar tension to normal physiological conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Smith DG |title=Atlas of Amputations and Limb Deficiencies: Surgical, Prosthetic and Rehabilitation Principles|date=2004|publisher=American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons|isbn=978-0892033133|pages=21–30|chapter=Chapter 2. General principles of amputation surgery.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An experimental technique known as the &quot;Ewing amputation&quot; aims to improve post-amputation [[proprioception]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2018/04/13/stepping-strong-brigham-amputation How The Marathon Bombing Helped Bring Innovation To Amputation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brighamandwomensfaulkner.org/about-bwfh/news/ewing Jim Ewing, Dynamic-Model Amputation Patient ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920,&amp;nbsp; Professor Janos Ertl, Sr., MD, of Hungary, developed the Ertl procedure in order to return a high number of amputees to the work force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ertlreconstruction.com/|title=Ertl Reconstruction - amputation|website=www.ertlreconstruction.com|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ertl technique, an osteomyoplastic procedure for transtibial amputation, can be used to create a highly functional residual limb. Creation of a tibiofibular bone bridge provides a stable, broad tibiofibular articulation that may be capable of some distal weight bearing. Several different modified techniques and fibular bridge fixation methods have been used; however, no current evidence exists regarding comparison of the different techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fischgrund|first=Jeffrey S.|date=June 2016|title=JAAOS Research|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons|volume=24|issue=6|pages=392|doi=10.5435/jaaos-d-16-00309|pmid=27213622|issn=1067-151X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-operative management ===
The use of rigid removable dressings (RRD's) in trans-tibial (below knee) amputations, rather than soft bandaging has been shown to improve healing time, reduce edema, prevent knee flexion contractures and reduce complications, including further amputation, from external trauma such as falls onto the stump&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reichmann JP, Stevens PM, Rheinstein J, Kreulen CD | title = Removable Rigid Dressings for Postoperative Management of Transtibial Amputations: A Review of Published Evidence | journal = PM&amp;R | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 516–523 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29054690 | doi = 10.1016/j.pmrj.2017.10.002 | url =   }}&lt;/ref&gt; and should be considered standard practice.

Post-operative management, in addition to wound healing, should consider maintenance of limb strength, joint range, edema management, preservation of the intact limb (if applicable) and stump desensitisation.

== Trauma ==
Traumatic amputation is the partial or total avulsion of a part of a body during a serious accident, like traffic, labor, or combat.&lt;ref&gt;Current Surgical Diagnosis and Treatment: &quot;Amputations&quot;, editions Lange, USA, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Harry Gouvas: &quot;Accidents and Massive Disasters&quot;, editions of Greek Red Cross, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neil Watson: &quot;Hand Injuries and Infections&quot; Cower Medical Publishing, London, New York, 1996, {{ISBN|0-906923-80-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traumatic amputation of a human limb, either partial or total, creates the immediate danger of death from blood loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Harry Gouvas: &quot;Accidents and massive Disasters&quot;, Editions of Greek Red Cross, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthopedic surgeons often assess the severity of different injuries using the Mangled Extremity Severity Score. Given different clinical and situational factors, they can predict the likelihood of amputation. This is especially useful for emergency physicians to quickly evaluate patients and decide on consultations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johansen K, Daines M, Howey T, Helfet D, Hansen ST | title = Objective criteria accurately predict amputation following lower extremity trauma | journal = The Journal of Trauma | volume = 30 | issue = 5 | pages = 568–72; discussion 572–3 | date = May 1990 | pmid = 2342140 | doi = 10.1097/00005373-199005000-00007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes===
[[File:3372709503 10dc75d783 oSéquelleAmputation.jpg|thumb|170px|Private Lewis Francis was wounded July 21, 1861, at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] by a bayonet to the knee.]]
Traumatic amputation is uncommon in humans (1 per 20,804 population per year). Loss of limb usually happens immediately during the accident, but sometimes a few days later after medical complications. Statistically the most common causes of traumatic amputations are:&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;
* Traffic accidents (cars, motorcycles, bicycles, trains, etc.)
* Labor accidents (equipment, instruments, cylinders, chainsaws, press machines, meat machines, wood machines, etc.)
* Agricultural accidents, with machines and mower equipment
* Electric shock hazards
* Firearms, bladed weapons, explosives
* Violent rupture of ship rope or industry wire rope
* Ring traction (ring amputation, de-gloving injuries)
* Building doors and car doors
* Animal attacks
* Gas cylinder explosions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scuba Tanks as Lethal Weapons|url=http://www.undercurrent.org/UCnow/dive_magazine/2011/LethalWeapons201102.html|website=undercurrent.org|access-date=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Other rare accidents&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

===Treatment===
The development of the science of [[microsurgery]] over last 40 years has provided several treatment options for a traumatic amputation, depending on the patient's specific trauma and clinical situation:
* 1st choice: Surgical amputation - break - prosthesis
* 2nd choice: Surgical amputation - transplantation of other tissue - plastic reconstruction.
* 3rd choice: [[Replantation]] - reconnection - revascularisation of amputated limb, by microscope (after 1969)
* 4th choice: Transplantation of cadaveric hand (after 2000),&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neil Watson: &quot;Hand Injuries and Infections&quot;Cower Medical Publishing,{{ISBN|0-906923-80-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epidemiology===
* In the United States in 1999, there were 14,420 non-fatal traumatic amputations according to the [[American Statistical Association]]. Of these, 4,435 occurred as a result of traffic and transportation accidents and 9,985 were due to labor accidents. Of all traumatic amputations, the distribution percentage is 30.75% for traffic accidents and 69.24% for labor accidents.&lt;ref name=&quot;amstat.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.amstat.org/ American Statistical Association: Amputations in USA, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The population of the United States in 1999 was about 300,000,000, so the conclusion is that there is one amputation per 20,804 persons per year. In the group of labor amputations, 53% occurred in laborers and technicians, 30% in production and service workers, 16% in silviculture and fishery workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;amstat.org&quot;/&gt;
* A study found that in 2010, 22.8% of patients undergoing amputation of a lower extremity in the United States were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss AJ, Elixhauser A, Steiner C. ''Readmissions to U.S. Hospitals by Procedure, 2010.'' HCUP Statistical Brief #154. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. April 2013. [http://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb154.jsp]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Methods in preventing amputation, [[limb-sparing techniques]], depend on the problems that might cause amputations to be necessary. Chronic infections, often caused by diabetes or [[decubitus ulcers]] in bedridden patients, are common causes of infections that lead to gangrene, which would then necessitate amputation.

There are two key challenges: first, many patients have impaired circulation in their extremities, and second, they have difficulty curing infections in limbs with poor vasculation (blood circulation).
 
Crush injuries where there is extensive tissue damage and poor circulation also benefit from [[Hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric oxygen therapy]] (HBOT). The high level of oxygenation and revascularization speed up recovery times and prevent infections.

A study found that the patented method called Circulator Boot achieved significant results in prevention of amputation in patients with diabetes and arterioscleorosis.&lt;ref name=dillon1&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bouskela E, Donyo KA | title = Effects of oral administration of purified micronized flavonoid fraction on increased microvascular permeability induced by various agents and on ischemia/reperfusion in the hamster cheek pouch | journal = Angiology | volume = 48 | issue = 5 | pages = 391–9 | date = May 1997 | pmid = 9158383 | doi = 10.1177/000331979704800503 | url = http://www.circulatorboot.com/literature/angiology1.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101125035502/http://circulatorboot.com/literature/angiology1.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2010-11-25 | access-date = 2010-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dillon2&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dillon RS | title = Patient assessment and examples of a method of treatment.

For victims of trauma, advances in [[microsurgery]] in the 1970s have made replantations of severed body parts possible.

The establishment of laws, rules, and guidelines, and employment of modern equipment help protect people from traumatic amputations.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

==Prognosis==
The individual may experience psychological trauma and emotional discomfort. The stump will remain an area of reduced mechanical stability. Limb loss can present significant or even drastic practical limitations.

A large proportion of amputees (50–80%) experience the phenomenon of [[phantom limb]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 2005 |title=The Science of Things | first = Heidi | last = Schultz | name-list-format = vanc |journal=National Geographic Magazine |url=http://magma.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0501/resources_who.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906143209/http://magma.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0501/resources_who.html |archive-date=September 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; they feel body parts that are no longer there. These limbs can itch, ache, burn, feel tense, dry or wet, locked in or trapped or they can feel as if they are moving. Some scientists believe it has to do with a kind of neural map that the brain has of the body, which sends information to the rest of the brain about limbs regardless of their existence. Phantom sensations and phantom pain may also occur after the removal of body parts other than the limbs, e.g. after amputation of the breast, extraction of a tooth (phantom tooth pain) or removal of an eye ([[phantom eye syndrome]]).

A similar phenomenon is unexplained sensation in a body part unrelated to the amputated limb. It has been hypothesized that the portion of the brain responsible for processing stimulation from amputated limbs, being deprived of input, expands into the surrounding brain, (''[[Phantoms in the Brain]]'': [[V.S. Ramachandran]] and [[Sandra Blakeslee]]) such that an individual who has had an arm amputated will experience unexplained pressure or movement on his face or head{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.

In many cases, the phantom limb aids in adaptation to a prosthesis, as it permits the person to experience [[proprioception]] of the prosthetic limb. To support improved resistance or usability, comfort or healing, some type of [[stump sock]]s may be worn instead of or as part of wearing a prosthesis.

Another side effect can be [[heterotopic ossification]], especially when a bone injury is combined with a head injury. The brain signals the bone to grow instead of scar tissue to form, and nodules and other growth can interfere with prosthetics and sometimes require further operations. This type of injury has been especially common among soldiers wounded by [[improvised explosive device]]s in the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/03/26/MNSOLDIERS26.DTL |title=War without end / Damaged soldiers start their agonizing recoveries |first=Joan |last=Ryan |name-list-format=vanc |date=March 25, 2006 |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208093622/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2006%2F03%2F26%2FMNSOLDIERS26.DTL |archive-date=February 8, 2011 |url-status=live |access-date=June 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to technologic advances in prosthetics, many amputees live active lives with little restriction. Organizations such as the [[Challenged Athletes Foundation]] have been developed to give amputees the opportunity to be involved in athletics and [[adaptive sports]] such as [[Team Zaryen|Amputee Soccer]].

Nearly half of the individuals who have an amputation due to vascular disease will die within 5 years, usually secondary to the extensive co-morbidities rather than due to direct consequences of amputation. This is higher than the five year mortality rates for breast cancer, colon cancer, and prostate cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robbins|first=Jeffrey M.|last2=Strauss|first2=Gerald|last3=Aron|first3=David|last4=Long|first4=Jodi|last5=Kuba|first5=Jennifer|last6=Kaplan|first6=Yelena|date=November 2008|title=Mortality Rates and Diabetic Foot Ulcers|journal=Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association|volume=98|issue=6|pages=489–493|doi=10.7547/0980489|pmid=19017860|issn=8750-7315|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e804940ef6ce6111a99b545511ac10aa28c2ea1d}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of persons with diabetes who have a lower extremity amputation, up to 55% will require amputation of the second leg within two to three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Savage|first=P.

==Etymology==
The word amputation is derived from the [[Latin]] ''amputare'', &quot;to cut away&quot;, from ''ambi-'' (&quot;about&quot;, &quot;around&quot;) and ''putare'' (&quot;to prune&quot;). The English word “Poes” was first applied to surgery in the 17th century, possibly first in Peter Lowe's ''A discourse of the Whole Art of Chirurgerie'' (published in either 1597 or 1612); his work was derived from 16th-century French texts and early English writers also used the words &quot;extirpation&quot; (16th-century French texts tended to use ''extirper''), &quot;[[disarticulation]]&quot;, and &quot;[[dismemberment]]&quot; (from the Old French ''desmembrer'' and a more common term before the 17th century for limb loss or removal), or simply &quot;cutting&quot;, but by the end of the 17th century &quot;amputation&quot; had come to dominate as the accepted medical term.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}
