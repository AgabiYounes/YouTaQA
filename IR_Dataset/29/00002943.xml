'''Dual wielding''' is the technique of using two [[weapon]]s, one in each hand, during [[combat]]. It is not a common combat practice. Although historical records of dual wielding in [[war]] are limited, there are numerous [[Martial arts#Variation and scope|weapon-based martial arts]] that involve the use of a pair of weapons. The use of a [[companion weapon]] is sometimes employed in [[European martial arts]] and fencing, such as a parrying dagger. [[Miyamoto Musashi]], a [[Japan]]ese swordsman and ''[[ronin]]'', was said to have conceived of the idea of a particular style of swordsmanship involving the use of two swords.

In terms of [[firearm]]s, especially [[handgun]]s and [[submachine gun]]s, dual wielding is generally denounced by firearm enthusiasts due to its impracticality.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlN_4MMTdPs&lt;/ref&gt; Though using two hand guns at a time confers an advantage by allowing more ready ammunition, it is rarely done due to other aspects of weapons handling. Dual wielding has been popularized by fictional works ([[film]], [[television]], and [[video games]]), which have the freedom of ignoring the impracticality of the style, plus the term itself is often invoked in the context of the work.

==History==
Dual wielding has not been used or mentioned much in military history, though it appears in [[Martial arts#Variation and scope|weapon-based martial arts]] and [[fencing]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r0PCAgAAQBAJ|title=Schools and Masters of Fencing: From the Middle Ages to the Eighteenth Century|last=Castle|first=Egerton|date=2012-06-19|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486138756|page=51|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The use of weapon combinations in each hand has been mentioned for close combat in western Europe during the [[Byzantine]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Byzantine&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim Dawson PhD|title=Byzantine Infantryman: Eastern Roman Empire C.900-1204|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O14p5hPv8wAC|date=2010|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84603-105-2|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Medieval]], and [[Renaissance era]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ShacklefordSpiritofSword&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Shackleford|title=Spirit Of The Sword: A Celebration of Artistry and Craftsmanship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pkLaMKl09L8C|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=7 September 2010|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=978-1-4402-1638-1|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of a [[parrying dagger]] such as a main gauche along with a [[rapier]] is common in historical European martial arts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford Medieval warfare&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Clifford Rogers|title=The Oxford Encyclopaedia of Medieval Warfare and Military Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mzwpq6bLHhMC|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=June 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533403-6|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Traditional schools of [[Japanese martial arts]] include dual wield techniques, particularly a style conceived by [[Miyamoto Musashi]] involving the [[katana]] and [[wakizashi]], two-sword [[kenjutsu]] techniques he called ''[[Niten Ichi-ryū]]''. [[Eskrima]], the traditional martial arts of the Philippines teaches ''Doble Baston'' techniques involving the basic use of a pair of [[rattan sticks]] and also Espada y daga or Sword/Stick and Dagger. [[Okinawan martial arts]] have a method that uses a pair of [[Sai (weapon)|''sai'']].  [[Chinese martial arts]] involve the use of a pair of [[butterfly sword]]s and [[hook sword]]s. [[Gatka]], a weapon-based martial art from the [[Punjab region]], is known to use two sticks at a time. The Thailand weapon-based martial art [[Krabi Krabong]] involves the use of a separate [[Krabi (sword)|''Krabi'']] in each hand. [[Kalaripayattu]] teaches advanced students to use either two sticks (of various sizes) or two daggers or two swords, simultaneously. One of the oldest mentions of dual wielding are the gladiator style known as [[dimachaerus]], where a gladiator would use two swords of the same length, sometimes straight and sometimes crooked midways up the blade.  North American Indian tribes of the Atlantic northeast used a form involving a [[tomahawk]] in the primary hand and [[longknife]] in the secondary.  It is practiced today as part of the modern Cree martial art [[Okichitaw]].

All the above-mentioned examples, involve either one long and one short weapon, or two short weapons.  An example of a dual wield of two sabres is the Ukrainian cossack dance [[hopak]].

The use of a gun in each hand is often associated with the [[American Old West]], mainly due to media portrayals. It was common for people in the era to carry two guns, but not to use them at the same time, as shown in movies. The other pistol was used as a back-up weapon.&lt;ref name=&quot;OldwestFactorFilm&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeremy Agnew | title=The Old West in Fact and Film: History Versus Hollywood | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R_mRcTRYcvsC | accessdate=12 June 2013 | year=2012 | publisher=McFarland | isbn=978-0-7864-9311-1 | page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there were several examples of gunmen in the West who actually used two pistols at the same time in their gunfights: 
* [[John Wesley Hardin]] killed a gunman named Benjamin Bradley who shot at him, by drawing both of his pistols and firing back.&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, John Wesley (1896).

* Mexican vaquero [[Augustine Chacon]] had several gunfights in which he was outnumbered by more than one gunman and prevailed by equipping himself with a revolver in each hand.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R. Michael (2005).

* [[King Fisher]] once managed to kill three bandits in a shootout by pulling both of his pistols.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccchaney.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.ccchaney.com/Genealogy/maternal/Damron/FisherJohnKing/kingfisher.html Texas Gunslinger, Outlaw and Lawman].&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the infamous [[Four Dead in Five Seconds Gunfight]], lawman [[Dallas Stoudenmire]] pulled both of his pistols as he ran out onto the street and killed one bystander and two other gunmen.&lt;ref&gt;Metz, Leon Claire. 1979.

* [[Jonathan R. Davis]], a prospector during the [[California Gold Rush]], was ambushed by eleven outlaws while together with two of his comrades. One of his friends was killed and the other was mortally wounded during the ambush. Davis drew both of his revolvers and fired, killing seven of the bandits, and killing the rest of them with his bowie knife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcs-group.com/oldwest/pistoleer/davis.html The Spell of the West: Captain Jonathan R.

Dual wielding two handguns was said to have been popularized by the passion of film and television.&lt;ref name=&quot;GunDigestGuide2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerry Ahern|title=Gun Digest Buyer's Guide to Concealed-Carry Handguns|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ulWbH-4xtd8C|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=5 October 2010|publisher=F+W Media, Inc|isbn=978-1-4402-1767-8|pages=135–137|chapter=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[MythBusters]]'', there is an episode in which they compared many firing stances, including having a gun in each hand and found that, compared to the two-handed single-gun stance as a benchmark, only the one-handed shoulder-level stance with a single gun was comparable in terms of accuracy and speed. The ability to look down the sights of the gun was given as the main reason for this.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myth&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=Wheel of Mythfortune |series=MythBusters |date=November 23, 2011 |network=[[Discovery Channel]] |season=2011 |number=177 |first1=Adam |first2=Jamie |last1=Savage |last2=Hyneman}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an episode the following year, they compared holding two guns and firing simultaneously—rather than alternating left and right shots—with holding one gun in the two-handed stance, and found that the results were in favor of using two guns and firing simultaneously.&lt;ref name=MythBusters&gt;{{cite web|title=Hollywood gunslingers|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/hollywood-gunslingers.htm|publisher=Mythbusters - Discovery|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
