'''Arcadia 2001''' is a [[Second generation of video game consoles|second-generation]] [[8-bit]] [[home video game console]] released by [[Emerson Radio]] in May 1982, several months before the release of [[ColecoVision]]. It was discontinued only 18 months later, with a total of 35 games having been released.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watcher reviews&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Watcher|first=Dark|title=Emerson Arcadia 2001 - DW Facts|url=http://www.videogameconsolelibrary.com/pg80-arcadia.htm#page=reviews|publisher=Video Game Console Library|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emerson licensed the Arcadia 2001 to Bandai, which released it in Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watcher reviews&quot;/&gt; Over 30 Arcadia 2001 clones exist.

The unrelated Arcadia Corporation, manufacturer of the [[Atari 2600]] [[Starpath Supercharger|Supercharger]] add-on, was sued by Emerson for trademark infringement. Arcadia Corporation then changed its name to [[Starpath]].&lt;ref name=&quot;starpath&quot;&gt;[http://thedoteaters.com/?bitstory=epyx The Dot Eaters - Epyx | The Dot Eaters&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Arcadia is much smaller than its contemporary competitors and is powered by a standard 12-volt [[AC adapter|power supply]] so it can be used in a boat or a vehicle. It also has two outputs (or inputs) headphone jacks on the back of the unit, on the far left and far right sides.

The system came with two [[Intellivision]]-style controllers with a 12-button keypad and 'fire' buttons on the sides. The direction pads have a removable joystick attachment. Most games came with [[BoPET]] overlays that could be applied to the controller's keypads. The console itself had five buttons: power, start, reset, option, and select.

There are at least three different types of cartridge case styles&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obsoletemedia.org/emerson-arcadia-2001/ obsoletemedia.org: Emerson Arcadia 2001 (1982 – 1984)]&lt;/ref&gt; and artwork, with variations on each. Emerson-family cartridges come in two different lengths (short and long) of black plastic cases.

In 1982, the Bandai Arcadia, a variant of the Emerson Arcadia 2001, was released in Japan by Bandai. There were four Japan-exclusive game releases developed by Bandai which were the only known Arcadia titles written by other companies than UA Ltd.

*''Doraemon''
*''Dr. Slump''
*''Mobile Soldier Gundam''
*''Super Dimension Fortress Macross''

==Reception==
After seeing the Arcadia 2001 at the summer 1982 [[Consumer Electronics Show]], [[Danny Goodman]] of ''[[Creative Computing]] Video &amp; Arcade Games'' reported that its graphics were similar to the Atari 2600's, and that &quot;our overall impression of the game play was favorable for a system in this price range, though no cartridge stands out as being an exciting original creation&quot;. He called the controller offering both [[Intellivision]]-like disc and joystick functionality &quot;A great idea&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;goodman1983spring&quot;&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Goodman |first=Danny |author-link=Danny Goodman |date=Spring 1983 |title=Home Video Games: Video Games Update |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/cva/v1n1/vgupdate.php |magazine=Creative Computing Video &amp; Arcade Games |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Games==
Emerson planned to launch the console with 19 games.{{r|goodman1983spring}} Some Arcadia 2001 games are ports of lesser-known arcade games such as ''Route 16'', ''Jungler'', and ''Jump Bug'', which were not available on other home systems.

Emerson actually created many popular arcade titles including ''[[Pac-Man]]'', ''[[Galaxian]]'' and ''[[Defender (video game)|Defender]]'' for the Arcadia, but never had them manufactured as Atari started to sue its competitor companies for releasing games to which it had exclusive-rights agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitpress.com/the_digs/arcadia/texts/2001-faq.htm |title=Arcadia 2001: Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=digitpress.com|date=2002-06-04 |accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early marketing showed popular arcade games, but they were later released as clones. For instance, the Arcadia 2001 game ''Space Raiders'' is a clone of ''Defender'', and ''Breakaway'' is a clone of ''[[Breakout clone|Breakout]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lester|first=John|title=History of Consoles: Arcadia 2001 (1982)|url=http://gamester81.com/history-of-consoles-arcadia-2001-1982/|publisher=Gamster81|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
