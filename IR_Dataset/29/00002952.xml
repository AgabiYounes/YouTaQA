An '''alcopop''' (or '''cooler''', '''spirit cooler''' in [[South African English]], or '''malternative''' in America) is any of certain flavored [[alcoholic beverage]]s with relatively low alcohol content (e.g., 3–7% [[alcohol by volume]]), including:
# [[Malt beverage]]s to which various fruit [[juice]]s or other flavorings have been added
# Beverages containing wine to which ingredients such as fruit juice or other flavorings have been added ([[wine cooler]]s)
# Beverages containing [[Distilled beverage|distilled alcohol]] and sweet liquids such as fruit juices or other flavourings&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&amp;SessionId=51&amp;GA=95&amp;DocTypeId=SB&amp;DocNum=1625&amp;GAID=9&amp;LegID=29771&amp;SpecSess=&amp;Session= SB1625, Illinois General Assembly 1977] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205091420/http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&amp;SessionId=51&amp;GA=95&amp;DocTypeId=SB&amp;DocNum=1625&amp;GAID=9&amp;LegID=29771&amp;SpecSess=&amp;Session= |date=2008-12-05 }} (Amendment to The Liquor Control Act of 1934, Section 6-35; 235 ILCS 5/6-35)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''alcopop''' (a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''alcohol'' and ''[[soft drink|pop]]'') is used commonly in the United Kingdom to describe these drinks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.marininstitute.org/alcopops/resources/Alcopop_QA.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511223144/http://www.marininstitute.org/alcopops/resources/Alcopop_QA.pdf |archive-date=2008-05-11 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other terms include '''FAB''' (flavored alcoholic beverage), '''FMB''' (flavored malt beverage),&lt;ref name=&quot;CBE&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boe.ca.gov/sptaxprog/pdf/fmbpaper2.pdf|title=California Board of Equalization. Flavored Malt Beverages, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''PPS''' (pre-packaged spirit or premium packaged spirits), and '''RTD''' ([[ready-to-drink]] – [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]).

== Description ==
There are a variety of beverages produced and marketed around the world as well as within each market which are described as coolers or alcopops. They tend to be [[sweetness|sweet]] and served in small [[bottle]]s (typically 355 ml (the normal size of a soda pop can) in the US, 275 ml in South Africa and Germany, 330 ml in Canada and Europe), and between 4% and 7% [[alcohol by volume|ABV]]. In Europe, Canada, and South Africa coolers tend to be pre-mixed spirits, including vodka (e.g. [[Smirnoff Ice]]) or rum (e.g. [[Bacardi Breezer]]). In the United States, on the other hand, alcopops often start out as [[hops|un-hopped]] [[beer]]s, depending on the state in which they are sold. Much of the malt (and alcohol) is removed (leaving mostly water), with subsequent addition of alcohol (usually vodka or grain alcohol), sugar, coloring and flavoring. Such drinks are legally classified as beers in virtually all states and can therefore be sold in outlets that do not or cannot carry spirit-based drinks. There are, however, stronger ones that ''are'' simply pre-mixed spirits (e.g. Bacardi Rum Island Iced Tea), often containing about 12.5% alcohol by volume, that can be sold only where hard liquor is available.

In the United States there is a proportionally limited tax on alcopops relative to those sold in Europe, although some states are considering legislation to bring their tax levels closer to the European model, which is credited with limiting consumption by youth.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

According to the US [[Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau]] (TTB):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Flavored malt beverages are brewery products that differ from traditional malt beverages such as beer, ale, lager, porter, stout, or malt liquor in several respects. Flavored malt beverages exhibit little or no traditional beer or malt beverage character. Their flavor is derived primarily from added flavors rather than from malt and other materials used in fermentation. At the same time, flavored malt beverages are marketed in traditional beer-type bottles and cans and distributed to the alcohol beverage market through beer and malt beverage wholesalers, and their alcohol content is similar to other malt beverages in the 4-6% alcohol by volume range.

Although flavored malt beverages are produced at breweries, their method of production differs significantly from the production of other malt beverages and beer. In producing flavored malt beverages, brewers brew a fermented base of beer from malt and other brewing materials. Brewers then treat this base using a variety of processes in order to remove malt beverage character from the base. For example, they remove the color, bitterness, and taste generally associated with beer, ale, porter, stout, and other malt beverages. This leaves a base product to which brewers add various flavors, which typically contain distilled spirits, to achieve the desired taste profile and alcohol level.

While the alcohol content of flavored malt beverages is similar to that of most traditional malt beverages, the alcohol in many of them is derived primarily from the distilled spirits component of the added flavors rather than from fermentation.
:—70 Fed. Reg. 194 et seq. (January 3, 2005)&lt;ref name=&quot;CBE&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In some [[Continental Europe]]an countries, such as [[Austria]] and [[Germany]], bottled [[beer cocktail]]s and [[Shandy|shandies]] are available, which are being marketed the same way like alcopops. However, these beverages are based on traditional hopped beers and therefore not considered to be alcopops.

== History ==

[[File:Bacardibreezer.jpg|thumb|left|Two [[Bacardi Breezer]]s]]

Wine coolers gained popularity in the US market in the 1980s when [[Bartles and Jaymes]] began advertising their brand of wine coolers, which were followed by other brands, including when [[Bacardi]] introduced the [[Bacardi Breezer|Breezer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.distell.co.za/agechecker/?brand=/brands/default.aspx|title=Age Checker &amp;#124; Distell|website=www.distell.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growth in popularity occurred around 1993 with [[Two Dogs]], DNA Alcoholic Spring Water, [[Hooper's Hooch]] and [[Zima (drink)|Zima]], which was marketed under the title of &quot;malternative beverage.&quot; [[Wine coolers]] were on the decline due to the increase in the US federal wine tax, and using a malt-beverage base became the new industry standard. Later, [[Mike's Hard Lemonade]] was released in the United States, with humorous commercials depicting what they called &quot;violence against lemons&quot;. [[Smirnoff]] also came out with another [[citrus]]-[[flavor]]ed [[malt beverage]] in the United States in the late 1990s called [[Smirnoff Ice]], which promoted itself with flashy commercials, usually involving trendy young people dancing in unlikely situations and places. (In the UK, Smirnoff Ice is marketed by [[Diageo]] as a PPS.){{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Some{{who|date=March 2018}} have expressed concern that such drinks might appeal to children as they tend to be sweet and brightly colored. Many [[Alcohol advertising|cooler advertising campaigns]] have been criticized as trying to make 'alcopops' appeal to young drinkers. In the United Kingdom, that led to a media outcry during the mid-1990s as the [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] press associated alcopops with under-age drinking which damaged sales and would lead to [[off-licence]]s withdrawing them from their stores.
In response to a complaint from the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] (CSPI), the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) conducted an extensive investigation in 2001. The agency &quot;found no evidence of intent to target minors with the FMB products, packaging, or advertising. Furthermore, after reviewing the consumer survey evidence submitted by CSPI in support of the proposition that FMBs were predominantly popular with minors, the FTC concluded that flaws in the survey's methodology limited the ability to draw conclusions from the survey data.&quot;

The Federal Trade Commission again in 2003 investigated FMB ads, [[product placement]], and internal company marketing documents after a directive from the conferees of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. &quot;The Commission's investigation found no evidence of targeting underage consumers in the marketing of FMBs. Adults 21 to 29 appear to be the intended target of FMB marketing&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Federal Trade Commission.

Washington, DC: Federal Trade Commission, 2003. p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; and found that &quot;the majority of FMB drinkers are over the age of 27.&quot;&lt;ref name=FTC&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/os/2003/09/alcohol08report.pdf Alcohol Marketing and Advertising: A Report to Congress]''. Washington, DC: Federal Trade Commission, 2003. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2003, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] raised the tax on flavored malt beverages to equal that of spirits, the second highest in [[Europe]]. [[Germany]] has imposed an extra duty of 0.80 to 0.90 [[euro]] per bottle effective August 1, 2004. To circumvent higher taxation, some German producers have switched to [[wine coolers]], which are being marketed the same way. Some bottles now carry a warning stating that they are not for consumption by people under the legal drinking age (under 18 in the UK and 21 in the United States). On May 11, 2008, the [[Australia]]n Government increased the excise tax on alcopops by 70%, to bring it in line with the tax on spirits. There is the concern this tax will encourage consumers to buy straight spirits and mix the drinks themselves,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/expert-report-backs-alcopop-tax-hike-20080917-4i2p.html|title=Expert report backs alcopop tax hike|last=Jenkins|first=Melissa|date=2008-09-16|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly resulting in drinks with a higher alcohol concentration than the premixed alternatives. This tax was revoked during March 2009 meaning the government had to pay back the 290 million collected on the tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/alcopops-price-to-drop-after-bill-defeat/story-e6frf7jo-1111119172860 |title=Alcopops tax defeated in the Senate after second vote |first=Gerard |last=McManus |agency=AAP |work=Herald Sun |date=March 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Trade Commission report states, &quot;Further, industry-conducted research on consumers over the age of 21 who use FMBs shows that these consumers generally view the FMBs as substitutes for beer, ... This research also concludes that consumers are not likely to consume more than two or three FMBs on any occasion because of the products'
sweetness.&lt;ref name=FTC/&gt;

In March 2018, Coca-Cola announced it would be launching an alcopop product for the first time, a ''[[chūhai]]'' beverage in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |title=Coca-Cola to launch alcoholic drink in Japan |first=Leo |last=Lewis |url=https://www.ft.com/content/0f2f1ee4-2159-11e8-9efc-0cd3483b8b80 |date=March 6, 2018 |quote=Coca-Cola is planning a break with 125 years to experiment with its first alcoholic drink as the world’s largest soft drinks company eyes Japan’s growing market for “Chu-Hi” alcopops. |archive-url=https://archive.today/20180307022457/https://www.ft.com/content/0f2f1ee4-2159-11e8-9efc-0cd3483b8b80 |archive-date=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brands of coolers are numerous and their alcoholic base vary greatly.&lt;ref name=&quot;cocktailtimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cocktailtimes.com/indepth/rtd/rtd.shtml|title=Ready To Drink (RTD) Fact Sheet|publisher=Cocktail Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some notable brands include: [[VK Vodkakick]], [[Smirnoff Ice]], [[Mike's Hard Lemonade]], [[Bacardi Breezer]], [[Palm Bay (alcoholic beverage)|Palm Bay]], [[Skyy Blue]], [[Jack Daniel's]] Hard Cola and in the UK  [[WKD Original Vodka]].

== Attempts to discourage &quot;alcopops&quot; ==
=== Australia ===
The Australian government increased the tax on these drinks under the [[2008 Australian federal budget|2008 budget]] to the same rate as spirits, volumetrically, in an effort to stop [[binge drinking]]. The tax was criticized by the opposition as a tax grab, and voted down in the Senate on March 18, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/national/alcopops-tax-fails-to-pass-senate-20090318-91zw.html Alcopops tax fails to pass Senate], ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 18 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Before its rejection, the tax had already raised at least A$290 million after April 2008.&lt;ref name=TryAgain/&gt; In April 2009, some Labor party MPs planned to resubmit the tax to the Senate,&lt;ref name=TryAgain&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,25337669-421,00.html Government to try again with alcopops tax] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418161735/http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C27574%2C25337669-421%2C00.html |date=2009-04-18 }}, news.com.au, 15 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was finally approved in August 2009, increasing the tax on the drinks from $39.36 to $66.67 per litre of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Australian Tax on Alcopops|url=http://www.ias.org.uk/What-we-do/Publication-archive/The-Globe/Issue-1-2009/Australian-Tax-on-Alcopops.aspx|accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 study concluded that the tax had no impact on binge drinking of the drinks by teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/food/alcopop-tax-fails-to-deter-teen-binge-drinking-raises-45-billion-in-revenue/story-fneuz92c-1226650824648|title='Alcopop' tax fails to deter teen binge drinking, raises $4.5 billion in revenue|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
On 1 July 2004 the German government increased the tax on mixed drinks based on spirits (e.g. vodka, rum) by roughly one Euro per 275-ml-bottle in order to discourage teenagers drinking excessively, although those drinks were already prohibited for those under the age of 18. This had two implications: The most common alcopops, such as [[Smirnoff Ice]] or [[Bacardi Breezer]], were nearly taken off the market, while other manufacturers changed the recipes of their drinks to replace spirit alcohols with wine or beer, but with the same [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]], enabling these mixed drinks (which are not &quot;alcopops&quot; under German law) to be sold legally to minors 16 and 17 years of age.

=== Philippines ===
In 2019, some senators including [[Pia Cayetano]] and former Special Assistant to the President [[Bong Go]] called for pullout of alcopops from the market due to &quot;deceptive packaging that resembles fruit juices usually bought by young consumers&quot;. Alcopops also have seven percent alcohol content, which is slightly lower than that of local beer brand [[Red Horse Beer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.mb.com.ph/2019/08/22/pull-out-alcopop-drinks-from-grocery-shelves-bong-go-urges|title=Pull out Alcopop drinks from grocery shelves, Bong Go urges|website=Manila Bulletin News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/business/238127-senators-take-sip-alcopops-alcohol-tax-hearing|title=LOOK: Senators take a sip of alcopops during alcohol tax hearing|first=Ralf|last=Rivas|website=Rappler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===
In South Africa, &quot;spirit coolers&quot; cannot be sold to persons under the age of 18. They are only sold at liquor stores.

=== United Kingdom ===
In June 1997, [[Co-op Food]] became the first major retailer to place an outright ban on the sale of alcopops in its shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/co-op-places-ban-on-alcopops-1255741.html|title=Co-op places ban on alcopops|website=[[The Independent]]|last=Cope|first=Nigel|date=13 June 1997|access-date=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has since been rescinded.

In the UK [[Secretary of State for Health]], [[Patricia Hewitt]] called for a tax increase on such products, although this had not yet happened as of October 2013.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}
