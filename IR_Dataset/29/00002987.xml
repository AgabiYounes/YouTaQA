The '''Acts of Union''' were two [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]]: the '''Union with Scotland Act 1706''' passed by the [[Parliament of England]], and the '''Union with England Act''' passed in 1707 by the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. They put into effect the terms of the [[Treaty of Union]] that had been agreed on 22 July 1706, following negotiation between commissioners representing the parliaments of the two countries. By the two Acts, the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]]{{mdash}}which at the time were separate [[sovereign state|states]] with separate legislatures, but [[Personal union|with the same monarch]]{{mdash}}were, in the words of the Treaty, &quot;United into One Kingdom by the Name of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Article I of the Treaty of Union&lt;/ref&gt;

The two countries had shared a monarch since the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, when [[King James VI of Scotland]] inherited the English throne from his [[double first cousin]] twice removed, [[Queen Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. Although described as a Union of Crowns, until 1707 there were in fact two separate Crowns resting on the same head (as opposed to the implied creation of a single Crown and a single Kingdom, exemplified by the later [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]). Prior to the Acts of Union there had been three previous attempts (in 1606, 1667, and 1689) to unite the two countries by Acts of Parliament, but it was not until the early 18th century that both political establishments came to support the idea, albeit for different reasons.

The Acts took effect on 1 May 1707. On this date, the Scottish Parliament and the English Parliament united to form the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], based in the [[Palace of Westminster]] in London, the home of the English Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Act of Union 1707|Act of Union 1707]], Article 3&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the Acts are referred to as the '''Union of the Parliaments'''. On the Union, the historian [[Simon Schama]] said &quot;What began as a hostile merger, would end in a full partnership in the most powerful going concern in the world ... it was one of the most astonishing transformations in European history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Britannia Incorporated|series= A History of Britain |serieslink= Simon Schama's A History of Britain |credits= [[Simon Schama]] (presenter) |network= [[BBC One]] |airdate= 22 May 2001 |number=10 |minutes=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==
[[File:Union flag 1606 (Kings Colors).svg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|The first [[Union flag]], created by James VI and I. A separate version was used in Scotland during the 17th century.]]

=== Pre-1707 attempts at Union ===
Despite attempts by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] to conquer [[Scotland]] in the late 13th and early 14th centuries, the two countries were entirely separate. However, when [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] became Queen of England in 1558, a union became increasingly likely as she neither married nor had children. From 1558 onwards, her heir was her Catholic cousin [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], who pledged herself to a peaceful union between the two kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abdn.ac.uk/historic/actsofunion/panel2.php ABDN.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1567, Mary was forced to abdicate as Queen of Scots and replaced by her infant son [[James VI and I|James VI]], who was brought up as a Protestant and became heir to the English throne. After Elizabeth died in 1603, the two Crowns were held in personal union by James, now also James I of England, and his Stuart successors, but England and Scotland remained separate kingdoms.

==== 1603–1639 ====
When James became King of England in 1603, the creation of a unified Church of Scotland and England governed by bishops was the first step in his vision of a centralised, Unionist state.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephen|first1=Jeffrey|title=Scottish Nationalism and Stuart Unionism|journal=Journal of British Studies|date=January 2010|volume=49|issue=1, Scottish Special|pages=55–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his accession, he announced his intention to unite the two realms so he would not be &quot;guilty of bigamy;&quot; he used the [[royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|royal prerogative]] to take the title &quot;King of Great Britain&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Larkin |editor-first=James F.|editor2-last=Hughes |editor2-first=Paul L.|title=Stuart Royal Proclamations: Volume I |location= |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1973 |page=19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and give a British character to his court and person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=R. |last=Lockyer |title=James VI and I |location=London |publisher=Addison Wesley Longman |year=1998 |pages=51–52 |isbn=978-0-582-27962-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Signing of the National Covenant in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|left|Scottish opposition to Stuart attempts to impose religious union led to the 1638 National Covenant]]
The 1603 [[Union of England and Scotland Act 1603|Union of England and Scotland Act]] established a joint Commission to agree terms but the [[English Parliament]] was concerned this would lead to the imposition of an [[absolute monarchy|absolutist]] structure similar to that of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Lockyer, ''op. cit.'', pp. 54–59&lt;/ref&gt; James dropped his policy of a speedy union, the topic disappeared from the legislative agenda while attempts to revive it in 1610 were met with hostility.&lt;ref&gt;Lockyer, ''op. cit.'', p.59&lt;/ref&gt;

This did not mean James abandoned the idea; 17th-century religion and politics were closely linked and he viewed a unified Church of Scotland and England as the first step towards a centralised, Unionist state.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; The problem was that the two churches were very different in both structure and doctrine; Scottish bishops presided over Presbyterian structures but were doctrinal [[Calvinists]] who viewed many [[Church of England]] practices as little better than Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McDonald|first1=Alan|title=The Jacobean Kirk, 1567–1625: Sovereignty, Polity and Liturgy|date=1998|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1859283738|pages=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religious policies followed by James and his son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] were intended as precursors to political union; resistance to this concept led to the 1638 [[Covenanter|National Covenant]] in Scotland and the 1639-1651 [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]].

==== 1639–1670 ====
{{Main|Scotland under the Commonwealth}}
[[File:The Solemn League And Covenant.jpg|thumb|left|The 1643 [[Solemn League and Covenant]] between England and Scotland]]
The 1639–1640 [[Bishops' Wars]] confirmed the primacy of the Presbyterian [[Church of Scotland]] or kirk and established a [[Covenanter]] government in Scotland. The Scots remained neutral when the [[First English Civil War]] began in 1642, but grew concerned as to the impact of Royalist victory on Scotland after Parliamentary defeats in the first year of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaplan |first1=Lawrence |title=Steps to War: The Scots and Parliament, 1642-1643 |journal=Journal of British Studies |date=May 1970 |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=50–70 |jstor=175155 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious union with England was also seen as the best way to preserve a Presbyterian kirk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robertson|first1=Barry|title=Royalists at War in Scotland and Ireland, 1638–1650|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317061069 |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 1643 [[Solemn League and Covenant]] provided Scottish military support for the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] in return for a religious union between the [[Church of England]] and the kirk. While it referred repeatedly to 'union' between England, Scotland, and Ireland, it did not explicitly commit to political union which had little support even among their English supporters.
[[File:Cromwell at Dunbar Andrew Carrick Gow.jpg|thumb|right|[[Battle of Dunbar (1650)]]; Scotland was incorporated into the Commonwealth after defeat in the Anglo-Scots War.]]
Even religious union was fiercely opposed by the Episcopalian majority in the Church of England and [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] like [[Oliver Cromwell]]. The Scots and English Presbyterians came to see the Independents who dominated the [[New Model Army]] as a bigger threat than the Royalists and when [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] surrendered in 1646, they agreed to restore him to the English throne. Both Royalists and Covenanters agreed the '''institution''' of monarchy was divinely ordered but disagreed on the nature and extent of Royal authority versus that of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Tim|title=Rebellion: Britain's First Stuart Kings, 1567-1642|date=2015|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0198743118|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag of The Commonwealth.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]-era flag depicting the union between England and Scotland]]
After defeat in the 1647–1648 [[Second English Civil War]], Scotland was occupied by English troops which were withdrawn once the so-called [[Engagers]] whom Cromwell held responsible for the war had been replaced by the Kirk Party. In December 1648, [[Pride's Purge]] confirmed Cromwell's political control in England by removing Presbyterian MPs from Parliament and executing Charles in January 1649. Despite this, in February, the Kirk Party proclaimed [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] King of Scotland and Great Britain; and agreed to restore him to the English throne.

Defeat in the 1649–1651 [[Third English Civil War|Third English Civil War or Anglo-Scottish War]] resulted in Scotland's incorporation into the [[Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland]], largely driven by Cromwell's determination to break the power of the kirk, which he held responsible for the Anglo-Scottish War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morrill|first1=John|title=Oliver Cromwell and the English Revolution|date=1990|publisher=Longman|isbn=978-0582016750|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1652 [[Tender of Union]] was followed on 12 April 1654 by ''An Ordinance by the Protector for the Union of England and Scotland,'' creating the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/eng/conpur098.htm Constitution.org]&lt;/ref&gt; It was ratified by the [[Second Protectorate Parliament]] on 26 June 1657, creating a single Parliament in Westminster, with 30 representatives each from Scotland and Ireland added to the existing English members.&lt;ref&gt;The 1657 Act's long title was ''An Act and Declaration touching several Acts and Ordinances made since 20 April 1653, and before 3 September 1654, and other Acts''&lt;/ref&gt;

While it established free trade within the Commonwealth, the economic benefits were diminished by the heavy taxation needed to fund the army.&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/tk_02_cromwell.html Parliament.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012160340/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/tk_02_cromwell.html |date=12 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland, Union was associated with military occupation, in England with heavy taxes and had little popular support in either country. It was dissolved by the 1660 [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of Charles II despite a petition by Scottish members of the Commonwealth [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] for its continuance.

The Scottish economy was badly damaged by the English [[Navigation Acts]] of 1660 and 1663 and wars with the Dutch Republic, its major export market. An Anglo-Scots Trade Commission was set up in January 1668 but the English had no interest in making concessions, as the Scots had little to offer in return. In 1669, Charles II revived talks on political union; his motives were to weaken Scotland's commercial and political links with the Dutch, still seen as an enemy and complete the work of his grandfather James I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacIntosh |first1=Gillian |title=Scottish Parliament under Charles II, 1660-1685 |date=2007 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0748624577 |pages=79–87 passim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continued opposition in both England and Scotland meant that by the end of 1669, negotiations between Commissioners ground to a halt.&lt;ref&gt;C. Whatley, ''op. cit.'', p.95&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1670–1707 ====
Following the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, a [[Convention of the Estates of Scotland|Scottish Convention]] met in Edinburgh in April 1689 to agree a new constitutional settlement; during which the Scottish Bishops backed a proposed union in an attempt to preserve Episcopalian control of the kirk. [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] were supportive of the idea but it was opposed both by the Presbyterian majority in Scotland and the English Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lynch|first1=Michael|title=Scotland: a New History|date=1992|publisher=Pimlico Publishing|isbn=978-0712698931|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Episcopacy in Scotland was abolished in 1690, alienating a significant part of the political class; it was this element that later formed the bedrock of opposition to Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Tim|title=Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy, 1685-1720|date=2007|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0141016528|pages=404–406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1690s were a time of economic hardship in Europe as a whole and Scotland in particular, a period now known as the [[Seven ill years]] which led to strained relations with England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=C. |last=Whatley |title=The Scots and the Union |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |year=2006 |page=91 |isbn=978-0-7486-1685-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1698, the [[Company of Scotland|Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies]] received a charter to raise capital through public subscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitchison|first1=Rosalind|title=A History of Scotland|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415278805|pages=301–2|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Company invested in the [[Darién scheme]], an ambitious plan funded almost entirely by Scottish investors to build a colony on the [[Isthmus of Panama]] for trade with East Asia.&lt;ref name=Richards2004p79&gt;E. Richards, ''Britannia's Children: Emigration from England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland since 1600'' (Continuum, 2004), {{ISBN|1852854413}}, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was a disaster; the losses of over £150,000 severely impacted the Scottish commercial system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitchison|first1=Rosalind|title=A History of Scotland|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415278805|page=314|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The financial losses incurred have often been suggested as one of the drivers behind Union.

=== Treaty and passage of the Acts of 1707 ===
[[File:Articles of Union 1707.jpg|thumb|left|&quot;Articles of Union otherwise known as Treaty of Union&quot;, 1707]]
Deeper political integration had been a key policy of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] from the time she acceded to the throne in 1702. Under the aegis of the Queen and her ministers in both kingdoms, the parliaments of England and Scotland agreed to participate in fresh negotiations for a union treaty in 1705.

Both countries appointed 31 commissioners to conduct the negotiations. Most of the Scottish commissioners favoured union, and about half were government ministers and other officials. At the head of the list was Queensberry, and the [[Lord Chancellor of Scotland]], the [[Earl of Seafield]].&lt;ref name=&quot;commissioners&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/04_01_commissioners.html | title = The commissioners | publisher = UK Parliament website | year = 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090619224021/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/04_01_commissioners.html | archivedate = 19 June 2009 | accessdate = 5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English commissioners included the [[Lord High Treasurer]], the [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Earl of Godolphin]], the [[Lord Keeper of the Great Seal|Lord Keeper]], [[William Cowper, 1st Earl Cowper|Baron Cowper]], and a large number of Whigs who supported union. Tories were not in favour of union and only one was represented among the commissioners.&lt;ref name=&quot;commissioners&quot;/&gt;

Negotiations between the English and Scottish commissioners took place between 16 April and 22 July 1706 at the [[Cockpit-in-Court|Cockpit]] in London. Each side had its own particular concerns. Within a few days, England gained a guarantee that the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] dynasty would succeed Queen Anne to the Scottish crown, and Scotland received a guarantee of access to colonial markets, in the hope that they would be placed on an equal footing in terms of trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;negotiations&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/04_02_course.html | title = The course of negotiations | publisher = UK Parliament website | year = 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090721014514/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/04_02_course.html | archivedate = 21 July 2009 | accessdate = 5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After negotiations ended in July 1706, the acts had to be ratified by both Parliaments. In Scotland, about 100 of the 227 members of the [[Parliament of Scotland]] were supportive of the [[Court Party]]. For extra votes the pro-court side could rely on about 25 members of the [[Squadrone Volante (Scotland)|Squadrone Volante]], led by the [[James Graham, 1st Duke of Montrose|Marquess of Montrose]] and the [[Duke of Roxburghe]]. Opponents of the court were generally known as the [[Country Party (Britain)|Country party]], and included various factions and individuals such as the [[Duke of Hamilton]], [[Lord Belhaven]] and [[Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun]], who spoke forcefully and passionately against the union. The Court party enjoyed significant funding from England and the Treasury and included many who had accumulated debts following the [[Darien Disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/05_ratification.html | title = Ratification | publisher = UK parliament website | year = 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090619224031/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/05_ratification.html | archivedate = 19 June 2009 | accessdate = 5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland, the [[James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry|Duke of Queensberry]] was largely responsible for the successful passage of the Union act by the [[Scottish Parliament]]. In Scotland, he received much criticism from local residents, but in England he was cheered for his action. He had received around half of the funding awarded by the Westminster treasury for himself. In April 1707, he travelled to London to attend celebrations at the royal court, and was greeted by groups of noblemen and gentry lined along the road. From [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]], the route was lined with crowds of cheering people, and once he reached London a huge crowd had formed. On 17 April, the Duke was gratefully received by the Queen at [[Kensington Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/08_union.html | title = 1 May 1707 – the Union comes into effect | publisher = UK Parliament website | year = 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090619224036/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/08_union.html | archivedate = 19 June 2009 | accessdate = 5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political motivations ==
[[File:QueenAnne1702.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Queen Anne in 1702, the year she became queen, from the school of [[John Closterman]]]]

The Acts of Union should be seen within a wider European context of increasing state centralisation during the late 17th and early 18th centuries. This included the monarchies of France, Sweden, Denmark and Spain. While there were exceptions such as the [[Dutch Republic]] or the [[Republic of Venice]], the trend was clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Munck |first1=Thomas |title=Seventeenth-Century Europe: State, Conflict and Social Order in Europe 1598-1700 |date=2005 |publisher=Palgrave |isbn=978-1403936196 |pages=429–431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this can be disputed by pointing out the simple fact that an essential part of the Act of Union was restatement of the Act of Settlement 1701 and the ban on Roman Catholics from taking the throne. It is impossible to ignore or dismiss the importance of sectarianism.

The dangers of the monarch using one Parliament against the other became apparent in the wars of 1647 and 1651 and resurfaced during the [[Exclusion Crisis]]. English resistance to the Catholic [[James II of England|James]] succeeding his brother Charles resulted in his being sent to Edinburgh in 1681 as [[Lord High Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland|Lord High Commissioner]]. In August, the Scottish Parliament passed the Succession Act, confirming the divine right of kings, the rights of the natural heir 'regardless of religion,' the duty of all to swear allegiance to that king and the independence of the Scottish Crown. It then went beyond ensuring James's succession to the Scottish throne by explicitly stating the aim was to make his exclusion from the English throne impossible without '...the fatall and dreadfull consequences of a civil war.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jackson |first1=Clare |title=Restoration Scotland, 1660-1690: Royalist Politics, Religion and Ideas |date=2003 |publisher=Boydell Press |isbn=978-0851159300 |pages=38–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue reappeared during the 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]]. Contrary to what is often assumed, the English Parliament generally supported the replacement of James with his Protestant daughter [[Mary II]] but strongly resisted making her Dutch husband [[William III &amp; II]] joint ruler. They only gave way when he threatened to return to the Netherlands and Mary refused to rule without him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Horwitz |first1=Henry |title=Parliament, Policy and Politics in the Reign of William III. |date=1986 |publisher=MUP |isbn=978-0719006616 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/parliamentpolicy0000horw_o2j8/page/10 10–11] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/parliamentpolicy0000horw_o2j8/page/10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland, conflict over control of the kirk between Presbyterians and Episcopalians and William's position as a fellow Calvinist put him in a much stronger position. Originally, William insisted on retaining Episcopacy in the kirk and the Committee of the Articles, an unelected body that controlled what legislation Parliament could debate. Both of these would have given the Crown far greater control than in England but he withdrew his demands due to the 1689-1692 Jacobite Rising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lynch|first1=Michael|title=Scotland, A New History|date=1992|publisher=Vintage|isbn=978-0712698931|pages=300–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== English perspective ===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}
The English purpose was to ensure that Scotland would not choose a monarch different from the one on the English throne. The two countries had shared a king for much of the previous century, but the English were concerned that an independent Scotland with a different king, even if he were a Protestant, might make alliances against England. The English succession was provided for by the English [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which ensured that the monarch of England would be a Protestant member of the [[House of Hanover]]. Until the Union of Parliaments, the Scottish throne might be inherited by a different successor after [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]: the Scottish [[Act of Security 1704]] granted parliament the right to choose a successor and explicitly required a choice different from the English monarch unless the English were to grant free trade and navigation. Many people in England were unhappy about the prospect, however. [[English overseas possessions]] made England wealthy in comparison to Scotland and had many times the number of Members of Parliament than Scotland, thus able to pass any legislation over Scottish objections. This made unification a markedly unequal relationship, much to England's advantage.

=== Scottish perspective ===

In Scotland, some claimed that union would enable Scotland to recover from the financial disaster wrought by the [[Darien scheme]] through English assistance and the lifting of measures put in place through the [[Alien Act 1705|Alien Act]] to force the Scottish Parliament into compliance with the Act of Settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=C. A. |last=Whatley |title=Bought and sold for English Gold? Explaining the Union of 1707 |location=East Linton |publisher=Tuckwell Press |year=2001 |page=48 |isbn=978-1-86232-140-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combined votes of the Court party with a majority of the [[Squadrone Volante (Scotland)|Squadrone Volante]] were sufficient to ensure the final passage of the treaty through the House.

Personal financial interests were also allegedly involved. Many Commissioners had invested heavily in the Darien scheme and they believed that they would receive compensation for their losses; Article 15 granted [[Pound sterling|£]]398,085 10[[Shilling|s]] sterling to Scotland, a sum known as [[The Equivalent]], to offset future liability towards the English national debt. In essence it was also used as a means of compensation for investors in the Company of Scotland's Darien scheme, as 58.6% was allocated to its shareholders and creditors.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, Douglas.

Even more direct bribery was a factor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/09_bribery.html Parliament.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925233310/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/09_bribery.html |date=25 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; £20,000 (£240,000 [[Pound Scots|Scots]]) was dispatched to Scotland for distribution by the [[Earl of Glasgow]]. [[James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry]], the [[Queen's Commissioner in Parliament]], received £12,325, more than 60% of the funding. [[Robert Burns]] referred to this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;We're bought and sold for English Gold,
Such a Parcel of Rogues in a Nation.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of the money was used to hire spies, such as [[Daniel Defoe]]; his first reports were of vivid descriptions of violent demonstrations against the Union. &quot;A Scots rabble is the worst of its kind,&quot; he reported, &quot;for every Scot in favour there is 99 against&quot;. Years later, [[Sir John Clerk, 2nd Baronet|Sir John Clerk of Penicuik]], originally a leading [[Unionism (Scotland)|Unionist]], wrote in his memoirs that Defoe &quot;was a spy among us, but not known as such, otherwise the Mob of Edinburgh would pull him to pieces.&quot;

The Treaty was hated in Scotland at the time. Riots occurred in Edinburgh, as well as substantial riots in Glasgow. The people of Edinburgh demonstrated against the treaty, and their apparent leader in opposition to the Unionists was [[James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton]]. However, Hamilton was actually on the side of the English Government. Demonstrators in Edinburgh were opposed to the Union for many reasons: they feared the Kirk would be Anglicised; that Anglicisation would remove democracy from the only really elementally democratic part of the Kingdom; and they feared that tax rises would come.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A People's History of Scotland|last=Bambery|first=Chris|publisher=Verso|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Lockhart (politician)|Sir George Lockhart of Carnwath]], the only member of the Scottish negotiating team against union, noted that &quot;The whole nation appears against the Union&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/devolution/scotland/briefing/1707.shtml |title=Scottish Referendums |publisher=BBC |accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, an ardent pro-unionist and Union negotiator, observed that the treaty was &quot;contrary to the inclinations of at least three-fourths of the Kingdom&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; Public opinion against the Treaty as it passed through the Scottish Parliament was voiced through petitions from shires, burghs, presbyteries and parishes. The [[Convention of Royal Burghs]] also petitioned against the Union as proposed:{{quote|That it is our indispensable duty to signify to your grace that, as we are not against an honourable and safe union with England far less can we expect to have the condition of the people of Scotland, with relation to these great concerns, made better and improved without a Scots Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;The Humble Address of the Commissioners to the General Convention of the Royal Burrows of this Ancient Kingdom Convened the Twenty-Ninth of October 1706, at Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Not one petition in favour of an incorporating union was received by Parliament. On the day the treaty was signed, the [[carillon]]er in [[St Giles Cathedral]], Edinburgh, rang the bells in the tune ''Why should I be so sad on my wedding day?''&lt;ref&gt;Notes by [[John Purser]] to CD ''Scotland's Music'', [http://www.electricscotland.com/familytree/magazine/augsep2003/edinburgh.htm Facts about Edinburgh].&lt;/ref&gt; Threats of widespread civil unrest resulted in Parliament imposing [[martial law]].

{{Main|Treaty of Union}}
The [[Treaty of Union]], agreed between representatives of the [[Parliament of England]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]] in 1706, consisted of 25 articles, 15 of which were economic in nature. In Scotland, each article was voted on separately and several clauses in articles were delegated to specialised subcommittees. Article 1 of the treaty was based on the political principle of an incorporating union and this was secured by a majority of 116 votes to 83 on 4 November 1706. To minimise the opposition of the [[Church of Scotland]], an Act was also passed to secure the [[Presbyterian]] establishment of the Church, after which the Church stopped its open opposition, although hostility remained at lower levels of the clergy. The treaty as a whole was finally ratified on 16 January 1707 by a majority of 110 votes to 69.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riley&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |first=P. J. W. |last=Riley |title=The Union of 1707 as an Episode in English Politics |journal=The English Historical Review |volume=84 |issue=332 |year=1969 |pages=498–527 [pp. 523–524] |doi= 10.1093/ehr/lxxxiv.cccxxxii.498|jstor=562482 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two Acts incorporated provisions for Scotland to send [[Scottish representative peers|representative peers]] from the [[Peerage of Scotland]] to sit in the [[House of Lords]]. It guaranteed that the [[Church of Scotland]] would remain the [[established church]] in Scotland, that the [[Court of Session]] would &quot;remain in all time coming within Scotland&quot;, and that [[Scots law]] would &quot;remain in the same force as before&quot;. Other provisions included the restatement of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] and the ban on [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] from taking the throne. It also created a [[customs union]] and [[monetary union]].

The Act provided that any &quot;laws and statutes&quot; that were &quot;contrary to or inconsistent with the terms&quot; of the Act would &quot;cease and become void&quot;.

===Related Acts===

The Scottish Parliament also passed the [[Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act 1707]] guaranteeing the status of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. The English Parliament passed a similar Act, 6 Anne c.8.

Soon after the Union, the Act 6 Anne c.40{{mdash}}later named the [[Union with Scotland (Amendment) Act 1707]]{{mdash}}united the English and Scottish [[Privy Council]]s and decentralised Scottish administration by appointing justices of the peace in each shire to carry out administration. In effect it took the day-to-day government of Scotland out of the hands of politicians and into those of the [[College of Justice]].

In the year following the Union, the [[Treason Act 1708]] abolished the Scottish law of [[High treason in the United Kingdom#History: after union with Scotland|treason]] and extended the corresponding English law across Great Britain.

== Evaluations ==
Scotland benefited, says historian G.N. Clark, gaining &quot;freedom of trade with England and the colonies&quot; as well as &quot;a great expansion of markets&quot;. The agreement guaranteed the permanent status of the Presbyterian church in Scotland, and the separate system of laws and courts in Scotland.  Clark argued that in exchange for the financial benefits and bribes that England bestowed, what it gained was

&lt;blockquote&gt;of inestimable value. Scotland accepted the Hanoverian succession and gave up her power of threatening England's military security and complicating her commercial relations ... The sweeping successes of the eighteenth-century wars owed much to the new unity of the two nations.&lt;ref&gt;G.N. Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660–1714'' (2nd ed. 1956) pp 290–93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the time [[Samuel Johnson]] and [[James Boswell]] made their tour in 1773, recorded in ''[[A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland]]'', Johnson noted that Scotland was &quot;a nation of which the commerce is hourly extending, and the wealth increasing&quot; and in particular that [[Glasgow]] had become one of the greatest cities of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon Brown|title=My Scotland, Our Britain: A Future Worth Sharing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dRz1AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA150|year=2014|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster UK|page=150|isbn=9781471137518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A commemorative [[two-pound coin]] was issued to mark the tercentennial—300th anniversary—of the Union, which occurred two days before the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|Scottish Parliament general election]] on 3 May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2006-11-06a.79.0 House of Lords – Written answers], 6 November 2006, TheyWorkForYou.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish Government]] held a number of commemorative events through the year including an education project led by the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland]], an exhibition of Union-related objects and documents at the [[National Museums of Scotland]] and an exhibition of portraits of people associated with the Union at the [[National Galleries of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;Announced by the Scottish Culture Minister, Patricia Ferguson, 9 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
