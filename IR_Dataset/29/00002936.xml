'''Southeast Alaska''', colloquially referred to as the '''Alaska Panhandle''' or '''Alaskan Panhandle''', is the southeastern portion of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alaska]], bordered to the east by the northern half of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[British Columbia]]. The majority of Southeast Alaska's area is part of the [[Tongass National Forest]], the United States' largest [[United States National Forest|national forest]]. In many places, the [[international border]] runs along the crest of the [[Boundary Ranges]] of the [[Coast Mountains]] (see [[Alaska boundary dispute]]). The region is noted for its scenery and mild, rainy [[climate]].

The largest cities in the region are [[Juneau]], [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], and [[Ketchikan]]. This region is also home to the easternmost town in Alaska, [[Hyder, Alaska|Hyder]].

==Geography==
Southeast Alaska has a land area of {{convert|35138|sqmi|sqkm}}{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}, comprising much of the [[Alexander Archipelago]]. The largest islands are, from North to South, [[Chichagof Island]], [[Admiralty Island]], [[Baranof Island]], [[Kupreanof Island]], [[Revillagigedo Island]] and [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]]. Major bodies of water of Southeast Alaska include [[Glacier Bay]], [[Lynn Canal]], [[Icy Strait]], [[Chatham Strait]], [[Stephens Passage]], [[Frederick Sound]], [[Sumner Strait]], and [[Clarence Strait]]. 

The archipelago is the northern terminus of the [[Inside Passage]], a protected waterway of convoluted passages between islands and fjords, beginning in [[Puget Sound]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state. This was an important travel corridor for [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], [[Haida people|Haida]], and [[Tsimshian]] Native peoples, as well as gold-rush era steamships. In modern times it is an important route for [[Alaska Marine Highway]] ferries as well as [[cruise ship]]s.

==Demographics==
[[File:Downtown Juneau and Douglas Island.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Juneau, Alaska|The City and Borough of Juneau]], the most populous borough in Southeast Alaska.]]
[[File:Downtown Ketchikan - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Ketchikan Gateway Borough, Alaska|Ketchikan Gateway Borough]], the second most populous borough in Southeast Alaska.]]
Southeast Alaska is composed of seven entire [[county-equivalent|borough]]s and two [[census area]]s, in addition to the portion of the [[Yakutat City and Borough, Alaska|Yakutat Borough]] lying east of [[141st meridian west|141° West]] longitude. Although it has only 6.14 percent of Alaska's land area, it is larger than the state of [[Maine]], and almost as large as the state of [[Indiana]]. The Southeast Alaskan coast is roughly as long as the [[British Columbia Coast|west coast]] of Canada.

The [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] population of Southeast Alaska was 71,616 inhabitants, about 45 percent of whom were concentrated in the city of [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]]. As of 2018, the number of settlements in Southeast Alaska that have a population of at least 1,000 people has grown to nine.

==National parks and monuments==
[[Image:TongassForest1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Tongass National Forest]], near [[Ketchikan]]]]
Southeast Alaska includes the [[Tongass National Forest]] (which manages [[Admiralty Island National Monument]] and [[Misty Fjords National Monument]]), [[Glacier Bay National Park]], [[Sitka National Historical Park]], [[Alaska's Inside Passage]], and myriad large and small islands. It is the largest [[national park]] in the [[United States]]. On August 20, 1902, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] established the [[Alexander Archipelago Forest Reserve]], which formed the heart of the [[Tongass National Forest]] that covers most of the region.

==Climate==
[[File:Southeast Alaska Köppen.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] in southeast Alaska]]
The climate of Southeast Alaska is dominated by a mid-latitude [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb'') in the south, an oceanic, marine sub-polar climate ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfc'') in the central region around [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]], and a [[subarctic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfc'') to the far northwest and the interior highlands of the archipelago. Southeast Alaska is also the only region in Alaska where the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months.

==Ecology==
Southeast Alaska is a [[temperate rain forest]] within the [[Pacific temperate rain forest]] zone, as classified by the [[World Wildlife Fund]]'s [[ecoregion]] system, which extends from northern [[California]] to [[Prince William Sound]]. The most common tree species are [[sitka spruce]] and [[western hemlock]].

Wildlife includes [[brown bear]]s, [[American black bear|black bear]]s, endemic [[Alexander Archipelago wolf]] packs, [[black-tailed deer|Sitka black-tailed deer]], [[humpback whale]]s, [[orca]]s, five species of [[salmon]], [[bald eagle]]s, [[harlequin duck]]s, [[scoter]]s, and [[marbled murrelet]]s.

The [https://indd.adobe.com/view/bb243dff-5852-44c5-bdf5-4b1be96bdc53 Ecological Atlas of Southeast Alaska], published by Audubon Alaska in 2016, offers an overview of the region's landscape, birds, wildlife, human uses, climate change, and more, synthesizing data from agencies and a variety of other sources.

==Culture==
[[File:Raventotemsitka.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Totem pole at [[Sitka National Historical Park]]]]
This area is the traditional homeland of the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], and home of a historic settling of [[Haida people|Haida]] as well as a modern settlement of [[Tsimshian]]. The region is closely connected to [[Seattle]] and the American [[Pacific Northwest]] economically and culturally.

==Industry==
Major industries in Southeast Alaska include [[commercial fishing]] and [[tourism]] (primarily the cruise ship industry). 

=== Logging ===
[[Logging]] has been an important industry in the past, but has been steadily declining with competition from other areas and the closure of the region's major pulp mills; the Alaska Forest Association described the situation as &quot;desperate&quot; in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alaskajournal.com/business-and-finance/2011-11-03/ak-forest-association-se-timber-situation-desperate|title=AK Forest Association: SE timber situation 'desperate'|website=The Alaska Journal of Commerce|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-22|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419053843/http://www.alaskajournal.com/business-and-finance/2011-11-03/ak-forest-association-se-timber-situation-desperate|archivedate=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its members include Alcan Forest Products (owned by Canadian Transpac Group, one of the top 5 log exporters in North America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://grouptranspac.com/about/history/|title=Our History - Trans-Pacific Energy Group|website=Trans-Pacific Energy Group|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-22|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317070844/http://grouptranspac.com/about/history/|archivedate=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Viking Lumber, which is based in [[Craig, Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timberassociation.com/listing/viking-lumber-company-inc/|title=Viking Lumber Company, Inc.|website=TPM|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debates over whether to expand logging in the federally owned Tongass are not uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sitnews.us/0311News/030311/030311_forests.html|title=SitNews: Murkowski Questions Forest Service Spending, Timber Sales;|last=SitNews|website=www.sitnews.us|access-date=2016-03-22|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106151315/http://www.sitnews.us/0311News/030311/030311_forests.html|archivedate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/us/a-battle-to-keep-trees-or-an-industry-standing.html?_r=0|title=In Alaska, a Battle to Keep Trees, or an Industry, Standing - NYTimes.com|website=mobile.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-03-22|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106151100/http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/us/a-battle-to-keep-trees-or-an-industry-standing.html?_r=0|archivedate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mining ===
Mining remains important in the northern area with the [[Juneau mining district]] and [[Admiralty mining district]] hosting active mines as of 2015. Gold was discovered in 1880 and played an important part in the early history of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationByGeography/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/alaska/seak/era/cfm/Documents/9.6_TimberIndustry.pdf|title=The Southeastern Alaska Timber Industry: Historical Overview and Current Status|last=Sisk|first=John|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106151630/http://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationByGeography/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/alaska/seak/era/cfm/Documents/9.6_TimberIndustry.pdf|archivedate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010s, mines increasingly begun to be explored and eventually completed in neighboring [[British Columbia]], upstream of important rivers such as the [[Unuk River|Unuk]] and the [[Stikine River|Stikine]], which became known as the transboundary mining issue. In 2014, the [[Mount Polley mine disaster|Mount Polley Mine disaster]] focused attention on the issue, and an agreement between Canada and Alaska was drafted in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alaskapublic.org/2015/11/18/alaska-drafts-transboundary-agreement-with-b-c/|title=Alaska drafts transboundary mine agreement with BC|last=Schoenfeld|first=Ed|last2=Juneau|first2=CoastAlaska-|website=Alaska Public Media|access-date=2016-03-22|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119143417/http://www.alaskapublic.org/2015/11/18/alaska-drafts-transboundary-agreement-with-b-c/|archivedate=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed [[Kerr Sulphurets Mitchell]] exploration is upstream of the Unuk. Mines upstream of the Stikine include the Red Chris, which is owned by the same company (Imperial Metals) as the Mount Polley mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/red-chris-mine-gets-green-light-from-b-c-government-1.3121297|title=B.C. government approves permits for controversial Red Chris Mine|website=www.cbc.ca|access-date=2016-03-22|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222192608/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/red-chris-mine-gets-green-light-from-b-c-government-1.3121297|archivedate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The border between Alaska and the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]] was the subject of the [[Alaska boundary dispute]], where the United States and the [[United Kingdom]] claimed different borderlines at the Alaskan panhandle. While the British foreign affairs were in favor of support of the Canadian argument, the event resulted in what was thought of as a betrayal, leading to alienation of the British from the new nation of [[Canada]].

==Transportation==
[[Image:Alaska Panhandle.png|thumb|250px|Southeast Alaska and [[Alaska Marine Highway]] ferry routes]]
Due to the extremely rugged, mountainous nature of Southeastern Alaska, almost all communities (with the exception of [[Hyder, Alaska|Hyder]], [[Skagway]], and [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]]) have no road connections outside of their locale, so aircraft and boats are the major means of transport. The [[Alaska Marine Highway]] passes through this region.

===Air transportation===
[[Alaska Airlines]] is by far the largest air carrier in the region, with Juneau's [[Juneau International Airport]] serving as the aerial hub for all of Southeast and Ketchikan's [[Ketchikan International Airport]] serving as a secondary hub for southern Southeast Alaska. Alaska's [[Bush aviation|bush airlines ]] and [[air taxi]]s serve many of the smaller and more isolated communities and villages in the regions. Many communities are accessible by air only by [[floatplane]], as proper runways are often difficult to construct on the steep island slopes.

===Marine transportation===
Southeast Alaska is primarily served by the state-run [[Alaska Marine Highway]], which links Skagway, Haines, [[Hoonah, Alaska|Hoonah]], [[Juneau]], [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], [[Petersburg, Alaska|Petersburg]], [[Wrangell, Alaska|Wrangell]], [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]] and other outlying communities with [[Prince Rupert, BC]] and [[Bellingham, Washington]]; and secondarily by the [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]]-based [[Inter-Island Ferry Authority]], which provides the only scheduled passenger and auto ferry service to the island. A new Authority, the Rainforest Islands Ferry Authority, was created and in 2014 may possibly operate the North End route. The Authority would connect Coffman Cove with Wrangell and Petersburg. Small companies like Sitka-based Allen Marine and other independent operators in the [[Lynn Canal]] occasionally also offer marine passenger service. Ship traffic in the area is seasonally busy with [[cruise ship]]s.
