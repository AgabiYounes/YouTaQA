'''Axayacatl''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|k|s|ə|ˈ|j|ɑː|k|ə|t|əl}}; {{lang-nci|āxāyacatl}} {{IPA-nah|aːʃaːˈjákatɬ||Axayakatl.ogg}}; {{lang-es|Axayácatl}} {{IPA-es|aksaˈʝakatɬ|}}; meaning &quot;face of water&quot;; {{circa|1449}}–1481) was the sixth {{lang|nci|[[tlatoani]]}} of the {{lang|nci|[[altepetl]]}} of [[Tenochtitlan]] and ruler of the [[Aztec Triple Alliance]].

==Biography==

===Early life and background===
Axayacatl was a son of the princess [[Atotoztli II]] and her cousin, prince [[Tezozomoc (son of Itzcoatl)|Tezozomoc]]. He was a grandson of the Emperors [[Moctezuma I]] and [[Itzcoatl]]. He was a descendant of the king [[Cuauhtototzin]].

He was a successor of Moctezuma and his brothers were Emperors [[Tizoc]] and [[Ahuitzotl]] and his sister was the Queen [[Chalchiuhnenetzin]]. He was an uncle of the Emperor [[Cuauhtémoc]] and father of Emperors [[Moctezuma II]] and [[Cuitláhuac]].

===Rise to power===
During his youth, his military prowess gained him the favor influential figures such as [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]] and [[Tlacaelel I]], and thus, upon the death of [[Moctezuma I]] in 1469, he was chosen to ascend to the throne, much to the displeasure of his two older brothers, [[Tizoc]] and [[Ahuitzotl]].

It is also important that the [[Aztec calendar stone|Great Sun Stone]], also known as the Aztec Calendar, was carved under his leadership. In the year 1475 there was a major earthquake that destroyed many homes in Tenochtitlán.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://staging.doaks.org/research/publications/doaks-online-publications/palaces-of-the-ancient-new-world/isbn-0-88402-300-1.pdf#page=16 |title=Palaces of the Ancient New World |last=Evans |first=Susan Toby |last2=Pillsbury |first2=Joanne |publisher=Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection |year=1998 |isbn=0-88402-300-1 |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military actions and death===
Using as a pretext the insulting behavior of a few Tlatelolcan citizens, Axayacatl invaded his neighbor, killed its ruler, [[Moquihuix]], and replaced him with a military governor. The Tlatelolcans lost any voice they had in forming Aztec policy.

Axayacatl largely dedicated his twelve-year reign to consolidating his militaristic repute: he led successful [[Aztec warfare|campaigns]] against the neighboring {{lang|nci|altepetl}} of [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]] in 1473 (see [[Battle of Tlatelolco]]) and the [[Matlatzinca people|Matlatzinca]] of the [[Toluca Valley]] in 1474, but was finally defeated by the [[Purépecha people|Tarascan]]s of [[Michoacán]] in 1476. Despite some subsequent minor triumphs, Axayacatl's defeat at the hands of the Tarascans irreversibly marred his image, as it constituted the only major defeat suffered by the Aztecs up to that moment. In spite of his young age, he fell gravely ill in 1480, passing away a mere year later, in 1481, whereupon he was succeeded by his brother Tizoc.

===Axayacatl the poet===
Axayacatl wrote two poems. The first, ''Ycuic Axayayatzin'' (English: &quot;Song of Axayacatl&quot;) is a defense against his brothers and critics; the second, ''Huehue cuicatl'' (English: &quot;Song of the Ancients&quot;) is a lament written after his defeat in Michoacan.&lt;ref name=&quot;azteca&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Trece Poetas del Mundo Azteca|author=Miguel Leon-Portilla|publisher=Universidad Nacinal Autonoma de Mexico|date=1978|location=Mexico City|edition=2nd, 1972|language=Spanish|trans-title=Thirteen Poets of the Aztec World|pages=133–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* The ''Obsidian and Blood'' series by [[Aliette de Bodard]] are set in the last year of the reign of Axayacatl and the first years of the reign of [[Tizoc]], with their youngest brother [[Ahuitzotl]] appearing as a primary character.
