'''{{lang|de|Arbeit macht frei}}''' ({{IPA-de|ˈaɐ̯baɪt ˈmaxt ˈfʁaɪ||De-Arbeit macht frei.ogg}}) is a German phrase meaning &quot;work sets you free&quot;. The slogan is known for appearing on the entrance of [[Auschwitz]] and other [[Nazi concentration camps]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopedia of the Holocaust]]'', [[Yad Vashem]],  1990, vol. 4, p. 1751.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The expression comes from the title of an 1873 novel by German [[Philology|philologist]] [[Lorenz Diefenbach]], {{lang|de|Arbeit macht frei: Erzählung von Lorenz Diefenbach}}, in which gamblers and fraudsters find the path to virtue through labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/18/auschwitz-arbeit-macht-frei-sign|title=Poland declares state of emergency after 'Arbeit Macht Frei' stolen from Auschwitz|last=Connolly|first=Kate|date=2009-12-18|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4tlbAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=diefenbach+arbeit+macht+frei&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjr9Jni0-TdAhVB7qwKHdGyD3gQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=diefenbach%20arbeit%20macht%20frei&amp;f=false|title=Arbeit macht frei: Erzählung von Lorenz Diefenbach|last=Diefenbach|first=Lorenz|date=1873|publisher=J. Kühtmann's Buchhandlung|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was also used in French ({{lang|fr|le travail rend libre!}})  by [[Auguste Forel]], a Swiss entomologist, neuroanatomist and psychiatrist, in his {{lang|fr|Fourmis de la Suisse}} (''English'': &quot;Ants of Switzerland&quot;) (1920).&lt;ref name=&quot;Fourmis de la Suisse&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/lesfourmisdelasu00fore#page/n7/mode/2up |title=Les fourmis de la Suisse (2nd Ed.) |first=Auguste |last=Forel |authorlink=Auguste Forel|location=La Chaux-de-Fonds |publisher=Imprimarie cooperative |year=1920 |language=French |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, the {{lang|de|Deutsche Schulverein}} of Vienna, an ethnic nationalist &quot;protective&quot; organization of Germans within the Austrian empire, printed membership stamps with the phrase {{lang|de|Arbeit macht frei}}.
According to visitcracow.com: “In the 1930s, they (Nazis) promoted programs against unemployment through this sentence.”

The phrase is also evocative of the medieval German principle of ''[[Stadtluft macht frei]]'' (&quot;urban air makes you free&quot;), according to which [[Serfdom|serfs]] were liberated after being a city resident for [[Year and a day rule|one year and one day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.br.de/nachrichten/bayern/stadtluft-macht-frei-sibler-bedauert-geweckte-assoziationen,RLkOSOe |language=de |title=&quot;Stadtluft macht frei&quot;: Minister bedauert Irritationen |date=26 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slogan {{Lang|de|Arbeit macht frei}} was placed at the entrances to a number of [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]]s. The slogan's use was implemented by [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officer [[Theodor Eicke]] at [[Dachau concentration camp]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOD9ncsixssC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=arbeit+macht+frei+%22eicke%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjc2bjf2uTdAhUITKwKHRNGCUEQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=arbeit%20macht%20frei%20%22eicke%22&amp;f=false|title=Legacies of Dachau: The Uses and Abuses of a Concentration Camp, 1933-2001|last=Marcuse|first=Harold|date=2001-03-22|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521552042|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then copied by [[Rudolf Höss]] at Auschwitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/auschwitz/40-45/beginnings/|title=Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State . Auschwitz 1940-1945 . Surprising Beginnings {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slogan can still be seen at several sites, including over the entrance to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz I]] where the sign was erected by order of commandant [[Rudolf Höss]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Laurence Rees]], ''Auschwitz: a New History''&lt;/ref&gt;The Auschwitz I sign was made by prisoner-labourers including master [[blacksmith]] [[Jan Liwacz]], and features an upside-down ''B'', which has been interpreted as an act of defiance by the prisoners who made it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Auschwitz's sign of death and defiance|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8420681.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=B - the sculpture|url=http://www.auschwitz.info/en/b-the-sculpture.html| website=International Auschwitz Committee| accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of ridiculing the falsity of the slogan was a popular saying used among Auschwitz prisoners: 

'''''Arbeit macht frei''' (Work makes you free)''

'''''durch Krematorium Nummer drei''' (Through Krematorium Number Three)''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://krakowdirect.com/arbeit-macht-frei-facts-auschwitz-gate/|title=Arbeit macht frei - facts about Auschwitz gate|date=2019-07-05|website=Krakow Direct|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 the first political prisoners were being rounded up for an indefinite period without charges. They were held in a number of places in Germany. The slogan was first used over the gate of a &quot;wild camp&quot; in the city of [[Oranienburg concentration camp|Oranienburg]], which was set up in an abandoned brewery in March 1933 (it was later rebuilt in 1936 as [[Sachsenhausen (detention camp)|Sachsenhausen]]).{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} It can also be seen at the Dachau, [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp|Gross-Rosen]], and [[Concentration camp Theresienstadt|Theresienstadt]] camps, as well as at [[Fort Breendonk]] in [[Belgium]]. It has been claimed that the slogan was placed over the entrance gates of the [[Monowitz concentration camp|Monowitz]] camp (also known as Auschwitz III).&lt;ref&gt;Denis Avey with Rob Broomby ''The Man who Broke into Auschwitz'', Hodder and Stoughton, London, 2011 p.236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freddie Knoller with Robert Landaw ''Desperate Journey: Vienna-Paris-Auschwitz'', Metro, London, 2002, {{ISBN|978-184-358028-7}} p.158&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan appeared at the [[Flossenbürg concentration camp|Flossenbürg]] camp on the left gate post at the camp entry. The original gate posts survive in another part of the camp, but the slogan sign no longer exists.&lt;ref&gt;KZ-Gedenkstaette Flossenbuerg&lt;/ref&gt; [[Primo Levi]] describes seeing the words illuminated over a doorway (as distinct from a gate) at Monowitz.&lt;ref&gt;[[Primo Levi|Levi, Primo]], trans. Stuart Woolf, ''[[If This is a Man]]''. Abacus, London, 2004, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938 the [[Austria]]n political [[cabaret]] writer [[Jura Soyfer]] and the [[composer]] [[Herbert Zipper]], while prisoners at [[Dachau Concentration Camp]], wrote the ''[[Dachaulied]]'', or ''The'' ''Dachau'' ''Song''. They had spent weeks marching in and out of the camp's gate to daily [[forced labour]], and considered the motto {{Lang|De|Arbeit macht frei}} over the gate an insult.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The song repeats the phrase cynically as a &quot;lesson&quot; taught by Dachau.

In ''The Kingdom of Auschwitz'', [[Otto Friedrich]] wrote about [[Rudolf Höss]], regarding his decision to display the motto so prominently at the Auschwitz entrance:

{{quote|He seems not to have intended it as a mockery, nor even to have intended it literally, as a false promise that those who worked to exhaustion would eventually be released, but rather as a kind of mystical declaration that self-sacrifice in the form of endless labour does in itself bring a kind of spiritual freedom.&lt;ref name=Friedrich&gt;{{cite book |last= Friedrich |first= Otto |title= The Kingdom of Auschwitz |publisher= [[Harper Perennial]] |date=August 1994 |isbn= 978-0-06-097640-8 |pages= 2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The signs are prominently displayed, and were seen by all prisoners and staff&amp;mdash;all of whom 
knew, suspected, or quickly learned that prisoners confined there would likely only be freed by death. The signs' psychological impact was tremendous.&lt;ref name=Friedrich/&gt;

==Thefts of {{Lang|De|Arbeit Macht Frei}} signs==
The {{Lang|De|Arbeit Macht Frei}} sign over the Auschwitz I gate was stolen in December 2009 and later recovered by authorities in three pieces. Anders Högström, a Swedish neo-Nazi, and two Polish men were jailed as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/former-neo-nazi-jailed-for-auschwitz-sign-theft-2172533.html|title=Former neo-Nazi jailed for Auschwitz sign theft|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original sign is now in storage at the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum]] and a replica was put over the gate in its place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12094855 | work=BBC News | title=Auschwitz sign theft: Swedish man jailed | date=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 November 2014, the sign over the Dachau gate was stolen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29878278 | work=BBC News | title=Dachau infamous Nazi concentration camp gate stolen | date=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found on 28 November 2016 under a tarpaulin at a parking lot in [[Ytre Arna]], a settlement north of [[Bergen]], Norway's second-largest city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/i/XyLgo/stjaalet-arbeit-macht-frei-port-funnet-i-bergen|title=Stjålet «Arbeit macht frei»-port funnet i Bergen|access-date=2018-10-01|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/221193|title='No usable evidence' in investigation into stolen Dachau sign|website=Israel National News|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
