''Abracadabra'' is of unknown origin, and its first occurrence is in the second century works of [[Serenus Sammonicus]], according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;&gt;{{cite|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2009|section=abracadabra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[Folk etymology|folk etymologies]] are associated with the word:&lt;ref name=&quot;graham&quot;&gt;{{cite|url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2016/12/performative-utterances/|title=Magic words: performative utterance in fact and fantasy|author=Elyse Graham|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=December 30, 2016|work=Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; from phrases in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] that mean &quot;I will create as I speak&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kushner|first=Lawrence|title=The Book of Words: Talking Spiritual Life, Living Spiritual Talk|date=1998|publisher=Jewish Lights Publishing|isbn=1580230202|page=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hhtaTSSZmDYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22The+Book+of+Words%22+kushner+abracadabra&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RMHrUvvoJJLksAT7qoHYDg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20Book%20of%20Words%22%20kushner%20abracadabra&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Aramaic]] &quot;I create like the word&quot; (אברא כדברא),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lew|first1=Alan|title=This is Real and You Are Completely Unprepared|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VVRAqM2D_7sC&amp;pg=PT108&amp;lpg=PT108&amp;dq=alan+lew+abracadabra&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=myKdFRdzIg&amp;sig=ueB4E76vUDCxK9kQwASDSwhUI_M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dSQHVY2yIoS5oQSwtIKICw&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=alan%20lew%20abracadabra&amp;f=false|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to folk etymologies that point to similar words in Latin and Greek such as [[abraxas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OEDOnline&quot;&gt;{{cite|url=http://oed.com/view/Entry/539|section=abracadabra|title=Oxford English Dictionary Online|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''OED Online'', &quot;no documentation has been found to support any of the various conjectures.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OEDOnline&quot; /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Abracadabra triangle (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Abracadabra written in a triangular form as represented in ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'']] 
The first known mention of the word was in the second century AD in a book called ''Liber Medicinalis'' (sometimes known as ''De Medicina Praecepta Saluberrima'') by [[Serenus Sammonicus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Vollmer&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Sammonicus|first=Quintus Serenus |authorlink=Serenus Sammonicus|title=Quinti Sereni Samonici De medicina praecepta salvberrima|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y5FOAAAAYAAJ|year=1786|publisher=In bibliopolio I.G. Mülleriano|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[physician]] to the [[Roman emperor]] [[Caracalla]], who in chapter 51 prescribed that [[malaria]] sufferers wear an amulet containing the word written in the form of a triangle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shah |first1=Sonia |title=The Tenacious Buzz of Malaria |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704111704575354911834340450 |accessdate=17 June 2018 |work=Wall Street Journal |date=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/21/A0022100.html Bartleby] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122135703/http://www.bartleby.com/61/21/A0022100.html |date=November 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power of the amulet, he claimed, makes lethal diseases go away. Other Roman emperors, including [[Geta (emperor)|Geta]] and [[Severus Alexander]], were followers of the medical teachings of Serenus Sammonicus and may have used the incantation as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vollmer&quot; /&gt;

It was used as a [[magical formula]] by the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]] of the [[Basilideans|sect of Basilides]] in invoking the aid of beneficent spirits against disease and misfortune.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Abracadabra}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is found on [[Abraxas]] stones, which were worn as amulets. Subsequently, its use spread beyond the Gnostics.

The Puritan minister [[Increase Mather]] dismissed the word as bereft of power. [[Daniel Defoe]] also wrote dismissively about Londoners who posted the word on their doorways to ward off sickness during the [[Great Plague of London]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Defoe. [https://archive.org/stream/journalofplagu00defo#page/38/mode/2up ''A Journal of the Plague Year'']. London, Dent, 1911 (1722)&lt;/ref&gt;

The word is now commonly used as an [[incantation]] in the performance of magic.
