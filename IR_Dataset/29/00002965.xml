==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:What Alcohol Does to Your Body.webm|thumb|upright=1.3|Effects of alcohol on the body]]

The risk of alcohol dependence begins at low levels of drinking and increases directly with both the volume of alcohol consumed and a pattern of [[Binge drinking|drinking larger amounts on an occasion]], to the point of intoxication, which is sometimes called &quot;binge drinking&quot;. Young adults are particularly at risk of engaging in binge drinking.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Long-term misuse===
[[File:Possible long-term effects of ethanol.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Some of the possible [[long-term effects of ethanol]] an individual may develop. Additionally, in pregnant women, alcohol can cause [[fetal alcohol syndrome]].]]
Alcoholism is characterised by an increased [[Alcohol tolerance|tolerance]] to alcohol&amp;nbsp;– which means that an individual can consume more alcohol&amp;nbsp;– and [[physical dependence]] on alcohol, which makes it hard for an individual to control their consumption. The physical dependency caused by alcohol can lead to an affected individual having a very strong urge to drink alcohol. These characteristics play a role in decreasing an alcoholic's ability to stop drinking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman-1996&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoffman |first=PL |last2=Tabakoff |first2=B | title = Alcohol dependence: a commentary on mechanisms | journal = Alcohol and Alcoholism | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 333–40 | date = July 1996 | pmid = 8879279 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.alcalc.a008159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcoholism can have adverse effects on mental health, causing psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide.

=== Warning signs ===
Warning signs of alcoholism include the consumption of increasing amounts of alcohol and frequent intoxication, preoccupation with drinking to the exclusion of other activities, promises to quit drinking and failure to keep those promises, the inability to remember what was said or done while drinking (colloquially known as &quot;blackouts&quot;), personality changes associated with drinking, denial or the making of excuses for drinking, the refusal to admit excessive drinking, dysfunction or other problems at work or school, the loss of interest in personal appearance or hygiene, marital and economic problems, and the complaint of poor health, with loss of appetite, respiratory infections, or increased anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Volume Library|publisher=The Southwestern Company|chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=RE9OwGtvDMACf}}|year=2009|isbn=978-0-87197-208-8|volume=1|location=Nashville, TN |page=29|chapter=Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Short-term effects=====
{{Main|Short-term effects of alcohol consumption}}

Drinking enough to cause a [[blood alcohol concentration]] (BAC) of 0.03–0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible [[euphoria]] (a &quot;happy&quot; feeling), increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a [[Alcohol flush reaction|flushed, red appearance in the face]] and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes [[lethargy]], [[sedation]], balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC of 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g. slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes [[stupor]], unconsciousness, [[anterograde amnesia]], vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit ([[pulmonary aspiration]]) while unconscious) and [[respiratory depression]] (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a [[coma]] (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal [[alcohol poisoning]]. With all alcoholic beverages, [[drinking and driving|drinking while driving]], operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have penalties for drunk driving.

An alcoholic's behavior and mental impairment while drunk can profoundly affect those surrounding him and lead to isolation from family and friends. This isolation can lead to [[relational disorder|marital conflict]] and [[divorce]], or contribute to [[domestic violence]]. Alcoholism can also lead to [[child neglect]], with subsequent lasting damage to the emotional development of the alcoholic's children.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcemh2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Schadé |first1=Johannes Petrus |title=The Complete Encyclopedia of Medicine and Health |year=2006 |publisher=Foreign Media Books |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=j8DuEHxSCU4C|page=132}} |isbn=978-1-60136-001-4 |pages=132–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, children of alcoholic parents can develop a number of emotional problems.

Severe acute withdrawal symptoms such as [[delirium tremens]] and seizures rarely occur after 1-week post cessation of alcohol.

A [[Kindling (sedative-hypnotic withdrawal)|kindling effect]] also occurs in alcoholics whereby each subsequent withdrawal syndrome is more severe than the previous withdrawal episode; this is due to neuroadaptations which occur as a result of periods of abstinence followed by re-exposure to alcohol.

===Gender difference===
Based on combined data from [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration|SAMHSA]]'s 2004–2005 National Surveys on Drug Use &amp; Health, the rate of past-year alcohol dependence or abuse among persons aged 12 or older varied by level of alcohol use: 44.7% of past month heavy drinkers, 18.5% binge drinkers, 3.8% past month non-binge drinkers, and 1.3% of those who did not drink alcohol in the past month met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year. Males had higher rates than females for all measures of drinking in the past month: any alcohol use (57.5% vs. 45%), binge drinking (30.8% vs. 15.1%), and heavy alcohol use (10.5% vs. 3.3%), and males were twice as likely as females to have met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year (10.5% vs. 5.1%).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Gender differences in alcohol use and alcohol dependence or abuse: 2004 or 2005.&quot; The NSDUH Report.

====Alcoholism====
The term ''alcoholism'' is commonly used amongst laypeople, but the word is poorly defined. The WHO calls ''alcoholism'' &quot;a term of long-standing use and variable meaning&quot;, and use of the term was disfavored by a 1979 WHO expert committee. ''[[The Big Book (Alcoholics Anonymous)|The Big Book]]'' (from [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]) states that once a person is an alcoholic, they are always an alcoholic (but others note that many do recover), but does not define what is meant by the term ''alcoholic'' in this context. In 1960, [[Bill W.]], co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), said:
:We have never called alcoholism a [[disease]] because, technically speaking, it is not a disease entity. For example, there is no such thing as [[heart disease]]. Instead there are many separate heart ailments, or combinations of them. It is something like that with alcoholism. We did not wish to get in wrong with the medical profession by pronouncing alcoholism a disease entity. We always called it an [[illness]], or a [[malady]]&amp;nbsp;– a far safer term for us to use.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGovernWhite2003&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Thomas F.|last1= McGovern|first2=William L. |last2=White|title=Alcohol Problems in the United States: Twenty Years of Treatment Perspective|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=3gRwmYohuooC|page=7}}|accessdate=17 April 2010|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7890-2049-9|pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In professional and research contexts, the term &quot;alcoholism&quot; sometimes encompasses both alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence,&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|one/000002709|alcoholism}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes is considered equivalent to alcohol dependence. Talbot (1989) observes that alcoholism in the classical disease model follows a progressive course: if a person continues to drink, their condition will worsen. This will lead to harmful consequences in their life, physically, mentally, emotionally and socially.&lt;ref name=Thomb1999&gt;{{cite book|last=Thombs|first=Dennis L|title=Introduction To Addictive Behaviors 2ed|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Aze4azm9XkQCIntroduction}}|year=1999|publisher=The Guildford Press|location=London|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson (1980) explores the emotional progression of the addict's response to alcohol. He looks at this in four phases. The first two are considered &quot;normal&quot; drinking and the last two are viewed as &quot;typical&quot; alcoholic drinking.&lt;ref name=Thomb1999/&gt; Johnson's four phases consist of:
# Learning the mood swing. A person is introduced to alcohol (in some cultures this can happen at a relatively young age), and the person enjoys the happy feeling it produces.  At this stage, there is no emotional cost.
# Seeking the mood swing. A person will drink to regain that feeling of euphoria experienced in phase 1; the drinking will increase as more intoxication is required to achieve the same effect. Again at this stage, there are no significant consequences.
# At the third stage there are physical and social consequences, i.e., hangovers, family problems, work problems, etc. A person will continue to drink excessively, disregarding the problems.
# The fourth stage can be detrimental, as Johnson cites it as a risk for premature death. As a person now drinks to feel normal, they block out the feelings of overwhelming guilt, remorse, anxiety, and shame they experience when sober.&lt;ref name=Thomb1999/&gt;

====Milam &amp; Ketcham's physical deterioration stages====
Other theorists such as Milam &amp; Ketcham (1983) focus on the physical deterioration that alcohol consumption causes. They describe the process in three stages:
# Adaptive stage – The person will not experience any negative symptoms, and they believe they have the capacity for drinking alcohol without problems. Physiological changes are happening with the increase in tolerance, but this will not be noticeable to the drinker or others.
# Dependent stage – At this stage, symptoms build up gradually. [[Hangover]] symptoms from excessive drinking may be confused with withdrawal symptoms. Many addicts will maintain their drinking to avoid withdrawal sickness, drinking small amounts frequently. They will try to hide their drinking problem from others and will avoid gross intoxication.
# Deterioration stage – Various organs are damaged due to long-term drinking. Medical treatment in a rehabilitation center will be required; otherwise, the pathological changes will cause death.

====DSM and ICD====
In psychology and psychiatry, the DSM is the most common global standard, while in medicine, the standard is ICD. The terms they recommend are similar but not identical.

The [[DSM-IV]] diagnosis of alcohol dependence represents one approach to the definition of alcoholism. In part, this is to assist in the development of research protocols in which findings can be compared to one another. According to the DSM-IV, an alcohol dependence diagnosis is: &quot;maladaptive alcohol use with clinically significant impairment as manifested by at least three of the following within any one-year period: tolerance; withdrawal; taken in greater amounts or over longer time course than intended; desire or unsuccessful attempts to cut down or control use; great deal of time spent obtaining, using, or recovering from use; social, occupational, or recreational activities given up or reduced; continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological [[sequela]]e.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DSMIV&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title = Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV | url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=W-BGAAAAMAAJ}} |year = 1994 | publisher = American Psychiatric Association | location = Washington, DC | isbn = 978-0-89042-025-6 | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the imprecision inherent in the term, there have been attempts to define how the word ''alcoholism'' should be interpreted when encountered. In 1992, it was defined by the [[National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence]] (NCADD) and [[American Society of Addiction Medicine|ASAM]] as &quot;a primary, chronic disease characterized by impaired control over drinking, preoccupation with the drug alcohol, use of alcohol despite adverse consequences, and distortions in thinking.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morse |first1=RM |last2=Flavin |first2=DK | title = The definition of alcoholism.

===Social barriers===
Attitudes and social stereotypes can create barriers to the detection and treatment of alcohol abuse. This is more of a barrier for women than men. Fear of stigmatization may lead women to deny that they are suffering from a medical condition, to hide their drinking, and to drink alone. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be less likely to suspect that a woman they know is an alcoholic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blume Laura N., Nielson Nancy H., Riggs Joseph A., et all 1998 861–870&quot; &gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Blum | first1 = Laura N. | last2 = Nielsen | first2 = Nancy H. | last3 = Riggs | first3 = Joseph A. | last4 = Council on Scientific Affairs, American Medical Association | author-link4 = American Medical Association | title = Alcoholism and alcohol abuse among women: report of the council on scientific affairs | journal = [[Journal of Women's Health]] | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = 861–70 | doi = 10.1089/jwh.1998.7.861 | pmid = 9785312 | date = September 1998 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, reduced fear of stigma may lead men to admit that they are suffering from a medical condition, to display their drinking publicly, and to drink in groups.

These tools are mostly [[self report study|self-reports]] in questionnaire form.

The [[CAGE questionnaire]], named for its four questions, is one such example that may be used to screen patients quickly in a doctor's office.

{{Quotation|Two &quot;yes&quot; responses indicate that the respondent should be investigated further.

The questionnaire asks the following questions:

Other tests are sometimes used for the detection of alcohol dependence, such as the [[Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire]], which is a more sensitive diagnostic test than the [[CAGE questionnaire]]. It helps distinguish a diagnosis of alcohol dependence from one of heavy alcohol use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/html.cfm/index3556EN.html |title=Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire (SADD) |last1=Raistrick |first1=D. |last2=Dunbar|first2= G. |last3=Davidson |first3=R. |year=1983 |publisher=European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160721101929/http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/html.cfm/index3556EN.html |archivedate=21 July 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Michigan Alcohol Screening Test]] (MAST) is a screening tool for alcoholism widely used by courts to determine the appropriate sentencing for people convicted of alcohol-related offenses,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ncadd-sfv.org/symptoms/mast_test.html |title=Michigan Alcohol Screening Test |publisher=The National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906123532/http://www.ncadd-sfv.org/symptoms/mast_test.html |archivedate=6 September 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[driving under the influence]] being the most common. The [[Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test]] (AUDIT), a screening questionnaire developed by the [[World Health Organization]], is unique in that it has been validated in six countries and is used internationally. Like the CAGE questionnaire, it uses a simple set of questions – a high score earning a deeper investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2001/WHO_MSD_MSB_01.6a.pdf |title=The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test; Guidelines for Use in Primary Care |first1=Thomas F. |last1=Babor |first2=John C. |last2=Higgins-Biddle |first3=John B. |last3=Saunders |first4=Maristela G. |last4=Monteiro |year=2001 |publisher=World Health Organization |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502132711/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2001/WHO_MSD_MSB_01.6a.pdf |archivedate=2 May 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Paddington Alcohol Test]] (PAT) was designed to screen for alcohol-related problems amongst those attending [[Accident and Emergency department]]s.

===Urine and blood tests===
There are reliable tests for the actual use of alcohol, one common test being that of [[blood alcohol content]] (BAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Jones |first=AW | title = Urine as a biological specimen for forensic analysis of alcohol and variability in the urine-to-blood relationship | journal = Toxicol Rev | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–35 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16856767 | doi = 10.2165/00139709-200625010-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These tests do not differentiate alcoholics from non-alcoholics; however, long-term heavy drinking does have a few recognizable effects on the body, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Das |first1=SK |last2= Dhanya |first2=L |last3=Vasudevan |first3=DM | title = Biomarkers of alcoholism: an updated review | journal = Scand J Clin Lab Invest | volume = 68 | issue = 2 | pages = 81–92 | year = 2008 | pmid = 17852805 | doi = 10.1080/00365510701532662 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Macrocytosis]] (enlarged [[Mean corpuscular volume|MCV]])
* Elevated [[Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase|GGT]]
* Moderate elevation of [[Aspartate transaminase|AST]] and [[Alanine transaminase|ALT]] and an AST: ALT ratio of 2:1
* High [[carbohydrate deficient transferrin]] (CDT)

With regard to alcoholism, BAC is useful to judge [[alcohol tolerance]], which in turn is a sign of alcoholism.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; Electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities including [[hypokalemia]], [[hypomagnesemia]], [[hyponatremia]], [[hyperuricemia]], [[metabolic acidosis]], and [[respiratory alkalosis]] are common in alcoholics.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIHHx&quot; /&gt;

However, none of these blood tests for biological markers is as sensitive as screening questionnaires.

==Prevention==
{{further|Alcohol education}}
The [[World Health Organization]], the [[European Union]] and other regional bodies, national governments and parliaments have formed alcohol policies in order to reduce the harm of alcoholism.&lt;ref name=&quot;alchwho2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/alcohol_drinking/en/ |title=Alcohol |author=World Health Organization |year=2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226094205/http://www.who.int/topics/alcohol_drinking/en/ |archivedate=26 February 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;apitwhoer&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/mediacentre/fs1005e.pdf |title=Alcohol policy in the WHO European Region: current status and the way forward |date=12 September 2005 |publisher=World Health Organization |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123105252/http://www.euro.who.int/document/mediacentre/fs1005e.pdf |archivedate=23 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Targeting adolescents and young adults is regarded as an important step to reduce the harm of alcohol abuse. Increasing the age at which licit drugs of abuse such as alcohol can be purchased, the banning or restricting advertising of alcohol has been recommended as additional ways of reducing the harm of alcohol dependence and abuse. Credible, [[evidence based]] educational campaigns in the mass media about the consequences of alcohol abuse have been recommended. Guidelines for parents to prevent alcohol abuse amongst adolescents, and for helping young people with mental health problems have also been suggested.&lt;ref name=&quot;acdacpovfa&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crews |first1=F |last2=He |first2=J |last3=Hodge |first3=C | title = Adolescent cortical development: a critical period of vulnerability for addiction | journal = Pharmacol Biochem Behav | volume = 86 | issue = 2 | pages = 189–99 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17222895 | doi = 10.1016/j.pbb.2006.12.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
Treatments are varied because there are multiple perspectives of alcoholism. Those who approach alcoholism as a medical condition or disease recommend differing treatments from, for instance, those who approach the condition as one of social choice. Most treatments focus on helping people discontinue their alcohol intake, followed up with life training and/or social support to help them resist a return to alcohol use. Since alcoholism involves multiple factors which encourage a person to continue drinking, they must all be addressed to successfully prevent a relapse. An example of this kind of treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of supportive therapy, attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of coping mechanisms. The treatment community for alcoholism typically supports an abstinence-based [[zero tolerance]] approach; however, some prefer a [[Harm reduction|harm-reduction]] approach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gabbard&quot;/&gt;

===Detoxification===
{{Main|Alcohol detoxification}}
[[Alcohol detoxification]] or 'detox' for alcoholics is an abrupt stop of alcohol drinking coupled with the substitution of drugs, such as [[benzodiazepines]], that have similar effects to prevent [[Alcohol withdrawal syndrome|alcohol withdrawal]]. Individuals who are only at risk of mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms can be detoxified as outpatients. Individuals at risk of a severe withdrawal syndrome as well as those who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients. Detoxification does not actually treat alcoholism, and it is necessary to follow up detoxification with an appropriate treatment program for alcohol dependence or abuse to reduce the risk of relapse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blondell-2005&quot;/&gt; Some symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as depressed mood and anxiety typically take weeks or months to abate while other symptoms persist longer due to persisting neuroadaptations.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20148778&quot; /&gt; Alcoholism has serious adverse effects on brain function; on average it takes one year of abstinence to recover from the cognitive deficits incurred by chronic alcohol abuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stavro-2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stavro |first1=K |last2=Pelletier |first2=J |last3=Potvin |first3=S | title = Widespread and sustained cognitive deficits in alcoholism: a meta-analysis | journal = Addict Biol | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 203–13 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22264351 | doi = 10.1111/j.1369-1600.2011.00418.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological===
[[File:Alcoholics Anonymous Regional Service Center by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|A regional service center for [[Alcoholics Anonymous]].]]

Various forms of [[group therapy]] or [[psychotherapy]] can be used to deal with underlying psychological issues that are related to alcohol addiction, as well as provide relapse prevention skills. The mutual-help group-counseling approach is one of the most common ways of helping alcoholics maintain sobriety.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgan-Lopez-2006&quot;/&gt; [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] was one of the first organizations formed to provide mutual, nonprofessional counseling, and it is still the largest. Others include [[LifeRing Secular Recovery]], [[SMART Recovery]], [[Women for Sobriety]], and [[Secular Organizations for Sobriety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.helpguide.org/articles/addiction/self-help-groups-for-alcohol-addiction.htm|title=Self-Help Groups for Alcohol Addiction|last=Smith, M.A.|first=Melinda|last2=Saisan, M.S.W.|first2=Joanna|date=2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521163926/http://www.helpguide.org/articles/addiction/self-help-groups-for-alcohol-addiction.htm|archivedate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moderate drinking===

Rationing and moderation programs such as [[Moderation Management]] and DrinkWise do not mandate complete abstinence. While most alcoholics are unable to limit their drinking in this way, some return to moderate drinking. A 2002 US study by the [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]] (NIAAA) showed that 17.7 percent of individuals diagnosed as alcohol dependent more than one year prior returned to low-risk drinking. This group, however, showed fewer initial symptoms of dependency.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAWSON2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dawson |first1=DA |last2=Grant|first2= BF |last3=Stinson |first3=FS |last4=Chou |first4=PS |last5=Huang |first5=B |last6=Ruan |first6=WJ | title = Recovery from DSM-IV alcohol dependence: United States, 2001–2002 | journal = Addiction | volume = 100 | issue = 3 | pages = 281–92 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15733237 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2004.00964.x | url = http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh29-2/131-142.htm | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110719104620/http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh29-2/131-142.htm | archivedate = 19 July 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A follow-up study, using the same subjects that were judged to be in remission in 2001–2002, examined the rates of return to problem drinking in 2004–2005.

===Medications===
In the United States there are four approved medications for alcoholism: acamprosate, two methods of using naltrexone and disulfiram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Alcohol and Other Drugs|url=http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/AA76/AA76.htm |url-status=live |publisher=National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728134244/http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa76/aa76.htm |archive-date=28 July 2013 |access-date=2013-07-11 |number=76|date=July 2008|journal=Alcohol Alert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Naltrexone]] is a [[competitive antagonist]] for opioid receptors, effectively blocking the effects of [[endorphin]]s and [[opioid]]s. Naltrexone is used to decrease cravings for alcohol and encourage abstinence. Alcohol causes the body to release endorphins, which in turn release dopamine and activate the reward pathways; hence in the body reduces the pleasurable effects from consuming alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soyka |first1=M |last2=Rösner |first2=S | title = Opioid antagonists for pharmacological treatment of alcohol dependence – a critical review | journal = Curr Drug Abuse Rev | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 280–91 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 19630726 | doi = 10.2174/1874473710801030280 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence supports a reduced risk of relapse among alcohol-dependent persons and a decrease in excessive drinking.&lt;ref name=JAMA2014/&gt; [[Nalmefene]] also appears effective and works in a similar manner.&lt;ref name=JAMA2014/&gt;

* [[Disulfiram]] prevents the elimination of [[acetaldehyde]], a chemical the body produces when breaking down ethanol. Acetaldehyde itself is the cause of many [[hangover]] symptoms from alcohol use. The overall effect is discomfort when alcohol is ingested: an extremely fast-acting and long-lasting, uncomfortable hangover.

Several other drugs are also used and many are under investigation.
* [[Benzodiazepines]], while useful in the management of acute alcohol withdrawal, if used long-term can cause a worse outcome in alcoholism. Alcoholics on chronic benzodiazepines have a lower rate of achieving abstinence from alcohol than those not taking benzodiazepines. This class of drugs is commonly prescribed to alcoholics for insomnia or anxiety management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor1-first=S.J.E. |editor1-last=Lindsay |editor2-first=Graham E. |editor2-last=Powell |title=The Handbook of Clinical Adult Psychology |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=a6A9AAAAIAAJ|page=380}} |edition=2nd |date=28 July 1998 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-07215-1 |page=402 |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initiating prescriptions of benzodiazepines or sedative-hypnotics in individuals in recovery has a high rate of relapse with one author reporting more than a quarter of people relapsed after being prescribed sedative-hypnotics.

===Dual addictions and dependences===
Alcoholics may also require treatment for other psychotropic [[drug addiction]]s and [[drug dependence]]s. The most common dual dependence syndrome with alcohol dependence is [[benzodiazepine dependence]], with studies showing 10–20 percent of alcohol-dependent individuals had problems of dependence and/or misuse problems of benzodiazepine drugs such as [[diazepam]] or [[clonazepam]]. These drugs are, like alcohol, [[depressant]]s. Benzodiazepines may be used legally, if they are prescribed by doctors for anxiety problems or other mood disorders, or they may be purchased as [[illegal drugs]].  Benzodiazepine use increases cravings for alcohol and the volume of alcohol consumed by problem drinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Poulos |first1=CX |last2=Zack |first2=M | title = Low-dose diazepam primes motivation for alcohol and alcohol-related semantic networks in problem drinkers | journal = Behav Pharmacol | volume = 15 | issue = 7 | pages = 503–12 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15472572 | doi = 10.1097/00008877-200411000-00006 | url = | issn = 0955-8810 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Benzodiazepine dependency requires careful reduction in dosage to avoid [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] and other health consequences. Dependence on other sedative-hypnotics such as [[zolpidem]] and [[zopiclone]] as well as [[opiate]]s and illegal drugs is common in alcoholics. Alcohol itself is a sedative-hypnotic and is cross-tolerant with other sedative-hypnotics such as [[barbiturate]]s, benzodiazepines and [[nonbenzodiazepine]]s. Dependence upon and withdrawal from sedative-hypnotics can be medically severe and, as with alcohol withdrawal, there is a risk of [[psychosis]] or [[seizure]]s if not properly managed.&lt;ref name=&quot;dolpdaa&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johansson |first1=BA |last2=Berglund |first2=M |last3=Hanson |first3=M |last4=Pöhlén |first4=C |last5=Persson |first5=I | title = Dependence on legal psychotropic drugs among alcoholics | journal = Alcohol and Alcoholism | volume = 38 | issue = 6 | pages = 613–18 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14633651 | doi = 10.1093/alcalc/agg123 | url = http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/38/6/613 | format = PDF | issn = 0735-0414 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090220090248/http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/38/6/613 | archivedate = 20 February 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the medical and scientific communities, there is a broad consensus regarding alcoholism as a disease state. For example, the American Medical Association considers alcohol a drug and states that &quot;drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing brain disease characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use despite often devastating consequences. It results from a complex interplay of biological vulnerability, environmental exposure, and developmental factors (e.g., stage of brain maturity).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; Alcoholism has a higher prevalence among men, though, in recent decades, the proportion of female alcoholics has increased.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walter H., Gutierrez K., Ramskogler K., Hertling I., Dvorak A., Lesch O.M., et al. 2003 253–268&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walter |first1=H|last2= Gutierrez |first2=K |last3=Ramskogler |first3=K|last4= Hertling |first4=I |last5=Dvorak |first5=A |last6=Lesch |first6=OM | title = Gender-specific differences in alcoholism: implications for treatment | journal = Archives of Women's Mental Health | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 253–58 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14628177 | doi = 10.1007/s00737-003-0014-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Current evidence indicates that in both men and women, alcoholism is 50–60 percent genetically determined, leaving 40–50 percent for environmental influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dick |first1=DM |last2=Bierut |first2=LJ | title = The genetics of alcohol dependence | journal = Current Psychiatry Reports | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 151–57 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16539893 | doi = 10.1007/s11920-006-0015-1 | url = | issn = 1523-3812 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most alcoholics develop alcoholism during adolescence or young adulthood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enoch-2006&quot;/&gt; 31 percent of college students show signs of alcohol abuse, while six percent are dependent on alcohol.

Alcohol has a long history of use and misuse throughout recorded history. Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of abuse and dependence on alcohol. In some ancient cultures alcohol was worshiped and in others, its abuse was condemned. Excessive alcohol misuse and drunkenness were recognized as causing social problems even thousands of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis, and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of alcohol abuse and chronic drunkenness boosted membership of the [[temperance movement]] and led to the [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition of alcohol in the United States]], a nationwide constitutional ban on the production, importation, transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages that remained in place until 1933; this policy resulted in the decline of death rates from cirrhosis and alcoholism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blocker2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blocker |first1=Jack S. |title=Did Prohibition Really Work?

The various health problems associated with long-term alcohol consumption are generally perceived as detrimental to society, for example, money due to lost labor-hours, medical costs due to injuries due to drunkenness and organ damage from long-term use, and secondary treatment costs, such as the costs of rehabilitation facilities and detoxification centers. Alcohol use is a major contributing factor for [[head injury|head injuries]], [[motor vehicle accident]]s (due to [[drunk driving]]), [[domestic violence]], and assaults. Beyond the financial costs that alcohol consumption imposes, there are also significant social costs to both the alcoholic and their family and friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jessica Kingsley Publishers&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last1=McCully |first1=Chris |title=Goodbye Mr. Wonderful.

===Topiramate===
[[Topiramate]], a derivative of the naturally occurring sugar monosaccharide D-fructose, has been found effective in helping alcoholics quit or cut back on the amount they drink. Evidence suggests that topiramate antagonizes excitatory glutamate receptors, inhibits dopamine release, and enhances inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid function. A 2008 review of the effectiveness of topiramate concluded that the results of published trials are promising, however, as of 2008, data was insufficient to support using topiramate in conjunction with brief weekly compliance counseling as a first-line agent for alcohol dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Olmsted |first1=CL |last2=Kockler |first2=DR | title = Topiramate for alcohol dependence | journal = Ann Pharmacother | volume = 42 | issue = 10 | pages = 1475–80 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18698008 | doi = 10.1345/aph.1L157 | issn = 1060-0280 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/212937c609f6ed0951bcce858807f46b47c2fbad }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 review found that topiramate may be superior to existing alcohol pharmacotherapeutic options.
