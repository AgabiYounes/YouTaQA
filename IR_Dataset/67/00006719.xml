'''Columbia''' {{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|l|ʌ|m|b|i|ə}} is a city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Missouri]]. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Boone County, Missouri|Boone County]] and home to the [[University of Missouri]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GR6&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |accessdate=2011-06-07 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531210815/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |archivedate=May 31, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1821, it is the principal city of the five-county [[Columbia metropolitan area (Missouri)|Columbia metropolitan area]]. It is Missouri's [[List of cities in Missouri|fourth most-populous]] and fastest growing city, with an estimated 123,180 residents in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/economy/2018/04/10/your-citys-population-keeping-pace-fastest-growing-city-each-state/489842002/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/columbiacitymissouri/PST045217&lt;/ref&gt;

As a Midwestern [[college town]], Columbia has a reputation for progressive politics, persuasive journalism, and public art.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/places/mo/columbia/ Columbia, Missouri&lt;/ref&gt; The tripartite establishment of [[Stephens College]] (1833), the University of Missouri (1839), and [[Columbia College (Missouri)|Columbia College]] (1851), which surround the city's [[Downtown Columbia, Missouri|Downtown]] to the east, south, and north, has made the city a center of learning. At its center is 8th Street, also known as the [[Avenue of the Columns]], which connects [[Francis Quadrangle]] and [[Jesse Hall]] to the [[Boone County Courthouse (Columbia, Missouri)|Boone County Courthouse]] and the [[City Hall (Columbia, Missouri)|City Hall]]. Originally an agricultural town, the cultivation of the mind is Columbia's chief economic concern today. Never a major center of manufacturing, the city also depends on healthcare, insurance, and technology businesses. Companies such as [[Shelter Insurance]], [[Carfax (company)|Carfax]], and [[Slackers CDs and Games]], were founded in the city. Cultural institutions include the [[State Historical Society of Missouri]], the [[Museum of Art and Archaeology]], and the annual [[True/False Film Festival]]. The [[Missouri Tigers]], the state's only major college athletic program, play football at [[Faurot Field]] and basketball at [[Mizzou Arena]] as members of the rigorous [[Southeastern Conference]].

The city rests upon the forested hills and rolling prairies of [[Mid-Missouri]], near the [[Missouri River]] valley, where the [[Ozarks|Ozark Mountains]] begin to transform into plains and savanna. Limestone forms bluffs and glades while rain dissolves the bedrock, creating caves and springs which water the [[Hinkson Creek|Hinkson]], [[Perche Creek|Roche Perche]], and [[Bonne Femme Creek (Boone County, Missouri)|Bonne Femme]] creeks. Surrounding the city, [[Rock Bridge Memorial State Park]], [[Mark Twain National Forest]], and [[Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge]] form a greenbelt preserving sensitive and rare environments. The [[Columbia Agriculture Park]] is home to the Columbia Farmers Market.

The first humans who entered the area at least 12,000 years ago were nomadic hunters. Later, woodland tribes lived in villages along waterways and [[Mound Builders|built mounds]] in high places. The [[Osage Nation|Osage]] and [[Missouria]] nations were expelled by the exploration of French traders and the rapid settlement of American pioneers. The latter arrived by the [[Boone's Lick Road]] and hailed from the culture of the [[Upland South]], especially Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. From 1812, the [[Boonslick]] area played a pivotal role in Missouri's early history and the nation's westward expansion. German, Irish, and other European immigrants soon joined. The modern populace is unusually diverse, over 8% foreign-born. White and black people are the largest ethnicities, and people of Asian descent are the third-largest group. The city has been called the &quot;Athens of Missouri&quot; for its [[Classics|classic]] beauty and educational emphasis, but is more commonly called &quot;CoMo&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Como&quot; /&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Columbia, Missouri}}
[[File:CoMoPano1869.jpg|thumb|right|An aerial depiction of Columbia's downtown district in 1869. The large building on the right is University of Missouri Academic Hall.]]

Columbia's origins begin with the settlement of [[American pioneer]]s from Kentucky and Virginia in an early 1800s region known as the [[Boonslick]]. Before 1815 settlement in the region was confined to small log forts because of the threat of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] attack during the [[War of 1812]]. When the war ended settlers came on foot, horseback, and wagon, often moving entire households along the [[Boone's Lick Road]] and sometimes bringing [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved African Americans]]. By 1818 it was clear that the increased population would necessitate a new county be created from territorial [[Howard County, Missouri|Howard County]]. The [[Moniteau Creek (north central Missouri)|Moniteau Creek]] on the west and [[Cedar Creek (Missouri River tributary)|Cedar Creek]] on the east were obvious natural boundaries.

Believing it was only a matter of time before a county seat was chosen, the Smithton Land Company was formed to purchase over {{convert|2000|acre|km2}} to established the village of Smithton near the present-day intersection of Walnut and Garth. In 1819 Smithton was a small cluster of log cabins in an ancient forest of oak and hickory; chief among them was the cabin of [[Richard Gentry]], a trustee of the Smithton Company who would become first mayor of Columbia. In 1820, Boone County was formed and named after the recently deceased explorer [[Daniel Boone]]. The Missouri Legislature appointed John Gray, Jefferson Fulcher, Absalom Hicks, Lawrence Bass, and David Jackson as commissioners to select and establish a permanent county seat. Smithton never had more than twenty people, and it was quickly realized that well digging was difficult because of the bedrock.

Springs were discovered across the [[Flat Branch|Flat Branch Creek]], so in the spring of 1821 Columbia was laid out, and the inhabitants of Smithton moved their cabins to the new town. The first house in Columbia was built by Thomas Duly in 1820 at what became Fifth and Broadway. Columbia's permanence was ensured when it was chosen as county seat in 1821 and the Boone's Lick Road was rerouted down Broadway.

The roots of Columbia's three economic foundations—education, medicine, and insurance— can be traced to the city's incorporation in 1821.&lt;ref name=&quot;ckbome&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.columbia.k12.mo.us/columbia/colhis.htm | title=History of Columbia | work=[[Columbia Public Schools]] | accessdate=January 1, 2008 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202045636/http://www.columbia.k12.mo.us/columbia/colhis.htm | archivedate=February 2, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bdkfqw&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.columbiaredi.com/pdfs/ColumbiaKudos.pdf | archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080216012203/http://www.columbiaredi.com/pdfs/ColumbiaKudos.pdf | url-status=dead | archive-date=February 16, 2008 | format=PDF | title=Columbia Kudos | work=Columbia Regional Economic Development (REDI) | accessdate=January 1, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Original plans for the town set aside land for a state university. In 1833, Columbia Baptist Female College opened, which later became [[Stephens College]]. Columbia College, distinct from today's and later to become the [[University of Missouri]], was founded in 1839. When the state legislature decided to establish a state university, Columbia raised three times as much money as any competing city,&lt;ref name = &quot;skbsjf&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =Switzler | first=William | title=History of Boone County, Missouri | publisher=St. Louis Western Historical Company |year=1882 | pages=300–310}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James S. Rollins]] donated the land that is today the Francis Quadrangle.&lt;ref name = &quot;skbsjf&quot;/&gt; Soon other educational institutions were founded in Columbia, such as Christian Female College, the first college for women west of the Mississippi, which later became [[Columbia College (Columbia, Missouri)|Columbia College]].

The city benefited from being a stagecoach stop of the [[Santa Fe Trail|Santa Fe]] and [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]] trails, and later from the [[Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad]]. In 1822, [[William Jewell (educator)|William Jewell]] set up the first hospital. In 1830, the first newspaper began; in 1832, the first theater in the state was opened; and in 1835, the state's first agricultural fair was held. By 1839, the population of 13,000 and wealth of Boone County was exceeded in Missouri only by that of [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]], which, at that time, included the City of [[St. Louis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Switzler | first=William | title=History of Boone County, Missouri | publisher=St. Louis Western Historical Company |year=1882 | pages=325–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbia's infrastructure was relatively untouched by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. As a slave state, Missouri had many residents with Southern sympathies, but it stayed in the Union. The majority of the city was pro-Union;&lt;ref name = &quot;ckbome&quot;/&gt; however, the surrounding agricultural areas of Boone County and the rest of central Missouri were decidedly pro-Confederate. Because of this, the University of Missouri became a base from which Union troops operated. No battles were fought within the city because the presence of Union troops dissuaded Confederate guerrillas from attacking, though several major battles occurred at nearby [[Boonville, Missouri|Boonville]] and [[Centralia, Missouri|Centralia]].

After Reconstruction, race relations in Columbia followed the Southern pattern of increasing violence of whites against blacks in efforts to suppress voting and free movement: George Burke, a black man who worked at the university, was [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]] in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =NAACP | title=Thirty Years of Lynching in the United States, 1889–1918 | publisher=NAACP |year=1919 | page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1923, James T. Scott, an African-American janitor at the University of Missouri, was arrested on allegations of raping a university professor's daughter. He was taken from the county jail and lynched on April 29 before a white mob of several hundred, hanged from the Old Stewart Road Bridge.

[[File:University of Missouri - Memorial Union.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Memorial Union (University of Missouri)|Memorial Union]] at the University of Missouri]]
In the 21st century, a number of efforts have been undertaken to recognize Scott's death. In 2010 his death certificate was changed to reflect that he was never tried or convicted of charges, and that he had been lynched. In 2011 a headstone was put at his grave at Columbia Cemetery; it includes his wife's and parents' names and dates, to provide a fuller account of his life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/community-celebrates-life-of-lynching-victim-james-t-scott/article_37682fd8-806e-5805-b89e-490b9d63f69e.html Katy Bergen, &quot;Community celebrates life of lynching victim James T.

In 1963, [[University of Missouri System]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.umsystem.edu/ums/about/history/| title=History of the University | work=[[University of Missouri System]] | accessdate=July 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Columbia College (Columbia, Missouri)|Columbia College system]] established their headquarters in Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ccis.edu/about/ | title=Welcome to Columbia College | work=[[Columbia College (Columbia, Missouri)|Columbia College]] | accessdate=July 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The insurance industry also became important to the local economy as several companies established headquarters in Columbia, including [[Shelter Insurance]], [[Missouri Employers Mutual]], and [[Columbia Insurance Group]]. [[State Farm Insurance]] has a regional office in Columbia. In addition, the now-defunct Silvey Insurance was a large local employer.

Columbia became a transportation crossroads when [[U.S. Route 63 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 63]] and [[U.S. Route 40 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 40]] (which was improved as present-day [[Interstate 70 (Missouri)|Interstate 70]]) were routed through the city. Soon after, the city opened the [[Columbia Regional Airport]]. By 2000, the city's population was nearly 85,000.&lt;ref name = &quot;dpmpnc&quot;/&gt;

==Geography==
Columbia, in northern mid-Missouri, is {{convert|120|mi|km}} away from both [[St. Louis]] and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], and {{convert|29|mi|km}} north of the state capital of [[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.medpedsresidency.missouri.edu/columbia_missouri.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041010035724/http://medpedsresidency.missouri.edu/columbia_missouri.htm | url-status=dead | archive-date=October 10, 2004 | title=About Columbia | work=MU internal Medicine and Child Health | accessdate=January 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is near the [[Missouri River]], between the [[Ozark Plateau]] and the [[Geography of Missouri#Regions|Northern Plains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://chamber.columbia.mo.us/community/about.asp?Maps | title=Maps | work=Columbia Chamber of Commerce | accessdate=January 11, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080209060935/http://chamber.columbia.mo.us/community/about.asp?Maps |archivedate = February 9, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/ozar/hrs3.htm | title=Early Settlement Rural...Ozark Frontier | work=National Park Service | accessdate=January 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|63.5|sqmi|sqkm|2}} of which {{convert|63.08|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.42|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=July 8, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=July 2, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topography===
The city generally slopes from the highest point in the Northeast to the lowest point in the Southwest towards the Missouri River. Prominent tributaries of the river are Perche Creek, Hinkson Creek, and Flat Branch Creek. Along these and other creeks in the area can be found large valleys, cliffs, and cave systems such as that in [[Rock Bridge State Park]] just south of the city. These creeks are largely responsible for numerous stream valleys giving Columbia hilly terrain similar to the Ozarks while also having prairie flatland typical of northern Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=A.G.|last=Unklesbay|publisher=Missouri Geological Survey|year=1952|title=Geology of Boone County, Missouri}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia also operates several greenbelts with trails and parks throughout town.

===Animal life===
Large mammal] found in the city include urbanized coyotes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mdc.mo.gov/nathis/mammals/coyote/ | title=Coyote | work=Missouri Department of Conservation | accessdate=January 11, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060928232433/http://mdc.mo.gov/nathis/mammals/coyote/ |archivedate = September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[red fox]]es, and numerous [[whitetail deer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mdc.mo.gov/nathis/mammals/deer2/ | title=Whitetale deer | work=Missouri Department of Conservation | accessdate=January 11, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060928232140/http://mdc.mo.gov/nathis/mammals/deer2/ |archivedate = September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eastern gray squirrel]], and other rodents are abundant, as well as cottontail rabbits and the nocturnal opossum and raccoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mdc.mo.gov/nathis/mammals/squirrel/ | title=Eastern Gray Squirrel | work=Missouri Department of Conservation | accessdate=January 11, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060928232328/http://mdc.mo.gov/nathis/mammals/squirrel/ |archivedate = September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mdc4.mdc.mo.gov/applications/MDCLibrary/MDCLibrary2.aspx?NodeID=394 | title=Mammals (In Missouri) | work=Missouri Department of Conservation | accessdate=January 11, 2008 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203234523/http://mdc4.mdc.mo.gov/applications/MDCLibrary/MDCLibrary2.aspx?NodeID=394 | archivedate=February 3, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large bird species are abundant in parks and include the Canada goose, mallard duck, as well as shorebirds, including the great egret and great blue heron. Turkeys are also common in wooded areas and can occasionally be seen on the MKT recreation trail. Populations of bald eagles are found by the Missouri River. The city is on the [[Mississippi Flyway]], used by migrating birds, and has a large variety of small bird species, common to the eastern U.S. The Eurasian tree sparrow, an introduced species, is limited in North America to the counties surrounding St. Louis. Columbia has large areas of forested and open land and many of these areas are home to wildlife.

===Climate===
Columbia has a [[humid continental]] climate ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfa)'' marked by sharp seasonal contrasts in temperature, and is in [[Hardiness zone|USDA Plant Hardiness Zone]] 6a.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/#|title= USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map|year= 2012|website= planthardiness.ars.usda.gov|publisher= Agricultural Research Center, PRISM Climate Group Oregon State University|accessdate= 2014-05-30|url-status= dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227032333/http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/|archivedate= February 27, 2014|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monthly daily average temperature ranges from {{convert|29.7|°F|1}} in January to {{convert|77.3|°F|1}} in July, while the high reaches or exceeds {{convert|90|°F|0}} on an average of 32 days per year, {{convert|100|°F|0}} on two days, while four nights of sub-{{convert|0|°F|0}} lows can be expected.&lt;ref name = &quot;NWS St. Louis, MO (LSX)&quot;/&gt; Precipitation tends to be greatest and most frequent in the latter half of spring, when severe weather is also most common.

==Cityscape==
[[File:Tiger hotel.jpg|thumb|Downtown Columbia]]
Columbia's most significant and well-known architecture is found in buildings located in its downtown area and on the university campuses. The University of Missouri's [[Jesse Hall]] and the [[neo-gothic]] [[Memorial Union (University of Missouri)|Memorial Union]] have become icons of the city. The [[David R. Francis Quadrangle]] is an example of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[Jeffersonian architecture|academic village]] concept.

Four [[Historic district (United States)|historic districts]] located within the city are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]: [[Downtown Columbia, Missouri|Downtown Columbia]], the [[East Campus Neighborhood]], [[Francis Quadrangle]], and the [[North Ninth Street Historic District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/nrlist.htm | title=Recent Listings | work=[[National Park Service]] | accessdate=January 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The downtown skyline is relatively low and is dominated by the 10-story [[Tiger Hotel]] and the 15-story Paquin Tower.

Downtown Columbia is an area of approximately one square mile surrounded by the University of Missouri on the south, Stephens College to the east, and Columbia College on the north. The area serves as Columbia's financial and business district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downtown.org/index.html |title=Discover The District |work=The District |accessdate=January 1, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122081217/http://www.downtown.org/index.html |archivedate=January 22, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Columbia MO downtown area 2017.jpg|thumb|left|Downtown apartment and mixed-use development next to the [[Missouri United Methodist Church]] in June 2017]]
Since the early-21st century, a large number of high-rise apartment complexes have been built in downtown Columbia. Many of these buildings also offer mixed-use business and retail space on the lower levels. These developments have not been without criticism, with some expressing concern the buildings hurt the historic feel of the area, or that the city does not yet have the infrastructure to support them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbiatribune.com/8a143965-d376-5682-926a-3f36982fda25.html  | title=Council candidates: City needs to address growing pains | work=Columbia Daily Tribune | accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's historic residential core lies in a ring around downtown, extending especially to the west along Broadway, and south into the East Campus Neighborhood. The city government recognizes 63 neighborhood associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gocolumbiamo.com/Public_Comm/Neighborhood_Associations/documents/NAContactList.pdf |format=PDF |title=Columbia, Missouri Neighborhood Associations |work=City of Columbia |accessdate=February 16, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216012204/http://www.gocolumbiamo.com/Public_Comm/Neighborhood_Associations/documents/NAContactList.pdf |archivedate=February 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's most dense commercial areas are primarily along [[Interstate 70 (Missouri)|Interstate 70]], [[U.S. Route 63 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 63]], Stadium Boulevard, Grindstone Parkway, and Downtown.
