'''Charlton Athletic Football Club''' is an English professional [[association football]] club based in [[Charlton, London|Charlton]], south-east [[London]]. They currently compete in the [[EFL Championship]], the second tier of English football. The club was founded on 9 June 1905 when a number of youth clubs in south-east London, including East Street Mission and Blundell Mission, combined to form Charlton Athletic. Their home ground is [[The Valley (London)|the Valley]], where the club have played since 1919, apart from one year in [[Catford]], during [[1923–24 in English football|1923–24]], and seven years at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] between 1985 and 1992, due to financial issues, and then safety concerns raised by the local council. The club's fans formed the Valley Party, nominating candidates to stand in local elections, in a bid to return the club to The Valley.

Charlton turned professional in 1920 and first entered [[the Football League]] in 1921. Since then the club has had four separate periods in the top flight of English football: 1936–1957, 1986–1990, 1998–1999, and 2000–2007. Historically, Charlton's most successful period was the 1930s, when the club's highest league finishes were recorded, including runners-up of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in 1937. After World War II, Charlton reached two consecutive [[FA Cup]] finals, losing in [[1946 FA Cup Final|1946]], and winning in [[1947 FA Cup Final|1947]].

The club's traditional [[Kit (association football)|kit]] consists of red shirts, white shorts and red socks, and their most commonly used nickname is ''The Addicks''. Charlton share [[South London derby|local rivalries]] with fellow [[Football in London|South East London]] clubs [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].

===Early history (1905–1946)===
Charlton Athletic F.C. were formed on 9 June 1905&lt;ref name = &quot;Charlton Athletic - Club History&quot;/&gt; by a group of 15- to 17-year-olds in East Street, Charlton, which is now known as Eastmoor Street and no longer residential. Charlton spent most of the years before the First World War playing in youth leagues. They became a senior side in 1913 the same year that nearby [[Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal]] relocated to North London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charlton Athletic - Club History&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, they joined the Kent League for one season (1919–20) before becoming professional, appointing [[Walter Rayner]] as the first full-time manager. They were accepted by the Southern League and played just a single season (1920–21) before being voted into the [[Football League]]. Charlton's first Football League match was against [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] in August 1921, which they won 1–0. In 1923, Charlton became &quot;giant killers&quot; in the [[FA Cup]] beating top flight sides Manchester City, West Bromwich Albion, and Preston North End before losing to eventual winners Bolton Wanderers in the Quarter-Finals. Later that year, it was proposed that Charlton merge with Catford Southend to create a larger team with bigger support.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton 2001, p.30&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1923–24 season Charlton played in Catford at [[The Mount stadium]] and wore the colours of &quot;The Enders&quot;, light and dark blue vertical stripes. However, the move fell through and the Addicks returned to the Charlton area in 1924, returning to the traditional red and white colours in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton 2001, p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlton finished second bottom in the Football League in 1926 and were forced to apply for [[re-election (Football League)|re-election]] which was successful. Three years later the Addicks won the [[Football League Division Three|Division Three]] championship in 1929&lt;ref name=&quot;England 1928/29&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author1=Felton, Paul |author2=Spencer, Barry |title=England 1928/1929 |url=http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1928-29.html |publisher=RSSSF |accessdate=10 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205200833/http://rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1928-29.html |archive-date=5 February 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and they remained at the [[Football League Division Two|Division Two]] level for four years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charlton Athletic - Club History&quot;/&gt; After [[relegation]] into the Third Division south at the end of the 1932–33 season the club appointed Jimmy Seed as manager and he oversaw the most successful period in Charlton's history either side of the [[Second World War]]. Seed, an ex-miner who had made a career as a footballer despite suffering the effects of poison gas in the First World War, remains the most successful manager in Charlton's history. He is commemorated in the name of a stand at the Valley.&lt;ref&gt;Jimmy Seed, Soccer From the Inside (Thorsons Publishers, 1947), p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; Seed was an innovative thinker about the game at a time when tactical formations were still relatively unsophisticated. He later recalled &quot;a simple scheme that enabled us to pull several matches out of the fire&quot; during the 1934–35 season: when the team was in trouble &quot;the centre-half was to forsake his defensive role and go up into the attack to add weight to the five forwards.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Seed, Soccer From the Inside, p.66.&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation Seed brought to the team proved effective and the Addicks gained successive promotions from the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] between 1934 and 1936, becoming the first club to ever do so.&lt;ref name = &quot;Charlton Athletic - Club History&quot;/&gt; Charlton finally secured promotion to the First Division by beating local rivals [[West Ham United]] at the [[Boleyn Ground]], with their centre-half John Oakes playing on despite concussion and a broken nose.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Cameron, Home and Away with Chalton Athletic 1920–2004 (2004), p.69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, Charlton finished runners up in the First Division,&lt;ref name=&quot;1936/1937 English Division 1 (old) Table&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author1=Felton, Paul |author2=Edwards, Gareth |title=England 1936/1937 |url=http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1936-37.html |publisher=RSSSF |accessdate=10 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205203456/http://rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1936-37.html |archive-date=5 February 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1938 finished fourth&lt;ref name=&quot;1937/1938 English Division 1 (old) Table&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author1=Felton, Paul |author2=Edwards, Gareth |title=England 1937/1938 |url=http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1937-38.html |publisher=RSSSF |accessdate=10 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222101344/http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1937-38.html |archive-date=22 December 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1939 finished third.&lt;ref name=&quot;1938/1939 English Division 1 (old) Table&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author1=Felton, Paul |author2=Edwards, Gareth |title=England 1938/1939 |url=http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1938-39.html |publisher=RSSSF |accessdate=10 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205203350/http://rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1938-39.html |archive-date=5 February 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were the most consistent team in the top flight of English football over the three seasons immediately before the Second World War.&lt;ref name = &quot;Charlton Athletic - Club History&quot;/&gt; This continued during the war years and they won the [[Football League War Cup]] and appeared in finals.

===Post-war success and fall from grace (1946–1984)===
Charlton reached the [[1946 FA Cup Final]], but lost 4–1 to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]. Charlton's Bert Turner scored an own goal in the eightieth minute before equalising for the Addicks a minute later to take them into extra time, but they conceded three further goals in the extra period.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Home and Away with Charlton Athletic 1910–2004, p.112.&lt;/ref&gt; When the full league programme resumed in 1946–47 Charlton could finish only 19th in the First Division, just above the relegation spots, but they made amends with their performance in the FA Cup, reaching the [[1947 FA Cup Final]]. This time they were successful, beating [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] 1–0, with [[Chris Duffy (footballer, born 1918)|Chris Duffy]] scoring the only goal of the day.&lt;ref name=&quot;1947 FA Cup Final&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Burnley 0&amp;nbsp;– 1 Charlton| url = http://www.cafc.co.uk/personality.ink?page=7770| publisher=Charlton Athletic FC| accessdate =26 August 2013| archivedate=19 September 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100919131744/http://cafc.co.uk/personality.ink?page=7770}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this period of renewed football attendances, Charlton became one of only thirteen English football teams to average over 40,000 as their attendance during a full season.&lt;ref name = &quot;Charlton Athletic - Club History&quot;/&gt; The Valley was the largest football ground in the League, drawing crowds in excess of 70,000.&lt;ref name = &quot;Charlton Athletic - Club History&quot;/&gt; However, in the 1950s little investment was made either for players or to The Valley, hampering the club's growth. In 1956, the then board undermined [[Jimmy Seed]] and asked for his resignation; Charlton were relegated the following year.&lt;ref name = &quot;Charlton Athletic - Club History&quot;/&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though it did not feel like it, this was a turning point in the club's history leading to a period of turbulence and change including further promotion and exile. A change in management and shortly after a change in club ownership&lt;ref&gt;Clayton 2001, p.141&lt;/ref&gt; led to severe problems, such as the reckless signing of former [[European Footballer of the Year]] [[Allan Simonsen]], and the club looked like it would go out of business.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton 2001, pp.142–150&lt;/ref&gt;

===The &quot;wilderness&quot; years (1984–1995)===
In 1984 financial matters came to a head and the club went into administration, to be reformed as Charlton Athletic. (1984) Ltd.&lt;ref name = &quot;Charlton Athletic - Club History&quot;/&gt; although the club's finances were still far from secure. They were forced to leave the Valley just after the start of the 1985–86 season, after its safety was criticised by Football League officials in the wake of the [[Bradford City stadium fire]].
The club began to groundshare with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] at [[Selhurst Park]]&lt;ref name = &quot;Charlton Athletic - Club History&quot;/&gt; and this arrangement looked to be for the long-term, as Charlton did not have enough funds to revamp the Valley to meet safety requirements.

Despite the move away from the Valley, Charlton were promoted to the First Division as Second Division runners-up at the end of 1985–86,&lt;ref name=&quot;England 1985/86&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remained at this level for four years (achieving a highest league finish of 14th) often with late escapes, most notably against [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds]] in 1987, where the Addicks triumphed in extra-time of the [[English Football League play-offs|play-off]] final replay to secure their top flight place.&lt;ref name = &quot;Charlton Athletic - Club History&quot;/&gt; In 1987 Charlton also returned to [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] for the first time since the 1947 FA Cup final for the [[Full Members Cup]] final against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn]].&lt;ref&gt;Clayton 2001, p.156&lt;/ref&gt;
Eventually, Charlton were relegated in 1990 along with Sheffield Wednesday and bottom club Millwall.&lt;ref name = &quot;Charlton Athletic - Club History&quot;/&gt; Manager [[Lennie Lawrence]] remained in charge for one more season before he accepted an offer to take charge of [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. He was replaced by joint player-managers [[Alan Curbishley]] and [[Steve Gritt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Charlton Athletic - Club History&quot;/&gt; The pair had unexpected success in their first season finishing just outside the play-offs, and [[1992–93 in English football|1992–93]] began promisingly and Charlton looked good bets for promotion in the new Division One (the new name of the old Second Division following the formation of the [[Premier League]]). However, the club was forced to sell players such as [[Rob Lee]] to help pay for a return to the Valley, while club fans formed the Valley Party, nominating candidates to stand in local elections in 1990, pressing the local council to enable the club's return to the Valley - finally achieved in December 1992.

In March 1993, defender [[Tommy Caton]], who had been out of action due to injury since January 1991, announced his retirement from playing on medical advice. He died suddenly at the end of the following month at the age of 30.

===Premier League years (1995–2007)===
In 1995, new chairman [[Richard Murray (businessman)|Richard Murray]] appointed Alan Curbishley as sole manager of Charlton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alan Curbishley profile&quot;&gt;{{cite web

[[1997–98 in English football|1997–98]] was Charlton's best season for years. They reached the Division One play-off final and battled against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in a thrilling game which ended with a 4–4 draw after extra time.

Charlton's first Premier League campaign began promisingly (they went top after two games) but they were unable to keep up their good form and were soon battling relegation. The battle was lost on the final day of the season but the club's board kept faith in Curbishley, confident that they could bounce back. Curbishley rewarded the chairman's loyalty with the Division One title in 2000 which signalled a return to the Premier League.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charlton bounce back in style&quot;&gt;{{cite news

After the club's return, Curbishley proved an astute spender and by 2003 he had succeeded in establishing Charlton in the top flight. Charlton spent much of the [[2003–04 Premier League]] season challenging for a [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] place, but a late-season slump in form and the sale of star player [[Scott Parker (footballer)|Scott Parker]] to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], left Charlton in seventh place,&lt;ref name=&quot;Curbishley basks in glory&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Curbishley basks in glory| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/charlton_athletic/3714559.stm| publisher = BBC| website = BBC Sport| date = 15 May 2004| accessdate = 26 August 2013| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160113005022/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/charlton_athletic/3714559.stm| archive-date = 13 January 2016| url-status = live| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was still the club's highest finish since the 1950s.

===Return to the Football League (2007–2014)===
Charlton's return to [[EFL Championship|the second tier of English football]] was a disappointment, with their promotion campaign tailing off to an 11th-place finish. Early in the following season the Addicks were linked with a foreign takeover,&lt;ref name=&quot;Group eyes £50m Charlton takeover&quot;&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this was swiftly denied by the club. On 10 October 2008, Charlton received an indicative offer for the club from a Dubai-based diversified investment company. However, the deal later fell through. The full significance of this soon became apparent as the club recorded net losses of over £13&amp;nbsp;million for that financial year. Pardew left on 22 November after a 2–5 home loss to Sheffield United that saw the team fall into the relegation places.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pardew and Charlton part company&quot;&gt;{{cite news

[[File:ChrisPowell.jpg|thumb|Former Charlton player [[Chris Powell]] returned to the club as manager between 2011 and 2014]]
After a change in ownership, Parkinson and Charlton legend [[Mark Kinsella]] left after a poor run of results.  Another Charlton legend, [[Chris Powell]], was appointed manager of the club in January 2011, winning his first game in charge 2–0 over Plymouth at the Valley.  This was Charlton's first league win since November. Powell's bright start continued with a further three victories, before running into a downturn which saw the club go 11 games in succession without a win. Yet the fans' respect for Powell saw him come under remarkably little criticism. The club's fortunes picked up towards the end of the season, but leaving them far short of the play-offs. In a busy summer, Powell brought in 19 new players and after a successful season, on 14 April 2012, Charlton Athletic won promotion back to the Championship with a 1–0 away win at [[Carlisle United]]. A week later, on 21 April 2012, they were confirmed as champions after a 2–1 home win over [[Wycombe Wanderers]]. Charlton then lifted the League One trophy on 5 May 2012, having been in the top position since 15 September 2011, and after recording a 3–2 victory over [[Hartlepool United]], recorded their highest ever league points score of 101, the highest in any professional European league that year.

In the first season back in the Championship, the 2012–13 season saw Charlton finish ninth place with 65 points, just three points short of the play-off places to the Premier League.

===Duchâtelet ownership (2014–2019)===
In early January 2014 during the 2013–14 season, Belgian businessman [[Roland Duchâtelet]] took over Charlton as owner in a deal worth £14million. This made Charlton a part of a network of football clubs owned by Duchâtelet. On 11 March 2014, two days after an FA Cup quarter-final loss to Sheffield United, and with Charlton sitting bottom of the table, Powell was sacked and leaked private emails suggested that this was due to a rift with the owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3985700/Charlton-owner-Roland-Duchatelet-dictated-team-selection-tried-explain-concept-4-4-2-formation-former-manager-Chris-Powell.html|title=Emails show Charlton owner Duchatelet 'tried to dictate' team|work=Mail Online|access-date=11 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161204092242/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3985700/Charlton-owner-Roland-Duchatelet-dictated-team-selection-tried-explain-concept-4-4-2-formation-former-manager-Chris-Powell.html|archive-date=4 December 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New manager [[Jose Riga]], despite having to join Charlton long after the transfer window had closed, was able to improve Charlton's form and eventually guide them to 18th place, successfully avoiding relegation. After Riga's departure to manage Blackpool, former Millwall player [[Bob Peeters]] was appointed as manager in May 2014 on a 12-month contract. Charlton started strong, but a long run of draws meant that after only 25 games in charge Peeters was dismissed with the team in 14th place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30772664|title=Bob Peeters sacked as Charlton coach after 25 league games|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=12 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112163554/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30772664|archive-date=12 January 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/551456/Charlton-Athletic-Sack-Bob-Peeters|title=Charlton Athletic have sacked Bob Peeters after a dismal run of form|work=Daily Express|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; His replacement, [[Guy Luzon]], ensured there was no relegation battle by winning most of the remaining matches, resulting in a 12th-place finish.

Bowyer was appointed permanently in September on a one-year contract and after finishing third in the regular [[2018-19 EFL League One]] season, Charlton beat [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] 2–1 in the League One play-off final to earn promotion back to the [[EFL Championship]] after a three-season absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48324840|title=Charlton 2–1 Sunderland – League One Play-off Final|work=BBC Sport|date=26 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maryon Park 1905.jpg|left|thumb|275px|One of Charlton's early grounds, Siemens Meadow]]
The club's first ground was Siemens Meadow (1905–1907), a patch of rough ground by the River Thames. This was over-shadowed by the [[Siemens Brothers]] Telegraph Works. Then followed [[Woolwich Common]] (1907–1908), Pound Park (1908–1913), and Angerstein Lane (1913–1915). After the end of the First World War, a chalk quarry known as the Swamps was identified as Charlton's new ground, and in the summer of 1919 work began to create the level playing area and remove debris from the site.&lt;ref name = &quot;Details about Charlton Athletic&quot;/&gt; The first match at this site, now known as the club's current ground The Valley, was in September 1919. Charlton stayed at The Valley until 1923, when the club moved to [[The Mount stadium]] in [[Catford]] as part of a proposed merger with Catford Southend Football Club. However, after this move collapsed in 1924 Charlton returned to The Valley.

During the 1930s and 1940s, significant improvements were made to the ground, making it one of the largest in the country at that time.&lt;ref name = &quot;Details about Charlton Athletic&quot;/&gt; In 1938 the highest attendance to date at the ground was recorded at over 75,000 for a [[FA Cup]] match against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. During the 1940s and 1950s the attendance was often above 40,000, and Charlton had one of the largest support bases in the country. However, after the club's relegation little investment was made in The Valley as it fell into decline.

In the 1980s matters came to a head as the ownership of the club and The Valley was divided. The large East Terrace had been closed down by the authorities after the [[Bradford City stadium fire]] and the ground's owner wanted to use part of the site for housing. In September 1985, Charlton made the controversial move to ground-share with South London neighbours [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] at [[Selhurst Park]]. This move was unpopular with supporters and in the late 1980s significant steps were taken to bring about the club's return to The Valley.

Since the return to The Valley, three sides of the ground have been completely redeveloped turning The Valley into a modern, all-seater stadium with a 27,111 capacity. There are plans in place to increase the ground's capacity to approximately 31,000 and even around 40,000 in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;Expansion plans underway&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Supporters==
The bulk of the club's support base comes from South East London and Kent, particularly the London boroughs of Greenwich, Bexley and Bromley. Supporters played a key role in the return of the club to The Valley in 1992 and were rewarded by being granted a voice on the board in the form of an elected supporter director.  Any season ticket holder could put themselves forward for election, with a certain number of nominations, and votes were cast by all season ticket holders over the age of 18. The last such director, Ben Hayes,&lt;ref name=ForumHistory&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which met for the first time in December 2008 and is still active to this day.&lt;ref name=ForumHistory/&gt;

==Nicknames==

Charlton's most common nickname is The Addicks. The most likely origin of this name is from a local fishmonger, Arthur &quot;Ikey&quot; Bryan, who rewarded the team with meals of haddock and chips.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton 2001, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

The progression of the nickname can be seen in the book ''The Addicks Cartoons: An Affectionate Look into the Early History of Charlton Athletic'', which covers the pre-First World War history of Charlton through a narrative based on 56 cartoons which appeared in the now defunct Kentish Independent. The very first cartoon, from 31 October 1908, calls the team the Haddocks. By 1910, the name had changed to Addicks although it also appeared as Haddick. The club also have two other nicknames, The Red Robins, adopted in 1931, and The Valiants, chosen in a fan competition in the 1960s which also led to the adoption of the sword badge which is still in use. The Addicks nickname never went away and was revived by fans after the club lost its Valley home in 1985 and went into exile at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. It is now once again the official nickname of the club.

Charlton fans' chants have included &quot;Valley, Floyd Road&quot;, a song noting the stadium's address to the tune of &quot;[[Mull of Kintyre (song)|Mull of Kintyre]]&quot;, and &quot;[[When the Red, Red Robin (Comes Bob, Bob, Bobbin' Along)|The Red, Red Robin]]&quot;

==Colours and crest==
[[File:Greenwich arms.png|thumb|100px|Crest of the former [[Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich]] Council, used by Charlton briefly in late 1940s and early 1950s]]Charlton have used a number of crests and badges during their history, although the current design has not been changed since 1968. The first known badge, from the 1930s, consisted of the letters CAF in the shape of a [[clubs (suit)|club]] from a pack of cards. In the 1940s, Charlton used a design featuring a [[European robin|robin]] sitting in a football within a shield, sometimes with the letters CAFC in the four-quarters of the shield, which was worn for the [[1946 FA Cup Final]]. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the crest of the former metropolitan borough of Greenwich was used as a symbol for the club but this was not used on the team's shirts.&lt;ref name = &quot;CrestHistory&quot;/&gt;

In 1963, a competition was held to find a new badge for the club, and the winning entry was a hand holding a sword, which complied with Charlton's nickname of the time, the Valiants.&lt;ref name = &quot;CrestHistory&quot;/&gt; Over the next five years modifications were made to this design, such as the addition of a circle surrounding the hand and sword and including the club's name in the badge. By 1968, the design had reached the one known today, and has been used continuously from this year, apart from a period in the 1970s when just the letters CAFC appeared on the team's shirts.&lt;ref name=&quot;CrestHistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web

With the exception of one season, Charlton have always played in red and white. The colours had been chosen by the group of boys who had founded Charlton Athletic in 1905 after having to play their first matches in the borrowed kits of their local rivals Woolwich Arsenal, who also played in red and white.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton 2001, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; The exception came during the 1923–24 season when Charlton wore the colours of Catford Southend as part of the proposed move to Catford, which were light and dark blue stripes.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton 2001, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the move fell through, Charlton returned to wearing red and white as their home colours.

==Rivalries==
{{Main|South London derby}}
[[File:CharltonMillwall2017.JPG|right|thumb|230x230px|Charlton and [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] pay tribute to [[Graham Taylor]] at [[The Valley (London)|The Valley]] in January 2017.]]Charlton's main rivals are [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].

===Crystal Palace===
The rivalry with Crystal Palace grew substantially in the mid-1980s, when the Addicks left their traditional home at [[The Valley (London)|The Valley]] because of safety concerns and played their home fixtures at The Eagles' [[Selhurst Park]] stadium. The ground-sharing arrangement – although seen by Crystal Palace chairman [[Ron Noades]] as essential for the future of football – was unpopular with both sets of fans. Indeed, the Charlton fans campaigned for a return to The Valley throughout the club's time at Selhurst Park.

Charlton left Selhurst Park in 1991, and the rivalry between the teams once again returned to a nominal level until two incidents 14 years later:

In 2005, having already lost 1–0 to Charlton at Selhurst Park earlier in the season, Palace were relegated at The Valley after a 2–2 draw. After the match there was a well publicised altercation between the two chairmen [[Richard Murray (businessman)|Richard Murray]] and [[Simon Jordan]], which only served to renew old hostilities between the fans.

===Millwall===
The rivalry began when Millwall moved south of the river in 1910 to The Den in [[New Cross]], [[South London|South East London]] situated fewer than four miles from The Valley. Matches between the two sides are always fiercely contested.
