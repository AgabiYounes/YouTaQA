==Medical uses==
Ciprofloxacin is used to treat a wide variety of infections, including infections of bones and joints, [[endocarditis]], [[gastroenteritis]], [[malignant otitis externa]], [[respiratory tract infections]], [[cellulitis]], [[urinary tract infections]], [[prostatitis]], [[anthrax]], and [[chancroid]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt;

Ciprofloxacin only treats bacterial infections; it does not treat viral infections such as the [[common cold]]. For certain uses including acute sinusitis, lower respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated [[gonorrhea]], ciprofloxacin is not considered a first-line agent.

Ciprofloxacin occupies an important role in treatment guidelines issued by major medical societies for the treatment of serious infections, especially those likely to be caused by Gram-negative bacteria, including ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''.  For example, ciprofloxacin in combination with [[metronidazole]] is one of several first-line antibiotic regimens recommended by the [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] for the treatment of community-acquired abdominal infections in adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Solomkin JS, Mazuski JE, Bradley JS, Rodvold KA, Goldstein EJ, Baron EJ, O'Neill PJ, Chow AW, Dellinger EP, Eachempati SR, Gorbach S, Hilfiker M, May AK, Nathens AB, Sawyer RG, Bartlett JG | title = Diagnosis and management of complicated intra-abdominal infection in adults and children: guidelines by the Surgical Infection Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 50 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–64 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20034345 | doi = 10.1086/649554 | authorlink11 = Sherwood Gorbach }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also features prominently in treatment guidelines for acute pyelonephritis, complicated or hospital-acquired urinary tract infection, acute or chronic prostatitis,&lt;ref name=uroweb2013&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Grabe M, Bjerklund-Johansen TE, Botto H, Çek M, Naber KG, Pickard RS, Tenke P, Wagenlehner F, Wullt B | title = Guidelines on Urological Infections | publisher = European Association of Urology |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131231000606/http://www.uroweb.org/gls/pdf/18_Urological%20infections_LR.pdf | archive-date=31 December 2013 |date=2013 |url=http://www.uroweb.org/gls/pdf/18_Urological%20infections_LR.pdf |url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; certain types of endocarditis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baddour LM, Wilson WR, Bayer AS, Fowler VG, Bolger AF, Levison ME, Ferrieri P, Gerber MA, Tani LY, Gewitz MH, Tong DC, Steckelberg JM, Baltimore RS, Shulman ST, Burns JC, Falace DA, Newburger JW, Pallasch TJ, Takahashi M, Taubert KA | display-authors = 6 | title = Infective endocarditis: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Committee on Rheumatic Fever, Endocarditis, and Kawasaki Disease, Council on Cardiovascular Disease in the Young, and the Councils on Clinical Cardiology, Stroke, and Cardiovascular Surgery and Anesthesia, American Heart Association: endorsed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America | journal = Circulation | volume = 111 | issue = 23 | pages = e394–434 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15956145 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.165564 | author23 = Councils on Clinical Cardiology, Stroke, and Cardiovascular Surgery and Anesthesia | author22 = Council on Cardiovascular Disease in the Young | author21 = Committee on Rheumatic Fever, Endocarditis, and Kawasaki Disease | author25 = Infectious Diseases Society of America | author24 = American Heart Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; certain skin infections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stevens DL, Bisno AL, Chambers HF, Everett ED, Dellinger P, Goldstein EJ, Gorbach SL, Hirschmann JV, Kaplan EL, Montoya JG, Wade JC | title = Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft-tissue infections | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 41 | issue = 10 | pages = 1373–406 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16231249 | doi = 10.1086/497143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and prosthetic joint infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Osmon DR, Berbari EF, Berendt AR, Lew D, Zimmerli W, Steckelberg JM, Rao N, Hanssen A, Wilson WR | title = Diagnosis and management of prosthetic joint infection: clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 56 | issue = 1 | pages = e1–e25 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23223583 | doi = 10.1093/cid/cis803 | author10 = Infectious Diseases Society of America. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases, treatment guidelines  are more restrictive, recommending in most cases that older, narrower-spectrum drugs be used as first-line therapy for less severe infections to minimize fluoroquinolone-resistance development. For example, the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends the use of ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones in urinary tract infections be reserved to cases of proven or expected resistance to narrower-spectrum drugs such as [[nitrofurantoin]] or [[trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gupta K, Hooton TM, Naber KG, Wullt B, Colgan R, Miller LG, Moran GJ, Nicolle LE, Raz R, Schaeffer AJ, Soper DE | title = International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis in women: A 2010 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 52 | issue = 5 | pages = e103–20 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21292654 | doi = 10.1093/cid/ciq257 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Association of Urology]] recommends ciprofloxacin as an alternative regimen for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, but cautions that the potential for &quot;adverse events have to be considered&quot;.&lt;ref name=uroweb2013/&gt;

Although approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of respiratory infections, ciprofloxacin is not recommended for respiratory infections by most treatment guidelines due in part to its modest activity against the common respiratory pathogen ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]''.&lt;ref name=cfaeocb&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoogkamp-Korstanje JA, Klein SJ | title = Ciprofloxacin in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis | journal = The Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 407–13 | date = September 1986 | pmid = 3490468 | doi = 10.1093/jac/18.3.407 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vardakas KZ, Siempos II, Grammatikos A, Athanassa Z, Korbila IP, Falagas ME | title = Respiratory fluoroquinolones for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials | journal = CMAJ | volume = 179 | issue = 12 | pages = 1269–77 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19047608 | pmc = 2585120 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.080358 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8019264&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Donaldson PM, Pallett AP, Carroll MP | title = Ciprofloxacin in general practice | journal = BMJ | volume = 308 | issue = 6941 | pages = 1437 | date = May 1994 | pmid = 8019264 | pmc = 2540361 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.308.6941.1437 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;Respiratory quinolones&quot; such as [[levofloxacin]], having greater activity against this pathogen, are recommended as first line agents for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in patients with important co-morbidities and in patients requiring hospitalization (Infectious Diseases Society of America 2007).

===Children===
Oral and intravenous ciprofloxacin are approved by the FDA for use in children for only two indications due to the risk of permanent injury to the musculoskeletal system:

1) Inhalational [[anthrax]] (postexposure)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2000/20780S08ltr.pdf |title=Cipro Labeling Revision Letter 08/30/2000 Supplement 008 New or Modified Indication |author=Dianne Murphy |publisher=U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) |date=30 August 2000 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018202604/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2000/20780S08ltr.pdf |archive-date=18 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contraindications==
Contraindications include:&lt;ref name=&quot;accessdata.fda.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Cipro Labeling Revision 02/25/2011 Supplement 075 |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2011/019537s075,020780s033lbl.pdf |publisher=U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) |date=25 February 2011 |access-date=1 April 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017230816/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2011/019537s075,020780s033lbl.pdf |archive-date=17 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tendon problems===
Ciprofloxacin includes a [[Boxed warning|black box warning]] in the United States due to an increased risk of [[tendinitis]] and tendon rupture, especially in people who are older than 60 years, people who also use corticosteroids, and people with kidney, lung, or heart transplants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stephenson AL, Wu W, Cortes D, Rochon PA |title=Tendon Injury and Fluoroquinolone Use: A Systematic Review |journal=Drug Saf |volume=36 |issue=9 |pages=709–21 |date=September 2013 |pmid=23888427 |doi=10.1007/s40264-013-0089-8 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tendon rupture can occur during therapy or even months after discontinuation of the medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Saint F, Gueguen G, Biserte J, Fontaine C, Mazeman E | title = [Rupture of the patellar ligament one month after treatment with fluoroquinolone] | language = French | journal = Revue de Chirurgie Orthopedique et Reparatrice de l'Appareil Moteur | volume = 86 | issue = 5 | pages = 495–7 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 10970974 | url = http://www.masson.fr/masson/MDOI-RCO-09-2000-86-5-0035-1040-101019-ART7 | trans-title = Rupture of the patellar ligament one month after treatment with fluoroquinolone }}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that fluoroquinolone use was associated with a 1.9-fold increase in tendon problems.

===Cardiac arrhythmia===
The fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, are associated with an increased risk of cardiac toxicity, including [[QT interval]] prolongation, [[torsades de pointes]], ventricular arrhythmia, and [[sudden cardiac death|sudden death]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gorelik E, Masarwa R, Perlman A, Rotshild V, Abbasi M, Muszkat M, Matok I |title=Fluoroquinolones and Cardiovascular Risk: A Systematic Review, Meta-analysis and Network Meta-analysis |journal=Drug Saf |volume= 42|issue= 4|pages= 529–538|date=October 2018 |pmid=30368737 |doi=10.1007/s40264-018-0751-2 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liu X, Ma J, Huang L, Zhu W, Yuan P, Wan R, Hong K |title=Fluoroquinolones increase the risk of serious arrhythmias: A systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Medicine (Baltimore) |volume=96 |issue=44 |pages=e8273 |date=November 2017 |pmid=29095256 |pmc=5682775 |doi=10.1097/MD.0000000000008273 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nervous system===
The 2013 FDA label warns of nervous system effects. Ciprofloxacin, like other fluoroquinolones, is known to trigger seizures or lower the seizure threshold, and may cause other central nervous system adverse effects. Headache, dizziness, and insomnia have been reported as occurring fairly commonly in postapproval review articles, along with a much lower incidence of serious CNS adverse effects such as tremors, psychosis, anxiety, hallucinations, paranoia, and suicide attempts, especially at higher doses.&lt;ref name=He2013/&gt; Like other fluoroquinolones, it is also known to cause peripheral neuropathy that may be irreversible, such as weakness, burning pain, tingling or numbness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm365050.htm |title=FDA Drug Safety Communication: FDA requires label changes to warn of risk for possibly permanent nerve damage from antibacterial fluoroquinolone drugs taken by mouth or by injection |publisher=U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528231716/https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm365050.htm |archive-date=28 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer===
Ciprofloxacin is active in six of eight ''in vitro'' assays used as rapid screens for the detection of genotoxic effects, but is not active in ''in vivo'' assays of genotoxicity.&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt; Long-term carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice resulted in no carcinogenic or tumorigenic effects due to ciprofloxacin at daily oral dose levels up to 250 and 750&amp;nbsp;mg/kg to rats and mice, respectively (about 1.7 and 2.5 times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon mg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Results from photo co-carcinogenicity testing indicate ciprofloxacin does not reduce the time to appearance of UV-induced skin tumors as compared to vehicle control.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Other===
The other black box warning is that ciprofloxacin should not be used in people with [[myasthenia gravis]] due to possible exacerbation of muscle weakness which may lead to breathing problems resulting in death or ventilator support. Fluoroquinolones are known to block neuromuscular transmission.&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt; There are concerns that fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin can affect cartilage in young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2011/019537s074,020780s032lbl.pdf |title=CIPRO (ciprofloxacin hydrochloride) TABLETS |website=U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) |access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment of overdose includes emptying of the stomach by induced vomiting or [[gastric lavage]], as well as administration of antacids containing magnesium, aluminum, or calcium to reduce drug absorption. Renal function and urinary pH should be monitored. Important support includes adequate hydration and urine acidification if necessary to prevent crystalluria. [[Hemodialysis]] or [[peritoneal dialysis]] can only remove less than 10% of ciprofloxacin.&lt;ref name=&quot;FDA 81532304, R.1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Cipro Labeling Revision 04/06/2009 Supplement 073 |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/019537s073,020780s030lbl.pdf |publisher=U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) |date=6 April 2009 |access-date=8 September 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705053513/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/019537s073,020780s030lbl.pdf |archive-date=5 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ciprofloxacin may be quantified in plasma or serum to monitor for drug accumulation in patients with hepatic dysfunction or to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in acute overdose victims.&lt;ref&gt;R.

== Interactions ==

Ciprofloxacin interacts with certain foods and several other drugs leading to undesirable increases or decreases in the serum levels or distribution of one or both drugs.

Ciprofloxacin should not be taken with antacids containing magnesium or aluminum, highly buffered drugs ([[sevelamer]], [[lanthanum carbonate]], [[sucralfate]], [[didanosine]]), or with supplements containing calcium, iron, or zinc. It should be taken two hours before or six hours after these products. Magnesium or aluminum antacids turn ciprofloxacin into insoluble salts that are not readily absorbed by the intestinal tract, reducing peak serum concentrations by 90% or more, leading to therapeutic failure. Additionally, it should not be taken with dairy products or calcium-fortified juices alone, as peak serum concentration and the area under the serum concentration-time curve can be reduced up to 40%. However, ciprofloxacin may be taken with dairy products or calcium-fortified juices as part of a meal.&lt;ref name=&quot;FDA 81532304, R.1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rodvold KA, Piscitelli SC | title = New oral macrolide and fluoroquinolone antibiotics: an overview of pharmacokinetics, interactions, and safety | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 17 Suppl 1 | pages = S192–9 | date = August 1993 | pmid = 8399914 | doi = 10.1093/clinids/17.supplement_1.s192 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bolhuis MS, Panday PN, Pranger AD, Kosterink JG, Alffenaar JW 2011 865–913&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bolhuis MS, Panday PN, Pranger AD, Kosterink JG, Alffenaar JW | title = Pharmacokinetic drug interactions of antimicrobial drugs: a systematic review on oxazolidinones, rifamycines, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and Beta-lactams | journal = Pharmaceutics | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 865–913 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 24309312 | pmc = 3857062 | doi = 10.3390/pharmaceutics3040865 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ciprofloxacin inhibits the drug-metabolizing enzyme [[CYP1A2]] and thereby can reduce the clearance of drugs metabolized by that enzyme. CYP1A2 substrates that exhibit increased serum levels in ciprofloxacin-treated patients include [[tizanidine]], [[theophylline]], [[caffeine]], [[methylxanthines]], [[clozapine]], [[olanzapine]], and [[ropinirole]]. Co-administration of ciprofloxacin with the CYP1A2 substrate tizanidine (Zanaflex) is contraindicated due to a 583% increase in the peak serum concentrations of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin as compared to administration of tizanidine alone. Use of ciprofloxacin is cautioned in patients on theophylline due to its narrow therapeutic index. The authors of one review recommended that patients being treated with ciprofloxacin reduce their caffeine intake. Evidence for significant interactions with several other CYP1A2 substrates such as [[cyclosporine]] is equivocal or conflicting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bolhuis MS, Panday PN, Pranger AD, Kosterink JG, Alffenaar JW 2011 865–913&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=ctcos/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Janknegt R | title = Drug interactions with quinolones | journal = The Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy | volume = 26 Suppl D | pages = 7–29 | date = November 1990 | pmid = 2286594 | doi = 10.1093/jac/26.suppl_D.7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
Ciprofloxacin is a [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]] of the [[Quinolone antibiotic|fluoroquinolone]] class. It is active against some [[Gram-positive]] and many [[Gram-negative]] bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=First aid for the USMLE step 2 CK |url=https://archive.org/details/firstaidcasesfor00taol |url-access=registration |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |isbn=9780071487955 |edition=6th |date=June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It functions by inhibiting [[DNA gyrase]], and a type II [[topoisomerase]], topoisomerase IV,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Drlica K, Zhao X | title = DNA gyrase, topoisomerase IV, and the 4-quinolones | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 377–92 | date = September 1997 | pmid = 9293187 | pmc = 232616 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pommier Y, Leo E, Zhang H, Marchand C | title = DNA topoisomerases and their poisoning by anticancer and antibacterial drugs | journal = Chemistry &amp; Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 421–33 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20534341 | doi = 10.1016/j.chembiol.2010.04.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; necessary to separate bacterial DNA, thereby inhibiting cell division.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Ciprofloxacin for systemic administration is available as immediate-release tablets, extended-release tablets, an oral suspension, and as a solution for intravenous administration. When administered over one hour as an intravenous infusion,&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt; ciprofloxacin rapidly distributes into the tissues, with levels in some tissues exceeding those in the serum.  Penetration into the central nervous system is relatively modest, with cerebrospinal fluid levels normally less than 10% of peak serum concentrations.  The serum half-life of ciprofloxacin is about 4–6 hours, with 50-70% of an administered dose being excreted in the urine as unmetabolized drug. An additional 10% is excreted in urine as metabolites.  Urinary excretion is virtually complete 24 hours after administration. Dose adjustment is required in the elderly and in those with renal impairment.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Ciprofloxacin is weakly bound to serum proteins (20-40%), but is an inhibitor of the drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 1A2, which leads to the potential for clinically important drug interactions with drugs metabolized by that enzyme.{{medical citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Ciprofloxacin is about 70% orally available when administered orally, so a slightly higher dose is needed to achieve the same exposure when switching from IV to oral administration&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt;

The extended release oral tablets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2003/21554_ciproXR_lbl.pdf|title=Cipro XR Prescribing Information|publisher=U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230232923/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2003/21554_ciproXR_lbl.pdf|archive-date=30 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; allow once-daily administration by releasing the drug more slowly in the gastrointestinal tract. These tablets contain 35% of the administered dose in an immediate-release form and 65% in a slow-release matrix.  Maximum serum concentrations are achieved between 1 and 4 hours after administration. Compared to the 250- and 500-mg immediate-release tablets, the 500-mg and 1000-mg XR tablets provide higher C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, but the 24‑hour AUCs are equivalent.

Ciprofloxacin immediate-release tablets contain ciprofloxacin as the hydrochloride salt, and the XR tablets contain a mixture of the hydrochloride salt as the free base.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==History==
[[File:Cipro 250 mg.JPG|thumb|Ciprofloxacin 250-mg tablets from Ukraine]]
The first members of the quinolone antibacterial class were relatively low-potency drugs such as [[nalidixic acid]], used mainly in the treatment of urinary tract infections owing to their renal excretion and propensity to be concentrated in urine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mayrer AR, Andriole VT | title = Urinary tract antiseptics | journal = The Medical Clinics of North America | volume = 66 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–208 | date = January 1982 | pmid = 7038329 | doi = 10.1016/s0025-7125(16)31453-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1979, the publication of a patent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US4146719?dq=4146719|title=Patent US4146719 - Piperazinyl derivatives of quinoline carboxylic acids - Google Patents|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; filed by the pharmaceutical arm of Kyorin Seiyaku Kabushiki Kaisha disclosed the discovery of [[norfloxacin]], and the demonstration that certain structural modifications including the attachment of a fluorine atom to the quinolone ring leads to dramatically enhanced antibacterial potency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khan MY, Gruninger RP, Nelson SM, Klicker RE | title = Comparative in vitro activity of norfloxacin (MK-0366) and ten other oral antimicrobial agents against urinary bacterial isolates | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 848–51 | date = May 1982 | pmid = 6213200 | pmc = 182027 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.21.5.848 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the aftermath of this disclosure, several other pharmaceutical companies initiated research and development programs with the goal of discovering additional antibacterial agents of the fluoroquinolone class.

The fluoroquinolone program at [[Bayer]] focused on examining the effects of very minor changes to the norfloxacin structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US4547503?dq=US+4547503|title=Patent US4547503 - 1-Cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-[4-(oxo-alkyl)-1-piperazinyl ... - Google Patents|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US4544658?pg=PA1&amp;dq=US+4544658|title=Patent US4544658 - 1-Cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-(alkyl-1-piperazinyl)quinoline-3 ... - Google Patents|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1983, the company published ''in vitro'' potency data for ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibacterial having a chemical structure differing from that of norfloxacin by the presence of a single carbon atom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wise R, Andrews JM, Edwards LJ | title = In vitro activity of Bay 09867, a new quinoline derivative, compared with those of other antimicrobial agents | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 559–64 | date = April 1983 | pmid = 6222695 | pmc = 184701 | doi = 10.1128/aac.23.4.559 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This small change led to a two- to 10-fold increase in potency against most strains of Gram-negative bacteria.  Importantly, this structural change led to a four-fold improvement in activity against the important [[Gram-negative]] pathogen ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', making ciprofloxacin one of the most potent known drugs for the treatment of this intrinsically antibiotic-resistant pathogen.{{Medical citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Cost===
It is available as a generic medication and not very expensive.&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ric2014/&gt; Wholesale it costs between {{US$}}0.03 and {{US$}}0.13 a dose.&lt;ref name=ERC2015/&gt; In the United States it is sold for about {{US$}}0.40 per dose.&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt;

===Generic equivalents===
On 24 October 2001, the Prescription Access Litigation (PAL) project filed suit to dissolve an agreement between Bayer and three of its competitors which produced [[Generic drugs|generic versions of drugs]] ([[Barr Pharmaceuticals|Barr Laboratories]], [[Actavis|Rugby Laboratories]], and [[Marion Merrell Dow|Hoechst-Marion-Roussel]]) that PAL claimed was blocking access to adequate supplies and cheaper, generic versions of ciprofloxacin. The plaintiffs charged that Bayer Corporation, a unit of Bayer AG, had unlawfully paid the three competing companies a total of $200 million to prevent cheaper, generic versions of ciprofloxacin from being brought to the market, as well as manipulating its price and supply. Numerous other consumer advocacy groups joined the lawsuit. On 15 October 2008, five years after Bayer's patent had expired, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York granted Bayer's and the other defendants' motion for summary judgment, holding that any anticompetitive effects caused by the settlement agreements between Bayer and its codefendants were within the exclusionary zone of the patent and thus could not be redressed by federal antitrust law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit |title=United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit |url=http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/08-1097.pdf |location=USA |year=2008 |access-date=4 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827080527/http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/08-1097.pdf |archive-date=27 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in effect upholding Bayer's agreement with its competitors.
