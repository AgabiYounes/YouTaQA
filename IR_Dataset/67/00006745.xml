'''Couscous''' ([[Berbers|Berber]] : ⵙⴽⵙⵓ ''seksu,'' {{Lang-ar|كُسْكُس}} ''{{transl|ar|kuskus}}'') originated as a [[Maghreb]]i dish of small (about &lt;small&gt;{{Convert|3|mm|}} diameter&lt;/small&gt;) [[steaming|steamed]] balls of crushed [[durum wheat]] [[semolina]]&lt;ref name=&quot;notpasta&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/health/23recipehealth.html |title=Couscous: Just Don't Call It Pasta |newspaper=The New York Times |date=23 February 2009 |last=Shulman |first=Martha Rose |accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is traditionally served with a [[stew]] spooned on top. [[Pearl millet]] and [[sorghum]], especially in the [[Sahel]], and other cereals can be cooked in a similar way and the resulting dishes are also sometimes called couscous.&lt;ref name=&quot;milletCC&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=J.R.N. |last2=Barrion |first2=S.C. |last3=Rooney |first3=L.W. |title=Pearl Millet--New Developments in Ancient Food Grain |journal=Cereal Foods World |year=2010 |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=16–19 |doi=10.1094/CFW-55-1-0016 |url=https://www.aaccnet.org/publications/plexus/cfw/pastissues/2010/Documents/CFW-55-1-0016.pdf |accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}}&lt;ref name=&quot;codex&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Codex Standards for Couscous: 202-1995 |url=http://www.fao.org/input/download/standards |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pearl or Israeli couscous, properly known as [[ptitim]], is a type of [[pasta]].

== Etymology ==
The original name may be derived from the [[Berber languages|Berber]] ''seksu'', meaning &quot;well rolled&quot;, &quot;well formed&quot;, or &quot;rounded&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://centrederechercheberbere.fr/tl_files/doc-pdf/couscous.pdf |title=Couscous : sur l’étymologie du mot.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous different names and pronunciations for couscous exist around the world. Couscous is {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ʊ|s|k|ʊ|s}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|uː|s|k|uː|s}} in the United Kingdom and only the latter in the United States. It is sometimes pronounced ''kuskusi'' ({{lang|ar|كسكسي}}) in Arabic, while it is also known in [[Morocco]] as ''seksu''; ''kesksu'' or ({{lang|ar|كسكسي}}) ; in [[Algeria]] as ''kosksi'' or as ''ṭa`ām'' ({{lang|ar|طعام}}, literally meaning &quot;food&quot;); in [[Tunisia]] and [[Libya]] ''kosksi'' or ''kuseksi'', in [[Egypt]] ''kuskusi'' ({{lang|ar|كسكسي}}), in [[Israel]] it is known as ({{lang|he|קוסקוס}}), or ''kuskus'', in [[Sicilian language|Sicily]] ''cuscusu'' and ''keskes'' in [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;foucauld&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Foucauld |first1=Charles de |title=Dictionnaire touareg-français : dialecte de l'Ahaggar |date=1950–1952 |publisher=Impr. nationale de France |location=Paris |url=https://archive.org/details/DictionnaireTouareg-francaisDialecteDeLAhaggar |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|919}}

== Origin and history ==
The origin of couscous appears to be in the region from eastern to northern Africa where [[Berbers]] used it as early as the 7th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;mwn&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2012/06/46130/moroccan-couscous-and-tagine/ |title=Moroccan Couscous and Tagine |author=Mustafa Ettoualy |publisher=Moroccan World News |date=29 June 2012 |accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;efc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Couscous |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/sports-and-everyday-life/food-and-drink/food-and-cooking/couscous |work=Encyclopedia of Food and Culture | publisher= The Gale Group Inc. |accessdate=23 January 2018 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognized as a traditional North African delicacy, it is a common [[cuisine]] component among [[Maghreb]] countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;mwn&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;efc&quot; /&gt;

[[Ibn Battuta]] (b. Morocco, 1304–1368? AD) stated in his ''Rihlah'' (Travels), indicating what may be the earliest mention of couscous (kuskusu) in West Africa from the early 1350s:
{{Quote|text=When the traveler arrives in a village the women of the blacks come with ''anlî'' and milk and chickens and flour of ''nabaq'' [lotus], rice, and ''fûnî'' [[fonio]] [a type of [[millet]]], this is like the grain of mustard and from it ''kuskusu'' and porridge are made, and bean flour. He buys from them what he likes, but not rice, as eating the rice is harmful to white men and the fûnî is better than it.&lt;ref name=&quot;hamdun&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hamdun |first1=Said |editor1-last=King |editor1-first=Noel Quinton |title=Ibn Battuta in Black Africa |date=1975 |publisher=Collings |location=London |isbn=978-0-901720-57-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32}}}}

== Preparation ==
[[File:Tunisian brown couscous with vegetables.JPG|thumb|Brown couscous with vegetables in Tunisia]]
Couscous is traditionally made from the hard part of the durum, the part of the grain that resisted the grinding of the millstone. The semolina is sprinkled with water and rolled with the hands to form small pellets, sprinkled with dry flour to keep them separate, and then sieved. Any pellets that are too small to be finished granules of couscous fall through the sieve and are again rolled and sprinkled with dry semolina and rolled into pellets. This labor-intensive process continues until all the semolina has been formed into tiny granules of couscous. In the traditional method of preparing couscous, groups of women come together to make large batches over several days, which were then dried in the sun and used for several months. Handmade couscous may need to be re-hydrated as it is prepared; this is achieved by a process of moistening and steaming over stew until the couscous reaches the desired light and fluffy consistency.&lt;ref name=&quot;asbell&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Chronicle Books |isbn=978-1-4521-0042-5 |last=Asbell |first=Robin |title=The New Whole Grain Cookbook: Terrific Recipes Using Farro, Quinoa, Brown Rice, Barley, and Many Other Delicious and Nutritious Grains |date=2011-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some regions couscous is made from [[Farina (food)|farina]] or coarsely ground [[barley]] or [[pearl millet]]. In [[Brazil]], the traditional couscous is made from [[cornmeal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Receitas |url=http://revistagloborural.globo.com/GloboRural/0,6993,EEC533123-1488-4,00.html |website=revistagloborural.globo.com |accessdate=9 August 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129120634/http://revistagloborural.globo.com/GloboRural/0%2C6993%2CEEC533123-1488-4%2C00.html |archivedate=January 29, 2008 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Couscoussier.jpg|150px|thumb|A ''kiskas'' (French: ''[[couscoussier]]''), a traditional steamer for couscous.]]
In modern times, couscous production is largely mechanized, and the product is sold in markets around the world. This couscous can be sauteed before it is cooked in water or another liquid.&lt;ref name=&quot;asbell&quot; /&gt; Properly cooked couscous is light and fluffy, not gummy or gritty. Traditionally, North Africans use a [[food steamer]] (called a''taseksut'' in [[Berber language|Berber]], a {{lang|ar|كِسْكَاس}} ''kiskas'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] or a ''[[couscoussier]]'' in [[French language|French]]). The base is a tall metal pot shaped rather like an oil jar in which the meat and vegetables are cooked as a stew. On top of the base, a steamer sits where the couscous is cooked, absorbing the flavours from the stew. The lid to the steamer has holes around its edge so steam can escape. It is also possible to use a pot with a steamer insert. If the holes are too big, the steamer can be lined with damp [[cheesecloth]]. There is little [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence of early diets including couscous, possibly because the original ''couscoussier'' was probably made from organic materials that could not survive extended exposure to the elements.

== Instant couscous ==
The couscous that is sold in most [[Western culture|Western]] supermarkets has been pre-steamed and dried. It is typically prepared by adding 1.5 measures of boiling water or stock to each measure of couscous then leaving covered tightly for about five minutes. Pre-steamed couscous takes less time to prepare than regular couscous, most dried [[pasta]], or dried grains (such as [[rice]]).

== Local variations ==
[[File:MoroccanCouscous.jpg|thumb|Couscous with various toppings]]
[[File:Fish couscous from Kerkenah, Tunisia, August 16th, 2007.jpg|thumb|Fish couscous in [[Trapani]]]]

=== Algeria and Morocco ===

In Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya, couscous is generally served with vegetables ([[carrot]]s, [[potato]]es, and [[turnip]]s) cooked in a spicy or mild [[broth]] or stew, and some meat (generally, [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[lamb and mutton|lamb]] or [[lamb and mutton|mutton]]). In Algeria and Morocco it may be served at the end of a meal or by itself in a dish called ''&quot;sfouff&quot;''. The couscous is usually steamed several times until it is fluffy and pale in color. It is then sprinkled with [[almond]]s, [[cinnamon]] and [[sugar]]. Traditionally, this dessert is served with milk perfumed with [[orange flower water]], or it can be served plain with [[buttermilk]] in a bowl as a cold light soup for supper. Moroccan couscous uses saffron. Algerian couscous includes tomatoes and a variety of legumes and vegetables, Saharan couscous is served without legumes and without broth.&lt;ref name=efc /&gt;

=== Tunisia ===
In Tunisia, it is made mostly spicy with [[harissa]] sauce and served commonly with any dish, including lamb, fish, seafood, beef and sometimes in southern regions, camel. [[Fish as food|Fish]] couscous is a Tunisian specialty and can also be made with [[octopus as food|octopus]], [[squid as food|squid]] or other [[seafood]] in hot, red, spicy sauce.

=== Libya ===
In Libya, it is mostly served with meat, specifically mostly lamb, but also [[Camel#Food uses|camel]], and rarely beef, in Tripoli and the western parts of Libya, but not during official ceremonies or weddings. Another way to eat couscous is as a dessert; it is prepared with dates, sesame, and pure honey, and locally referred to as &quot;maghrood&quot;.

=== Israel ===
[[File:Stammtisch Augsburg 2016-11-20 im Picnic Israelischer Couscous.jpg|thumb|Israeli Couscous, also known as ptitim, served in a restaurant in Israel.]]

In Israel, and among members of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic Jewish]] communities in the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]], couscous is a common food. Couscous is not indigenous to the Eastern Mediterranean, and arrived in the region with the [[Aliyah|migration]] of Jews from North Africa to Israel in the 20th century. Since then it has become a very popular dish in the country, and it is a staple of the Sephardic community and people of all backgrounds.

In addition, Israelis of all backgrounds commonly eat [[ptitim]], also known as Israeli couscous, or pearl couscous, which is similar to regular couscous except it is larger like the [[Ashkenazi]] [[farfel]] or the Levantine maftoul (though ptitim does not contain bulgur unlike maftoul). Ptitim is a staple food and is very popular, especially with children, and is commonly served with butter or cooked with vegetables or chicken broth. However, it is prepared more similarly to [[pasta]] and is only boiled for a few minutes, and it is not steamed and fluffed like North African couscous. There are other shapes of ptitim, including a shape which resembled rice, which is also known as [[David Ben-Gurion|Ben Gurion]]’s rice, which was created in the 1950s after Israel's independence, as there was [[rationing]] and food shortages and rice was unavailable in the country.

[[File:Ptitim - Ben-Gurion rice.jpg|thumb|Israeli couscous shaped like rice, also known as Ben-Gurion's Rice, found in a local supermarket.]]

In addition to ptitim, there are many varieties of couscous that can be found throughout Israel. Among Israelis of Sephardic origin (whose families moved to Israel from North African countries), couscous is a very common food and is served at almost every meal, especially on holidays, special occasions and celebrations, as well as on [[Shabbat]] (Jewish sabbath), for their Friday night dinners. Many people make their own couscous by hand, but it is a very labor-intensive process. It is also common to buy instant couscous, and there are a large variety of brands and varieties for sale in Israel.

[[File:Kuskus-chacho.JPG|thumb|North African Jewish couscous being made by hand at a home in Netanya, Israel for Shabbat.]]

[[File:Couscous-7.JPG|thumb|Tunisian Jewish-style couscous served in Israel.]]

Different communities have different styles and sizes of couscous, similar to the differences in size and style between the couscous of the different cuisines of the Maghreb. [[Moroccan Jews|Moroccan Jewish]] couscous is larger, and is frequently prepared with aromatic spices and served with meat. [[History of the Jews in Algeria|Algerian Jewish]] couscous is smaller. The smallest is [[History of the Jews in Tunisia|Tunisian Jewish]] couscous, which is not much larger than grains of coarse sand. Tunisian Jewish couscous is often served with [[harissa]] or [[Zhug|shkug]], or cooked with vegetables such as carrots, zucchini, or potatoes and served with [[Cholent|chamin]], a North African Jewish beef stew similar to [[cholent]], that is often served for Shabbat. Couscous is also be prepared with cinnamon sticks, orange and other citrus peel, and aromatic spices for special occasions and celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/worldofjewishcoo00mark/page/245|title=The world of Jewish cooking|last=Marks, Gil.|first=|date=1996|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=0684824914|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/worldofjewishcoo00mark/page/245 245–248]|oclc=34690573}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not common to find sweet couscous or dessert couscous in Israel, as in Egypt and other countries.

=== Egypt ===
In Egypt, couscous is eaten more as a dessert. It is prepared with butter, sugar, cinnamon, raisins, and nuts and topped with cream.

=== Palestinian territories ===
[[File:Palestinian couscous.jpg|thumb|Maftoul, a Palestinian variety of couscous that is made with bulgur.]]
In the Palestinian community, North African style couscous is not consumed. The Palestinians instead prepare a dish called maftoul, which is also consumed in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan and is called mograhbieh. Maftoul can be considered to be a special type of couscous but made from different ingredients and a different shape. It is significantly larger than North African couscous, and is similar in size to Israeli couscous, but has a different preparation. Maffoul is similarly steamed as North African couscous and often served on special occasions in a chicken broth with garbanzo beans and tender pieces of chicken taken off the bone. Maftoul is an Arabic word derived from the root &quot;fa-ta-la&quot;, which means to roll or to twist, which is exactly describing the method used to make maftoul by hand rolling [[bulgur]] with wheat flour.&lt; Couscous may be used to make a breakfast [[tabbouleh]] salad. Though usually cooked it water, it can also be cooking in another liquid, like [[apple juice]], and served with [[dried fruit]] and [[honey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;asbell&quot; /&gt;

=== Levant ===

In the Levant (excluding Israel and the Palestinian territories) they consume a large type of couscous with bulgur at the center, similar to the Palestinian maftoul called mograhbieh, which is commonly served in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan as part of a stew or cooked in chicken broth with cinnamon, caraway and chickpeas.

=== Europe ===
Couscous is also consumed in France, where it is considered a traditional dish, and has also become common in Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece. Indeed, many polls have indicated that it is often a favorite dish.&lt;ref&gt;Study conducted on January 11 and 12, 2006, for the magazine ''Notre Temps'' based on face-to-face interviews with a sample of {{formatnum:1000}} people representative of the adult French population, stratified by age, sex, profession of the head of household, region and type of municipality.&lt;/ref&gt; In France, Spain and Italy, the word &quot;couscous&quot; (''cuscús'' in Catalan, Spanish and Italian; ''cuscuz'' in Portuguese) usually refers to couscous together with the stew. Packaged sets containing a box of quick-preparation couscous and a can of vegetables and, generally, meat are sold in French, Spanish and Italian [[grocery store]]s and [[supermarket]]s. In France, it is generally served with [[harissa]] sauce, a style inherited from the [[Tunisian cuisine]]. Indeed, couscous was voted as the third-favourite dish of [[France|French]] people in 2011 in a study by TNS Sofres for magazine ''Vie Pratique Gourmand'', and the first in the east of France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tns-sofres.com/points-de-vue/79A4BE8A098F4BBFA11B939A135302CA.aspx Les plats préférés des Français] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408173836/http://www.tns-sofres.com/points-de-vue/79A4BE8A098F4BBFA11B939A135302CA.aspx |date=April 8, 2012 }}, enquête réalisée en août 2011 pour le magazine Vie Pratique Gourmand auprès d'un échantillon national de {{formatnum:999}} personnes représentatif de l'ensemble de la population âgée de 18 ans et plus, interrogées en face à face.

=== West Africa ===
In the [[Sahel]]ian countries of West Africa, such as [[Mali]] and [[Senegal]], the equivalent of couscous is called [[Thieboudienne|''thiep'']], and it is made out of [[pearl millet]] pounded or milled to the size and consistency of couscous.&lt;ref&gt;Sivak MN.

Couscous is distinct from pasta, even pasta such as [[orzo]] and [[risoni]] of similar size, in that it is made from crushed durum wheat semolina, while pasta is made from ground wheat. Couscous and pasta have similar nutritional value, although pasta is usually more refined. Pasta is cooked by boiling and couscous is steamed.&lt;ref name=&quot;notpasta&quot; /&gt; [[Burghul]] or bulgur is a kind of parboiled dried cracked wheat of similar size to couscous, cooked by adding boiling water and leaving for a few minutes to soften.
