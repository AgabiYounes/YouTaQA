'''Chris Marker''' ({{IPA-fr|maʁkɛʁ|lang}}; 29 July 1921 – 29 July 2012) was a French writer, photographer, documentary film director, [[multimedia]] artist and [[Essay#Film|film essayist]]. His best known films are ''[[La Jetée]]'' (1962), ''[[A Grin Without a Cat]]'' (1977) and ''[[Sans Soleil]]'' (1983). Marker is usually associated with the [[Left Bank Cinema|Left Bank]] subset of the [[French New Wave]], that occurred in the late 1950s and 1960s, and included such other filmmakers as [[Alain Resnais]], [[Agnès Varda]] and [[Jacques Demy]].

His friend and sometime collaborator Alain Resnais called him &quot;the prototype of the twenty-first-century man.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot;&gt;Wakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 2. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1988. 649–654.&lt;/ref&gt; Film theorist Roy Armes has said of him: &quot;Marker is unclassifiable because he is unique...The French Cinema has its dramatists and its poets, its technicians, and its autobiographers, but only has one true essayist: Chris Marker.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot; /&gt;

==Early life==

Marker was born '''Christian François Bouche-Villeneuve'''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eai.org/artistBio.htm?id=317|title=''Chris Marker biography'' Electronic Arts Intermix|accessdate=Dec 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121123131/http://eai.org/artistBio.htm?id=317|archive-date=21 January 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was always elusive about his past and known to refuse interviews and not allow photographs to be taken of him; his place of birth is highly disputed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot; /&gt; Some sources and Marker himself claim that he was born in [[Ulaanbaatar]], Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, David, ''The New Biographical Dictionary of Film''{{spaced ndash}} Fourth Edition, Little, Brown (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources say he was born in [[Belleville, Paris]], and others, in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot; /&gt; The 1949 edition of ''Le Cœur Net'' gives his birthday as 22 July. Film critic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] has said, &quot;Marker told me himself that Mongolia is correct. I have since concluded that Belleville is correct—but that does not spoil the spiritual truth of Ulan Bator.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, David, The New Biographical Dictionary of Film{{spaced ndash}} Fifth Edition, Little, Brown (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about his secretive nature, Marker said, &quot;My films are enough for them [the audience].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot; /&gt;

Marker was a philosophy student in France before [[World War II]]. During the German occupation of France, he joined the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis (FTP)]], a part of the [[French Resistance]]. At some point during the war he left France and joined the [[United States Air Force]] as a paratrooper,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot; /&gt; although some sources claim that this is not true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chrismarker.org/2008/03/nyt-all-movie-guides-chris-marker-bio/ |title=NYT &amp; All Movie Guide’s Chris Marker Bio – Notes from the Era of Imperfect Memory |publisher=Chrismarker.org |date=29 July 1921 |accessdate=9 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819201105/http://www.chrismarker.org/2008/03/nyt-all-movie-guides-chris-marker-bio/ |archivedate=19 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, he began a career as a journalist, first writing for the journal ''[[Esprit (magazine)|Esprit]]'', a neo-Catholic, [[Marxist]] magazine where he met fellow journalist [[André Bazin]]. For ''Esprit'', Marker wrote political commentaries, poems, short stories, and (with Bazin) film reviews. He later became an early contributor to Bazin's ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot; /&gt;

During this period, Marker began to travel around the world as a journalist and photographer, a vocation he pursued for the rest of his life. The French publishing company [[Éditions du Seuil]] hired him as editor of the series ''Petite Planète'' (&quot;Small World&quot;). This collection devoted one edition to each country and included information and photographs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot; /&gt; In 1949 Marker published his first novel, ''Le Coeur net'' (''The Forthright Spirit''), which was about aviation. In 1952 Marker published an illustrated essay on French writer [[Jean Giraudoux]], ''Giraudoux Par Lui-Même''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot; /&gt;

==Early career (1950–1961)==

During his early journalism career, Marker became increasingly interested in filmmaking and in the early 1950s experimented with photography. Around this time Marker met and befriended many members of the [[Left Bank Cinema|Left Bank Film Movement]], including [[Alain Resnais]], [[Agnès Varda]], [[Henri Colpi]], [[Armand Gatti]], and the novelists [[Marguerite Duras]] and [[Jean Cayrol]]. This group is often associated with the [[French New Wave]] directors who came to prominence during the same time period, and the groups were often friends and journalistic co-workers. The term ''Left Bank'' was first coined by film critic [[Richard Roud]],&lt;ref name=hfa&gt;{{cite web|title=The Left Bank Revisited: Marker, Resnais, Varda|work=Harvard Film Archive|url=http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2000mayjun/leftbank.html|accessdate=16 August 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907190306/http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2000mayjun/leftbank.html|archive-date=7 September 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; who described them as having &quot;fondness for a kind of [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] life and an impatience with the conformity of the Right Bank, a high degree of involvement in literature and the [[plastic arts]], and a consequent interest in [[experimental film]]making&quot;, as well as an identification with the political [[left wing|left]].&lt;ref name=hfa/&gt; [[Anatole Dauman]] produced many of Marker's earliest films. 

In 1952 Marker made his first film, ''[[Olympia 52]]'', a 16mm feature documentary about the [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Helsinki Olympic Games]]. In 1953 he collaborated with Resnais on the documentary ''[[Statues Also Die]]''. The film examines traditional [[African art]] such as sculptures and masks, and its decline with coming of Western colonialism. It won the 1954 [[Prix Jean Vigo]], but was banned by French censors for its criticism of French colonialism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot; /&gt;

After working as assistant director on Resnais's ''[[Night and Fog (1955 film)|Night and Fog]]'' in 1955, Marker made ''Sunday in Peking'', a short documentary &quot;[[Essay#Film|film essay]]&quot; in the style that characterized Marker's output for most of his career. Marker shot the film in two weeks while traveling through China with Armand Gatti in September 1955. In the film, Marker's commentary overlaps scenes from China, such as tombs that, contrary to Westernized understandings of Chinese legends, do not contain the remains of [[Ming Dynasty]] emperors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot; /&gt;

After working on the commentary for Resnais's film ''Le mystère de l'atelier quinze'' in 1957, Marker continued to refine his style with the feature documentary ''Letter from Siberia''. An essay film on the narrativization of Siberia, it contains Marker's signature commentary, which takes the form of a letter from the director, in the long tradition of epistolary treatments by French explorers of the &quot;undeveloped&quot; world. ''Letter ''looks at Siberia's movement into the 20th century and at some of the tribal cultural practices receding into the past. It combines footage Marker shot in [[Siberia]] with old newsreel footage, cartoon sequences, stills, and even an illustration of [[Alfred E. Neuman]] from ''[[Mad Magazine]]'' as well as a fake TV commercial as part of a humorous attack on Western mass culture. In producing a meta-commentary on narrativity and film, Marker uses the same brief filmic sequence three times but with different commentary—the first praising the Soviet Union, the second denouncing it, and the third taking an apparently neutral or &quot;objective&quot; stance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot; /&gt;

In 1959 Marker made the animated film ''Les Astronautes'' with [[Walerian Borowczyk]]. The film was a combination of traditional drawings with still photography. In 1960 he made ''Description d'un combat'', a documentary on the [[Israel|State of Israel]] that reflects on its past and future.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot; /&gt; The film won the Golden Bear for Best Documentary at the [[11th Berlin International Film Festival|1961 Berlin Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preise &amp; Auszeichnungen 1961|date=|work=berlinale.de|url=http://www.berlinale.de/de/archiv/jahresarchive/1961/03_preistr_ger_1961/03_Preistraeger_1961.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1961, Marker traveled to Cuba and shot the film ''¡Cuba Sí!'' The film promotes and defends [[Fidel Castro]] and includes two interviews with him. It ends with an anti-American epilogue in which the United States is embarrassed by the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] fiasco, and was subsequently banned. The banned essay was included in Marker's first volume of collected film commentaries, ''Commentaires I'', published in 1961. The following year Marker published ''Coréennes'', a collection of photographs and essays on conditions in [[Korea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot; /&gt;

==''La Jetée'' and ''Le Joli Mai'' (1962–1966)==

Marker became known internationally for the short film ''[[La Jetée]]'' (''The Pier'') in 1962. It tells of a [[post-apocalyptic science fiction|post-nuclear war]] experiment in [[time travel]] by using a series of filmed photographs developed as a [[photomontage]] of varying pace, with limited narration and sound effects. In the film, a survivor of a futuristic third World War is obsessed with distant and disconnected memories of a pier at the [[Orly Airport]], the image of a mysterious woman, and a man's death. Scientists experimenting in time travel choose him for their studies, and the man travels back in time to contact the mysterious woman, and discovers that the man's death at the Orly Airport was his own. Except for one shot of the woman mentioned above sleeping and suddenly waking up, the film is composed entirely of photographs by Jean Chiabaud and stars Davos Hanich as the man, [[Hélène Chatelain]] as the woman and filmmaker [[William Klein (photographer)|William Klein]] as a man from the future.

''La Jetée'' was the inspiration for [[Mamoru Oshii]]'s 1987 debut live action feature ''[[The Red Spectacles]]'' (and later for parts of Oshii's 2001 film ''[[Avalon (2001 film)|Avalon]]'') and also inspired [[Terry Gilliam]]'s ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]'' (1995) and [[Jonás Cuarón]]'s ''[[Year of the Nail]]'' (2007). It also inspired many of [[Mira Nair]]'s shots in her 2006 film ''[[The Namesake (film)|The Namesake]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

While making ''La Jetée'', Marker was simultaneously making the 150-minute documentary essay-film ''[[Le joli mai]]'', released in 1963. Beginning in the spring of 1962, Marker and his camera operator Pierre Lhomme shot 55 hours of footage interviewing random people on the streets of Paris. The questions, asked by the unseen Marker, range from their personal lives, as well as social and political issues of relevance at that time. As he had with montages of landscapes and indigenous art, Marker created a film essay that contrasted and juxtaposeed a variety of lives with his signature commentary (spoken by Marker's friends, singer-actor [[Yves Montand]] in the French version and [[Simone Signoret]] in the English version). The film has been compared to the ''[[Cinéma vérité]]'' films of [[Jean Rouch]], and criticized by its practitioners at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot; /&gt; The term &quot;Cinéma vérité&quot; was itself anathema to Marker, who never used it. It was shown in competition at the 1963 [[Venice Film Festival]], where it won the award for Best First Work. It also won the Golden Dove Award at the Leipzig DOK Festival.

After the documentary ''Le Mystère Koumiko'' in 1965, Marker made ''Si j'avais quatre dromadaires'', an essay-film that, like ''La Jetée'', is a [[photomontage]] of over 800 photographs Marker had taken over the previous 10 years in 26 countries. The commentary involves a conversation between a fictitious photographer and two friends, who discuss the photos. The film's title is an allusion to a poem by [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]. It was the last film in which Marker included &quot;travel footage&quot; for many years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot; /&gt;

==SLON and ISKRA (1967–1974)==

In 1967 Marker published his second volume of collected film essays, ''Commentaires II''. That same year, Marker organized the omnibus film ''[[Far from Vietnam|Loin du Vietnam]]'', a protest against the [[Vietnam War]] with segments contributed by Marker, [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Alain Resnais]], [[Agnès Varda]], [[Claude Lelouch]], [[William Klein (photographer)|William Klein]], Michele Ray and [[Joris Ivens]]. The film includes footage of the war, from both sides, as well as anti-war protests in New York and Paris and other anti-war activities.

From this initial collection of filmmakers with left-wing political agendas, Marker created the group S.L.O.N. (''Société pour le lancement des oeuvres nouvelles'',&quot;Society for launching new works&quot;, but also the Russian word for &quot;elephant&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chrismarker.org/wounded-time/ |title=Wounded Time – Notes from the Era of Imperfect Memory |publisher=Chrismarker.org |date= |accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; SLON was a film collective whose objectives were to make films and to encourage industrial workers to create film collectives of their own. Its members included Valerie Mayoux, Jean-Claude Lerner, Alain Adair and John Tooker. Marker is usually credited as director or co-director of all of the films made by SLON.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot; /&gt;

After the events of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]], Marker felt a moral obligation to abandon his own personal film career and devote himself to SLON and its activities. SLON's first film was about a strike at a Rhodiacéta factory in France, ''[[À bientôt, j'espère]]'' (''Rhodiacéta'') in 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot; /&gt; Later that year SLON made ''La Sixième face du pentagone'', about an anti-war protest in Washington, D.C. and was a reaction to what SLON considered to be the unfair and censored reportage of such events on mainstream television. The film was shot by [[François Reichenbach]], who received co-director credit. ''La Bataille des dix millions'' was made in 1970 with Mayoux as co-director and [[Santiago Álvarez (filmmaker)|Santiago Álvarez]] as cameraman and is about the 1970 sugar crop in Cuba and its disastrous effects on the country. In 1971, SLON made ''Le Train en marche'', a new prologue to Soviet filmmaker Aleksandr Medvedkin's 1935 film ''Schastye'', which had recently been re-released in France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot; /&gt;

In 1974, SLON became I.S.K.R.A. (''Images, Sons, Kinescope, Réalisations, Audiovisuelles'', but also the name of [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s political newspaper ''[[Iskra]],'' which also is a Russian word for &quot;spark&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot; /&gt;

==Return to personal work (1974–1986)==

In 1974 returned to his personal work and made a film outside of ISKRA. ''La Solitude du chanteur de fond'' is a one-hour documentary about Marker's friend [[Yves Montand]]'s benefit concert for Chilean refugees. The concert was Montand's first public performance in four years, and the documentary includes film clips from his long career as a singer and actor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot; /&gt;

Marker had been working on a film about [[Chile]] with ISKRA since 1973. Marker had collaborated with Belgian sociologist [[Armand Mattelart]] and ISKRA members Valérie Mayoux and Jacqueline Meppiel to shoot and collect the visual materials, which Marker then edited together and provided the commentary for. The resulting film was the two and a half-hour documentary ''La Spirale'', released in 1975. The film chronicles events in Chile, beginning with the [[Chilean presidential election, 1970|1970 election]] of socialist President [[Salvador Allende]] until his [[Death of Salvador Allende|murder]] and [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|the resulting coup]] in 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot; /&gt;

Marker then began work on one of his most ambitious films, ''[[A Grin Without a Cat]]'', released in 1977. The film's title refers to the [[Cheshire Cat]] from ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''. The metaphor compares the promise of the global socialist movement before [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] (the grin) with its actual presence in the world after May 1968 (the cat). The film's original French title is ''Le fond de l'air est rouge'', which means &quot;the air is essentially red&quot;, or &quot;revolution is in the air&quot;, implying that the socialist movement was everywhere around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sterritt&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sterritt|first=David|authorlink=David Sterritt|year=2009|url=http://www.cineaste.com/articles/ema-grin-without-a-catem|title=A Grin Without a Cat|work=[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]|publisher=Cineaste Publishers|volume=34|issue=4|accessdate=31 July 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928220805/http://www.cineaste.com/articles/ema-grin-without-a-catem|archivedate=28 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was intended to be an all-encompassing portrait of political movements since May 1968, a summation of the work which he had taken part in for ten years. The film is divided into two parts: the first half focuses on the hopes and idealism before May 1968, and the second half on the disillusion and disappointments since those events. Marker begins the film with the [[The Battleship Potemkin#The Odessa Steps sequence|Odessa Steps sequence]] from [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s film ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'', which Marker points out is a fictitious creation of Eisenstein which has still influenced the image of the historical event. Marker used very little commentary in this film, but the film's montage structure and preoccupation with memory make it a Marker film. Upon release, the film was criticized for not addressing many current issues of the New Left such as the woman's movement, sexual liberation and worker self-management.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot; /&gt; The film was re-released in the US in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sterritt&quot; /&gt;

In the late 1970s, Marker traveled extensively throughout the world, including an extended period in Japan. From this inspiration, he first published the [[photo-essay]] ''Le Dépays'' in 1982, and then used the experience for his next film ''[[Sans Soleil]]'', released in 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot; /&gt;

''[[Sans Soleil]]'' stretches the limits of what could be called a documentary. It is an essay, a [[Film editing|montage]], mixing pieces of documentary with fiction and philosophical comments, creating an atmosphere of [[dream]] and science fiction. The main themes are Japan, Africa, [[memory]] and travel. A sequence in the middle of the film takes place in San Francisco, and heavily references [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''. Marker has said that ''Vertigo'' is the only film &quot;capable of portraying impossible memory, insane memory.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot; /&gt; The film's commentary are credited to the fictitious cameraman Sandor Krasna, and read in the form of letters by an unnamed woman. Though centered around Japan, the film was also shot in such other countries as [[Guinea Bissau]], Ireland and [[Iceland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot; /&gt; ''Sans Soleil'' was shown at the [[1983 Berlin Film Festival]] where it won the OCIC Award. It was also awarded the Sutherland Trophy at the 1983 [[British Film Institute]] Awards.

In 1984, Marker was invited by producer [[Serge Silberman]] to document the making of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s film ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]''. From this Marker made ''[[A.K. (film)|A.K.]]'', released in 1985. The film focuses more on Kurosawa's remote but polite personality than on the making of the film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onfilm.chicagoreader.com/movies/capsules/2_AK Chicago Reader: Dave Kehr's Review of AK]&lt;/ref&gt; The film was screened in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[1985 Cannes Film Festival]],&lt;ref name=&quot;festival-cannes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1107/year/1985.html |title=Festival de Cannes: A.K. |accessdate=28 June 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; before ''Ran'' itself had been released.

In 1985, Marker's long-time friend and neighbor [[Simone Signoret]] died of cancer. Marker then made the one-hour TV documentary ''Mémoires pour Simone'' as a tribute to her in 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot; /&gt;

==Multimedia and later career (1987–2012)==

Beginning with ''Sans Soleil'', Marker developed a deep interest in [[Digital data|digital]] technology. From 1985 to 1988, he worked on a conversational program (a prototypical chatbot) called &quot;Dialector,&quot; which he wrote in [[Applesoft BASIC]] on an [[Apple II]]. He incorporated audiovisual elements in addition to the snippets of dialogue and poetry that &quot;Computer&quot; exchanged with the user. Version 6 of this program was revived from a floppy disk (with Marker's help and permission) and emulated online in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dialector.poptronics.fr/|title=History of the Dialector Program|last=de Cayeux|first=Agnes|last2=Lozano|first2=Andrès|date=2015|website=poptronics|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514194946/http://dialector.poptronics.fr/|archive-date=May 14, 2018|url-status=|access-date=May 14, 2018|last3=Rivoire|first3=Annick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://chrismarker.org/history-of-the-dialector-program/|title=History of the Dialector Program|date=2015-11-01|work=Chris Marker|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His interests in digital technology also led to his film ''[[Level Five (film)|Level Five]]'' (1996) and ''Immemory'' (1998, 2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chris Marker|url=http://www.eai.org/artistBio.htm?id=317|publisher=[[Electronic Arts Intermix]]|accessdate=13 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121123131/http://eai.org/artistBio.htm?id=317|archive-date=21 January 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; an interactive multimedia [[CD-ROM]], produced for the [[Centre Pompidou]] (French language version) and from [[Exact Change]] (English version). Marker created a 19-minute multimedia piece in 2005 for the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City titled ''Owls at Noon Prelude: The Hollow Men'' which was influenced by [[T. S. Eliot]]'s [[The Hollow Men|poem]].&lt;ref name=MOMA1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/115 |title=Owls at Noon Prelude: The Hollow Men |last=Staff |date=April 2005 | publisher = [[Museum of Modern Art]] |accessdate= 7 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marker lived in Paris, and very rarely granted interviews. One exception was a lengthy interview with ''[[Libération]]'' in 2003 in which he explained his approach to filmmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rare Marker|date=5 March 2003|newspaper=[[Libération]]|url=http://next.liberation.fr/cinema/0101466984-rare-marker|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked for a picture of himself, he usually offered a photograph of a cat instead. (Marker was represented in Agnes Varda's 2008 documentary ''The Beaches of Agnes'' by a cartoon drawing of a cat, speaking in a technologically altered voice.) Marker's own cat was named ''Guillaume-en-égypte''. In 2009, Marker commissioned an [[commons:File:Guillaume En-Egypte.png|Avatar of Guillaume-en-Egypte]] to represent him in [[machinima]] works. The avatar was created by Exosius Woolley and first appeared in the short film / machinima, ''Ouvroir the Movie by Chris Marker''.

In the 2007 [[Criterion Collection]] release of ''La Jetée'' and ''Sans Soleil'', Marker included a short essay, &quot;Working on a Shoestring Budget&quot;. He confessed to shooting all of ''Sans Soleil'' with a silent film camera, and recording all the audio on a primitive [[audio cassette]] recorder. Marker also reminds the reader that only one short scene in ''La Jetée'' is of a moving image, as Marker could only borrow a movie camera for one afternoon while working on the film.

From 2007 through 2011 Marker collaborated with the art dealer and publisher Peter Blum on a variety of projects that were exhibited at the Peter Blum galleries in New York City's Soho and Chelsea neighborhoods. Marker's works were also exhibited at the Peter Blum Gallery on 57th Street in 2014.
