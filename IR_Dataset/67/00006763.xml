      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''cistron''' is an alternative term for &quot;[[gene]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lewin | first = Benjamin | name-list-format = vanc | authorlink = Benjamin Lewin | title = Genes VII | year = 2000 | publisher = Oxford University Press and Cell Press | location = New York | isbn = 0-19-879276-X | page = [https://archive.org/details/genesvii00lewi/page/955 955] | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/genesvii00lewi/page/955 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word cistron is used to emphasize that genes exhibit a specific behavior in a [[complementation test|cis-trans test]]; distinct positions (or [[locus (genetics)|loci]]) within a [[genome]] are '''cistronic'''.

== History ==
The words ''cistron'' and ''gene'' were coined before the advancing state of [[biology]] made it clear that the concepts they refer to are practically equivalent. The same historical naming practices are responsible for many of the [[synonym]]s in the life sciences.

The term cistron was coined by [[Seymour Benzer]] in an article entitled ''The elementary units of heredity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Benzer S | date = 1957 | chapter = The elementary units of heredity | title = The Chemical Basis of Heredity | url = https://archive.org/details/symposiumonchemi00symp | url-access = registration | veditors =  McElroy WD, Glass B | pages = [https://archive.org/details/symposiumonchemi00symp/page/70 70–93] | publisher = Johns Hopkins Press | location = Baltimore, Maryland }} also reprinted in {{cite book | vauthors = Benzer S | date = 1965 | chapter = The elementary units of heredity | title = Selected papers on Molecular Genetics | veditors = Taylor JH | pages = 451–477 | publisher = Academic Press | location = New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cistron was defined by an operational test applicable to most organisms that is sometimes referred to as a cis-trans test, but more often as a [[complementation test]].

== Definition ==
For example, suppose a [[mutation]] at a chromosome position &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is responsible for a change in [[recessive trait]] in a [[diploid]] organism (where chromosomes come in pairs). We say that the mutation is recessive because the organism will exhibit the [[wild type]] [[phenotype]] (ordinary trait) unless both chromosomes of a pair have the mutation ([[homozygous]] mutation). Similarly, suppose a mutation at another position, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, is responsible for the same recessive trait. The positions &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are said to be within the same cistron when an organism that has the mutation at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; on one chromosome and has the mutation at position &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; on the paired chromosome exhibits the recessive trait even though the organism is not homozygous for either mutation. When instead the wild type trait is expressed, the positions are said to belong to distinct cistrons / genes. Or simply put, mutations on the same cistrons will not complement; as opposed to mutations on different cistrons may complement (see Benzer's T4 bacteriophage experiments [[T4 rII system]]).

For example, an [[operon]] is a stretch of DNA that is [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] to create a contiguous segment of [[RNA]], but contains more than one cistron / gene. The operon is said to be polycistronic, whereas ordinary genes are said to be monocistronic.
