'''Constans''' ({{lang-la|Flavius Julius Constans Augustus}};&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 220&quot;&gt;Jones, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc-gre|Κῶνστας Αʹ}}; c. 323&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 220&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Victor, 41:23&lt;/ref&gt; – 350) or '''Constans I''' was [[Roman Emperor]] from 337 to 350. He defeated his brother [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]] in 340, but anger in the army over his personal life (homosexuality) and favouritism towards his barbarian bodyguards led the general [[Magnentius]] to rebel, resulting in the assassination of Constans in 350.

==Career==
Constans was the third and youngest son of [[Constantine the Great]] and [[Fausta]], his father's second wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;DiMaio, ''Constans I (337–350 A.D.)''&lt;/ref&gt;  He was educated at the court of his father at [[Constantinople]] under the tutelage of the poet [[Aemilius Magnus Arborius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 220&quot;/&gt;

On 25 December 333, Constantine I elevated Constans to the rank of ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' at [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 220&quot;/&gt; Constans became engaged to [[Olympias of Armenia|Olympias]], the daughter of the [[Praetorian Prefect]] [[Ablabius (consul 331)|Ablabius]], but the marriage never came to pass.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; With Constantine’s death in 337, Constans and his two brothers, [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]] and [[Constantius II]], divided the Roman world among themselves&lt;ref name=&quot;Eutropius, 10:9&quot;&gt;Eutropius, 10:9&lt;/ref&gt; and disposed of virtually all relatives who could possibly have a claim to the throne.&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor, 41:20&quot;&gt;Victor, 41:20&lt;/ref&gt; The army proclaimed them ''[[Augustus (title)|Augusti]]'' on September 9, 337.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 220&quot;/&gt; Almost immediately, Constans was required to deal with a [[Sarmatian]] invasion in late 337, in which he won a resounding victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Impero Romano da maggio a settembre 337.png|thumb|left|Division of the Roman Empire among the Caesars appointed by [[Constantine I]]: from west to east, the territories of [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]], Constans, [[Dalmatius]] and [[Constantius II]]. After the death of Constantine I (May 337), this was the formal division of the Empire, until Dalmatius was killed and his territory divided between Constans and Constantius.]]
Constans was initially under the guardianship of Constantine II.  The original settlement assigned Constans the [[praetorian prefecture of Italy]], which included Northern Africa.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Constans was unhappy with this division, so the brothers met at [[Viminacium]] in 338 to revise the boundaries.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Constans managed to extract the prefecture of [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]] and the [[diocese of Thrace]],{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} provinces that were originally to be ruled by his cousin [[Dalmatius]], as per Constantine I’s proposed division after his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor, 41:20&quot;/&gt; Constantine II soon complained that he had not received the amount of territory that was his due as the eldest son.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;&gt;Gibbon, Ch. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Annoyed that Constans had received Thrace and [[Diocese of Macedonia|Macedonia]] after the death of Dalmatius, Constantine demanded that Constans hand over the African provinces, which he agreed to do in order to maintain a fragile peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor, 41:21&quot;&gt;Victor, 41:21&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon, however, they began quarreling over which parts of the African provinces belonged to [[Carthage]], and thus Constantine, and which belonged to [[Italy]], and therefore Constans.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, 2:41-42&lt;/ref&gt; This led to growing tensions between the two brothers, which were only heightened by Constans finally coming of age and Constantine refusing to give up his guardianship. In 340 Constantine II invaded Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor, 41:21&quot;/&gt; Constans, at that time in [[Dacia]], detached and sent a select and disciplined body of his Illyrian troops, stating that he would follow them in person with the remainder of his forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;/&gt; Constantine was eventually trapped at [[Aquileia]], where he died, leaving Constans to inherit all of his brother’s former territories – [[Hispania]], [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] and [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Eutropius, 10:9&quot;/&gt;

Constans began his reign in an energetic fashion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eutropius, 10:9&quot;/&gt; In 341-42, he led a successful campaign against the [[Franks]], and in the early months of 343 he visited [[Roman Britain|Britain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; The source for this visit, [[Julius Firmicus Maternus]], does not provide a reason, but the quick movement and the danger involved in crossing the [[English Channel|channel]] in the winter months suggests it was in response to a military emergency, possibly to repel the [[Picts]] and [[Gaels|Scots]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Regarding religion, Constans was tolerant of [[Judaism]] and promulgated an edict banning pagan sacrifices in 341.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; He suppressed [[Donatism]] in Africa and supported [[Nicene Christianity|Nicene orthodoxy]] against [[Arianism]], which was championed by his brother Constantius. Although Constans called the [[Council of Serdica]] in 343 to settle the conflict,&lt;ref&gt;Socrates Scholasticus, ''Church History'', book 2, chapter 20.&lt;/ref&gt; it was a complete failure,&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia, 1930, Patrick J. Healy, Sardica&lt;/ref&gt; and by 346 the two emperors were on the point of open warfare over the dispute.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The conflict was only resolved by an interim agreement which allowed each emperor to support their preferred clergy within their own spheres of influence.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Homosexuality===

The Roman historian [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] says Constans &quot;indulged in great vices,&quot; in reference to his [[homosexuality]], and [[Aurelius Victor]] stated that Constans had a reputation for scandalous behaviour with &quot;handsome barbarian hostages.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, Constans did sponsor a decree alongside Constantius II that ruled that marriage based on &quot;unnatural&quot; sex should be punished meticulously. Boswell argues that the decree outlawed homosexual marriages only, rather than homosexual activity more generally. However, it was likely the case that Constans promulgated the legislation under pressure from the growing band of Christian leaders, in an attempt to placate public outrage at his own perceived indecencies.&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, ''Christianity, Social Tolerance and Homosexuality'', 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In the final years of his reign, Constans developed a reputation for cruelty and misrule.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, 2:42&lt;/ref&gt; Dominated by favourites and openly preferring his select bodyguard, he lost the support of the [[Roman legion|legions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;/&gt; In 350, the general [[Magnentius]] declared himself emperor at [[Augustodunum]] with the support of the troops on the [[Rhine]] frontier and, later, the western provinces of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Eutropius, 10:9:4&lt;/ref&gt; Constans was enjoying himself nearby when he was notified of the elevation of Magnentius.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;/&gt;  Lacking any support beyond his immediate household,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;/&gt; he was forced to flee for his life. As he was trying to reach [[Hispania]], supporters of Magnentius cornered him in a fortification in ''Helena'' (now [[Elne]]) in the eastern [[Pyrenees]] of southwestern [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]],&lt;ref&gt;Victor, 41:21:23&lt;/ref&gt; where he was killed after seeking sanctuary in a temple.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} An alleged [[prophecy]] at his birth had said Constans would die ''in the arms of his grandmother''. His place of death happens to have been named after [[Helena (empress)|Helena]], mother of [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] and his own grandmother, thus realizing the prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;{{66 PHPC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
