'''Cross-country skiing''' is a form of [[skiing]] where skiers rely on their own [[Terrestrial locomotion|locomotion]] to move across snow-covered terrain, rather than using [[ski lift]]s or other forms of assistance. Cross-country skiing is widely practiced as a sport and recreational activity; however, some still use it as a means of transportation. Variants of cross-country skiing are adapted to a range of terrain which spans unimproved, sometimes mountainous terrain to groomed courses that are specifically designed for the sport.

Modern cross-country skiing is similar to the original form of skiing, from which all skiing disciplines evolved, including [[alpine skiing]], [[ski jumping]] and [[Telemark skiing]]. Skiers propel themselves either by striding forward (classic style) or side-to-side in a skating motion (skate skiing), aided by arms pushing on [[ski poles]] against the snow. It is practised in regions with snow-covered landscapes, including [[Northern Europe]], [[Canada]], [[Russia]], the [[United States]], [[Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jRrwAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=cross-country+skiing+australia&amp;dq=cross-country+skiing+australia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAir6_lc3hAhWOmeAKHTZ9DPYQ6AEIKjAA|title=Australian Cross Country Skiing|last=Hampel|first=Ian|date=1988|publisher=Kangaroo Press|year=|isbn=9780864171993|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ExVLAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=new+zealand+cross+country+skiing+books&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7ztf0ls3hAhVFdt8KHQVnDkoQ6AEIKjAA|title=New Zealand Backcountry Skiing|last=Broadbent|first=James|date=2004|publisher=New Zealand Alpine Club|isbn=9780958242134|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early skiers used one long pole or spear in addition to the skis. The first depiction of a skier with two [[ski pole]]s dates to 1741.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hergstrom|first=P|title=Beschreibung von dem unter schwedischer Krone gehörigen Lappland|year=1748|publisher=von Rother|location=Leipzig |language= de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional skis, used for snow travel in Norway and elsewhere into the 1800s, often comprised one short ski with a natural fur traction surface, the ''andor'', and one long for gliding, the ''langski''—one being up to {{convert|100|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} longer than the other—allowing skiers to propel themselves with a scooter motion. This combination has a long history among the [[Sami people]]. Skis up to 280&amp;nbsp;cm have been produced in Finland, and the longest recorded ski in Norway is 373&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name=Berg&gt;{{Cite book | last =  Berg | first = Karin | language = Norwegian | year = 1993 | title = Ski i Norge | isbn = 82-588-0951-2 | location = Oslo | publisher = Aventura – Skiforeningen | url = http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010053106003 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ski warfare]], the use of ski-equipped troops in [[war]], is first recorded by the [[Denmark|Danish]] historian [[Saxo Grammaticus]] in the 13th century. These troops were reportedly able to cover distances comparable to that of light [[cavalry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Magnus|first=Olaus|title=Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus|url=http://www.ub.uit.no/northernlights/eng/omagnus.htm|accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The garrison in [[Trondheim]] used skis at least from 1675, and the Danish-Norwegian army included specialized skiing battalions from 1747—details of military ski exercises from 1767 are on record.&lt;ref name=Bergsland&gt;{{cite book |last= Bergsland |first= Einar |year= 1946 |title= På ski |location= Oslo |publisher= Aschehoug}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skis were used in military exercises in 1747.&lt;ref&gt;

Norwegian skiing regiments organized military skiing contests in the 18th century, divided in four classes: shooting at a target while skiing at &quot;top speed&quot;, downhill racing among trees, downhill racing on large slopes without falling, and &quot;long racing&quot; on &quot;flat ground&quot;.&lt;ref name=Bergsland/&gt; An early record of a public ski competition occurred in [[Tromsø (city)|Tromsø]], 1843. In Norwegian, {{lang|no|langrenn}} refers to &quot;competitive skiing where the goal is to complete a specific distance in groomed tracks in the shortest possible time&quot;. In Norway, ''ski touring competitions'' ({{lang-no|turrenn}}) are long-distance cross-country competitions open to the public, competition is usually within age intervals.&lt;ref name=Idrettsleksikon/&gt;

A new technique, [[skate skiing]], was experimented with early in the 20th Century, but was not widely adopted until the 1980s. [[Johan Grøttumsbråten]] used the skating technique at the [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1931|1931 World Championship]] in Oberhof, one of the earliest recorded use of skating in competitive cross-country skiing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olav 1993&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Bø |first= Olav |title= Skiing throughout history |others= W. Edson Richmond (trans.) |location= Oslo |publisher= Samlaget |year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique was later used in ski orienteering in the 1960s on roads and other firm surfaces. It became widespread during the 1980s after the success of [[Bill Koch (skier)|Bill Koch]] ([[United States]]) in [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1982|1982 Cross-country Skiing Championships]] drew more attention to the skating style. Norwegian skier [[Ove Aunli]] started using the technique in 1984, when he found it to be much faster than classic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Bengtsson | first = Bengt Erik | title = Cross-country skating: How it started | work = Skiing History Magazine

In contrast, alpine skiing is referred to as {{lang|no|stå på ski}} (literally &quot;stand on skis&quot;).

[[Fridtjov Nansen]], describes the crossing of Greenland as {{lang|no|På ski over Grønland}}, literally &quot;On skis across Greenland&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Nansen |first= Fridtjof |title= Paa ski over Grønland. En skildring af Den norske Grønlands-ekspedition 1888–89 |location= Kristiania |publisher= Aschehoug}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the English edition of the report was titled, ''The first crossing of Greenland''. Nansen referred to the activity of traversing snow on skis as {{lang-no|skilöbning}} (he used the term also in the English translation), which may be translated as ''ski running''. Nansen used {{lang|no|skilöbning}}, regarding all forms of skiing, but noted that ski jumping is purely a competitive sport and not for amateurs. He further noted that in some competitions the skier &quot;is also required to show his skill in turning his ski to one side or the other within given marks&quot; at full speed on a steep hill. Nansen regarded these forms (i.e., jumping and slalom) as &quot;special arts&quot;, and believed that the most important branch of skiing was travel &quot;in an ordinary way across the country&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Nansen |first= Fridtjof |title= The first crossing of Greenland |url= https://archive.org/details/firstcrossingofg02nans |location= London |publisher= Longmans, Green and Co. |year= 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, Nansen's Greenland report was published as {{lang|de|Auf Schneeschuhen durch Grönland}} (literally &quot;On snowshoes through Greenland&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Nansen |first= Fridtjov |title= Auf Schneeschuhen durch Grönland |publisher= autorisirte deutsche Uebersetzung von M.

==Recreation==
[[File:Påske.jpg|thumb|right|Ski touring in untracked terrain.]]
Recreational cross-country skiing includes [[ski touring]] and groomed-trail skiing, typically at resorts or in parklands. It is an accessible form of recreation for persons with [[Ski for Light|vision and mobility impairments]]. A related form of recreation is [[Skijoring#Dog skijoring|dog skijoring]]—a winter sport where a cross-country skier is assisted by one or more dogs.

===Ski touring===
[[Ski touring]] takes place off-[[piste]] and outside of [[ski resorts]]. Tours may extend over multiple days. Typically, [[ski]]s, [[ski bindings|bindings]], and [[ski boot|boots]] allow for free movement of the heel to enable a walking pace, as with [[Nordic skiing|Nordic disciplines]] and unlike [[Alpine skiing]].&lt;ref name=branigan&gt;{{cite book|title= A Complete Guide to Alpine Ski Touring Ski Mountaineering and Nordic Ski Touring Including Useful Information for Off Piste Skiers and Snow Boarders|date= 2014|publisher= Authorhouse|isbn= 978-1-4918-8808-7|page= xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ski touring's subgenre [[ski mountaineering]] involves independently navigating and route finding through potential [[avalanche]] terrain and often requires familiarity with [[meteorology]] along with skiing skills. Ski touring can be faster and easier than summer [[hiking]] in some terrain, allowing for traverses and ascents that would be harder in the summer. Skis can also be used to access backcountry alpine climbing routes when snow is off the technical route, but still covers the hiking trail. In some countries, organizations maintain a network of huts for use by cross-country skiers in wintertime. For example, the [[Norwegian Trekking Association]] maintains over 400 huts stretching across thousands of kilometres of trails which hikers can use in the summer and skiers in the winter.&lt;ref name=volken&gt;{{cite book|last1= Volken|first1= Martin|last2= Schnell|first2= Scott|last3= Wheeler|first3= Margaret|title= Backcountry Skiing: Skills for Ski Touring and Ski Mountaineering|date= 2007|publisher= Mountaineers Books|isbn= 978-1-59485-038-7|page= [https://archive.org/details/backcountryskiin00volk/page/12 12]|url= https://archive.org/details/backcountryskiin00volk/page/12|accessdate= 2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Groomed-trail skiing===
{{main article|Cross-country skiing trail}}
[[File:Loipe am Mordfleck.jpg|thumb|right|Groomed ski trails for cross-country in [[Thuringia]], track-set for classic skiing at the sides and groomed for skate skiing in the center.]]
[[snow grooming|Groomed]] trail skiing occurs at facilities such as [[Nordmarka]] (Oslo), [[Royal Gorge Cross Country Ski Resort]] and [[Gatineau Park]] in [[Quebec]], where trails are laid out and groomed for both classic and skate-skiing. Such grooming and track setting (for classic technique) requires specialized equipment and techniques that adapt to the condition of the snow. Trail preparation employs snow machines which tow snow-compaction, texturing and track-setting devices. Groomers must adapt such equipment to the condition of the snow—crystal structure, temperature, degree of compaction, moisture content, etc. Depending on the initial condition of the snow, grooming may achieve an increase in density for new-fallen snow or a decrease in density for icy or compacted snow. Cross-country ski facilities may incorporate a course design that meets [[homologation]] standards for such organizations as the International Olympic Committee, the International Ski Federation, or national standards. Standards address course distances, [[degree of difficulty]] with maximums in elevation difference and steepness—both up and downhill, plus other factors.&lt;ref name=CanadianManual&gt;

Some facilities have night-time lighting on select trails—called ''[[Elljusspår|lysløype]]'' (light trails) in Norwegian and ''[[elljusspår]]'' (electric-light trails) in Swedish. The first ''lysløype'' opened in 1946 in Nordmarka and at Byåsen ([[Trondheim]]).&lt;ref&gt;

[[Ski orienteering]] is a form of cross-country skiing competition that requires navigation in a landscape, making optimal route choices at racing speeds. Standard [[orienteering map]]s are used, but with special green overprinting of trails and tracks to indicate their [[Navigate|navigability]] in [[snow]]; other symbols indicate whether any roads are snow-covered or clear. Standard skate-skiing equipment is used, along with a map holder attached to the chest. It is one of the four [[orienteering]] disciplines [[Sport governing body|recognized]] by the [[International Orienteering Federation]]. Upper body strength is especially important because of frequent double poling along narrow snow trails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Techniques==
[[File:Rotchev-veerpalu-2006.jpg|Skiers employing step turns, while descending during a 2006 FIS World Cup Cross Country competition in Otepää, [[Estonia]].|thumb|right]]
Cross-country skiing has two basic propulsion techniques, which apply to different surfaces: classic (undisturbed snow and tracked snow) and skate skiing (firm, smooth snow surfaces). The classic technique relies on a [[Ski wax|wax]] or texture on the ski bottom under the foot for [[Traction (engineering)|traction]] on the snow to allow the skier to slide the other ski forward in virgin or tracked snow. With the skate skiing technique a skier slides on alternating skis on a firm snow surface at an angle from each other in a manner similar to ice skating. Both techniques employ poles with baskets that allow the arms to participate in the propulsion. Specialized equipment is adapted to each technique and each type of terrain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees&quot;/&gt; A variety of turns are used, when descending.

Both poles can be used simultaneously (&quot;double-poling&quot;), or alternating, in classic the alternating technique is most common (the &quot;diagonal stride&quot;) while in the skating technique double poles are more common.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=pole/&gt;

===Classic===
The classic style is often used on prepared trails (pistes) that have pairs of parallel grooves (tracks) cut into the snow. It is also the most usual technique where no tracks have been prepared. With this technique, each ski is pushed forward from the other stationary ski in a striding and gliding motion, alternating foot to foot. With the &quot;diagonal stride&quot; variant the poles are planted alternately on the opposite side of the forward-striding foot; with the &quot;kick-double-pole&quot; variant the poles are planted simultaneously with every other stride. At times, especially with gentle descents, double poling is the sole means of propulsion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | edition = 3d | publisher = Copp C. Pitman | isbn = 978-0-7730-4045-8 | oclc = 300405310 | last = Rees | first = David| title = Cross-country skiing: touring and competition | location = Toronto | year = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; On uphill terrain, techniques include the &quot;side step&quot; for steep slopes, moving the skis perpendicular to the fall line, the &quot;herringbone&quot; for moderate slopes, where the skier takes alternating steps with the skis splayed outwards, and, for gentle slopes, the skier uses the diagonal technique with shorter strides and greater arm force on the poles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees&quot;/&gt;

===Skate skiing===
With skate skiing, the skier provides propulsion on a smooth, firm snow surface by pushing alternating skis away from one another at an angle, in a manner similar to [[ice skating]]. Skate-skiing usually involves a coordinated use of poles and the upper body to add impetus, sometimes with a double pole plant each time the ski is extended on a temporarily &quot;dominant&quot; side (&quot;V1&quot;) or with a double pole plant each time the ski is extended on either side (&quot;V2&quot;). Skiers climb hills with these techniques by widening the angle of the &quot;V&quot; and by making more frequent, shorter strides and more forceful use of poles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hindman | first = Steve | title = Technique &amp; Training: Three steps to skating | work = Cross Country Skier Magazine | date = December 2008 | url = http://www.crosscountryskier.com/magazine/08_dec/technique.htm | accessdate = 2014-10-20 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141017042359/http://www.crosscountryskier.com/magazine/08_dec/technique.htm | archivedate = 17 October 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A variant of the technique is the &quot;marathon skate&quot; or &quot;Siitoten step&quot;, where the skier leaves one ski in the track while skating outwards to the side with the other ski.&lt;ref name=&quot;skixc1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://crosscountryskitechnique.com/the-early-development-of-skate-skiing/|title=Swedish Olympic Champion Recalls the Early Development of Skate Skiing – Cross Country Ski Technique|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Performance level, from recreational use to competition at the elite level&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees&quot;/&gt;

===Skis===
{{main article|Ski}}
[[File:Cross-country equipment--Skate and Classic.jpg|thumb|Cross-country ski equipment for skate-skiing (left) and classic-style skiing (right). Ski and pole lengths are different for each. Classic skis have a &quot;grip zone&quot; in the area under the binding.]]
Skis used in cross-country are lighter and narrower than those used in [[alpine skiing]]. Ski bottoms are designed to provide a gliding surface and, for classic skis, a traction zone under foot. The base of the gliding surface is a plastic material that is designed both to minimize friction and, in many cases, to accept waxes.&lt;ref name=oly&gt;{{cite web|title=Cross Country Skiing Equipment and History|url=http://www.olympic.org/cross-country-skiing-equipment-and-history?tab=history|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=2014-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glide wax may be used on the tails and tips of classic skis and across the length of skate skis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=mec&gt;{{cite web|title=Cross Country Skis (Nordic Skis) |url=http://www.mec.ca/AST/ContentPrimary/Learn/Snowsports/SkisBootsAndSkins/NordicSkis.jsp|website=MEC|publisher=Mountain Equipment Coop|accessdate=2014-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Types====
Each type of ski is sized and designed differently. Length affects maneuverability; camber affects pressure on the snow beneath the feet of the skier; side-cut affects the ease of turning; width affects forward friction; overall area on the snow affects bearing capacity; and tip geometry affects the ability to penetrate new snow or to stay in a track.&lt;ref name = SnowCountry&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the following ski types has a different combination of these attributes:
* '''Classic skis''': Designed for skiing in tracks. For adult skiers (between 155&amp;nbsp;cm/50&amp;nbsp;kg and 185&amp;nbsp;cm/75&amp;nbsp;kg), recommended lengths are between 180 and 210 centimetres (approximately 115% of the skier's height). Traction comes from a &quot;grip zone&quot; underfoot that when bearing the skier's weight engages either a textured gripping surface or a grip wax. Accordingly, these skis are classified as &quot;waxable&quot; or &quot;waxless&quot;. Recreational waxless skis generally require little attention and are adapted for casual use. Waxable skis, if prepared correctly, provide better grip and glide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.snocountry.com/article.php/20041227133240622 |title = Back to Basics: A Quick Look at Paste Waxes, Waxless Ski Preparation and Kick Waxing|accessdate = 2009-01-25|last = Bergin|first = Ron |authorlink = |year = 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070402051820/http://www.snocountry.com/article.php/20041227133240622 |archivedate = 2 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;REIAdvice&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/crosscountry-ski-touring-gear.html|title = Cross-Country Ski Gear: How to Choose|accessdate = 2015-06-29|last = Recreational Equipment, Inc.|authorlink = |year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:When the skier's weight is distributed on both skis, the ski's [[wikt:camber|camber]] diminishes the pressure of the grip zone on the snow and promotes bearing on the remaining area of the ski—the &quot;glide zone&quot;. A test for stiffness of camber is made with a piece of paper under the skier's foot, standing on skis on a flat, hard surface—the paper should be pinned throughout the grip zone of the ski on which all the skier's weight is placed, but slide freely when the skier's weight is bearing equally on both skis.&lt;ref name = Mountaineers/&gt;
* '''Skate skis''': Designed for skiing on groomed surfaces. Recommended lengths are between 170 and 200 centimetres (up to 110% of the skier's height) for adult skiers.  The entire bottom of each skate ski is a glide zone—prepared for maximum glide. Traction comes from the skier pushing away from the edge of the previous ski onto the next ski.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees&quot;/&gt;
* '''Back country skis''': Designed for [[ski touring]] on natural snow conditions. Recommended lengths are between 150 and 195 centimeters for adult skiers, depending on height and weight of the user. Back country skis are typically heavier and wider than classic and skate skis; they often have metal edges for better grip on hard snow; and their greater [[sidecut]] helps to carve turns.&lt;ref name=Berg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Editors | title = How to choose the right ski length | work = Back Country | date = 2 September 2013 | url = http://www.backcountry.com/explore/how-to-pick-the-right-ski-length | accessdate = 2014-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Melbye/&gt;

:The geometry of a back country ski depends on its purpose—skis suited for forested areas where loose powder can predominate may be shorter and wider than those selected for open, exposed areas where compacted snow may prevail. Sidecut on Telemark skis promotes turning in forest and rugged terrain. Width and short length aid turning in loose and deep snow. Longer, narrower and more rigid skis with sharp edges are suited for snow that has been compacted by wind or freeze-thaw. Touring ski design may represent a general-purpose compromise among these different ski conditions, plus being acceptable for use in groomed tracks.&lt;!---We don't see these terms in English: (referred to as mountain skis or crust skis)---&gt; Traction may come from a textured or waxed grip zone, as with classic skis, or from [[ski skins]], which are applied to the ski bottom for long, steep ascents and have hairs or mechanical texture that prevents sliding backwards.&lt;ref name=Berg/&gt;&lt;ref name=Melbye&gt;{{cite book|last1=Melbye|first1=Mats|title=Friluftsliv i vinterfjellet|date=1997|publisher=Universitetsforlaget|location=Oslo|isbn=82-00-42088-4|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gliding surface====
{{main article|Ski wax#Glide wax}}
Glide waxes enhance the speed of the gliding surface, and are applied by ironing them onto the ski and then polishing the ski bottom.  Three classes of glide wax are available, depending on the level of desired performance with higher performance coming at higher cost.  Hydrocarbon glide waxes, based on [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]] are common for recreational use.  Race waxes comprise a combination of fluorinated hydrocarbon waxes and fluorocarbon overlays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Harvey | first = Ian | title = Information on Fluorinated Waxes | work = A Michigan Nordic Ski Racer | date = 9 February 2011 | url = http://www.nordicskiracer.com/news.asp?NewsID=5429 | accessdate = 2014-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fluorocarbons decrease surface tension and surface area of the water between the ski and the snow, increasing speed and glide of the ski under specific conditions. Either combined with the wax or applied after in a spray, powder, or block form, fluorocarbons significantly improve the glide of the ski and are widely used in cross-country ski races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Swix | title = Information on Fluorinated Waxes | work = A Michigan Nordic Ski Racer | date = 22 February 2011
 | url = http://www.nordicskiracer.com/news.asp?NewsID=5482 | accessdate = 2014-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Traction surface====
{{main article|Ski wax#Grip wax}}
Skis designed for classic technique, both in track and in virgin snow, rely on a traction zone, called the &quot;grip zone&quot; or &quot;kick zone&quot;, underfoot. This comes either from a) ''texture'', designed to slide forward but not backwards, that is built into the grip zone of waxless skis, or from applied devices, e.g. climbing skins, or b) from ''grip waxes''. [[Ski wax#Grip wax|Grip waxes]] are classified according to their hardness: harder waxes are for colder and newer snow. An incorrect choice of grip wax for the snow conditions encountered may cause ski slippage (wax too hard for the conditions) or snow sticking to the grip zone (wax too soft for the conditions).&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees&quot;/&gt; Grip waxes generate grip by interacting with snow crystals, which vary with temperature, age and compaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees&quot;/&gt; Hard grip waxes don't work well for snow which has metamorphosed to having coarse grains, whether icy or wet. In these conditions, skiers opt for a stickier substance, called ''klister''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees&quot;/&gt;

===Boots and bindings===
[[File:Cross-country ski boot and binding system--Classic.jpg|thumb|Cross-country ski boot and ''standardized'' binding system for classic skiing. The skier clicks the toe of the boot into the binding and releases with the button in front of the boot.]]
[[Ski boots]] are attached to the ski only at the toe, leaving the heel free. Depending on application, boots may be lightweight (performance skiing) or heavier and more supportive (back-country skiing).&lt;ref name=Boot-binding/&gt;

[[Ski binding|Bindings]] connect the boot to the ski. There are three primary groups of [[Nordic Integrated System|binding systems]] used in cross-country skiing (in descending order of importance):&lt;ref name=Boot-binding&gt;{{cite web | last = Dzierzak | first = Lou | title = Cross country skiers venture off track | department = On the Wild Side | work = Cross Country Skier Magazine | date = November 2008 | url = http://www.crosscountryskier.com/magazine/08_nov/wild_side.htm | accessdate = 2014-10-21 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150302164504/http://www.crosscountryskier.com/magazine/08_nov/wild_side.htm | archivedate = 2 March 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Standardized system''': Boots and bindings have an integrated connection, typically a bar across the front end of the sole of the boot, and platform on which the boot rests. Two families of standards prevail: NNN (New Nordic Norm) and SNS (Salomon Nordic System) Profil. Both systems have variants for skiing on groomed surfaces and in back country. These systems are the most common type of binding.
* '''Three-pin''': The boot-gripping system comprises three pins that correspond to three holes in the sole of the boot's toe, used primarily for back-country skiing.
* '''Cable''': A [[Cable binding|cable]] secures the free-moving heel and keeps the toe of the boot pushed into a boot-gripping section, used primarily for back-country and telemark skiing.

===Poles===
{{main article|Ski pole}}
Ski poles are used for balance and propulsion. Modern cross-country ski poles are made from [[aluminium]], [[fibreglass-reinforced plastic]], or [[carbon fibre]], depending on weight, cost and performance parameters. Formerly they were made of wood or [[bamboo]].  They feature a foot (called a basket) near the end of the shaft that provides a pushing platform, as it makes contact with the snow. Baskets vary in size, according to the expected softness/firmness of the snow. Racing poles feature smaller, lighter baskets than recreational poles. Poles designed for skating are longer than those designed for classic skiing.&lt;ref name=pole&gt;{{cite web | last = Hindman | first = Steve | title = Poling Principles | department = Training &amp; Technique | work = Cross Country Skier | date = February 2004 | url = http://www.crosscountryskier.com/training_technique_feb_2004.html | accessdate = 2014-11-18 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141129024911/http://www.crosscountryskier.com/training_technique_feb_2004.html | archivedate = 29 November 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional skiing in the 1800s used a single pole for both cross-country and downhill. The single pole was longer and stronger than the poles that are used in pairs. In competitive cross-country poles in pairs were introduced around 1900.&lt;ref name= Aftenposten&gt;
