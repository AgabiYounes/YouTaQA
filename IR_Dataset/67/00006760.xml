'''Cryonics''' (from {{lang-el|κρύος}} ''kryos'' meaning 'cold') is the [[Cryopreservation|low-temperature freezing]] (usually at {{cvt|−196|C|F K|disp=or}}) and storage of a human corpse or severed head, with the speculative hope that [[resurrection]] may be possible in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McKie|first=Robin|title=Cold facts about cryonics|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/jul/14/medicalscience.science|accessdate=1 December 2013|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=13 July 2002|quote=&quot;Cryonics, which began in the Sixties, is the freezing – usually in liquid nitrogen – of human beings who have been legally declared dead.

Economic reality means it is highly improbable that any cryonics corporation could continue in business long enough to take advantage of the claimed long-term benefits offered.&lt;ref name=decline/&gt; Early attempts of cryonic preservations were performed in the 1960s and early 1970s which ended in failure with companies going out of business, and their stored corpses thawed and disposed of.&lt;ref name=hta-law/&gt;

==Conceptual basis==
Cryonicists argue that as long as brain structure remains intact, there is no fundamental barrier, given our current understanding of physical law, to recovering its information content. Cryonics proponents go further than the mainstream [[Scientific consensus|consensus]] in saying that the brain does not have to be continuously active to survive or retain memory. Cryonics controversially states that a human survives even within an inactive brain that has been badly damaged, provided that original encoding of memory and personality can, in theory, be adequately inferred and reconstituted from what structure remains.&lt;ref name=&quot;moen&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Doyle, DJ|date=2012|title=Cryonic Life Extension: Scientific Possibility or Stupid Pipe Dream?|journal=Ethics in Biology, Engineering and Medicine|volume=3|issue=1–3|pages=9–28|doi=10.1615/EthicsBiologyEngMed.2013006985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cryonics uses temperatures below −130&amp;nbsp;[[degree Celsius|°C]], called [[cryopreservation]], in an attempt to preserve enough brain information to permit future revival of the cryopreserved person. Cryopreservation may be accomplished by freezing, freezing with [[cryoprotectant]] to reduce ice damage, or by [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]] to avoid ice damage. Even using the best methods, cryopreservation of whole bodies or brains is very damaging and irreversible with current technology.

Cryonics advocates hold that in the future the use of some kind of presently-nonexistent [[nanotechnology]] may be able to help bring the dead back to life and treat the diseases which killed them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Crippen| title = Ethics review: Dark angels – the problem of death in intensive care| journal = Critical Care| volume = 11| page = 202| year = 2007| pmid=17254317| doi = 10.1186/cc5138| first1 = DW| last2 = Whetstine| first2 = L| issue = 1| pmc=2151911}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mind uploading]] has also been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Frozen in time: Oregon firm preserves bodies, brains in hopes that science catches up|url=http://portlandtribune.com/pt/9-news/293801-170586-frozen-in-time-oregon-firm-preserves-bodies-brains-in-hopes-that-science-catches-up|accessdate=21 February 2016|work=[[Portland Tribune]]|date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cryonics in practice==

Cryonics can be expensive. {{asof|2018}} the cost of preparing and storing corpses using cryonics ranged from US$28,000 to $200,000.&lt;ref name=hta-cost&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Human Tissue Authority]] |title=Things to consider when making your decision on cryonics |url=https://www.hta.gov.uk/things-consider-when-making-your-decision-cryonics |date=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When used at high concentrations, [[cryoprotectants]] can stop [[ice]] formation completely. Cooling and solidification without [[crystal]] formation is called [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fahy GM, MacFarlane DR, Angell CA, Meryman HT|date=August 1984|title=Vitrification as an approach to cryopreservation|journal=Cryobiology|volume=21|issue=4|pages=407–26|doi=10.1016/0011-2240(84)90079-8|pmid=6467964}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first cryoprotectant solutions able to vitrify at very slow cooling rates while still being compatible with whole organ survival were developed in the late 1990s by [[Cryobiology|cryobiologists]] [[Greg Fahy|Gregory Fahy]] and [[Brian Wowk]] for the purpose of banking transplantable organs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fahy GM, Wowk B, Pagotan R 167–75&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|display-authors=etal|vauthors=Fahy GM, Wowk B, Pagotan R|date=July 2009|title=Physical and biological aspects of renal vitrification|journal=Organogenesis|volume=5|issue=3|pages=167–75|doi=10.4161/org.5.3.9974|pmc=2781097|pmid=20046680}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|display-authors=etal|vauthors=Fahy GM, Wowk B, Wu J|date=April 2004|title=Cryopreservation of organs by vitrification: perspectives and recent advances|journal=Cryobiology|volume=48|issue=2|pages=157–78|doi=10.1016/j.cryobiol.2004.02.002|pmid=15094092}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fahy|first1=G|last2=Wowk|first2=B|last3=Wu|first3=J|last4=Phan|first4=J|last5=Rasch|first5=C|last6=Chang|first6=A|last7=Zendejas|first7=E|year=2005|title=Corrigendum to &quot;Cryopreservation of organs by vitrification: perspectives and recent advances&quot; [Cryobiology 48 (2004) 157–178]|journal=Cryobiology|volume=50|issue=3|page=344|doi=10.1016/j.cryobiol.2005.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has allowed animal brains to be vitrified, warmed back up, and examined for ice damage using light and [[Electron microscope|electron microscopy]].

Costs can include payment for medical personnel to be on call for death, vitrification, transportation in dry ice to a preservation facility, and payment into a trust fund intended to cover indefinite storage in liquid nitrogen and future revival costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent chilling facts&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Cryonics: the chilling facts|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/cryonics-the-chilling-facts-2326328.html|accessdate=21 February 2016|work=[[The Independent]]|date=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes dying hope&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=A Dying Young Woman’s Hope in Cryonics and a Future|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/us/cancer-immortality-cryogenics.html|accessdate=21 February 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, U.S. cryopreservation costs can range from $28,000 to $200,000, and are often financed via life insurance.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent chilling facts&quot; /&gt; [[KrioRus]], which stores bodies communally in large [[Cryogenic storage dewar|dewars]], charges $12,000 to $36,000 for the procedure.&lt;ref name=&quot;ft&quot; /&gt; Some customers opt to have only their brain cryopreserved (&quot;neuropreservation&quot;), rather than their whole body.

As of 2014, about 250 corpses have been cryogenically preserved in the U.S., and around 1,500 people have signed up to have their remains preserved.&lt;ref name=&quot;moen&quot; /&gt; As of 2016, four facilities exist in the world to retain cryopreserved bodies: three in the U.S. and one in Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian keep cool&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='The ultimate lottery ticket:' Inside one of four cryonics facilities in the world|url=http://koin.com/2016/02/17/oregon-cryonics-the-ultimate-lottery-ticket/|accessdate=21 February 2016|work=[[KOIN]] (CBS Portland)|date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking into account the lifecycle of corporations, it is extremely unlikely that any cryonics company could continue to exist for sufficient time to take advantage even of the supposed benefits offered: historically, even the most robust corporations have only a one-in-a-thousand chance of surviving even one hundred years.&lt;ref name=decline&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Cogent Social Sciences |author=Stodolsky DS |title=The growth and decline of cryonics |doi=10.1080/23311886.2016.1167576 |volume=2 |year=2016 |issue=1 |page=1167576}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cryonics companies have failed: {{asof|2018|lc=yes}} all but one of the pre-1973 batch had gone out of business, and their stored corpses have been defrosted and disposed of.&lt;ref name=hta-law&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Human Tissue Authority]] |title=The law on cryonics |url=https://www.hta.gov.uk/law-cryonics |date=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obstacles to success==
=== Preservation damage ===
Without cryoprotectants, [[Cell (biology)|cell]] shrinkage and high [[salt]] concentrations during freezing usually prevent frozen cells from functioning again after thawing. Ice crystals can also disrupt connections between cells that are necessary for organs to function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fahy GM, Levy DI, Ali SE|date=June 1987|title=Some Emerging Principles Underlying the Physical Properties, Biological Actions, and Utility of Vitrification Solutions|journal=Cryobiology|volume=24|issue=3|pages=196–213|doi=10.1016/0011-2240(87)90023-X|pmid=3595164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulties of recovering large animals and their individual organs from a frozen state have been long known.

Actual cryonics organizations use vitrification without a [[fixation (histology)|chemical fixation]] step,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Alcor Position Statement on Brain Preservation Prize| publisher = Alcor Life Extension Foundation| date = 2016-02-12| url = http://www.alcor.org/blog/alcor-position-statement-on-brain-preservation-foundation-prize/ | accessdate =  2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; sacrificing some structural preservation quality for less damage at the molecular level. Some scientists, like Joao Pedro Magalhaes, have questioned whether using a deadly chemical for fixation eliminates the possibility of biological revival, making chemical fixation unsuitable for cryonics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Mammal brain frozen and thawed out perfectly for first time| url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/2077140-mammal-brain-frozen-and-thawed-out-perfectly-for-first-time/| accessdate = 2016-06-06 | work=[[New Scientist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Robert L. McIntyre and [[Gregory Fahy]] at the cryobiology research company [[21st Century Medicine|21st Century Medicine, Inc.]] won the Small Animal Brain Preservation Prize of the [[Brain Preservation Foundation]] by demonstrating to the satisfaction of neuroscientist judges that a particular implementation of fixation and vitrification called ''aldehyde-stabilized cryopreservation''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=McIntyre RL, Fahy GM|date=December 2015|title=Aldehyde-stabilized cryopreservation|journal=Cryobiology|volume=71|issue=3|pages=448–458|doi=10.1016/j.cryobiol.2015.09.003|pmid=26408851}}&lt;/ref&gt; could preserve a rabbit brain in &quot;near perfect&quot; condition at −135&amp;nbsp;[[degree Celsius|°C]], with the cell membranes, synapses, and intracellular structures intact in electron micrographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.popsci.com/researchers-have-preserved-an-entire-rabbit-brain|title=Researchers Have Preserved an Entire Rabbit Brain|author1=Claire Maldarelli|date=9 February 2016|work=[[Popular Science]]|accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-our-minds-live-forever/|title=Can Our Minds Live Forever?|author1=Michael Shermer|date=1 February 2016|work=[[Scientific American]]|accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brain Preservation Foundation President, Ken Hayworth, said, &quot;This result directly answers a main skeptical and scientific criticism against cryonics—that it does not provably preserve the delicate synaptic circuitry of the brain.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/rabbit-brain-first-mammal-brain-return-successfully-cryopreservation-424913|title=Rabbit Brain Returns Successfully from Cryopreservation|author1=Anthony Cuthbertson|date=10 February 2016|work=[[Newsweek]]|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the price paid for perfect preservation as seen by microscopy was tying up all protein molecules with [[Fixation (histology)#Crosslinking fixatives – aldehydes|chemical crosslinks]], completely eliminating [[viable count|biological viability]].

Outside the cryonics community, many scientists have strong skepticism toward cryonics methods. [[Cryobiologist]] Dayong Gao states that &quot;we simply don't know if (subjects have) been damaged to the point where they've 'died' during vitrification because the subjects are now inside liquid nitrogen canisters.&quot; Biochemist Ken Storey argues (based on experience with organ transplants), that &quot;even if you only wanted to preserve the brain, it has dozens of different areas, which would need to be cryopreserved using different protocols.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc frozen&quot; /&gt;

===Revival===
Revival would require repairing damage from lack of oxygen, cryoprotectant toxicity, thermal stress (fracturing), freezing in tissues that do not successfully vitrify, finally followed by reversing the cause of death. In many cases extensive [[Regeneration (biology)|tissue regeneration]] would be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karow|first1=Armand|last2=Webb|first2=Watts|title=Tissue Freezing: A theory for injury and survival|journal=Crybiology|date=1965|volume=2|issue=3|pages=99–108|doi=10.1016/s0011-2240(65)80094-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal issues===
Historically, a person had little control regarding how their body was treated after death as religion held jurisdiction over the ultimate fate of their body.&lt;ref name=&quot;trust&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dukeminier |first1=Jesse | last2= Sitkoff | first2=Robert | date=2013 |title=Wills, Trusts, and Estates |url= |location= |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business in New York |page=507 |isbn=978-1-4548-2457-2 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, secular courts began to exercise jurisdiction over the body and use discretion in carrying out of the wishes of the deceased person.&lt;ref name=&quot;trust&quot; /&gt; Most countries legally treat preserved individuals as [[deceased]] persons because of laws that forbid vitrifying someone who is medically alive.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian frozen in time&quot; /&gt; In France, cryonics is not considered a legal mode of body disposal;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.leparticulier.fr/jcms/c_101664/conseil-d-etat-du-06/01/2006-n-260307-cryogenisation-interdiction |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107144511/http://www.leparticulier.fr/jcms/c_101664/conseil-d-etat-du-06/01/2006-n-260307-cryogenisation-interdiction |archive-date=2014-01-07 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; only burial, cremation, and formal donation to science are allowed.

In London in 2016, the English [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ruled in favor of a mother's right to seek cryopreservation of her terminally ill 14-year-old daughter, as the girl wanted, contrary to the father's wishes. The decision was made on the basis that the case represented a conventional dispute over the disposal of the girl's body, although the judge urged ministers to seek &quot;proper regulation&quot; for the future of cryonic preservation following concerns raised by the hospital about the competence and professionalism of the team that conducted the preservation procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-38012267|title=Terminally ill teen won historic ruling to preserve body|date=November 18, 2016|work=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation]] v. Richardson, the [[Iowa Court of Appeals]] ordered for the disinterment of Richardson, who was buried against his wishes for cryopreservation.&lt;ref name=&quot;trust&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Alcor Life Extension Foundation v.

A detailed legal examination by Jochen Taupitz concludes that cryonic storage is legal in Germany for an indefinite period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Taupitz |first1=Jochen |last2=Fuhr |first2=Günther |last3=Zwick | first3=Anna |last4=Salkic |first4=Amina |date=2013 |title=Unterbrochenes Leben? |url=https://www.bookshop.fraunhofer.de/buch/unterbrochenes-leben/240032 |location=St. Ingbert, Germany |publisher=Fraunhofer Verlag |isbn=978-3-8396-0593-6 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
In 2009, writing in ''[[Bioethics (journal)|Bioethics]]'', David Shaw examines the ethical status of cryonics. The arguments against it include changing the concept of death, the expense of preservation and revival, lack of scientific advancement to permit revival, temptation to use premature euthanasia, and failure due to catastrophe. Arguments in favor of cryonics include the potential benefit to society, the prospect of immortality, and the benefits associated with avoiding death. Shaw explores the expense and the potential payoff, and applies an adapted version of [[Pascal's Wager]] to the question.&lt;ref name=&quot;shaw cryoethics&quot;&gt;Shaw, David. &quot;Cryoethics: seeking life after death.&quot; [[Bioethics (journal)|Bioethics]] 23.9 (2009): 515–521. APA&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Charles Tandy wrote in favor of cryonics, arguing that honoring someone's last wishes is seen as a benevolent duty in American and many other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=2913107|title=An Open Letter to Physicians in Death-with-Dignity States (The Case of a Terminally Ill Cryonicist)|last=Tandy|first=Charles|date=8 Feb 2017|publisher=[[Social Science Research Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cryopreservation was applied to human cells beginning in 1954 with frozen sperm, which was thawed and used to inseminate three women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fatherhood After Death Has Now Been Proved Possible|newspaper=Cedar Rapids Gazette|date=April 9, 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; The freezing of humans was first scientifically proposed by Michigan professor [[Robert Ettinger]] when he wrote ''The Prospect of Immortality'' (1962).&lt;ref name=dilemma&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/18/the-cryonics-dilemma-will-deep-frozen-bodies-be-fit-for-new-life|title=The cryonics dilemma: will deep-frozen bodies be fit for new life?|website=[[The Guardian]]|last=Devlin|first=Hannah|date=18 November 2016|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1966, the first human body was frozen—though it had been embalmed for two months—by being placed in [[liquid nitrogen]] and stored at just above freezing. The middle-aged woman from Los Angeles, whose name is unknown, was soon thawed out and buried by relatives.&lt;ref name=alcor&gt;{{cite web|url=https://alcor.org/Library/html/suspensionfailures.html|title=Suspension Failures – Lessons from the Early Days |last= Perry|first=R. Michael|website=ALCOR: Life Extension Foundation|date=October 2014|accessdate=August 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first body to be frozen with the hope of future revival was [[James Bedford]]'s, a few hours after his cancer-caused death in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Dear Dr. Bedford (and those who will care for you after I do) | publisher=Cryonics | date=July 1991 | url=http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/BedfordLetter.htm | access-date=2009-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bedford's corpse is the only one frozen before 1974 still preserved today.&lt;ref name=alcor/&gt; In 1976, Ettinger founded the [[Cryonics Institute]]; his corpse was cryopreserved in 2011.&lt;ref name=dilemma/&gt; Robert Nelson, &quot;a former TV repairman with no scientific background&quot; who led the Cryonics Society of California, was sued in 1981 for allowing nine bodies to thaw and decompose in the 1970s; in his defense, he claimed that the Society had run out of money.&lt;ref name=alcor/&gt; This led to the lowered reputation of cryonics in the U.S.&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite news|title=Inside the weird world of cryonics|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/d634e198-a435-11e5-873f-68411a84f346.html|accessdate=21 February 2016|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, a [[Y-Combinator]] startup called Nectome was recognized for developing a method of preserving brains with chemicals rather than by freezing.  The method is fatal, performed as euthanasia under general anethesia, but the hope is that future technology would allow the brain to be physically scanned into a computer simulation, neuron by neuron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610456/a-startup-is-pitching-a-mind-uploading-service-that-is-100-percent-fatal/ |title=A startup is pitching a mind-uploading service that is &quot;100 percent fatal&quot; |date=13 March 2018 |magazine=Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', cryonicists are predominantly nonreligious white males, outnumbering women by about three to one.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes do us part&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Howley|first1=Kerry|title=Until Cryonics Do Us Part|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/magazine/11cryonics-t.html|accessdate=2 February 2016|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|date=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', as of 2008, while most cryonicists used to be young, male and &quot;geeky&quot; recent demographics have shifted slightly towards whole families.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian frozen in time&quot; /&gt;

In 2015 Du Hong, a 61-year-old female writer of children's literature, became the first known Chinese national to have their head cryopreserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Chen|url=http://www.scmp.com/tech/science-research/article/1859328/cheating-death-elderly-writer-first-known-chinese-test-subject |title=Cheating death?

==Reception==
Cryonics is generally regarded as a fringe pseudoscience.&lt;ref name=jk&gt;{{cite news |title=Mainstream science is frosty over keeping the dead on ice |author=Steinbeck RL |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=29 September 2002 |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2002-09-29-0209290429-story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Society for Cryobiology]] have rejected as members those who practiced cryonics,&lt;ref name=jk/&gt; and have issued a public statement saying that cryonics is &quot;not science&quot;, and that it is a &quot;personal choice&quot; how people want to have their dead bodies disposed of.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.societyforcryobiology.org/assets/documents/Position_Statement_Cryonics_Nov_18.pdf Present SfC Position statement]&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian company [[KrioRus]] is the only non-US vendor of cryonics services. Yevgeny Alexandrov, chair of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] commission against pseudoscience, said there was &quot;no scientific basis&quot; for cryonics, and that the company's offering was based on &quot;unfounded speculation&quot;.&lt;ref name=rus&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |title='Insurance' against death: Russian cryonics firm plans Swiss lab for people in pursuit of eternal life  |first=Alex |last=Luhn |date=11 November 2017 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/11/11/insurance-against-death-russian-cryonics-firm-plans-swiss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although scientists have expressed skepticism about cryonics in media sources,&lt;ref name=&quot;ft&quot; /&gt; philosopher [[:no:Ole Martin Moen|Ole Martin Moen]] has written that it only receives a &quot;miniscule&quot; amount of attention from academia.&lt;ref name=moen/&gt;

While some neuroscientists contend that all the subtleties of a human mind are contained in its anatomical structure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jerry Adler|title=The Quest to Upload Your Mind Into the Digital Space|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/quest-upload-mind-into-digital-space-180954946/|accessdate=21 February 2016|work=[[Smithsonian Magazine]]|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; few neuroscientists will comment directly upon the topic of cryonics due to its speculative nature. Individuals who intend to be frozen are often &quot;looked at as a bunch of kooks&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brain Freeze: Can putting faith in cryonics deliver life after death?|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2015/10/06/brain-freeze-can-putting-faith-in-cryonics-deliver-life-after-death|work=[[Toronto Sun]]|accessdate=21 February 2016|date=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cryobiologist [[Kenneth B. Storey]] said in 2004 that cryonics is impossible and will never be possible, as cryonics proponents are proposing to &quot;over-turn the laws of physics, chemistry, and molecular science&quot;.&lt;ref name=popsicle&gt;{{cite journal |author=Miller K |title=Cryonics redux: is vitrification a viable alternative to immortality as a popsicle? |journal=Skeptic |volume=11 |issue=1 |year=2004 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurobiologist Michael Hendricks has said that &quot;Reanimation or simulation is an abjectly false hope that is beyond the promise of technology and is certainly impossible with the frozen, dead tissue offered by the 'cryonics' industry&quot;.&lt;ref name=ft/&gt;

[[William T. Jarvis]] has written that &quot;Cryonics might be a suitable subject for scientific research, but marketing an unproven method to the public is quackery&quot;.&lt;ref name=butler&gt;{{cite book |author=Butler K |title=A Consumer's Guide to &quot;Alternative&quot; Medicine |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=1992 |page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=q&gt;

According to cryonicist Aschwin de Wolf and others, cryonics can often produce intense hostility from spouses who are not cryonicists. James Hughes, the executive director of the pro-life-extension [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]], chooses not to personally sign up for cryonics, calling it a worthy experiment but stating laconically that &quot;I value my relationship with my wife.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes do us part&quot; /&gt;

[[Cryobiologist]] Dayong Gao states that &quot;People can always have hope that things will change in the future, but there is no scientific foundation supporting cryonics at this time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc frozen&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Frozen body: Can we return from the dead?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/0/23695785|accessdate=21 February 2016|work=[[BBC News]]|date=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, while it is universally agreed that &quot;[[personal identity]]&quot; is uninterrupted when brain activity temporarily ceases during incidents of accidental drowning (where people have been restored to normal functioning after being completely submerged in cold water for up to 66 minutes), some people express concern that a centuries-long cryopreservation might interrupt their conception of personal identity, such that the revived person would &quot;not be you&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;moen&quot; /&gt;

Many people say there would be no point in being revived in the far future if their friends and families are dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;shaw cryoethics&quot; /&gt;

==In fiction==
{{Main|Suspended animation in fiction}}

[[Suspended animation]] is a popular subject in science fiction and fantasy settings. It is often the means by which a character is transported into the future.

A survey in Germany found that about half of the respondents were familiar with cryonics, and about half of those familiar with cryonics had learned of the subject from films or television.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid24499638&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kaiser S1, Gross D1, Lohmeier J1, Rosentreter M1, Raschke J2 | title=Attitudes and acceptance toward the technology of cryonics in Germany | journal=International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care | volume=5 | year=2014 | pages=1–7 | doi = 10.1017/S0266462313000718 | id= | pmid=24499638 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[urban legend]] suggesting [[Walt Disney]]'s corpse was cryopreserved is false; it was cremated and interred at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mikkelson |first1=David |title=FACT CHECK: Was Walt Disney Frozen? |url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/suspended-animation/ |website=[[Snopes]] |date=19 October 1995|access-date=21 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Robert Nelson told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that he thought Walt Disney wanted to be cryopreserved as [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Studios]] had called him to ask detailed questions about his organisation, the Cryonics Society of California.
