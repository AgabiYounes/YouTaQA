'''Canidae''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|n|ᵻ|d|iː}}&lt;ref&gt;Canidae. Dictionary.com. The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary. Houghton Mifflin Company. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Canidae (accessed: February 16, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; (from Latin, ''canis'', &quot;dog&quot;) is a [[family (biology)|biological family]] of dog-like [[carnivora]]ns. A member of this family is called a canid.{{sfn|Wang|Tedford|2008|pp=181}} There are three [[subfamily|subfamilies]] found within the canid family, which are the extinct [[Borophaginae]] and [[Hesperocyoninae]], and the extant ''[[Caninae]]''.&lt;ref name=miklosi2015/&gt; The ''Caninae'' are known as canines,{{sfn|Wang|Tedford|2008|pp=182}} which includes [[Dog|domestic dogs]], [[Wolf|wolves]], [[Fox|foxes]] and other extant and extinct species.

Canids are found on all continents except [[Antarctica]], having arrived independently or accompanied human beings over extended periods of time. Canids vary in size from the {{Convert|2|m|ft|-long|adj=mid}} gray [[wolf]] to the {{Convert|24|cm|in|-long|adj=mid}} [[fennec fox]]. The body forms of canids are similar, typically having long muzzles, upright ears, teeth adapted for cracking bones and slicing flesh, long legs, and bushy tails. They are mostly [[social animals]], living together in family units or small groups and behaving cooperatively. Typically, only the dominant pair in a group breeds, and a litter of young are reared annually in an underground den. Canids communicate by scent signals and vocalizations. One canid, the domestic dog, long ago entered into a partnership with humans and today remains one of the most widely kept domestic animals.

==Taxonomy==
{{seealso|List of canids}}
In the history of the carnivores, the family Canidae is represented by the two extinct subfamilies designated as Hesperocyoninae and Borophaginae, and the extant subfamily Caninae.&lt;ref name=miklosi2015/&gt; This subfamily includes all living canids and their most recent fossil relatives.&lt;ref name=tedford2009/&gt; All living canids as a group form a dental [[monophyletic]] relationship with the extinct borophagines, with both groups having a [[bicuspid]] (two points) on the lower [[carnassial]] [[talonid]], which gives this tooth an additional ability in [[mastication]]. This, together with the development of a distinct [[Glossary of mammalian dental topography#Lower teeth|entoconid]] cusp and the broadening of the talonid of the first lower [[molar (tooth)|molar]], and the corresponding enlargement of the talon of the upper first molar and reduction of its [[Glossary of mammalian dental topography#Upper teeth|parastyle]] distinguish these late [[Cenozoic]] canids and are the essential differences that identify their clade.&lt;ref name=tedford2009/&gt;{{rp|p6}}

The cat-like [[feliform]]ia and dog-like [[caniform]]s emerged within the [[Carnivoramorpha]] Around 45–42 Mya (million [[year]]s ago).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Flynn | first1 = John J. | last2 = Wesley-Hunt | first2 = Gina D. | year = 2005 | title = Phylogeny of the Carnivora: Basal Relationships Among the Carnivoramorphans, and Assessment of the Position of 'Miacoidea' Relative to Carnivora | url = | journal = Journal of Systematic Palaeontology | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 1–28 | doi=10.1017/s1477201904001518}}&lt;/ref&gt; The caniforms included the fox-like genus ''[[Leptocyon]]'', whose various species existed from 34 Mya before branching 11.9 Mya into Vulpini (foxes) and Canini (canines).&lt;ref name=tedford2009/&gt;{{rp|174–5}}

Within the Canidae, the results of [[allozyme]] and [[chromosome]] analyses have previously suggested several [[phylogenetic]] divisions:
# The [[wolf]]-like canids (genus ''Canis'', ''Cuon'', and ''Lycaon'') include the domestic [[dog]] ''(Canis lupus familiaris)'', gray [[wolf]] (''Canis lupus''), [[red wolf]] (''Canis rufus''), [[eastern wolf]] (''Canis lycaon''), [[coyote]] (''Canis latrans''), Eurasian [[golden jackal]] (''Canis aureus''), [[African golden wolf]] (''Canis anthus''), [[Ethiopian wolf]] (''Canis simensis''), [[black-backed jackal]] (''Canis mesomelas''), [[side-striped jackal]] (''Canis adustus''), [[dhole]] (''Cuon alpinus''), and [[African wild dog]] (''Lycaon pictus'').&lt;ref name=wayne1993/&gt;
# The fox-like canids include the [[kit fox]] (''Vulpes velox''), [[red fox]] (''Vulpes vulpes''), [[Cape fox]] (''Vulpes chama''), [[Arctic fox]] (''Vulpes lagopus''), and [[fennec fox]] (''Vulpes zerda'').&lt;ref name=wayne1993/&gt;
# The South American canids include the [[bush dog]] (''Speothos venaticus''), [[hoary fox]] (''Lycalopex uetulus''), [[crab-eating fox]] (''Cerdocyon thous''), and [[maned wolf]] (''Chrysocyon brachyurus'').&lt;ref name=wayne1993/&gt;
# Various [[monotypic taxa]] include the [[bat-eared fox]] (''Otocyon megalotis''), [[gray fox]] (''Urocyon cinereoargenteus''), and [[raccoon dog]] (''Nyctereutes procyonoides'').&lt;ref name=wayne1993/&gt;

[[DNA]] analysis shows that the first three form [[monophyletic]] [[clade]]s. The wolf-like canids and the South American canids together form the tribe Canini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Behavioural Biology of Dogs |last=Jensen |first=Per |year=2007 |publisher=CABI |isbn=978-1-84593-188-9 |pages=11–13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SpkSd__EdKYC&amp;pg=PA3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular data imply a North American origin of living Canidae some 10 Mya and an African origin of wolf-like canines (''Canis'', ''Cuon'', and ''Lycaon''), with the jackals being the most [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] of this group. The South American clade is rooted by the maned wolf and bush dog, and the fox-like canids by the fennec fox and Blanford's fox. The gray fox and island fox are basal to the other clades; however, this topological difference is not strongly supported.&lt;ref name=Lindblad-toh2005&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1038/nature04338|pmid= 16341006|title= Genome sequence, comparative analysis and haplotype structure of the domestic dog|journal= Nature|volume= 438|issue= #7069|pages=803 in 803–19 |year= 2005|last1= Lindblad-Toh|first1= Kerstin|last2= Wade|first2= Claire M|last3= Mikkelsen|first3= Tarjei S.|last4= Karlsson|first4= Elinor K.|last5= Jaffe|first5= David B.|last6= Kamal|first6= Michael|last7= Clamp|first7= Michele|last8= Chang|first8= Jean L.|last9= Kulbokas|first9= Edward J.|last10= Zody|first10= Michael C.|last11= Mauceli|first11= Evan|last12= Xie|first12= Xiaohui|last13= Breen|first13= Matthew|last14= Wayne|first14= Robert K.|last15= Ostrander|first15= Elaine A.|last16= Ponting|first16= Chris P.|last17= Galibert|first17= Francis|last18= Smith|first18= Douglas R.|last19= Dejong|first19= Pieter J.|last20= Kirkness|first20= Ewen|last21= Alvarez|first21= Pablo|last22= Biagi|first22= Tara|last23= Brockman|first23= William|last24= Butler|first24= Jonathan|last25= Chin|first25= Chee-Wye|last26= Cook|first26= April|last27= Cuff|first27= James|last28= Daly|first28= Mark J.|last29= Decaprio|first29= David|last30= Gnerre|first30= Sante|display-authors= 29|bibcode= 2005Natur.438..803L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
The Canidae today includes a diverse group of some 34 species ranging in size from the maned wolf with its long limbs to the short-legged bush dog. Modern canids inhabit forests, tundra, savannahs, and deserts throughout tropical and temperate parts of the world. The evolutionary relationships between the species have been studied in the past using [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] approaches, but more recently, molecular studies have enabled the investigation of [[phylogenetics]] relationships. In some species, [[genetic divergence]] has been suppressed by the high level of [[gene flow]] between different populations and where the species have hybridized, large [[hybrid zone]]s exist.&lt;ref name=Wayne&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wooferhouse.net/Links/MolecularEvolutionOfTheDogFamily/MolecularEvolutionOfTheDogFamily.htm |title=Molecular evolution of the dog family |author=Wayne, Robert K. |accessdate=2014-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carnivora]]ns evolved from [[miacoid]]s about 55 Mya during the late [[Paleocene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paleodb.org/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?action=checkTaxonInfo&amp;taxon_no=57534&amp;is_real_user=1 |title=The Paleobiology Database |publisher=Paleodb.org |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 5 million years later, the carnivorans split into two main divisions: [[caniforms]] (dog-like) and [[feliforms]] (cat-like). By 40 Mya, the first member of the dog family proper had arisen. Called ''[[Prohesperocyon]] wilsoni'', its fossilized remains have been found in what is now the southwestern part of Texas. The chief features which identify it as a canid include the loss of the upper third molar (part of a trend toward a more shearing bite), and the structure of the middle ear which has an enlarged [[Tympanic part of the temporal bone|bulla]] (the hollow bony structure protecting the delicate parts of the ear). ''Prohesperocyon'' probably had slightly longer limbs than its predecessors, and also had parallel and closely touching toes which differ markedly from the splayed arrangements of the digits in [[bear]]s.&lt;ref name=Wang-Tedford&gt;{{cite magazine| last = Wang| first = Xiaoming| year = 2008| title = How Dogs Came to Run the World|magazine=Natural History Magazine| volume = July/August| url = http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/features/15771/how-dogs-came-to-run-the-world| accessdate = 2014-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The canid family soon subdivided into three subfamilies, each of which diverged during the Eocene: [[Hesperocyoninae]] (about 39.74–15 Mya), [[Borophaginae]] (about 34–2 Mya), and [[Caninae]] (about 34–0 Mya). The Caninae are the only surviving subfamily and all present-day canids, including wolves, foxes, coyotes, jackals, and domestic dogs, belong to it. Members of each subfamily showed an [[Cope's rule|increase in body mass with time]] and some exhibited specialized [[hypercarnivorous]] diets that made them prone to extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = B.| last2 = Wang| last1 = Van Valkenburgh | first2 = X. | first3 = J. | title=Cope's Rule, Hypercarnivory, and Extinction in North American Canids| last3 = Damuth | journal=Science | volume=306| issue = #5693 | pages=101–104 | date=October 2004 | issn = 0036-8075| pmid = 15459388 | doi=10.1126/science.1102417|bibcode = 2004Sci...306..101V | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/479cfa8a1eb19677fb6c169c77dab60c3d419053}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Fig. 1}}

===Oligocene epoch===
By the [[Oligocene]], all three subfamilies of canids (Hesperocyoninae, Borophaginae, and Caninae) had appeared in the fossil records of North America. The earliest and most primitive branch of the Canidae was the Hesperocyoninae lineage, which included the coyote-sized ''[[Mesocyon]]'' of the Oligocene (38–24 Mya). These early canids probably evolved for the fast pursuit of prey in a grassland habitat; they resembled modern [[civet]]s in appearance. Hesperocyonines eventually became extinct in the middle Miocene. One of the early members of the Hesperocyonines, the genus ''[[Hesperocyon]]'', gave rise to ''[[Archaeocyon]]'' and ''[[Leptocyon]]''. These branches led to the borophagine and canine [[evolutionary radiation|radiations]].&lt;ref name=Gittleman&gt;Martin, L.D. 1989. Fossil history of the terrestrial carnivora. Pages&amp;nbsp;536–568 in J.L. Gittleman, editor. Carnivore Behavior, Ecology, and Evolution, Vol. 1. Comstock Publishing Associates: Ithaca.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miocene epoch===
Around 9–10 mya during the [[Late Miocene]], the ''[[Canis]]'', ''[[Urocyon]]'', and ''[[Vulpes]]'' genera expanded from southwestern [[North America]], where the canine radiation began. The success of these canines was related to the development of lower [[carnassial]]s that were capable of both [[mastication]] and shearing.&lt;ref name=Gittleman/&gt; Around 8 Mya, the [[Beringia]]n land bridge allowed members of the genus ''[[Eucyon]]'' a means to enter Asia and they continued on to colonize Europe.&lt;ref name=Perini&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Perini, F.

===Pliocene epoch===
During the [[Pliocene]], around 4–5 Mya, ''[[Canis lepophagus]]'' appeared in North America. This was small and sometimes coyote-like. Others were wolf-like in characteristics. ''C. latrans'' (the coyote) is theorized to have descended from ''C. lepophagus''.&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, R.M. 1979. North American Quaternary Canis. Monograph of the Museum of Natural History, University of Kansas 6:1 – 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]], about 3 Mya, joined [[South America]] to North America, allowing canids to [[Great American Interchange|invade South America]], where they diversified. However, the most recent common ancestor of the South American canids lived in North America some 4 Mya and more than one incursion across the new land bridge is likely. One of the resulting lineages consisted of the [[gray fox]] (''Urocyon cinereoargentus'') and the now-extinct [[dire wolf]] (''Canis dirus''). The other lineage consisted of the so-called South American endemic species; the maned wolf (''Chrysocyon brachyurus''), the [[short-eared dog]] (''Atelocynus microtis''), the [[bush dog]] (''Speothos venaticus''), the crab-eating fox (''Cerdocyon thous''), and the [[South American fox]]es (''Lycalopex'' spp.). The monophyly of this group has been established by molecular means.&lt;ref name=Perini/&gt;

===Pleistocene epoch===
During the [[Pleistocene]], the North American wolf line appeared, with ''[[Canis edwardii]]'', clearly identifiable as a wolf, and ''[[Canis rufus]]'' appeared, possibly a direct descendant of ''C. edwardii''. Around 0.8 Mya, ''[[Canis ambrusteri]]'' emerged in North America. A large wolf, it was found all over North and Central America and was eventually supplanted by its descendant, the dire wolf, which then spread into South America during the Late Pleistocene.&lt;ref name=Larson&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exhibits.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/larson/canis.html |title=Wolves, coyotes and dogs (Genus ''Canis'') |author=Larson, Robert |work=The Midwestern United States 16,000 years ago |publisher=Illinois State Museum |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 0.3 Mya, a number of subspecies of the gray wolf (''C. lupus'') had developed and had spread throughout Europe and northern Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, R. 1992. &quot;Wolves: The great travelers of evolution&quot;. ''International Wolf'' 2 (#4):3 – 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The gray wolf colonized North America during the late [[Rancholabrean]] era across the Bering land bridge, with at least three separate invasions, with each one consisting of one or more different Eurasian gray wolf clades.&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;{{cite journal |title=An account of the taxonomy of North American wolves from morphological and genetic analyses |author=Chambers, S.

It may have been more of a scavenger than a hunter; its molars appear to be adapted for crushing bones and it may have gone extinct as a result of the extinction of the large herbivorous animals on whose carcasses it relied.&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;

In 2015, a study of mitochondrial genome sequences and whole-genome nuclear sequences of African and Eurasian canids indicated that extant wolf-like canids have colonized Africa from Eurasia at least five times throughout the Pliocene and Pleistocene, which is consistent with fossil evidence suggesting that much of African canid fauna diversity resulted from the immigration of Eurasian ancestors, likely coincident with Plio-Pleistocene climatic oscillations between arid and humid conditions. When comparing the African and Eurasian golden jackals, the study concluded that the African specimens represented a distinct monophyletic lineage that should be recognized as a separate species, ''Canis anthus'' ([[African golden wolf]]). According to a phylogeny derived from nuclear sequences, the Eurasian golden jackal (''Canis aureus'') diverged from the wolf/coyote lineage 1.9 Mya, but the African golden wolf separated 1.3 Mya. Mitochondrial genome sequences indicated the Ethiopian wolf diverged from the wolf/coyote lineage slightly prior to that.&lt;ref name=Koepfli-2015&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.06.060|pmid=26234211|title=Genome-wide Evidence Reveals that African and Eurasian Golden Jackals Are Distinct Species|journal=Current Biology|volume=25 |issue=#16 |pages=2158–65 |year=2015 |last1=Koepfli |first1=Klaus-Peter |last2=Pollinger |first2=John |last3=Godinho |first3=Raquel |last4=Robinson |first4=Jacqueline |last5=Lea|first5=Amanda |last6=Hendricks|first6=Sarah|last7=Schweizer|first7=Rena M.|last8=Thalmann|first8=Olaf|last9=Silva|first9=Pedro|last10=Fan|first10=Zhenxin|last11=Yurchenko|first11=Andrey A.|last12=Dobrynin|first12=Pavel|last13=Makunin|first13=Alexey|last14=Cahill|first14=James A.|last15=Shapiro|first15=Beth|last16=Álvares|first16=Francisco|last17=Brito|first17=José C.|last18=Geffen|first18=Eli|last19=Leonard|first19=Jennifer A.|last20=Helgen|first20=Kristofer M.|last21=Johnson|first21=Warren E.|last22=o'Brien|first22=Stephen J.|last23=Van Valkenburgh|first23=Blaire|last24=Wayne|first24=Robert K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|S1}}

All canids have a similar basic form, as exemplified by the gray wolf, although the relative length of muzzle, limbs, ears, and tail vary considerably between species. With the exceptions of the bush dog, the raccoon dog and some [[Dog breed|domestic breeds of ''Canis lupus'']], canids have relatively long legs and lithe bodies, adapted for chasing prey. The tails are bushy and the length and quality of the pelage vary with the season. The muzzle portion of the skull is much more elongated than that of the cat family. The [[zygomatic arch]]es are wide, there is a transverse [[lambdoidal]] ridge at the rear of the [[cranium]] and in some species, a [[sagittal crest]] running from front to back. The bony orbits around the eye never form a complete ring and the auditory bullae are smooth and rounded.&lt;ref name=Mivart&gt;{{cite book |title=Dogs, Jackals, Wolves, and Foxes: A Monograph of the Canidae |last=Mivart |first=St. George Jackson |year=1890 |pages=xiv–xxxvi |url=https://archive.org/details/dogsjackalswolv00keulgoog |publisher=London : R.H.

[[File:Black-backed Jackal skeleton.jpg|thumb|Skeleton of a black-backed jackal (''[[Canis mesomelas]]'') on display at the [[Museum of Osteology]]]]
All canids are [[digitigrade]], meaning they walk on their toes. The [[Rhinarium|tip of the nose]] is always naked, as are the cushioned pads on the soles of the feet. These latter consist of a single pad behind the tip of each toe and a more-or-less three-lobed central pad under the roots of the digits. Hairs grow between the pads and in the Arctic fox, the sole of the foot is densely covered with hair at some times of the year. With the exception of the four-toed African wild dog (''Lycaon pictus''), five toes are on the forefeet, but the pollex (thumb) is reduced and does not reach the ground. On the hind feet are four toes, but in some domestic dogs, a fifth vestigial toe, known as a [[dewclaw]], is sometimes present, but has no anatomical connection to the rest of the foot. The slightly curved nails are not retractile and more-or-less blunt.&lt;ref name=Mivart/&gt;

The [[Canine penis|penis in male canids]] is supported by a bone called the [[baculum]]. It also contains a structure at the base called the [[bulbus glandis]], which helps to create a [[copulatory tie]] during mating, locking the animals together for up to an hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ewer1973&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Ewer, R. F. |title=The Carnivores|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IETMd3-lSlkC|year=1973|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8493-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young canids are born blind, with their eyes opening a few weeks after birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Macdonald, D.|year= 1984|title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location= New York|page= [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofma00mals_0/page/57 57]|isbn= 978-0-87196-871-5|url= https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofma00mals_0/page/57}}&lt;/ref&gt; All living canids (Caninae) have a ligament analogous to the [[nuchal ligament]] of [[ungulates]] used to maintain the posture of the head and neckwith little active muscle exertion; this ligament allows them to conserve energy while running long distances following scent trails with their nose to the ground. However, based on skeletal details of the neck, at least some of the Borophaginae (such as ''[[Aelurodon]]'') are believed to have lacked this ligament.{{sfn|Wang|Tedford|2008|pp=97–98}}

===Dentition===
[[File:Wolf cranium labelled.jpg|thumb|300px|Diagram of a wolf skull with key features labelled]]
[[File:Lupocranio.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eurasian wolf]] skull]]

[[Dentition]] relates to the arrangement of teeth in the mouth, with the [[Dentition#Dental formula|dental notation]] for the upper-jaw teeth using the upper-case letters I to denote [[incisors]], C for [[Canine tooth|canines]], P for [[premolars]], and M for [[molars]], and the lower-case letters i, c, p and m to denote the [[Mandible|mandible teeth]]. Teeth are numbered using one side of the mouth and from the front of the mouth to the back. In [[carnivores]], the upper premolar P4 and the lower molar m1 form the [[carnassials]] that are used together in a scissor-like action to shear the muscle and tendon of prey.{{sfn|Wang|Tedford|2008|pp=74}}

Canids use their premolars for cutting and crushing except for the upper fourth premolar P4 (the upper carnassial) that is only used for cutting. They use their molars for grinding except for the lower first molar m1 (the lower carnassial) that has evolved for both cutting and grinding depending on the candid's dietary adaptation. On the lower carnassial, the [[trigonid]] is used for slicing and the [[talonid]] is used for grinding. The ratio between the trigonid and the talonid indicates a carnivore's dietary habits, with a larger trigonid indicating a [[hypercarnivore]] and a larger talonid indicating a more [[Omnivore|omnivorous]] diet.&lt;ref name=sansalone2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=cherin2013/&gt; Because of its low variability, the length of the lower carnassial is used to provide an estimate of a carnivore's body size.&lt;ref name=sansalone2015/&gt;

A study of the estimated bite force at the canine teeth of a large sample of living and fossil mammalian predators, when adjusted for their body mass, found that for [[placental]] mammals the bite force at the canines &lt;!-- (in [[Newton (unit)|Newtons]]/kilogram of body weight) --&gt; was greatest in the extinct dire wolf (163), followed among the modern canids by the four hypercarnivores that often prey on animals larger than themselves: the African wild dog (142), the gray wolf (136), the dhole (112), and the dingo (108). The bite force at the carnassials showed a similar trend to the canines. A predator's largest prey size is strongly influenced by its biomechanical limits.&lt;ref name=wroe2005/&gt;

Most canids have 42 [[teeth]], with a [[dentition|dental formula]] of: {{DentalFormula|upper=3.1.4.2|lower=3.1.4.3}}. The bush dog has only one upper molar with two below, the dhole has two above and two below. and the bat-eared fox has three or four upper molars and four lower ones.&lt;ref name=Mivart/&gt; The molar teeth are strong in most species, allowing the animals to crack open bone to reach the [[bone marrow|marrow]]. The deciduous, or baby teeth, formula in canids is {{DentalFormula|upper=3.1.3|lower=3.1.3}}, molars being completely absent.&lt;ref name=Mivart/&gt;

{{See also|Gray wolf#Behaviour|Dog behavior|Red fox#Behaviour|African wild dog#Behaviour}}
Almost all canids are social animals and live together in groups. In general, they are territorial or have a home range and sleep in the open, using their dens only for breeding and sometimes in bad weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Stephen |last2=Yalden |first2=Derek |title=Mammals of the British Isles|publisher=Mammal Society|edition=4th revised |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-906282-65-6 |page=413 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In most foxes, and in many of the true dogs, a [[breeding pair|male and female pair]] work together to hunt and to raise their young. Gray wolves and some of the other larger canids live in larger groups called [[pack (canine)|packs]]. African wild dogs have packs which may consist of 20 to 40 animals and packs of fewer than about seven individuals may be incapable of successful reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.patriciamcconnell.com/theotherendoftheleash/comparative-canid-behavior |title=Comparative canid behaviour |author=McConnell, Patricia B. |date=2009-08-31 |work=The other end of the leash |accessdate=2014-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunting in packs has the advantage that larger prey items can be tackled. Some species form packs or live in small family groups depending on the circumstances, including the type of available food. In most species, some individuals live on their own. Within a canid pack, there is a system of dominance so that the strongest, most experienced animals lead the pack. In most cases, the dominant male and female are the only pack members to breed.&lt;ref name=ADW&gt;{{cite web | title = Canidae: Coyotes, dogs, foxes, jackals, and wolves | work = Animal Diversity Web | publisher =University of Michigan| url = http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Canidae/ | accessdate = 2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canids communicate with each other by [[Territory (animal)|scent signals]], by visual clues and gestures, and by vocalizations such as growls, barks, and howls. In most cases, groups have a home territory from which they drive out other [[conspecific]]s. The territory is [[Urination|marked by leaving urine scent marks]], which warn trespassing individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, R. M.; Paradiso, J. L. 1983. ''Walker's Mammals of the World''. Baltimore, Maryland: The Johns Hopkins University Press. {{ISBN|0-8018-2525-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Social behavior is also mediated by secretions from glands on the upper surface of the tail near its root and from the [[anal gland]]s.&lt;ref name=ADW/&gt;

Canids as a group exhibit several reproductive traits that are uncommon among mammals as a whole. They are typically [[monogamous]], provide paternal care to their offspring, have reproductive cycles with lengthy [[Estrous cycle#Proestrus|proestral]] and [[Estrous cycle#Metestrus or diestrus|dioestral]] phases and have a copulatory tie during mating. They also retain adult offspring in the social group, suppressing the ability of these to breed while making use of the [[Alloparenting|alloparental care]] they can provide to help raise the next generation of offspring.&lt;ref name=Asa&gt;{{cite book |title=A review of Small Canid Reproduction: in The Swift Fox: Ecology and Conservation of Swift Foxes in a Changing World |editor-last=Asa |editor-first=Cheryl S. |editor2-last=Valdespino|editor2-first=Carolina|editor3-last=Carbyn|editor3-first=Ludwig N.|editor4-last= Sovada|editor4-first=Marsha Ann |year=2003 |publisher=University of Regina Press |isbn=978-0-88977-154-3 |pages=117–123 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Er1di1OqnlAC&amp;pg=PA117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the proestral period, increased levels of o[[estradiol]] make the female attractive to the male. There is a rise in [[progesterone]] during the oestral phase and the female is now receptive. Following this, the level of oestradiol fluctuates and there is a lengthy dioestrous phase during which the female is pregnant. [[Pseudo-pregnancy]] frequently occurs in canids that have ovulated but failed to conceive. A period of [[Estrous cycle#anestrus|anoestrus]] follows pregnancy or pseudo-pregnancy, there being only one oestral period during each breeding season. Small and medium-sized canids mostly have a [[gestation]] period of 50 to 60 days, while larger species average 60 to 65 days. The time of year in which the breeding season occurs is related to the length of day, as has been demonstrated in the case of several species that have been translocated across the equator to the other hemisphere and experiences a six-month shift of phase. Domestic dogs and certain small canids in captivity may come into oestrus more frequently, perhaps because the [[photoperiod]] stimulus breaks down under conditions of artificial lighting.&lt;ref name=Asa/&gt;

The size of a litter varies, with from one to 16 or more pups being born. The young are born small, blind and helpless and require a long period of parental care. They are kept in a den, most often dug into the ground, for warmth and protection.&lt;ref name=Mivart/&gt; When the young begin eating solid food, both parents, and often other pack members, bring food back for them from the hunt.

One canid, the [[Origin of the domestic dog|domestic dog]], entered into a partnership with humans a long time ago. The dog was the first domesticated species.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;&lt;ref name=perri2016/&gt; The archaeological record shows the first undisputed dog remains buried beside humans 14,700&amp;nbsp;years ago,&lt;ref name=giemsch2015/&gt; with disputed remains occurring 36,000&amp;nbsp;years ago.&lt;ref name=germonpre2009/&gt; These dates imply that the earliest dogs arose in the time of human [[hunter-gatherer]]s and not [[agriculturists]].&lt;ref name=thalmann2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=freedman2014/&gt;

The fact that wolves are pack animals with cooperative social structures may have been the reason that the relationship developed. Humans benefited from the canid's loyalty, cooperation, teamwork, alertness and tracking abilities, while the wolf may have benefited from the use of weapons to tackle larger prey and the sharing of food. Humans and dogs may have evolved together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Schleidt, Wolfgang M. |author2=Shalter, Michael D. |year=2003 |title=Co-evolution of humans and canids: An alternative view of dog domestication: Homo homini lupus? |journal=Evolution and Cognition |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=57–72 |url=https://www.uwsp.edu/psych/s/275/Science/Coevolution03.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411142919/http://www4.uwsp.edu/psych/s/275/science/coevolution03.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-11 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
