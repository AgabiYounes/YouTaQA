'''Cheerleading''' is an activity in which the participants (called &quot;cheerleaders&quot;) cheer for their team as a form of encouragement. It can range from chanting slogans to intense [[Physical exercise|physical activity]]. It can be performed to motivate sports teams, to entertain the audience, or for competition. Competitive routines typically range anywhere from one to three minutes, and contain components of [[Tumbling (gymnastics)|tumbling]], [[dance]], [[List of cheerleading jumps|jumps]], [[cheering|cheers]], and [[List of cheerleading stunts|stunting]].

Cheerleading originated in the United States, and remains predominantly in America, with an estimated 1.5 million participants in all-star cheerleading. The global presentation of cheerleading was led by the 1997 broadcast of  [[ESPN]]'s International cheerleading competition, and the worldwide release of the 2000 film ''[[Bring It On (film)|Bring It On]]''. Due in part to this recent exposure, there are now an estimated 100,000 participants scattered around the globe in Australia, Canada, China, Colombia, Finland, France, Germany, [[Cheerleading in Japan|Japan]], the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;nw20007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campo-Flores| first=Arian |title=A World of Cheer! |journal=[[Newsweek]] |date=2007-05-14 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/34924 |accessdate=2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Before organized cheerleading===

Cheerleading began during the late 18th century with the rebellion of male students.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golden, Suzi J. 2004, p. 5&quot;&gt;Golden, Suzi J. ''Best Cheers: How to Be the Best Cheerleader Ever''! WA: Becker &amp; Mayer, 2004, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[American Revolutionary War]], students experienced harsh treatment from teachers. In response to faculty's abuse, college students violently acted out. The undergraduates began to riot, burn down buildings located on their college campuses, and assault faculty members. As a more subtle way to gain independence, however, students invented and organized their own extracurricular activities outside their professors' control. This brought about American sports, beginning first with collegiate teams.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Mary Ellen. ''Go! Fight! Win!: Cheerleading in American Culture.'' Bowling Green, OH: Bowling Green State Univ. Popular, 1995, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s, students from [[Great Britain]] began to cheer and chant in unison for their favorite athletes at sporting events. Soon, that gesture of support crossed overseas to America.&lt;ref name=&quot;lshs.leesummit.k12.mo.us&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lshs.leesummit.k12.mo.us/studentprojects/0506/fall05/3rdproject/tbcheer/history.htm|title=History of Cheerleading|last=Unknown Author|website=Lee's Summit High School student projects|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218124302/http://lshs.leesummit.k12.mo.us/studentprojects/0506/fall05/3rdproject/tbcheer/history.htm|archive-date=2007-02-18|url-status=|access-date=2007-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 1869, the United States witnessed its first [[college football|intercollegiate football]] game. It took place between Princeton and [[Rutgers University]], and marked the day the original &quot;Sis Boom Rah!&quot; cheer was shouted out by student fans.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebscohost.com&quot;&gt;http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?wid=5&amp;hid=138&amp;sid=76593of7-86e8-413b-8483-6f6cf5647f11@sessionmgr110&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGIZZQ==#db=f6h%25NV=47640654{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;Princeton.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~oktour/virtualtour/french/Hist14-Football.htm |title=First Intercollegiate Football Game; Princeton.edu |publisher=princeton.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginning of organized cheer===
[[File:JCampbell.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Minnesota Golden Gophers Spirit Squads|Minnesota Gopher]] cheerleader Johnny Campbell]]
Organized cheerleading started as an all-male activity.&lt;ref&gt;https://cheerunion.org.ismmedia.com/ISM3/std-content/repos/Top/docs/ICU_History_2018.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1877, [[Princeton University]] had a &quot;Princeton Cheer&quot;, documented in the February 22, 1877, March 12, 1880, and November 4, 1881, issues of ''[[The Daily Princetonian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theprince.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/princeton?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=Princetonian18770222-01.2.12&amp;srpos=1 ''The Daily Princetonian''].

'''6'''(8): 5 November 4, 1881.&lt;/ref&gt; This cheer was yelled from the stands by students attending games, as well as by the athletes themselves. The cheer, &quot;Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Tiger! S-s-s-t! Boom! A-h-h-h!&quot; remains in use with slight modifications today, where it is now referred to as the &quot;Locomotive&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/football/songs.html |title=Princeton University website Songs and Cheers |publisher=Princeton.edu |accessdate=2012-08-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102092442/http://www.princeton.edu/football/songs.html |archivedate=2012-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Princeton class of 1882 graduate [[Thomas Peebles (American football)|Thomas Peebles]] moved to Minnesota in 1884. He transplanted the idea of organized crowds cheering at football games to the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers Spirit Squads|University of Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.today/20120709224633/http://files.usgwarchives.org/mn/hennepin/bios/1923/peeblest.txt &quot;Thomas Peebles&quot;]. ''History of Minneapolis, Gateway to the Northwest'' Chicago-Minneapolis: The S J Clarke Publishing Co. 1923. Marion Daniel Shutter, ed. Volume III: Biographical, pp. 719–720.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cheerunion.org/Content.aspx/History |title=International Cheer Union, Governing Body of International Cheerleading Website: History of Cheerleading |publisher=Cheerunion.org |date=1989-01-01 |accessdate=2012-08-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723193811/http://www.cheerunion.org/Content.aspx/History |archivedate=2012-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term &quot;Cheer Leader&quot; had been used as early as 1897, with Princeton's football officials having named three students as ''Cheer Leaders:'' Thomas, Easton, and Guerin from Princeton's classes of 1897, 1898, and 1899, respectively, on October 26, 1897. These students would cheer for the team also at football practices, and special cheering sections were designated in the stands for the games themselves for both the home and visiting teams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theprince.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/princeton?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=Princetonian18971026-01.2.11 ''The Daily Princetonian''].

'''25'''(112): 2. November 1, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until 1898 that University of Minnesota student Johnny Campbell directed a crowd in cheering &quot;Rah, Rah, Rah! Ski-u-mah, Hoo-Rah! Hoo-Rah! Varsity! Varsity! Varsity, Minn-e-So-Tah!&quot;, making Campbell the very first cheerleader.

November 2, 1898 is the official birth date of organized cheerleading. Soon after, the University of Minnesota organized a &quot;yell leader&quot; squad of six male students, who still use Campbell's original cheer today.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICFHandbook&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last=Neil | first=Randy L. | last2=Hart | first2=Elaine | title=The Official Cheerleader's Handbook | publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | year=1986 | edition=Revised Fireside Edition 1986 | isbn=978-0-671-61210-8 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/allnewofficialch00neil }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1903, the first cheerleading [[fraternities and sororities|fraternity]], Gamma Sigma, was founded.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACFeb2003&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Walker | first=Marisa | title=Cheer Milestones | journal=American Cheerleader | volume= 11 | issue=1 | pages=41–43 | date=February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Early women cheerleaders at UW Madison (2246608893).jpg|thumb|left|Cheerleaders at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1948]]

===Female participation===
In 1923, at the [[University of Minnesota]], women were permitted to participate in cheerleading.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebscohost.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pedia.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cheerleader.pedia.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718053056/http://www.cheerleader.pedia.com/ |archivedate=2012-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it took time for other schools to follow. In the late 1920s, many school manuals and newspapers that were published still referred to cheerleaders as &quot;chap,&quot; &quot;fellow,&quot; and &quot;man&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Mary Ellen. ''Go! Fight! Win!: Cheerleading in American Culture.'' Bowling Green, OH: Bowling Green State Univ. Popular, 1995, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Women cheerleaders were overlooked until the 1940s when collegiate men were drafted for [[World War II]], creating the opportunity for more women to make their way onto sporting event sidelines.&lt;ref&gt;Golden, Suzi J. Best Cheers: How to Be the Best Cheerleader Ever! WA: Becker &amp; Mayer, 2004, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by [[Kieran Scott]] in ''Ultimate Cheerleading'': &quot;Girls really took over for the first time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Craig. ''Chants, Cheers, and Jumps.'' Philadelphia: Mason Crest, 2003, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; An overview written on behalf of cheerleading in 1955 explained that in larger schools, &quot;occasionally boys as well as girls are included,&quot;, and in smaller schools, &quot;boys can usually find their place in the athletic program, and cheerleading is likely to remain solely a feminine occupation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Mary Ellen. ''Go! Fight! Win!: Cheerleading in American Culture.'' Bowling Green, OH: Bowling Green State Univ. Popular, 1995, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s, female participation in cheerleading continued to grow and by the 1970s, it was girls primarily cheering at public school games.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Mary Ellen. ''Go! Fight! Win!: Cheerleading in American Culture.'' Bowling Green, OH: Bowling Green State Univ. Popular, 1995, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Cheerleading could be found at almost every school level across the country, even pee wee and youth leagues began to appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varsity.com/event/1261/being-a-cheerleader-history.aspx|title=Being a Cheerleader - History of Cheerleading|website=Varsity.com|accessdate=19 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201182310/https://www.varsity.com/event/1261/being-a-cheerleader-history.aspx|archive-date=2017-12-01|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Mary Ellen. ''Go! Fight! Win!: Cheerleading in American Culture.'' Bowling Green, OH: Bowling Green State Univ. Popular, 1995, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, it was estimated by a man named Randy Neil that over 500,000 students actively participated in American cheerleading from elementary school to the collegiate level. He also approximated that ninety-five percent of cheerleaders within America were female.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Mary Ellen. ''Go! Fight! Win!: Cheerleading in American Culture.'' Bowling Green, OH: Bowling Green State Univ. Popular, 1995, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2005, overall statistics show around 97% of all modern cheerleading participants are female, although at the collegiate level, cheerleading is co-ed with about 50% of participants being male.&lt;ref name=&quot;popwarner&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Balthaser | first=Joel D. | title=Cheerleading – Oh How far it has come! | publisher=[[Pop Warner Little Scholars|Pop Warner]] | date=2005-01-06 | url=http://www.popwarner.com/articles/phenomenon.asp | accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cheerleading firsts===

In 1948, Lawrence &quot;Herkie&quot; Herkimer, of Dallas, Texas, a former cheerleader at [[Southern Methodist University]], formed the [[National Cheerleaders Association]] (NCA) in order to hold clinics for cheerleading. In 1949, The NCA held its first clinic in Huntsville, Texas, with 52 girls in attendance.&lt;ref name=&quot;popwarner&quot;/&gt; Herkimer contributed many firsts to cheerleading: the founding of the Cheerleader &amp; Danz Team [[cheerleading uniform]] supply company, inventing the [[herkie]] jump (where one leg is bent towards the ground as if kneeling and the other is out to the side as high as it will stretch in toe-touch position),&lt;ref name=&quot;cheerleading.about&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Cheerleading Jump Herkie | url=http://cheerleading.about.com/cs/jumps/g/herkie.htm | accessdate=2007-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and creating the &quot;Spirit Stick&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACFeb2003&quot;/&gt; By the 1960s, college cheerleaders began hosting workshops across the nation, teaching fundamental cheer skills to high-school-age girls. In 1965, Fred Gastoff invented the vinyl [[pom-pom]], which was introduced into competitions by the International Cheerleading Foundation (ICF, now the World Cheerleading Association, or WCA). Organized cheerleading competitions began to pop up with the first ranking of the &quot;Top Ten College Cheerleading Squads&quot; and &quot;Cheerleader All America&quot; awards given out by the ICF in 1967. In 1978, America was introduced to competitive cheerleading by the first broadcast of [[Collegiate Cheerleading Championships]] on [[CBS]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ICFHandbook&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ACFeb2003&quot;/&gt;

===Professional cheerleading===

[[File:Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders perform aboard USS Bainbridge (CGN-25), in 1983 (6370287).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders]] (1983) performing in the USO show &quot;America and Her Music&quot; on the deck of the nuclear-powered guided missile cruiser {{USS|Bainbridge|CGN-25}}]]

In the 1950s, the formation of professional cheerleading started. The first recorded cheer squad in [[National Football League]] (NFL) history was for the [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lshs.leesummit.k12.mo.us&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Craig. ''Chants, Cheers, and Jumps.'' Philadelphia: Mason Crest, 2003, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Professional cheerleaders put a new perspective on American cheerleading. Women were selected for two reasons: visual sex appeal, and the ability to dance. Women were exclusively chosen because men were the targeted marketing group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanson, Mary Ellen 1995, p. 55&quot;&gt;Hanson, Mary Ellen. ''Go! Fight! Win!: Cheerleading in American Culture.'' Bowling Green, OH: Bowling Green State Univ. Popular, 1995, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders]] soon gained the spotlight with their revealing outfits and sophisticated dance moves, debuting in the 1972–1973 season, but were first widely seen in [[Super Bowl X]] (1976). These pro squads of the 1970s established cheerleaders as &quot;American icons of wholesome sex appeal.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pedia.com&quot;/&gt;  By 1981, a total of seventeen Nation Football League teams had their own cheerleaders. The only teams without NFL cheerleaders at this time were New Orleans, New York, Detroit, Cleveland, Denver, Minnesota, Pittsburg, San Francisco, and San Diego. Professional cheerleading eventually spread to soccer and basketball teams as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanson, Mary Ellen 1995, p. 55&quot;/&gt;

===Modern advancements in cheerleading===
[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 041203-D-2987S-025.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Cheerleading is a mainstream activity in U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/sports/cheerleading|title=Cheerleading - sports|website=Britannica.com|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Picture shows [[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Defense Secretary]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] posing with [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] cheerleaders, 2004.]]
The 1980s saw the beginning of modern cheerleading, adding difficult stunt sequences and gymnastics into routines. All-star teams, or those not affiliated with a school, popped up, and eventually led to the creation of the [[United States All-Star Federation]] (USASF). ESPN first broadcast the National High School Cheerleading Competition nationwide in 1983. Cheerleading organizations such as the American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Advisors (AACCA), founded in 1987, started applying universal safety standards to decrease the number of injuries and prevent dangerous stunts, pyramids, and tumbling passes from being included in the cheerleading routines.&lt;ref name=&quot;AACCA&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=About the AACCA | url=http://www.aacca.org/about.asp | archiveurl=https://archive.today/20061206110741/http://www.aacca.org/about.asp | archivedate=2006-12-06 | accessdate=2007-01-11 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the National Council for Spirit Safety and Education (NCSSE) was formed to offer safety training for youth, school, all-star, and college coaches. The [[NCAA]] now requires college cheer coaches to successfully complete a nationally recognized safety-training program.

Even with its athletic and competitive development, cheerleading at the school level has retained its ties to its spirit leading traditions. Cheerleaders are quite often seen as ambassadors for their schools, and leaders among the student body. At the college level, cheerleaders are often invited to help at university fundraisers and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.varsity.com/event/1147/fundraising_ideas_cheerleading|title=Being a Cheerleader – Fundraising|website=Varsity.com|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheerleading is very closely associated with [[American football]] and [[basketball]]. Sports such as [[association football]] (soccer), [[ice hockey]], [[volleyball]], [[baseball]], and [[wrestling]] will sometimes sponsor cheerleading squads. The ICC Twenty20 Cricket World Cup in South Africa in 2007 was the first international cricket event to have cheerleaders. The [[Miami Marlins|Florida Marlins]] were the first [[Major League Baseball]] team to have a cheerleading team. Debuting in 2003, the &quot;Marlin Mermaids&quot; gained national exposure, and have influenced other MLB teams to develop their own cheer/dance squads.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Farina and Courtney A. Clark, ''Complete Guide to Cheerleading: All the Tips, Tricks, and Inspiration''  (Beverly MA: Voyageur, 2011), 12. ISBN 9781610602105&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution===
Competitive cheerleading is scored subjectively based on components including, but not limited to, the [[Cheering|cheer]] itself,  dance/choreography, [[List of cheerleading stunts|pyramids]], [[List of cheerleading stunts|stunt]]ing, and [[Tumbling (gymnastics)|tumbling]]. In order to prevent injuries, there are certain rules that cheerleading teams have to follow according to their level (high school, all-star, or college). According to the Encyclopedia of Sports Medicine, there are two purposes of cheerleading - to cheer on the sidelines for other athletes, and to be a &quot;highly skilled competing athlete.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of sports medicine|last=|first=|date=2011|publisher=SAGE Publications|others=Micheli, Lyle J., 1940-|isbn=978-1412961158|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|pages=254|oclc=640072379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with this evolution to the sport's structure, there have been significant advancements made to the typical cheerleading uniform. What began as the classic sweater and mid-calf pleated skirt uniform has now come to incorporate materials that allow for stretch and flexibility. Uniform changes are a result of the changing culture since the 1930s.

Cheerleading may seem like a light-hearted activity to some, but injuries that can come from practice or a competition can be severe if the [[athlete]] is not properly trained. There have been many catastrophic injuries from cheer, especially from tumbling and stunting. Because of the lack of studies on injuries in competitive cheerleading, many injuries that happen could be avoided. Most studies in [[sports medicine]] pertaining to cheerleading are focused on whether it is a sport or not.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golden, Suzi J. 2004, p. 5&quot;/&gt;

==Types of teams in the United States today==

[[File:University of Memphis Coed Cheerleaders.jpg|thumb|University of Memphis Cheerleaders performing a Co-ed double Cupie]]

===School-sponsored===
Most American middle schools, high schools, and colleges have organized cheerleading squads. Some colleges even offer cheerleading scholarships for students. A school cheerleading team may compete locally, regionally, or nationally, but their main purpose is typically to cheer for sporting events and encourage audience participation.  Cheerleading is quickly becoming a year-round activity, starting with tryouts during the spring semester of the preceding school year. Teams may attend organized summer cheerleading camps and practices to improve skills and create routines for competition.

In addition to supporting their schools’s football or other sports teams, student cheerleaders compete with recreational-style routine at competitions year-round. Teams practice intensely for competition and perform a routine no longer than 2 minutes and 30 seconds. Like other school-level athletes, teams compete to win league titles, and move on to bigger competitions with the hopes of reaching a national competition.

The tryout process can sometimes take place over a multiple day period. The cheerleading coach will arrange for a cheerleading clinic, during which basic materials are taught or reviewed before the final day of tryouts. The clinic gives returning cheerleaders and new cheerleaders an equal chance of becoming familiar with the material. Skills that are usually judged during a tryout may include jumps, tumbling, motions, and dance ability. Tryouts often take place during the spring, so that the coach has the squad chosen in time to attend summer camp as a team.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=November 2016}}

====Middle school====
[[File:LaBelle Middle School Cheerleaders Banner.jpg|thumb|[[LaBelle, Florida|LaBelle Middle School]] cheerleaders displayed in the school [[cafeteria]]]]
[[Middle school]] cheerleading evolved shortly after high school squads were created. In middle school, cheerleading squads serve the same purpose, but often follow a modified set of rules from high school squads.  Squads cheer for basketball teams, football teams, and other sports teams in their school. Squads also perform at pep rallies and compete against other local schools from the area.  Cheerleading in middle school sometimes can be a two-season activity: fall and winter. However, many middle school cheer squads will go year-round like high school squads. Middle school cheerleaders use the same cheerleading movements as their older counterparts, yet may perform less extreme stunts and tumbling elements, depending on the rules in their area.

====High school====
[[File:Mercer Island High School Cheerleaders.jpg|left|thumb|275px|High school cheerleaders]]
In high school, there are usually two squads per school: [[varsity team|varsity]] and a [[junior varsity team|junior varsity]].  High school cheerleading contains aspects of school spirit as well as competition. These squads have become part of a year-round cycle. Starting with tryouts in the spring, year-round practice, cheering on teams in the [[Autumn|fall]] and [[winter]], and participating in cheerleading competitions. Most squads practice at least three days a week for about two hours each practice during the summer. Many teams also attend separate tumbling sessions outside of practice. During the school year, cheerleading is usually practiced five- to six-days-a-week. During competition season, it often becomes seven days with practice twice a day sometimes. The school spirit aspect of cheerleading involves cheering, supporting, and &quot;pumping up&quot; the crowd at football games, basketball games, and even at wrestling meets. Along with this, cheerleaders usually perform at pep rallies, and bring school spirit to  other students. In May 2009, the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] released the results of their first true high school participation study. They estimated that the number of high school cheerleaders from public high schools is around 394,700.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfhs.org/web/2009/05/survey_indicates_nearly_400000.aspx NFHS.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608110413/http://www.nfhs.org/web/2009/05/survey_indicates_nearly_400000.aspx |date=June 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different cheerleading organizations that put on competitions; some of the major ones include state and regional competitions. Many high schools will often host cheerleading competitions, bringing in IHSA judges. The regional competitions are qualifiers for national competitions, such as the [http://www.uca.varsity.com/ UCA (Universal Cheerleaders Association)] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]] every year.&lt;ref&gt;Universal Cheerleaders Association (UCA) 2008. 7 December 2008. [http://uca.varsity.com Varsity.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Many teams have a professional choreographer that choreographs their routine in order to ensure they are not breaking rules or regulations and to give the squad creative elements.

[[File:Flick-Gator Cheerleaders.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Collegiate cheerleaders for the [[University of Florida]] perform a high splits pyramid during a [[Florida Gators football|Gators]] [[college football]] game]]

Most American universities have a cheerleading squad to cheer for football, basketball, volleyball, and soccer. Most college squads tend to be larger coed teams, although in recent years; all-girl squads and smaller college squads have increased rapidly.

College squads perform more difficult stunts which include multi-level pyramids, as well as flipping and twisting basket tosses.

Not only do college cheerleaders cheer on the other sports at their university, many teams at universities compete with other schools at either UCA College Nationals or [[National Cheerleaders Association|NCA]] College Nationals. This requires the teams to choreograph a 2-minute and 30 second routine that includes elements of jumps, tumbling, stunting, basket tosses, and pyramids. Winning one of these competitions is a very prestigious accomplishment, and is seen as another national title for most schools.

===Youth leagues and athletic associations===
[[File:YouthCheerleadingPompons.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Youth cheerleaders during a football [[halftime show]]. Youth cheer—[[Secondary school|high school]] ages and younger—make up the vast majority of cheerleaders and cheer teams.]]

Organizations that sponsor youth cheer teams usually sponsor either youth league [[American football|football]] or [[basketball]] teams as well. This allows for the two, under the same sponsor, to be intermingled. Both teams have the same mascot name and the cheerleaders will perform at their football or basketball games. Examples of such sponsors include [[Pop Warner Little Scholars|Pop Warner]], [[American Youth Football]], and the [[YMCA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livebinders.com/play/play?id=301593|title=Cheerleading|website=Livebinders.com|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of these squads is primarily to support their associated football or basketball players, but some teams do compete at local or regional completions. The Pop Warner Association even hosts a national championship each December for teams in their program who qualify.

===All-star or club cheerleading===
{{more citations needed section|date=November 2016}}

”All-star” or club cheerleading differs from school or sideline cheerleading because all-star teams focus solely on performing a competition routine and not on leading cheers for other sports teams. All-star cheerleaders are members of a privately owned gym or club which they typically pay dues or tuition to, similar to a gymnastics gym.

During the early 1980s, cheerleading squads not associated with a school or sports league, whose main objective was competition, began to emerge. The first organization to call themselves all-stars were the Q94 Rockers from [[Richmond, Virginia]], founded in 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACFeb2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Smith | first = Jennifer Renèe | title = The All-Star Chronicles | journal = American Cheerleader | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 40–42 |date=February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  All-star teams competing prior to 1987 were placed into the same divisions as teams that represented schools and sports leagues. In 1986, the [[National Cheerleaders Association]] (NCA) addressed this situation by creating a separate division for teams lacking a sponsoring school or athletic association, calling it the All-Star Division and debuting it at their 1987 competitions. As the popularity of this type of team grew, more and more of them were formed, attending competitions sponsored by many different organizations and companies, each using its own set of rules, regulations, and divisions. This situation became a concern to coaches and gym owners, as the inconsistencies caused coaches to keep their routines in a constant state of flux, detracting from time that could be better utilized for developing skills and providing personal attention to their athletes. More importantly, because the various companies were constantly vying for a competitive edge, safety standards had become more and more lax. In some cases, unqualified coaches and inexperienced squads were attempting dangerous stunts as a result of these expanded sets of rules.&lt;ref name=&quot;varsity2004&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = The Cheerleading Worlds Administered by the USASF | publisher = Varsity Brands, Inc. | url =http://www.varsity.com/index.asp?article=1514 | accessdate = 2007-09-20 | url-status = dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090203090219/http://www.varsity.com/index.asp?article=1514 | archivedate = 2009-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The United States All Star Federation]] (USASF) was formed in 2003 by the competition companies to act as the national governing body for all star cheerleading and to create a standard set of rules and judging criteria to be followed by all competitions sanctioned by the Federation. Eager to grow the sport and create more opportunities for high-level teams, The USASF hosted the first [[Cheerleading Worlds]] on April 24, 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;varsity2004&quot;/&gt; At the same time, cheerleading coaches from all over the country organized themselves for the same rule making purpose, calling themselves the National All Star Cheerleading Coaches Congress (NACCC). In 2005, the NACCC was absorbed by the USASF to become their rule making body.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACFeb2007&quot;/&gt; In late 2006, the [[U.S. All Star Federation|USASF]] facilitated the creation of the International All-Star Federation (IASF), which now governs club cheerleading worldwide.

[[File:ScaleCheer.jpg|right|800px|thumb|Competitive cheer - Paramount Cheerleaders doing a scale]]

{{As of|2020}}, all-star cheerleading, as sanctioned by the USASF, involves a squad of 5–36 females and males. All-star cheerleaders are placed into divisions, which are grouped based upon age, size of the team, gender of participants, and ability level. The age groups vary from under 4 years of age to 18 years and over. The squad prepares year-round for many different competition appearances, but they actually perform only for up to 2½ minutes during their team's routine. The numbers of competitions a team participates in varies from team to team, but generally, most teams tend to participate in six to ten competitions a year. These competitions include locals or regionals, which normally take place in school gymnasiums or local venues, nationals, hosted in large venues all around the U.S., and the Cheerleading Worlds, which takes place at [[Walt Disney World]] in [[Orlando, Florida]]. During a competition routine, a squad performs carefully choreographed stunting, tumbling, jumping, and dancing to their own custom music. Teams create their routines to an eight-count system and apply that to the music so that the team members execute the elements with precise timing and synchronization.

All-star cheerleaders compete at competitions hosted by private event production companies, the foremost of these being Varsity Spirit. Varsity Spirit is the parent company for many subsidies including The National Cheerleader's Association, The Universal Cheerleader's Association, AmeriCheer, Allstar Challenge, and JamFest, among others. Each separate company or subsidy typically hosts their own local and national level competitions. This means that many gyms within the same area could be state and national champions for the same year and never have competed against each other. Currently, there is no system in place that awards only one state or national title.

Judges at a competition watch closely for illegal skills from the group or any individual member. Here, an illegal skill is something that is not allowed in that division due to difficulty or safety restrictions. They look out for deductions, or things that go wrong, such as a dropped stunt or a tumbler who doesn’t stick a landing. More generally, judges look at the difficulty and execution of jumps, stunts and tumbling, synchronization, creativity, the sharpness of the motions, showmanship, and overall routine execution.

If a level 6 or 7 team places high enough at selected [[U.S. All Star Federation|USASF/IASF]] sanctioned national competitions, they could earn a place at the [[U.S. All Star Federation|Cheerleading Worlds]] and compete against teams from all over the world, as well as receive money for placing.&lt;ref name=&quot;nw20007&quot;/&gt; For elite level cheerleaders, The Cheerleading Worlds is the highest level of competition to which they can aspire, and winning a world championship title is an incredible honor.

===Professional===
[[File:Pro Bowl 2006 cheerleaders.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Each NFL team had one of their cheerleaders present at the [[2006 Pro Bowl]] to represent their team.]]

Professional cheerleaders and dancers cheer for sports such as [[football]], [[basketball]], [[baseball]], [[wrestling]], or [[hockey]]. There are only a small handful of professional cheerleading leagues around the world; some professional leagues include the [[National Basketball Association Cheerleading|NBA Cheerleading League]], the [[National Football League Cheerleading|NFL Cheerleading League]], the CFL Cheerleading League, the MLS Cheerleading League, the MLB Cheerleading League, and the NHL Ice Dancers. Although professional cheerleading leagues exist in multiple countries, there are no [[Olympic Games|Olympic teams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheer teams to provide crowd support only at winter olympics|url=https://www.usacheer.org/winter-olympics|website=usacheer.org|date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to cheering at games and competing, professional cheerleaders also, as teams, can often do a lot of [[philanthropy]] and [[Charitable trust|charity work]], [[model (person)|modeling]], [[Motivational speaker|motivational speaking]], [[reality television|television performances]], and [[advertising]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nflcheerleader.blogspot.com/2008/10/who-you-gonna-call-ghostbusters.html |title=Blogspot.com |publisher=Nflcheerleader.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?#doc_editlinks|date=May 2010}}

==Title IX sports status==
There is a large debate on whether or not cheerleading should be considered a sport for [[Title IX]] (a portion of the United States Education Amendments of 1972 forbidding discrimination under any education program on the basis of sex) purposes. Supporters consider cheerleading, as a whole, a sport, citing the heavy use of athletic talents&lt;ref name=&quot;cheerleading1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title= The road to recognition |work=BCA resources|date=August 2, 2008|url=http://www.cheerleading.org.uk/news/recognition.htm |accessdate=August 2, 2008 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080226060536/http://www.cheerleading.org.uk/news/recognition.htm |archivedate = February 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cheerleading in the USA: A sport and an industry |work=[[USA Today]]|date=April 26, 2002|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/_stories/2002-04-26-cheerleading-cover.htm |accessdate=December 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; while critics see it as a physical activity because a &quot;sport&quot; implies a competition among all squads and not all squads compete, along with subjectivity of competitions where—as with [[gymnastics]], [[Diving (sport)|diving]], and [[figure skating]]—scores are assessed based on human judgment and not an objective goal or measurement of time.&lt;ref name=&quot;stanford&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Sport, not a sport: consider Dan the expert |work=[[The Stanford Daily]]|date=September 29, 2004|url=http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2004/9/29/sportNotASportConsiderDanTheExpert |accessdate=December 15, 2007 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070104000827/http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2004/9/29/sportNotASportConsiderDanTheExpert |archivedate = January 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SFU&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title= No, Cheerleading is not a Sport|first=Jamie |last=Meades |work=SFU Cheer Resources|publisher=[[Simon Fraser University]]|date=September 29, 2004|url=http://www.sfucheerleading.ca/index.php?page=10&amp;sub=9&amp;method=view&amp;id=10 |accessdate=December 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.thequindecim.com/media/storage/paper618/news/2005/05/04/SportsAndWellness/Point.What.Makes.A.Sport.A.Sport-947338.shtml|title=Point: What Makes a Sport a Sport?|first=Tyler|last=Adams|work=The Quindecim|publisher=[[Goucher College]]|date=May 4, 2009|accessdate=July 1, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224074507/http://media.www.thequindecim.com/media/storage/paper618/news/2005/05/04/SportsAndWellness/Point.What.Makes.A.Sport.A.Sport-947338.shtml|archivedate=February 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accident caused the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] to ban its member schools from allowing cheerleaders to be &quot;launched or tossed and from taking part in formations higher than two levels&quot; for one week during a women's basketball conference tournament, and also resulted in a recommendation by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] that conferences and tournaments do not allow pyramids two and one half levels high or higher, and a stunt known as basket tosses, during the rest of the men's and women's basketball season.&lt;ref name=&quot;aacca.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The committee unanimously voted for sweeping revisions to cheerleading safety rules, the most major of which restricts specific upper-level skills during basketball games. Basket tosses, 2½ high pyramids, one-arm stunts, stunts that involve twisting or flipping, and twisting tumbling skills may be performed only during halftime and post-game on a matted surface and are prohibited during game play or time-outs.&lt;ref name=&quot;aacca.org&quot;/&gt;

In the early 2000s, cheerleading was considered {{By whom|date=November 2016}} one of the most dangerous school activities. The main source of injuries comes from [[List of cheerleading stunts|stunting]], also known as pyramids. These stunts are performed at games and pep rallies, as well as competitions. Sometimes competition routines are focused solely around the use of difficult and risky stunts. These stunts usually include a flyer (the person on top), along with one or two bases (the people on the bottom), and one or two spotters in the front and back on the bottom. The most common cheerleading related injury is a concussion. 96% of those concussions are stunt related.&lt;ref name=Pediatrics/&gt; Others injuries are: sprained ankles, sprained wrists, back injuries, head injuries (sometimes concussions), broken arms, elbow injuries, knee injuries, broken noses, and broken collarbones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The revamped and provocative [[Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders]] of the 1970s—and the many imitators that followed—firmly established the cheerleader as an American icon of wholesome sex appeal. In response, a new subgenre of exploitation films suddenly sprang up with titles such as ''[[The Cheerleaders]]'' (1972), ''[[The Swinging Cheerleaders]]'' (1974), ''Revenge of the Cheerleaders'' (1975), ''The Pom Pom Girls'' (1976), ''[[Satan's Cheerleaders]]'' (1977), ''Cheerleaders Beach Party'' (1978), ''Cheerleaders's Wild Weekend'' (1979), and ''[[Gimme an 'F']]'' (1984). In addition to R-rated sex comedies and horror films, cheerleaders became a staple of the adult film industry, starting with ''[[Debbie Does Dallas]]'' (1978) and its four sequels.

On television, the made-for-TV movie ''The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders'' (which aired January 14, 1979) starring [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] was a highly rated success, spawning the 1980 sequel ''The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders II''.

The Dallas squad was in high demand during the late 1970s with frequent appearances on network specials, awards shows, variety programs, commercials, the game show ''[[Family Feud]]'' and TV series such as ''[[The Love Boat]]''. The sci-fi sitcom ''[[Mork &amp; Mindy]]'' also based a 1979 episode around the [[Denver Broncos]] cheerleaders with Mork ([[Robin Williams]]) trying out for the squad.

''[[The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom]]'' (1993) is a [[Television film|TV movie]] which dramatized the true story of [[Wanda Holloway]], the Texas mother whose obsession with her daughter's cheerleading career made headline news. Another lurid TV movie based on a true story, ''[[Fab Five: The Texas Cheerleader Scandal]]'' was produced in 2008. In 1999's [[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]], Lester Burnham's suburban midlife crisis begins when he becomes infatuated with his daughter Jane's vain cheerleader friend, Angela Hayes, after seeing her perform a half-time dance routine at a high school basketball game.

Cheerleading's increasing popularity in recent decades has made it a prominent feature in high-school themed movies and television shows. The 2000 film ''[[Bring It On (film)|Bring It On]]'', about a [[San Diego]] high school cheerleading squad called &quot;The Toros&quot;, starred real-life former cheerleader [[Kirsten Dunst]].  ''Bring It On'' was a surprise hit and earned nearly $70 million domestically. It spawned five direct-to-video [[sequel]]s: ''[[Bring It On Again]]'' (2004), ''[[Bring It On: All or Nothing]]'' (2006), ''[[Bring It On: In It to Win It]]'' (2007), ''[[Bring It On: Fight to the Finish]]'' (2009) and ''[[Bring It On: Worldwide Cheersmack]]'' (2017). The first ''Bring It On'' was followed by the cheerleader caper-comedy, ''[[Sugar &amp; Spice]]'' (2001) and a string of campy horror/action films such as ''Cheerleader Ninjas'' (2002), ''Cheerleader Autopsy'', ''Cheerleader Massacre'' (both 2003), ''Chainsaw Cheerleaders'', and ''Ninja Cheerleaders'' (both 2008).

In 2006, [[Hayden Panettiere]], star of ''Bring It On: All or Nothing'', took another cheerleading role as [[Claire Bennet]], the cheerleader with an accelerated healing factor on [[NBC]]'s hit [[Science fiction|sci-fi]] [[TV series]] ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'', launching cheerleading back into the limelight of pop culture. Claire was the main focus of the show's first story arc, featuring the popular catchphrase, &quot;Save the cheerleader, save the world&quot;. Her prominent, protagonist role in ''Heroes'' was supported by a strong fan-base and provided a positive image for high school cheerleading.

In 2009, Panettiere starred again as a cheerleader, this time as Beth Cooper in the [[I Love You, Beth Cooper (film)|film adaptation]] of the novel ''[[I Love You, Beth Cooper]]''.

In 2006, the reality show ''[[Cheerleader Nation]]'' was featured on the [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] television channel. ''Cheerleader Nation'' is a 60-minute television series based on the [[Paul Laurence Dunbar High School (Lexington, Kentucky)|Paul Laurence Dunbar High School]] cheerleading team's ups and downs on the way to nationals, of which they are the three-time champions. The show also believes that cheerleading is tough. The show takes place in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].

The 2007 series ''[[Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Making the Team]]'' shows the process of getting on the pro squad of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. Everything from initial tryouts to workout routines and the difficulties involved is shown.

''[[Fired Up!]]'', a teen comedy about cheerleading camp, was released by [[Screen Gems]] in 2009. In the supernatural horror-comedy ''[[Jennifer's Body]]'' (2009), [[Megan Fox]] plays a demonically possessed high school cheerleader. Also that year, [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] signed music video and film director [[Bille Woodruff]] (''[[Barbershop (film)|Barbershop]]'', ''[[Honey (2003 film)|Honey]]'') to direct the fifth film in the ''Bring It On'' series titled ''[[Bring It On: Fight to the Finish]]''. The film stars [[Christina Milian]] (who previously played cheerleaders in ''[[Love Don't Cost a Thing (film)|Love Don't Cost a Thing]]'' and ''[[Man of the House (2005 film)|Man of the House]]'') and Rachelle Brook Smith, and was released directly to DVD and Blu-ray on September 1, 2009.

The television series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' (2009-2015) featured [[Dianna Agron]] as [[Quinn Fabray]], the captain of her high school cheerleading squad, the Cheerios. Quinn becomes pregnant, leading to her expulsion from the squad, but two of the other Cheerios, [[Santana Lopez]] and [[Brittany Pierce]] also feature heavily in the show. In the episode &quot;[[The Power of Madonna]]&quot;, [[Kurt Hummel]] joins the Cheerios along with [[Mercedes Jones]].

[[The CW|The CW Television Network]] created the short-lived ''[[Hellcats]]'' series (2010–11). This drama was about the ups and downs of being a college cheerleader. It starred [[Aly Michalka]] as Marty (a former gymnast forced to become a cheerleader after her academic scholarship is canceled) and [[Ashley Tisdale]] from ''[[High School Musical]]''.

In 2012, [[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]] produced a reality style series called Cheer that followed a senior team from the club gym, Central Jersey Allstars, on their road to the [[Cheerleading Worlds]].

Beginning in 2013, the [[YouTube]] channel [[AwesomenessTV]] created a series streamed on the platform that followed the well known and well decorated senior coed team “Smoed” from the California Allstars program in [[San Marcos, California]]. The show has since gone on for eight seasons and documents the team’s yearly quest to win at the [[Cheerleading Worlds]].

==Cheerleading in Canada==
[[File:School. West Hill High School Cheer Leaders BAnQ P48S1P09553.jpg|thumb|High school cheerleaders in [[Montreal]] in 1943]]
Cheerleading in Canada is rising in popularity among the youth in co-curricular programs. Cheerleading has grown from the sidelines to a competitive activity throughout the world and in particular Canada. Cheerleading has a few streams in Canadian sports culture. It is available at the middle-school, high-school, collegiate, and best known for all-star. There are multiple regional, provincial, and national championship opportunities for all athletes participating in cheerleading. Canada does not have provincial teams, just a national program referred to as CCU or Team Canada. Their first year as a national team was in 2009 when they represented Canada at the International Cheer Union World Cheerleading Championships [[International Cheer Union]] (ICU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CCU &quot;About&quot;|url=http://www.teamcanadacheer.com/index.php?componentName=AwardSection&amp;scid=73773|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competition in Canada===
There is no official governing body for Canadian cheerleading. The rules and guidelines for cheerleading used in Canada are the ones set out by the [[U.S. All Star Federation|USASF]]. However, there are many organizations in Canada that put on competitions and have separate and individual rules and scoresheets for each competition. Cheer Evolution is the largest cheerleading and dance organization for Canada. They hold many competitions as well as provide a competition for bids to Worlds. There are other organizations such as the Ontario Cheerleading Federation (Ontario), Power Cheerleading Association (Ontario), Kicks Athletics (Quebec), and the International Cheer Alliance (Vancouver). There are over forty recognized competitive gym clubs with numerous teams that compete at competitions across Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Find A Club Near You|url=http://canadiancheer.com/find-a-club-near-you/|publisher=Cheer Evolution|accessdate=28 March 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503170459/http://canadiancheer.com/find-a-club-near-you/|archivedate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadaian Cheer of the Global Stage===
There are two world championship competitions that Canada participates in. The first is the ICU World Championships where the Canadian National Teams compete against other countries. The second is The Cheerleading Worlds where Canadian club teams, referred to as &quot;all-star&quot; teams, compete at the USASF Cheerleading Worlds. National team members who compete at the ICU Worlds can also compete with their &quot;all-star club&quot; teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Canada looks for fourth straight gold medal|url=http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/canada-looks-for-fourth-straight-cheerleading-gold-medal-1.798435|accessdate=2 April 2013|date=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although athletes can compete in both [[International Cheer Union]] (ICU) and USASF, crossovers between teams at each individual competition are not permitted. Teams compete against the other teams from their countries on the first day of competition and the top three teams from each country in each division continue to finals. At the end of finals, the top team scoring the highest for their country earns the &quot;Nations Cup&quot;. Canada has multiple teams across their country that compete in the USASF Cheerleading Worlds Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States All Star Federation|url=http://www.usasf.net/|publisher=USASF|accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Cheer Union]] (ICU) is built of 103 countries that compete against each other in four divisions; Coed Premier, All-girl Premier, Coed Elite, and All-girl Elite. Canada has a national team ran by the Canadian Cheer Union (CCU). Their Coed Elite Level 5 Team and their All-girl Elite Level 5 team are 4-time world champions. The athletes on the teams are found from all over the country. In 2013, they added two more teams to their roster. A new division that will compete head-to-head with the United States: in both the All-girl and Coed Premier Level 6 divisions. Members tryout and are selected on the basis of their skills and potential to succeed. Canada's national program has grown to be one of the most successful programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teamcanadacheer.com/|title=teamcanadacheer|website=Teamcanadacheer|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
