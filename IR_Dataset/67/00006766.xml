{{About|the generic term|the intergovernmental organization|Commonwealth of Nations|other uses}}

A '''&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;commonwealth&lt;/span&gt;''' is a traditional English term for a political community founded for the [[common good]]. Historically it has sometimes been synonymous with &quot;[[republic]]&quot;. The noun &quot;commonwealth&quot;, meaning &quot;public welfare general good or advantage&quot;, dates from the 15th century. Originally a phrase (the common-wealth or the common wealth – echoed in the modern synonym &quot;public wealth&quot;) it comes from the old meaning of &quot;[[wealth]]&quot;, which is &quot;well-being&quot;, and is itself a loose translation of the Latin [[res publica]] (republic). The term literally meant &quot;common well-being&quot;. In the 17th century, the definition of &quot;commonwealth&quot; expanded from its original sense of &quot;[[public welfare]]&quot; or &quot;[[wikt:commonweal|commonweal]]&quot; to mean &quot;a state in which the supreme power is vested in the people; a republic or [[democracy|democratic state]]&quot;.

The term evolved to become a title to a number of political entities. Three countries – [[Australia]], the [[Bahamas]], and [[Dominica]] – have the official title &quot;Commonwealth&quot;, as do four [[U.S. state]]s and two [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]]. Since the early 20th century,  the term has been used to name some fraternal associations of nations, most notably the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], an organization primarily of former territories of the [[British Empire]], which is often referred to as simply &quot;the Commonwealth&quot;.

==Historical use==

===Rome===

Translations of Roman writers' works to English have on occasion translated &quot;''[[Res publica]]''&quot;, and variants thereof, to &quot;the commonwealth&quot;, a term referring to the Roman state as a whole.

===England===

The [[Commonwealth of England]] was the official name of the political unit (''de facto'' military rule in the name of parliamentary supremacy) that replaced the [[Kingdom of England]] (after the [[English Civil War]]) from 1649–53 and 1659–60, under the rule of [[Oliver Cromwell]] and his son and successor [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]]. From 1653 to 1659, although still legally known as a Commonwealth, the republic, united with the former [[Kingdom of Scotland]], operated under different institutions (at times as a ''de facto'' monarchy) and is known by historians as the Protectorate. In a British context, it is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Old Commonwealth&quot;.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

===Iceland===

The [[Icelandic Commonwealth]] or the [[Icelandic Free State]] ({{lang-is|Þjóðveldið}}) was the state existing in Iceland between the establishment of the [[Althing]] in 930 and the pledge of fealty to the [[King of Norway|Norwegian king]] in 1262. It was initially established by a public consisting largely of recent immigrants from [[Norway]] who had fled the unification of that country under [[King]] [[Harald Fairhair]].

===Philippines===
{{main|History of the Philippines (1898–1946)}}

The [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] was the administrative body that governed the [[Philippines]] from 1935 to 1946, aside from a [[government in exile|period of exile]] in the [[Second World War]] from 1942 to 1945 when [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japan occupied the country]]. It replaced the [[Insular Government]], a [[territory of the United States|United States territorial]] government, and was established by the [[Tydings–McDuffie Act]].  The Commonwealth was designed as a transitional administration in preparation for the country's full achievement of independence, which was achieved in 1946. The Commonwealth of the Philippines was a founding member of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/depts/dhl/unms/founders.shtml United Nations website listing founding members]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland–Lithuania===
{{Main|Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth}}

''Republic'' is still an alternative translation of the traditional name of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. [[Wincenty Kadłubek]] (Vincent Kadlubo, 1160–1223) used for the first time the original Latin term ''[[res publica]]'' in the context of Poland in his &quot;Chronicles of the Kings and Princes of Poland&quot;. The name was used officially for the confederal country formed by [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]] and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]] 1569–1795.

It is also often referred as &quot;[[Golden Liberty|Nobles' Commonwealth]]&quot; (1505–1795, i.e., before the union). In the contemporary political doctrine of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, &quot;our state is a Republic (or Commonwealth) under the presidency of the King&quot;. The Commonwealth introduced a doctrine of religious tolerance called [[Warsaw Confederation]], had its own parliament ''[[Sejm]]'' (although elections were restricted to [[nobility]] and [[elected king]]s, who were bound to certain contracts ''[[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]]'' from the beginning of the reign).

&quot;A commonwealth of good counsaile&quot; was the title of the 1607 English translation of the work of [[Wawrzyniec Grzymała Goślicki]] &quot;De optimo senatore&quot; that presented to English readers many of the ideas present in the political system of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

===Catalonia===
{{Main|Commonwealth of Catalonia}}

Between 1914 and 1925, [[Catalonia]] was an autonomous region of Spain. Its government during that time was given the title ''[[mancomunidad]]'' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''mancomunitat''), which is translated into English as &quot;commonwealth&quot;. The [[Commonwealth of Catalonia]] had limited powers and was formed as a federation of the four Catalan provinces. A number of Catalan-language institutions were created during its existence.

===Liberia===
{{See also|History of Liberia#Colonization (1821–1847)}}

Between 1838 and 1847, [[Liberia]] was officially known as the &quot;Commonwealth of Liberia&quot;. It changed its name to the &quot;Republic of Liberia&quot; when it declared independence (and adopted a new constitution) in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1985/liberia_1_commonwealth.htm The Commonwealth of Liberia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current use==

===Australia===

&quot;Commonwealth&quot; was first proposed as a term for a federation of the six Australian [[crown colony|crown colonies]] at the [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)#1891 convention|1891 constitutional convention]] in [[Sydney]]. Its adoption was initially controversial, as it was associated by some with the republicanism of [[Oliver Cromwell]] ([[#England|see above]]), but it was retained in all subsequent drafts of the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Irving. [http://www.civicsandcitizenship.edu.au/cce/helen_irving,9939.html Australian Federation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715000750/http://www.civicsandcitizenship.edu.au/cce/helen_irving%2C9939.html |date=2015-07-15 }} – Civics and Citizenship Education. Retrieved 15 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was finally incorporated into law in the ''[[Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act]] 1900'', which established the federation. Australia operates under a federal system, in which power is divided between the federal (national) government and the [[States and territories of Australia|state governments]] (the successors of the six colonies). So, in an Australian context, the term &quot;Commonwealth&quot; (capitalized), which is often abbreviated to Cth, refers to the [[Government of Australia|federal government]], and &quot;Commonwealth of Australia&quot; is the official name of the country.

===The Bahamas===

[[The Bahamas]] uses the official style ''Commonwealth of The Bahamas''.

===Dominica===

The small [[Caribbean]] republic of [[Dominica]] has used the official style ''Commonwealth of Dominica'' since 1978.

All four were part of [[British America|Great Britain's possessions]] along the Atlantic coast of North America prior to the formation of the United States of America in 1776. As such, they share a strong influence of English [[common law]] in some of their laws and institutions. The four are:
*[[Kentucky]] is designated a commonwealth by the [[Kentucky Constitution]] as the &quot;Commonwealth of Kentucky&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kentucky.gov |title=Kentucky.gov |publisher=Kentucky.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International bodies===

====Commonwealth of Nations====

The [[Commonwealth of Nations]]—formerly the British Commonwealth—is a voluntary association or confederation of 53 independent sovereign states, most of which were once part of the [[British Empire]]. The Commonwealth's membership includes both republics and monarchies. The [[Head of the Commonwealth]] is Queen [[Elizabeth II]], who also reigns as monarch directly in the 16 member states known as [[Commonwealth realm]]s.  

====Commonwealth of Independent States====

The [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) is a loose [[military alliance|alliance]] or confederation consisting of nine of the 15 [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Republics]], the exceptions being [[Turkmenistan]] (a CIS associate member), [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] left the CIS in August 2008 after [[2008 South Ossetia war|a clash]] with [[Russia]] over [[South Ossetia]]. Its creation signalled the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]], its purpose being to &quot;allow a civilised divorce&quot; between the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republics]]. The CIS has developed as a forum by which the member-states can co-operate in [[economics]], [[Defence (military)|defence]], and [[foreign policy]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantine, Michalopoulos, and Tarr David. &quot;The economics of customs unions in the Commonwealth of Independent States.&quot; Post-Soviet Geography and Economics 38, no. 3 (1997): 125-143.&lt;/ref&gt;
