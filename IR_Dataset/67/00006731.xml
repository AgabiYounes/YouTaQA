The '''McDonnell Douglas'''/'''Boeing C-17 Globemaster III''' is a large [[military transport aircraft]]. It was developed for the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) from the 1980s to the early 1990s by [[McDonnell Douglas]]. The C-17 carries forward the name of two previous piston-engined military cargo aircraft, the [[Douglas C-74 Globemaster]] and the [[Douglas C-124 Globemaster II]]. The C-17 commonly performs tactical and [[airlift#Strategic airlift|strategic airlift]] missions, transporting troops and cargo throughout the world; additional roles include [[medical evacuation]] and [[airdrop]] duties. It was designed to replace the [[Lockheed C-141 Starlifter]], and also fulfill some of the duties of the [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy]], freeing the C-5 fleet for [[outsize cargo]].

[[Boeing]], which merged with McDonnell Douglas in 1997, continued to manufacture C-17s for export customers following the end of deliveries to the U.S. Air Force. Aside from the United States, the C-17 is in service with the air forces of [[Indian Air Force|India]], [[Royal Air Force|United Kingdom]], [[Royal Australian Air Force|Australia]], [[Royal Canadian Air Force|Canada]], [[Qatar Emiri Air Force|Qatar]], [[United Arab Emirates Air Force|United Arab Emirates]], [[NATO]] [[Heavy Airlift Wing]] and [[Kuwait Air Force|Kuwait]]. The final C-17 was completed at the [[Long Beach, California]] plant and flown on 29 November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://boeing.mediaroom.com/2015-11-29-Final-Boeing-C-17-Globemaster-III-Departs-Long-Beach-Assembly-Facility |title=Final Boeing C-17 Globemaster III Departs Long Beach Assembly Facility |publisher=Boeing |date=29 November 2015 |accessdate=1 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407161607/http://boeing.mediaroom.com/2015-11-29-Final-Boeing-C-17-Globemaster-III-Departs-Long-Beach-Assembly-Facility |archive-date=7 April 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background and design phase===
In the 1970s, the U.S. Air Force began looking for a replacement for its [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] tactical cargo aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/djreprints/access/72923084.html?dids=72923084:72923084&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Nov+13%2C+1972&amp;author=&amp;pub=Wall+Street+Journal&amp;desc=Air+Force+Lets+Advanced+STOL+Prototype+Work&amp;pqatl=google &quot;Air Force Lets Advanced STOL Prototype Work.&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107202542/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/djreprints/access/72923084.html?dids=72923084:72923084&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Nov+13%2C+1972&amp;author=&amp;pub=Wall+Street+Journal&amp;desc=Air+Force+Lets+Advanced+STOL+Prototype+Work&amp;pqatl=google |date=7 November 2012}} ''Wall Street Journal'', 13 November 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Advanced Medium STOL Transport]] (AMST) competition was held, with [[Boeing Integrated Defense Systems|Boeing]] proposing the [[Boeing YC-14|YC-14]], and [[McDonnell Douglas]] proposing the [[McDonnell Douglas YC-15|YC-15]].&lt;ref&gt;Miles, Marvin.

The Air Force started the C-X program in November 1979 to develop a larger AMST with longer range to augment its strategic airlift.&lt;ref name=kennedy_part1&gt;Kennedy 2004, pp. 3–20, 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yc15-1 072.jpg|thumb|The [[McDonnell Douglas YC-15]] design was used as the basis for the C-17.|alt=Top view of cargo aircraft in-flight, trailed by a fighter chase aircraft. Under each un-swept wing are two engines suspended forward ahead the leading edge.]]
By 1980, the USAF found itself with a large fleet of aging [[Lockheed C-141 Starlifter|C-141 Starlifter]] cargo aircraft. Compounding matters, USAF needed increased strategic airlift capabilities to fulfill its rapid-deployment airlift requirements. The USAF set mission requirements and released a request for proposals (RFP) for C-X in October 1980. McDonnell Douglas elected to develop a new aircraft based on the YC-15. Boeing bid an enlarged three-engine version of its AMST YC-14. Lockheed submitted two designs, a C-5-based design and an enlarged C-141 design. On 28 August 1981, McDonnell Douglas was chosen to build its proposed aircraft, then designated ''C-17''. Compared to the YC-15, the new aircraft differed in having swept wings, increased size, and more powerful engines.&lt;ref name=norton_p12-3&gt;Norton 2001, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; This would allow it to perform the work done by the C-141, and to fulfill some of the duties of the [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy]], freeing the C-5 fleet for [[outsize cargo]].&lt;ref name=norton_p12-3/&gt;

Alternative proposals were pursued to fill airlift needs after the C-X contest. These were lengthening of C-141As into C-141Bs, ordering more C-5s, continued purchases of [[McDonnell Douglas KC-10 Extender|KC-10]]s, and expansion of the [[Civil Reserve Air Fleet]]. Limited budgets reduced program funding, requiring a delay of four years. During this time contracts were awarded for preliminary design work and for the completion of engine certification.&lt;ref name=norton_p13-5/&gt; In December 1985, a full-scale development contract was awarded, under Program Manager Bob Clepper.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/98482212.html?dids=98482212:98482212&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+03%2C+1986&amp;author=The+Los+Angeles+Times&amp;pub=Newsday+(Combined+editions)&amp;desc=Douglas+Wins+%243.4B+Pact+to+Build+C-17&amp;pqatl=google &quot;Douglas Wins $3.4B Pact to Build C-17.&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107202522/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/98482212.html?dids=98482212:98482212&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+03%2C+1986&amp;author=The+Los+Angeles+Times&amp;pub=Newsday+(Combined+editions)&amp;desc=Douglas+Wins+%243.4B+Pact+to+Build+C-17&amp;pqatl=google |date=7 November 2012}} ''Los Angeles Times'', 3 January 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, first flight was planned for 1990.&lt;ref name=norton_p13-5&gt;Norton 2001, pp. 13, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The Air Force had formed a requirement for 210 aircraft.&lt;ref name=kennedy_p70&gt;Kennedy 2004, pp. 70, 81–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development difficulties===
A static test of the C-17 wing in October 1992 resulted in the wing failing at 128% of design limit load, which was below the 150% requirement. Both wings buckled rear to the front and failures occurred in stringers, spars and ribs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dodig.mil/Audit/Audit2/93-159.pdf &quot;Technical Assessment Report; C-17 Wing Structural Integrity.&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328005836/http://www.dodig.mil/Audit/Audit2/93-159.pdf |date=28 March 2012}} ''Department of Defense'', 24 August 1993.

The report also stated that &quot;current military doctrine that does not reflect the use of small, austere airfields&quot;, thus the C-17's short field capability was not considered.&lt;ref name=airfields&gt;[http://archive.gao.gov/t2pbat3/152088.pdf &quot;Comparison of C-5 and C-17 Airfield Availability.&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927183044/http://archive.gao.gov/t2pbat3/152088.pdf |date=27 September 2007}} ''United States General Accounting Office,'' July 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 1995 GAO report stated that the USAF originally planned to order 210 C-17s at a cost of $41.8 billion, and that the 120 aircraft on order were to cost $39.5 billion based on a 1992 estimate.&lt;ref name=gao&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/archive/1995/ns95026.pdf &quot;C-17 Aircraft – Cost and Performance Issues.&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184250/http://www.gao.gov/archive/1995/ns95026.pdf |date=30 September 2007}} ''United States General Accounting Office,'' January 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1994, the U.S. Army decided it did not need the {{convert|60000|lb|abbr=on}} [[low-altitude parachute-extraction system]] (LAPES) delivery with the C-17 and that the C-130's {{convert|42000|lb|abbr=on}} capability was sufficient.&lt;ref name=gao/&gt; C-17 testing was limited to this lower weight.

[[File:Cockpit of a RAAF C-17 Globemaster in 2014.jpg|thumb|Cockpit of a C-17]]
The C-17 Globemaster III is a strategic transport aircraft, able to airlift cargo close to a battle area. The size and weight of U.S. mechanized firepower and equipment have grown in recent decades from increased air mobility requirements, particularly for large or heavy non-palletized [[outsize cargo]]. It has a length of {{convert|174|ft|m}} and a wingspan of {{convert|169|ft|10|in|m}}.&lt;ref name=AF_fact/&gt; 

The C-17 is powered by four [[Pratt &amp; Whitney PW2000|Pratt &amp; Whitney F117-PW-100]] [[turbofan]] engines, which are based on the commercial [[Pratt &amp; Whitney PW2000|Pratt and Whitney PW2040]] used on the [[Boeing 757]]. Each engine is rated at {{convert|40400|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} of thrust. The engine's [[thrust reversal|thrust reversers]] direct engine exhaust air upwards and forward, reducing the chances of [[foreign object damage]] by ingestion of runway debris, and providing enough reverse thrust to back the aircraft up on the ground while taxiing. The thrust reversers can also be used in flight at idle-reverse for added drag in maximum-rate descents. In [[vortex surfing]] tests performed by two C-17s, up to 10% fuel savings were reported.&lt;ref&gt;Drinnon, Roger. [http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123321609 &quot;'Vortex surfing' could be revolutionary.&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116045517/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123321609 |date=16 November 2012}} ''[[U.S. Air Force]],'' 11 October 2012.

For cargo operations the C-17 requires a crew of three: pilot, copilot, and loadmaster. The cargo compartment is {{convert|88|ft|m}} long by {{convert|18|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|12|ft|4|in|m}} high. The cargo floor has rollers for palletized cargo but it can be flipped to provide a flat floor suitable for vehicles and other rolling stock. Cargo is loaded through a large aft ramp that accommodates [[rolling stock]], such as a 69-ton (63-metric ton) [[M1 Abrams]] [[main battle tank]], other armored vehicles, trucks, and trailers, along with [[463L master pallet|palletized cargo]].

Maximum payload of the C-17 is {{convert|170900|lb|kg ST}}, and its [[maximum takeoff weight]] is {{convert|585000|lb|kg}}. With a payload of {{convert|160000|lb|kg}} and an initial cruise altitude of {{convert|28000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, the C-17 has an unrefueled range of about {{convert|2400|nmi|km|abbr=off}} on the first 71 aircraft, and {{convert|2800|nmi|km|abbr=off}} on all subsequent extended-range models that include a sealed center wing bay as a fuel tank. Boeing informally calls these aircraft the ''C-17 ER''.&lt;ref name=bids_c17_fml&gt;

The C-17 is designed to operate from runways as short as {{convert|3500|ft|m|abbr=on}} and as narrow as {{convert|90|ft|m|abbr=on}}. In addition, the C-17 can operate from unpaved, unimproved runways (although with greater chance of damage to the aircraft).&lt;ref name=AF_fact /&gt; The thrust reversers can be used to move the aircraft backwards and reverse direction on narrow taxiways using a three- (or more) point turn. The plane is designed for 20 [[man-hour]]s of maintenance per flight hour, and a 74% mission availability rate.&lt;ref name=AF_fact /&gt;

===Royal Air Force===
Boeing has marketed the C-17 to many European nations including Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. The [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) has established an aim of having interoperability and some weapons and capabilities commonality with the USAF. The 1998 [[Strategic Defence Review]] identified a requirement for a strategic airlifter. The Short-Term Strategic Airlift (STSA) competition commenced in September of that year, however tendering was canceled in August 1999 with some bids identified by ministers as too expensive, including the Boeing/[[British Aerospace|BAe]] C-17 bid, and others unsuitable.&lt;ref name=business&gt;O'Connell, Dominic. &quot;Political clash haunts MoD deal decision.&quot; ''The Business (Sunday Business Group),'' 5 December 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The project continued, with the C-17 seen as the favorite.&lt;ref name=business/&gt; In the light of [[Airbus A400M]] delays, the UK [[Secretary of State for Defence]], [[Geoff Hoon]], announced in May 2000 that the RAF would lease four C-17s at an annual cost of [[Pound sterling|£]]100 million from Boeing&lt;ref name=avweek_20060313/&gt; for an initial seven years with an optional two-year extension. The RAF had the option to buy or return the aircraft to Boeing. The UK committed to upgrading its C-17s in line with the USAF so that if they were returned, the USAF could adopt them. The lease agreement restricted the operational use of the C-17s, meaning that the RAF could not use them for para-drop, airdrop, rough field, low-level operations and air to air refuelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkdefence.co.uk/2012/09/the-airbus-a400m-atlas-part-1-background-progress-and-c130j-or-c17-options/|title=The Airbus A400M Atlas – Part 1 (Background, Progress and Options)|date=4 September 2012|work=Think Defence|accessdate=1 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506215911/http://www.thinkdefence.co.uk/2012/09/the-airbus-a400m-atlas-part-1-background-progress-and-c130j-or-c17-options/|archive-date=6 May 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first C-17 was delivered to the RAF at Boeing's Long Beach facility on 17 May 2001 and flown to [[RAF Brize Norton]] by a crew from [[No. 99 Squadron RAF|No. 99 Squadron]]. The RAF's fourth C-17 was delivered on 24 August 2001. The RAF aircraft were some of the first to take advantage of the new center wing fuel tank found in Block 13 aircraft. In RAF service, the C-17 has not been given an [[British military aircraft designation systems|official service name and designation]] (for example, C-130J referred to as Hercules C4 or C5), but is referred to simply as the C-17 or &quot;C-17A Globemaster&quot;.

The RAF declared itself delighted with the C-17. Although the Globemaster fleet was to be a fallback for the A400M, the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) announced on 21 July 2004 that they had elected to buy their four C-17s at the end of the lease,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/review-turns-up-the-heat-on-eurofighter-186087/ &quot;Review turns up the heat on eurofighter&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729091343/http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/review-turns-up-the-heat-on-eurofighter-186087/ |date=29 July 2013}}.

* On 23 January 2012, a USAF C-17 (AF Serial No. ''07-7189''), assigned to the [[437th Airlift Wing]], [[Joint Base Charleston]], South Carolina, landed on runway 34R at [[Forward Operating Base Shank]], [[Afghanistan]]. The crew did not realize the required stopping distance exceeded the runway's length thus were unable to stop. It came to rest approximately 700 feet from the runway's end upon an embankment, causing major structural damage but no injuries. After 9 months of repairs to make airworthy, the C-17 flew to Long Beach. It returned to service at an reported cost of $69.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/wiki.php?id=145343 |title=ASN Aircraft incident 23-JAN-2012 McDonnell Douglas C-17A Globemaster III 07-7189 |first=Harro |last=Ranter |website=aviation-safety.net |access-date=13 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220140336/https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/wiki.php?id=145343 |archive-date=20 December 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flugzeug-bild.de/bild/flughaefen~deutschland~stuttgart-str/96607/07-7189-boeing-c-17a-globemaster-iii-04052016.html |title=07-7189 Boeing C-17A Globemaster III 04.05.2016 |website=Flugzeug-bild.de |access-date=13 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220214606/http://www.flugzeug-bild.de/bild/flughaefen~deutschland~stuttgart-str/96607/07-7189-boeing-c-17a-globemaster-iii-04052016.html |archive-date=20 December 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 20 July 2012, a USAF C-17 of the [[305th Air Mobility Wing]], flying from [[McGuire AFB]], [[New Jersey]] to [[MacDill Air Force Base]] in [[Tampa, Florida]] mistakenly landed at nearby [[Peter O. Knight Airport]]. The landing followed an extended duration flight from Europe to Southwest Asia to embark military passengers before returning to the U.S. There were no injuries and no damage to the aircraft or the runway. It took off a short time later with ease from Knight's 3,580-foot runway to nearby MacDill AFB. The Air Force attributed the mistaken landing to a combination of pilot error and fatigue; both airfield's main runways were only a few miles apart and shared the same magnetic heading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/air-force-c-17-globemaster-iii-makes-surprise-landing-at-peter-o-knight/1241349 |title= Air Force C-17 Globemaster III makes surprise landing at Peter O.
