The '''Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus''' ([[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]: ''Узброеныя сілы Рэспублікі Беларусь – УС РБ'', ''Uzbrojenyja siły Respubliki Biełaruś'', [[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Boopyжённыe cилы Pecпyблики Бeлapycь'', ''Vooruzhennye sily Respubliki Belarus'') consist of the Ground Forces and the [[Belarusian Air Force|Air and Air Defence Forces]], all under the command of the [[Republic of Belarus]] [[Ministry of Defence (Belarus)|Ministry of Defence]]. Being a [[landlocked country]], Belarus has no [[navy]].

In 2017 the IISS estimated that personnel in the armed forces numbered 48,000. Most soldiers are [[conscripts]] serving for a period of 18 months, although there is an alternative service option.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017|title=The Military Balance 2017|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/tmib20/current|journal=The Military Balance|volume=117|pages=203–204|url-access=subscription |via=[[Taylor and Francis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republic of Belarus has conducted effective military reforms within the last decade which have reshaped its armed forces as a relatively effective force for a small state in somewhat difficult economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Steven J Main, [http://www.defac.ac.uk/colleges/csrc/document-listings/cee/g126 The Belarusian Armed Forces: A Military-Political History 1991–2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306045432/http://www.defac.ac.uk/colleges/csrc/document-listings/cee/g126 |date=2008-03-06 }}, [[Conflict Studies Research Centre]], RMA Sandhurst, 2003. This is the definitive work in English on the recent history of Belarus's armed forces.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The previous [[Belarusian People's Republic]] of March 1918 to 1919 did not have time to create [[armed forces]] in its brief existence, although attempts to create a military have been documented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radabnr.org/en/bibliographyen.htm Selected Bibliography of works on the struggle for Belarusian Independence 1900–1921 in the Francis Skaryna Belarusian Library in London] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927162702/http://www.radabnr.org/en/bibliographyen.htm |date=2013-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1991 the Soviet [[Belorussian Military District]] comprised the [[5th Guards Tank Army]] (HQ Bobruisk), the [[7th Tank Army]] (HQ Borisov), the [[28th Army (Soviet Union)|28th Army]] (HQ Grodno), the [[120th Guards Mechanised Brigade|120th Guards Motor Rifle Division]], the [[72nd Guards Joint Training Centre|72nd Guards District Training Center]] and logistical units and formations. In addition to these troops Belarus was host to centrally controlled formations, namely the [[103rd Guards Airborne Division]], the [[38th Guards Mobile Brigade|38th Guards Airborne Brigade]], the 11th Air Defence Corps of the [[2nd Air Defence Army]], the [[1st Air Army|26th Air Army]] and also units and formations of the [[Strategic Rocket Forces]], [[Long Range Aviation]], the Navy and special forces.

In late 1991 the 5th Guards Tank Army comprised the [[55th Guards Rifle Division|30th Guards Motor Rifle Division]], newly arrived from Czechoslovakia, and the [[193rd Tank Division]], plus two armament and equipment storage bases (the former 8th Guards and 29th Tank Divisions), and army troops. The 7th Tank Army comprised the [[3rd Guards Tank Division]], [[34th Tank Division|34th]], and [[37th Guards Tank Division]]s, plus army troops. The 28th Army comprised four divisions, one of which was a low-status mobilisation division. Also arriving from the [[Southern Group of Forces]] in Hungary was the [[19th Guards Tank Division]].

On September 20, 1991 the Supreme Soviet of Belarus passed resolution &quot;On the formation of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus&quot; and on January 11, 1992 resolution &quot;On the Armed Forces deployed in the territory of the Republic of Belarus.&quot; On March 18, 1992 the parliament passed resolution &quot;On the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus&quot; that bound the government &quot;to start the formation of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus as of March 20, 1992&quot; and &quot;to submit to the Supreme Soviet for approval the suggested structure of the Armed Forces, their size and order of their material and technical supplies&quot;.

On May 6, 1992 the [[Belorussian Military District]] was abolished. The Belarusian Ministry of Defence and the Main Staff were formed from its resources.&lt;ref&gt;I N Rodionov, ed, Belorusskiy voyennyy okrug, Military Encyclopedia, t1, &quot;Voyennoye izdatel'stvo&quot;, Moscow, 1997, 422, cited in Main, 2003, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The former first deputy commander and military district Chief of Staff, Lieutenant-General P P Kozlovskiy, was appointed Minister of Defence on 22 April 1992, taking over from acting Minister of Defence Colonel-General Petr Chaus.

On November 3, 1992, Belarus passed the law &quot;On the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus&quot; defining the status, structure and guiding principles of the Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;Pavel Bykovsky &amp; Alexander Vasilevich, [http://mdb.cast.ru/mdb/5-2001/dp/mdafb/ Military Development and the Armed Forces of Belarus] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205143656/http://mdb.cast.ru/mdb/5-2001/dp/mdafb/ |date=2007-12-05 }}, Moscow Defence Brief, CAST, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; After the introduction of presidency the law was amended twice: on September 4, 1996 and on November 9, 1999 but on the whole the law retains its initial contents.

On January 1, 1993 all service personnel on Belarusian soil were required to either take an oath of loyalty to Belarus, or leave. This oath however did not alleviate concerns regarding loyalty to Russia in time of crisis, especially since nearly 50% of all military personnel were ethnically Russian at the end of 1992.

In June 1995, President Lushenko issued a decree on the Mobile Forces. By June 1996, they comprised a headquarters in Vitebsk, two brigades drawn from the 103rd Guards Airborne Division, the 38th Independent Mobile Brigade ([[Brest, Belarus]]), an air transport regiment, and communications, logistics, and engineer units.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Woff, 'Minsk: making limited progress with reform,' [[Jane's Intelligence Review]], June 1996, 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], as well as the 1996 treaty on the [[Union of Russia and Belarus]] and the Treaty of the Formation of a Union State in 1999, confirmed a close partnership with Russia. Much of the air defence system is integrated into the Russian air defence network, and in 2006 the two nations signed an agreement on the creation of a unified air defence system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/russia/2006/russia-061019-rianovosti02.htm Russia, Belarus to sign agreement on joint air defence system] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212071536/http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/russia/2006/russia-061019-rianovosti02.htm |date=2009-02-12 }}, [[RIA Novosti]] via GlobalSecurity.org, 19 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Belarus government websites say that the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Belarus is supported by Central Command Support Elements and the General Staff of the Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.mil.by/struct1vseng.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502013106/http://mod.mil.by/struct1vseng.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2 May 2006|title=Ministry of Defence of RB - News|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Combat Support Elements of the Armed Forces included Reconnaissance, Electronic Warfare, Signals, Engineer, NBC Defence, Navigation and Topography, and Maintenance organisations. Logistic Elements of the Armed Forces provided Material Support, Logistic Support, Medical Support, Veterinarian Support, and Military Construction.

In 1995 the Military Academy of Belarus was set up on the basis of two military educational institutions – the Minsk Air Defence and Rocket School of the [[Soviet Air Defence Forces]] and the Minsk Higher Military Command School. Its 10 departments train officers of 38 specialties for practically all arms of service. Also in 1995 it was given the status of a government institution of secondary special military education for young men.

The [[Library of Congress]] said that in 1994 Belarus had ground forces of 52,500.&lt;ref name=LOCB&gt;[[Library of Congress Country Studies]], [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+by0067%29 Ground Forces], in A Country Study: Belarus, June 1995&lt;/ref&gt; They were organized into three corps headquarters, two motor divisions, one airborne division, the [[51st Guards Artillery Division]] at [[Osipovichi]],&lt;ref&gt;Feskov et al. 2004, 53, with five artillery brigades and two independent battalions.&lt;/ref&gt; three mechanized divisions, one airborne brigade, three surface-to-surface missile brigades,&lt;ref&gt;Including the 43rd ([[OTR-21 Tochka]]) and 76th (8 НУ 9КЛг) Rocket Brigades at Zaslonovo, probably.&lt;/ref&gt; two antitank brigades, one special duties brigade, and seven anti-aircraft missile brigades. Equipment included 3,108 main battle tanks (seventy-nine T-54, 639 T-55, 291 T-62, 299 T-64, eight T-80, and 1,800 T-72), 419 medium-range launchers, sixty surface to-surface missiles, and 350 surface-to-air missiles.

In 1993 the 7th Tank Army was reorganised as the 7th Army Corps. In 1994 the 7th Army Corps was redesignated as the 65th Army Corps, still located at [[Barysaw|Borisov]].

By January 1, 1995, the composition of the Belarusian ground forces had changed.&lt;ref name=LOCB /&gt; The [[Library of Congress]] estimated at the time that Ministry of Defence forces included the [[103rd Guards Airborne Division]] and the [[38th Guards Mobile Brigade|38th Separate Assault-Landing Brigade]]; the [[28th Army (Soviet Union)|28th Army Corps]] ([[Grodno Region]] and [[Brest Region]]), composed of headquarters at [[Grodno]], the 6th Separate Mechanised Infantry Brigade, the [[11th Guards Mechanized Brigade|11th Guards Mechanised Infantry Brigade]], the 50th Separate Mechanised Infantry Brigade, the Armament and Equipment base, and corps units (missile troops, antiaircraft, chemical and engineer troops, signals, and rear services); the [[65th Army (Soviet Union)|65th Army Corps]] (Minsk and [[Vitebsk Region]]s), composed of headquarters at [[Barysaw|Borisov]], three armament and equipment bases, and corps units; and the 5th Guards Army Corps (Minsk and Mahilyow regions) made up of headquarters at Babruysk, the 30th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade, two Armament and Equipment bases, and corps units.

Actually, the 103rd Guards Airborne Division had been reorganized as Headquarters, Mobile Forces, in 1993.
On 1 August 1996 the 51st Guards Artillery Division was reorganised as the 51st Guards Central Group of Artillery, still located at [[Osipovichi]].&lt;ref&gt;Soldat.ru, [http://www.soldat.ru/force/belarus/spravki.html Brigades of the Belarus Armed Forces] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117204708/http://soldat.ru/force/belarus/spravki.html |date=2013-01-17 }}, accessed December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 December 2001, a major reorganisation of the Ground Forces produced two operational-territorial commands, formed from two former corps headquarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Main, 2003&quot;&gt;Main, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; All Belarus ground forces were now grouped within these two commands, the [[Western Operational Command (Belarus)|Western Operational Command]] at [[Grodno]], former from the previous 28th Army Corps, the former Soviet [[28th Army (Soviet Union)|28th Army]], and the [[North Western Operational Command]], the former 65th Army Corps, at [[Barysaw]] (Borisov).

Since about 2001, territorial defence forces, which as of 2002 number around 150,000, have been forming, organised into battalions, companies, and platoons spread across Belarus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Main, 2003&quot;/&gt;

In 2007, the Land Forces consisted of 29,600 soldiers ([[6th Guards Mechanised Brigade]] ([[Grodno]]), [[11th Guards Mechanized Brigade]] at [[Slonim]], the [[120th Guards Mechanised Brigade]] ([[Minsk]]), 38th and 103rd Mobile Brigades (organized similarly to Soviet airborne regiments, not all of them are equipped with [[BMD-1]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ryadovoy.ru/forum/index.php/topic,406.0.html {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417044140/http://www.ryadovoy.ru/forum/index.php/topic%2C406.0.html |date=2012-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[5th Spetsnaz Brigade]] ([[Maryina Horka]]),&lt;ref&gt;Formed [[Maryina Gorka]], Minsk Oblast, 1 January 1963as the 5th Special Forces Brigade GRU.

On October 1, 2003, the base was considerably strengthened. From other bases of storage of arms and techniques now we are distinguished favorably by new structure. Besides a battalion of protection, storage and service, motor-rifle and tank battalions were added. {{cite web|url=http://www8.brinkster.com/vad777/sng/belorussia%5Cbelorusia.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513075011/http://www8.brinkster.com/vad777/sng/belorussia/belorusia.htm |archivedate=2008-05-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[34th Tank Division|34th]] &amp; [[37th Guards Tank Division|37th]] (former tank divisions), [[3rd Guards Tank Division|3rd]], and 28th ([[Baranovichi]]).

In 2012, it is reported that there are six mechanised brigades in the Ground Forces: three full-strength, the 6th (Grodno), 11th (Slonim), and [[120th Guards Mechanised Brigade]] at [[Minsk]]. The others were at reduced strength, where there was one battalion, the 19th (Zaslonova), 37th, and 50th (Baranovichi).&lt;ref&gt;Vad777&lt;/ref&gt; By 2017, the number of mechanised brigades had been further reduced to four, with two at full strength and two at reduced strength.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

===Air Force and Air Defence Forces===
In 2007 the [[Belarusian Air Force|Air Force and Air Defence Force of Belarus]] (AF &amp; ADF) consisted of 18,170 personnel (two fighter/interceptor bases, four FGA/reconnaissance squadrons, one transport air base, training aircraft, and attack and support helicopters, SAM units). Air Force equipment included in 2004 260 fighter-ground attack/training aircraft and 80 attack helicopters. According to Belarus government websites, the Air Forces now have two commands, the Western Operational-Tactical Command and the North-Western Operational-Tactical Command.

The 61st and 927th Air Bases have now merged into the 61st (fighter) Air Base at [[Baranovichi (air base)|Baranovichi]], flying [[MiG-29]]s, and the 206th Air Base (Ross) has merged into the 116th Guards Assault Air Base at [[Lida (air base)|Lida]], flying [[Su-25]]s.

===Internal Troops===
[[File:SPtriathlon2016-17.jpg|thumb|The Special Purpose Unit of the Internal Troops.]]
The Internal Troops were formed from the former Soviet [[Internal Troops]] after the collapse of the Soviet Union. They consist of three independent brigades and seven independent battalions (consecutively numbered). Among the Internal Troop formations is the 3rd Red Banner separate special purpose Brigade (V/Ch 3214, located in [[Minsk]], in the [[Administrative subdivisions of Minsk#Microraions|district]] Uruchcha, &quot;Uruchenskaya Brigade&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;See https://charter97.eu/en/news/2008/11/17/12125/?1 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425142959/https://charter97.eu/en/news/2008/11/17/12125/?1 |date=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This brigade performs crowd control, combating terrorism tasks, and can assist border guards in case of complications. In addition, the brigade has been training for combined arms operations in the event of armed conflict. It was formed in the 1990s on the base of the 334th Regiment of the [[120th Guards Motor Rifle Division|120th 'Rogachev' Guards Motor Rifle Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryadovoy.ru, {{cite web|url=http://www.ryadovoy.ru/forum/index.php?topic=2514.0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513220720/http://www.ryadovoy.ru/forum/index.php?topic=2514.0 |archivedate=2012-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Territorial Forces ===
The '''Territorial Forces''' ({{lang-be|Тэрытарыяльных Войскаў}}, {{lang-ru|Территориальных Войск}}) are a homeland defence organization in the armed forces. It is managed by the Department of the Territorial Forces, being a support department of the Ministry of Defence of Belarus and is operated by the General Staff. It is currently located on Kommunisticheskaya Street in [[Minsk]]. The current head of the department of territorial troops is Colonel Andrei Paseko.

The Territorial Defence system was established in the early 2000s. Over 120,000 troops constitute the size of the Territorial Forces, which is twice as much as it serves in the regular duty military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.mil.by/ru/news/press_center/publications/8489/ |title = Территориальная оборона в системе национальной безопасности — Военный информационный портал Министерства обороны Республики Беларусь}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an address by President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] on 18 February 2016, he announced the allocation of arms and to the territorial forces and the minimum and maximum amount of district troops ranging from one company and a battalion. Personnel of these units are recruited from residents of their respective administrative-territorial regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://belarusdigest.com/story/strengthening-territorial-defence-new-military-priorities-nato-dialogue-belarus-security-digest/ |title = Strengthening Territorial Defence, New Military Priorities, NATO Dialogue – Belarus Security Digest &amp;#124; BelarusDigest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://belaruspolicy.com/sites/default/files/articles/06.09.2015/territorialnye_voyska_segodnya.pdf Территориальные войска сегодня]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lektsii.org/8-12213.html Законы Республики Беларусь о защите республики]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modernarmy.ru/article/176 Войска территориальной обороны (ТерО)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://zapad-2013.blogspot.com.by/2013/08/blog-post_25.html Территориальная оборона — нормативные акты]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government Directive of 20 March 1992 ‘On the Establishment of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus’ founded the Belarusian army. The Soviet troops of the BMD were smoothly converted into Belarusian military units. Yet one of the first tasks of the Belarusian government was a reduction in its numbers. 240,000 soldiers and officers were serving in the Belarusian Military District. By early 2013 the numbers of military personnel had been scaled down nearly fourfold since 1991. In February 2014, Belorusskaya Voyennaya Gazeta, the official publication of the
Ministry of Defense revealed that the Belarusian Armed Forces contains about 59,500 personnel, including 46,000 soldiers and 13,000 civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vsr.mil.by/2014/02/22/vooruzhennye-sily-respubliki-belarus-na-sovremennom-etape-razvitiya/|title=ВООРУЖЕННЫЕ СИЛЫ РЕСПУБЛИКИ БЕЛАРУСЬ НА СОВРЕМЕННОМ ЭТАПЕ РАЗВИТИЯ — Во славу Родины|website=vsr.mil.by|language=ru-RU|access-date=2018-01-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115001610/https://vsr.mil.by/2014/02/22/vooruzhennye-sily-respubliki-belarus-na-sovremennom-etape-razvitiya/|archive-date=2018-01-15|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equipment ==
[[File:Btr-d Belarus.jpg|thumb|right|[[BTR-D]]]]
The military forces of Belarus are almost exclusively armed with Soviet-era equipment inherited from the Soviet Union. Although large in numbers, some Western experts consider some of it outdated.

“The Belarusian armed forces receive around 100 brand-new and upgraded systems a year,” said in late July 2018, Belarusian Deputy Minister of Defence for Armament and Chief of Armament Major General Sergei Simonenko.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.janes.com/article/82220/belarus-re-arms-airborne-troops |title=Belarus re-arms airborne troops &amp;#124; Jane's 360 |access-date=2018-08-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808130935/https://www.janes.com/article/82220/belarus-re-arms-airborne-troops |archive-date=2018-08-08 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MBTs are of Russian type [[T-72]], [[T-62]], and [[T-55]], the APCs and IFVs are of Russian type [[MT-LB]], [[BMP-2]], [[BMP-1]], and the [[BMD-1]], and Russian type trucks are the [[GAZ-66]] and the KAMAZ-6560. 
While the IISS Military Balance 2016 listed 69 T-80s in service,&lt;ref name=&quot;mb2016&quot;/&gt; by 2018 the listing had been removed, and the only MBTs listed were 527 T-72 as well as 5 T-72B3.

The Air Force is equipped with [[MiG-29]] fighters, [[Su-25]] attack aircraft, as well as [[Mil Mi-8|Mi-8]], [[Mi-24]], and some old, Polish built [[Mil Mi-2|Mi-2]] helicopters. In December 2005, Belarus bought 10 [[Aero L-39|L-39C]] jet trainer aircraft from the [[Ukraine]], and in 2017 a contract have been signed to buy 12 [[Su-30]]SM fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bsblog.info/on-the-purchase-of-su-30sm-for-the-belarusian-air-force/|title=On the purchase of Su-30SM for the Belarusian Air Force|date=20 June 2017|accessdate=23 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180723212417/https://bsblog.info/on-the-purchase-of-su-30sm-for-the-belarusian-air-force/|archive-date=2018-07-23|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, four batteries (''divizions'' in Russian terminology; about 6 systems each) of [[S-300 (missile)|S-300]] anti-aircraft systems were acquired from Russia to reinforce the [[Joint CIS Air Defense System]]. The Military Balance 2018 listed a brigade with the [[S-300P]] and a brigade with the [[S-300V]] ([[SA-12]]A Gladiator/[[SA-12]]B Giant).&lt;ref&gt;IISS Military Balance 2018, p.186.&lt;/ref&gt;
