==Early life==
Campbell was born in [[Royal Oak, Michigan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wise|first1=Damon|title=The Mighty Bruce|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/12/bruce-campbell-evil-dead-my-name-is|accessdate=November 10, 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=February 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Joanne Louise (née Pickens), a homemaker, and Charles Newton Campbell (April 27, 1928 – November 3, 2004), who worked in advertising for 35 years in roles ranging from traveling billboard inspector to company vice-president, later teaching at nine colleges as an adjunct professor, and was also an actor and director in local theater.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/detroitnews/obituary.aspx?n=charles-newton-campbell&amp;pid=182892708&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell has an older brother, Don, and an older half-brother, Michael Rendine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800051843/bio Bruce Campbell biography], ''Yahoo! Movies''&lt;/ref&gt; He is of [[Scottish American|Scottish]] descent.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

==Career==

===Early years===
[[File:Bruce Campbell .jpg|thumb|right|Campbell signing a VHS copy of ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' at a fan meet-and-greet]]
Campbell began acting as a teenager and soon began making short [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8]] movies with friends. After he met [[Sam Raimi]] in [[Wylie E. Groves High School]], the two became very good friends and started making movies together. Campbell would go on to attend [[Western Michigan University]] while he continued to work on his acting career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/12/18/an-interview-with-bruce-campbell?page=1|title=An Interview With Bruce Campbell|work=IGN|date=December 18, 2002|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell and Raimi collaborated on a 30-minute Super 8 version of the first ''Evil Dead'' film, titled ''Within the Woods'', which was initially used to attract investors.

===Major film roles===
A few years later, Campbell and Raimi got together with family and friends and began work on ''[[The Evil Dead]]''. Campbell starred and worked behind the camera, receiving a &quot;co-executive producer&quot; credit. Raimi wrote, directed and edited, while fellow Michigander [[Robert Tapert|Rob Tapert]] was producer. Following an endorsement by horror writer [[Stephen King]], the film slowly began to receive distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/bruce-campbell-toasts-stephen-king-for-helping-get-evil-dead-2-made|title=Bruce Campbell Toasts Stephen King For Helping Get Evil Dead 2 Made|work=SyFyWire|last=Grossberg|first=Josh|date=February 22, 2018|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years following its original release, it became the number one movie in the UK. It then received distribution in the United States, spawning two [[sequel]]s: ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' and ''[[Army of Darkness]]''.

Campbell was also drawn in the Marvel Zombie comics as his character, [[Ash Williams]]. He is featured in five comics, all in the series ''Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness''. In them, he fights alongside the Marvel heroes against the heroes and people who have turned into zombies (deadites) while in search of the [[Necronomicon]] (Book of the Names of the Dead).

He has appeared in many of Raimi's films outside of the ''Evil Dead'' series, notably having cameos in the director's ''[[Spider-Man]]'' [[Spider-Man in film|film series]]. Campbell also joined the cast in Raimi's ''[[Darkman]]'' and ''[[The Quick and the Dead (1995 film)|The Quick and the Dead]]'', though having no actual screen time in the latter film's theatrical cut.

Campbell often takes on quirky roles, such as [[Elvis Presley]] in the film ''[[Bubba Ho-Tep]]''. Along with ''Bubba Ho-Tep'', he played a supporting role in ''[[Maniac Cop]]'' and ''[[Maniac Cop 2]]'', and spoofed his career in the self-directed ''[[My Name is Bruce]].''

Other mainstream films for Campbell include supporting or featured roles in the [[Coen Brothers]] film ''[[The Hudsucker Proxy]]'', the [[Michael Crichton]] adaptation ''[[Congo (film)|Congo]]'', the film version of ''[[McHale's Navy (1997 film)|McHale's Navy]]'', ''[[Escape From L.A.]]'' (the sequel to [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Escape From New York]]''), the [[Jim Carrey]] drama ''[[The Majestic (film)|The Majestic]]'' and the 2005 Disney film ''[[Sky High (2005 film)|Sky High]]''.
 
Campbell had a starring voice role in the hit [[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)|2009 animated adaptation]] of the children's book ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs]]'', and a supporting voice role in [[Pixar]]'s ''[[Cars 2]]''.

In January 2010, he stated in an interview that his new film project is called ''Bruce vs. Frankenstein''.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35405/bruce-campbell-vs-frankenstein-gimme-some-stitches-baby |title=Bruce Campbell Vs. Frankenstein! Gimme Some Stitches, Baby! }}&lt;/ref&gt; a sequel to My Name is Bruce. The film would have been directed and produced by his friend Mike Richardson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.aintitcool.com/node/43676 |title=Listen up, screwheads! Bruce Campbell has a message for ya'! }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later cancelled.

Campbell produced the [[Evil Dead (2013 film)|remake]] of ''The Evil Dead'', along with Raimi and Rob Tapert. Campbell made an appearance that may allude to his signature character, Ash, with the expectation he would reprise that role in ''Army of Darkness 2''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/blog/2013/10/18/bruce-campbell-confirms-he-will-do-army-of-darkness-sequel/|title=Bruce Campbell Confirms He Will Do Army Of Darkness Sequel|author=Joe Comicbook|work=Comicbook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later interview with TV personality [[Erin Ashley Darling]], Campbell announced that ''Army of Darkness 2'' is not happening, saying &quot;It's all internet B.S. There's no reality whatsoever. These random comments slip out of either my mouth, or Sam Raimi's mouth, next thing you know, we're making a sequel.&quot; In September 2017, during a panel at [[Fan Expo Canada]], when asked if audiences could expect 4th ''[[Evil Dead]]'' film, Campbell said &quot;Everybody says Evil Dead 4! Evil Dead 4! You know, if we did an Evil Dead 4, Sam Raimi would spend $200 million on it, and it would bomb.&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nofspodcast.com/bruce-campbell-fan-expo-panel/|title=[EXCLUSIVE] Bruce Campbell Fan Expo Q&amp;A – Hail to the King, Baby! {{!}} Nightmare on Film Street|date=2017-09-05|work=Nightmare on Film Street|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; elaborating that the only future for ''Evil Dead'' is unrestricted distribution via a premium cable network, as ''[[Ash vs Evil Dead]]'' is on [[Starz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt;

When working undercover, his character frequently used the alias Chuck Finley, which Bruce later revealed was the name of one of his father's old co-workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.usanetwork.com/index.php?showtopic=403916|title=Get Burnt DVD commentary feature for episode 3: Fight or Flight|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell was the star of a 2011 ''Burn Notice'' made-for-television [[prequel]] focusing on Sam's Navy SEAL career, titled ''[[Burn Notice: The Fall of Sam Axe]]''.

Despite the inclusion of his character &quot;Ash Williams&quot; in Telltale Games' ''[[Poker Night 2]]'', Danny Webber voices the character in the game, instead of Bruce Campbell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Poker Night 2 (Video Game 2013)|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2813566/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_2|website = IMDb|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lennox in the Exo Zombies mode of ''[[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/bruce-campbell-to-star-in-new-call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-dlc/|title=Bruce Campbell to Star in New Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare DLC|work=PC Gamer|last=Chalk|first=Andy|date=June 1, 2015|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
In addition to acting and occasionally directing, Campbell has become a writer, starting with an autobiography, ''If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor'', published on August 24, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g8zheCbYg1oC|title=Google Books|work=Books.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The autobiography was a successful [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/07/08/bsp/besthardnonfiction.html | work=The New York Times |title=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paperback version of the book adds a chapter about the reaction of fans at book signings.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Whenever I do mainstream stuff, I think they're pseudo-interested, but they're still interested in seeing weirdo, offbeat stuff, and that's what I'm attracted to&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
''If Chins Could Kill'' follows Campbell's career to date as an actor in low-budget films and television, providing his insight into &quot;[[Cinema of the United States|Blue-Collar Hollywood]]&quot;.

Campbell's next book, ''[[Make Love! The Bruce Campbell Way]]'' was published on May 26, 2005. The book's plot involves Bruce (depicted in a comical way) as the main character struggling to make it into the world of [[A-list]] movies. He later recorded an [[radio drama|audio play]] adaptation of ''Make Love'' with fellow Michigan actors, including longtime collaborator [[Ted Raimi]]. This radio drama was released through the independent label Rykodisc and spans 6 discs with a 6-hour running time.

In addition to his books, Campbell also wrote a column for ''[[X Ray Magazine]]'' in 2001, an issue of the popular comic series ''[[The Hire]]'', and comic book adaptations of his ''Man with the Screaming Brain''. Most recently he wrote the introduction to [[Josh Becker]]'s ''The Complete Guide to Low-Budget Feature Filmmaking''.

In late 2016, Campbell announced that he would be releasing a third book, ''Hail to the Chin: Further Confessions of a B Movie Actor,'' which will detail his life from where ''If Chins Could Kill'' left off. ''Hail to the Chin'' was released in August 2017, and accompanied by a book tour across the United States and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bruce-campbell.com/newsroom.asp?specific=747|title=Newsroom - Bruce-Campbell.com|website=www.bruce-campbell.com|accessdate=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell maintained a blog on his official website, where he posted mainly about politics and the film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bruce-campbell.com/blog.asp|title=Bruce Campbell Blog|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blog has since been discontinued.
