'''Bombardier Inc.''' ({{IPA-fr|bɔ̃baʁdje}}) is a Canadian [[multinational corporation|multinational]] manufacturer of [[business jet]]s. It was also formerly a manufacturer of commercial jets, [[public transport]] vehicles, and [[high-speed rail]] train sets. Its aviation division, [[Bombardier Aviation]], is headquartered in [[Montreal]] and its public transport division, [[Bombardier Transportation]], is headquartered in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].

The company manufactures the [[Bombardier Global 7500]] and the [[Bombardier Global Express]] series, the [[Bombardier Challenger 600]] and the [[Bombardier Challenger 300]] series and the [[Learjet 70/75]] series.

The company was founded as a manufacturer of [[snowmobile]]s; however, it sold that line of business in 2003.

==History==
===Bombardier Recreational Products===
{{Main|Bombardier Recreational Products}}
In January 1934, a blizzard prevented [[Joseph-Armand Bombardier]] from reaching the nearest hospital in time to save his two-year-old son, Yvon, who died from [[appendicitis]] complicated by [[peritonitis]].&lt;ref name=skidoo/&gt;&lt;ref name=legacy&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cbc.ca/archives/topic/bombardier-the-snowmobile-legacy | title=Bombardier: The Snowmobile Legacy | publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bombardier was a mechanic who dreamed of building a vehicle that could &quot;float on snow&quot;.&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt; In 1935, in a repair shop in [[Valcourt (city)|Valcourt]], [[Quebec]], he designed and produced the first [[snowmobile]] using a drive system he developed that revolutionized travel in snow and swampy conditions.

In 1937, he patented and sold 12 of the 7-passenger &quot;B7&quot; [[snow coach]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/josepharmand-bombardier-created-the-snowmobile/ | title=Bombardier Conquered Winter With Snowmobile | first=SCOTT S. | last=SMITH | work=[[Investor's Business Daily]] | date=October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were used in rural Quebec to take children to school, carry freight, deliver mail, and as ambulances. In 1941, Bombardier opened a factory in Valcourt.&lt;ref name=workhorse&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/the-bombardier-winter-workhorse-is-born | title=The Bombardier winter workhorse is born | publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] | date=January 1, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, ''L'Auto-Neige Bombardier Limitée'' (&quot;Bombardier Snow Car Limited&quot;) was founded in [[Valcourt (city)|Valcourt]].&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;

During [[World War II]], the [[Government of Canada]] issued wartime [[rationing]] regulations. Bombardier customers had to prove that snowmobiles were essential to their livelihood in order to buy one. The company then shifted its focus to the [[arms industry]].&lt;ref name=workhorse/&gt;

In 1947, during a blizzard in [[Saskatchewan]], the company received positive press coverage when army snowmobiles with supplies reached isolated radio communication towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/rescue-by-snowmobile | title=Rescue by snowmobile | publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, the [[Government of Quebec]] passed a law requiring all roads to be cleared of snow; Bombardier's sales fell by nearly half in one year. Armand Bombardier therefore decided to diversify his business, first by producing tracked [[snowplow]]s sized specifically for use on municipal sidewalks, replacing [[horse-drawn vehicle]]s, then by making [[all-terrain vehicle]]s for the [[mining]], petroleum, and [[forestry]] industries.&lt;ref name=workhorse/&gt;

The machines had removable front skis that could be replaced with front wheels for use on paved or hard surfaces, thus providing greater utility to his large snowmobiles. In 1951, the wooden bodies were replaced with sheet steel and these vehicles were powered by [[Chrysler]] flathead six-cylinder engines and 3-speed manual transmissions.

In the early 1950s, Bombardier focused on developing a snowmobile for 1 or 2 passengers. A breakthrough occurred in 1957 when Bombardier developed a one piece molded rubber [[continuous track]] with enough durability to provide snow-gripping [[Traction (engineering)|traction]] for lightweight vehicles. The vehicle was called the &quot;Ski-Dog&quot; because it was meant to replace the [[dog sled]] for hunters and trappers. However, in 1958, &quot;[[Ski-Doo]]&quot; was accidentally painted on the first prototype.&lt;ref name=skidoo&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=seMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA94 | title=Ski-doo: 50 years on snow | last=Skorupa | first=Joe | journal=[[Popular Mechanics]] | volume=169 | issue=1 | pages=94, 95 | publisher=[[Hearst Communications]] | date=January 1992 | issn=0032-4558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public soon discovered that speedy vehicles that could zoom over snow were a lot of fun. Suddenly, a new winter sport was born, centered in Quebec. In the first year, Bombardier sold 225 Ski-Doos; four years later, 8,210 were sold. Bombardier slowed down promotion of the Ski-Doo line to prevent it from dominating the other company products, while still dominating the snowmobile industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/bombardier-just-for-the-fun-of-it | title=Snowmobiling just for the fun of it | publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] | date=March 15, 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; against competitors [[Polaris Industries]] and [[Arctic Cat]].

In 1963, [[Roski]] was created in [[Roxton Falls, Quebec]] as a manufacturer of composite parts for the Ski-Doo. In the 1960s, [[V-8 engine]]s were added.

On February 18, 1964, J. Armand Bombardier died of [[cancer]] at age 56. Until then, he oversaw all areas of operation and controlled the research department, making all the drawings himself. The younger generation took over, led by Armand's sons and sons-in-law. The young team reorganized and decentralized the company. The company adopted the computer to handle inventory, accounts, and billing. Distribution networks were improved and increased, and an [[incentive program]] was developed for sales staff.&lt;ref name=younger&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/younger-generation-takes-over-bombardier | title=Younger generation takes over Bombardier | publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] | date=April 12, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, a survey was mailed to Ski-Doo owners to find out how the product was being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oK8tAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jqAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;hl=fr&amp;pg=866%2C6884565 | title=Look What's Behind the Snowmobile King | work=[[Montreal Gazette]] | date=March 29, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germain Bombardier, who had been groomed by his father, took over the company upon his father's death in 1964. However, he quit and sold his shares in 1966 after a disagreement with other family members. [[Laurent Beaudoin]], the son-in-law of the founder, then became president, a position he held until 1999.&lt;ref name=younger/&gt;

In 1967, the company was renamed ''Bombardier Limited''. By that time, the snowmobiles were very useful for the [[Inuit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/inuit-embrace-the-snowmobile | title=Inuit embrace the snowmobile | publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] | date=August 7, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, [[Clayton Jacobson II]] invented the [[Personal watercraft|jet ski]] and the company licensed his patents to create the [[Sea-Doo]] [[personal watercraft]].&lt;ref name=guided&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.pressreader.com/new-zealand/manawatu-standard/20071120/284352605187066 | title=Guided Enterprise | work=[[Manawatu Standard]] | date=November 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 23, 1969, the company became a [[public company]], listing on the [[Montreal Exchange]] and the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/aerospace-company-bombardier-a-timeline-1.2781982 | title=Aerospace company Bombardier: A timeline | work=[[CTV News]] | date=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969–1970, the standard round windows reminiscent of [[porthole]]s were replaced with larger rectangular windows that provided more interior light. A change was made to the [[Chrysler]] Industrial 318 engines with the automatic Loadflite transmissions.&lt;ref name=guided/&gt;

In 1970, the company acquired [[Rotax]], an engine manufacturer based in [[Gunskirchen]], [[Austria]].

In 1971, Bombardier acquired [[Moto-Ski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://amsnow.com/news/vintage/2009/03/1971-moto-ski-bullet | title=1971 Moto-Ski Bullet | first=Les | last=Pinz | work=American Snowmobiler | date=March 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1971, Bombardier launched Operation SnoPlan, a program to promote snowmobile safety after a mounting death toll due to snowmobile accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/ski-doo-backlash | title=Ski-Doo backlash | publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] | date=January 9, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the company began producing [[Can-Am motorcycles]], which included [[Rotax]] engines.&lt;ref name=guided/&gt;

In 2003, the company sold [[Bombardier Recreational Products]] to a group of investors: [[Bain Capital]] (50%), Bombardier Family (35%) and [[Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec]] (15%) for $875 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB106198653325581800 | title=Bombardier to Sell Subsidiary To Group Led by Bain Capital | first=Christopher J. | last=Chipello | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=August 27, 2003 | url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2016, Bombardier delivered the first CSeries CS100 aircraft (now called the [[Airbus A220]]) to [[Swiss International Air Lines]]. [[Air Canada]] placed an order for the aircraft one day earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2016/06/28/air-canada-finalizes-38b-order-for-45-bombardier-cseries-jets.html | title=Air Canada finalizes $3.8B order for 45 Bombardier CSeries jets | work=[[Toronto Star]] | date=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Bombardier Transportation}}
The company diversified into rail transport after the [[1970s energy crisis]] reduced demand for snowmobiles.

In 1974, the company received its first order – to build [[MR-73]] trains for [[Société de transport de Montréal]] for use on the [[Montreal Metro]].
In 1975, the company acquired [[Montreal Locomotive Works]]. It was sold to [[General Electric]] in 1988.

In 1982, the company won a contract from New York's [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] to build 825 subway cars for $663 million.&lt;ref name=canadair/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/18/business/company-news-bombardier-inc.html | title=COMPANY NEWS; Bombardier Inc. | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=December 18, 1982 | url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the company ceased manufacturing locomotives and concentrated on producing passenger train [[rolling stock]]. It acquired a 45% stake in [[La Brugeoise et Nivelles]] (formerly BN Constructions Ferroviaires et Métalliques) based in [[Bruges]] in 1986, the assets of U.S. railcar manufacturers [[Budd Company]] and [[Pullman Company]] in 1987, and [[ANF Industrie]] based in [[Crespin, Nord]], [[France]] in 1989. A series of acquisitions in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], [[Canada]], and [[Mexico]] further increased operations.

In 1996, the company was selected as the lead developer for the [[Acela Express]] trains, the fastest trains in North America, in a $710 million contract. Problems with the trains resulted in lawsuits between the company and [[Amtrak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bombardier-blames-amtrak-for-train-problems-1.308822 | title=Bombardier blames Amtrak for train problems | work=[[CBC News]] | date=August 7, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Bombardier acquired [[Adtranz]] (DaimlerChrysler Rail Systems), a manufacturer of trains which were widely used throughout Germany and [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], becoming one of the largest manufacturers of railway [[rolling stock]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/4461015/Daimler-sells-rail-business-to-Bombardier-of-Canada.html | title=Daimler sells rail business to Bombardier of Canada | first=Benjamin | last=Wootliff | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=August 5, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bombardier.com/en/transportation/about-transportation/history?docID=0901260d8001dffa |title=History of Bombardier – Planes and Trains | publisher=Bombardier}}&lt;/ref&gt; This division produced the [[Bombardier Turbostar]].

In 2005, it launched the [[Bombardier Zefiro]] [[high-speed rail]], with speeds of 200–380 [[kilometres per hour]], for the [[Ministry of Railways (China)]].

On February 13, 2020 Alstom agreed to buy the Bombardier Transportation division for €7 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.fliegerfaust.com/alstom-buys-bombardier-2645131713.html | title=Alstom Buys Bombardier Transportation for Seven Billion Euros (US$7 Billion - CDN$10 Billion) - FliegerFaust | first=Dieter | last=Fockenbrock | work=[[Flieger Faust]] | date=February 12, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divested lines of business==
===Bombardier Capital===
From 1973, when it was based in [[Colchester, Vermont]], Bombardier Capital offered financial services such as lending and leasing.

{{main|GAC Ireland}}
In the late 1970s in the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[CIÉ]] (now [[Bus Éireann]] and [[Dublin Bus]]) commissioned a range of single and [[double-decker bus]]es to be designed and produced. The prototypes were devised in Germany and production of 51 express coaches (KE type) and 366 [[double-decker bus]]es (KD type) were assembled between 1980 and 1983 at a facility in [[Shannon, County Clare]]. They remained in service until 1997 and 2000 respectively. Some surviving examples are now exhibited at the [[National Transport Museum of Ireland]] at [[Howth Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Conway | first=Shane | url=http://www.classicbuses.co.uk/+Bombardier.html | title=The Bombardier buses and coaches of CIE | publisher=The Classic Irish Buses website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bombardier Museum==

The '''Museum of Ingenuity J. Armand Bombardier''' is a museum in Valcourt, Quebec dedicated to the life of Joseph-Armand Bombardier and the snowmobile industry. Opened in 1971, with substantial renovations in 1990, the museum is professionally curated and features a wide array of Ski-Doos, other industrial designs, and a selection of related books, booklets and other items of interest to snowmobile enthusiasts.&lt;ref name=museum&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.museebombardier.com/index.php | title=Museum of Ingenuity J. Armand Bombardier | publisher=Museum of Ingenuity J. Armand Bombardier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum includes the original garage &quot;factory&quot; where the first snowmobile was built. The garage was carefully removed from its original location in Valcourt and moved to its present site at the museum, which is located blocks away from the present-day [[Bombardier Recreational Products]] factory.&lt;ref name=museum/&gt;
