'''Broadway''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|ɔː|d|w|eɪ}}) is a road in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]]. Broadway runs from [[State Street (Manhattan)|State Street]] at [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]] for {{convert|13|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} through the [[Boroughs of New York City|borough]] of [[Manhattan]] and {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} through [[the Bronx]], exiting north from the city to run an additional {{convert|18|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} through the municipalities of [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]], [[Hastings-on-Hudson, New York|Hastings-On-Hudson]], [[Dobbs Ferry, New York|Dobbs Ferry]], [[Irvington, New York|Irvington]], and [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]], and terminating north of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref group=notes&gt;There are four other streets named &quot;Broadway&quot; in New York City's remaining three boroughs: one each in [[Brooklyn]] ([[Broadway (Brooklyn)|see main article]]) and [[Staten Island]], and two in [[Queens]] (one running from [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria]] to [[Elmhurst, Queens|Elmhurst]], and the other in [[Hamilton Beach, Queens|Hamilton Beach]]). Each borough therefore has a street named &quot;Broadway&quot;. See also from [[Forgotten NY]]:

&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the oldest north–south main thoroughfare in New York City, with much of the current street beginning as the [[Wecquaesgeek|Wickquasgeck trail]] before the arrival of Europeans.   This formed the basis for one of the primary thoroughfares of the Dutch [[New Amsterdam]] colony, which continued under British rule, although most of it did not bear its current name until the late 19th century. 

Broadway in Manhattan is known widely as the heart of the [[Broadway theatre|American commercial theatrical industry]], and is used as a [[metonym]] for it, as well as in the names of alternative theatrical ventures such as [[Off-Broadway]] and [[Off-Off-Broadway]].

==History==

Broadway was originally the [[Wecquaesgeek|Wickquasgeck trail]], carved into the brush of Manhattan by its [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] inhabitants.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The name of the Indian band has variously been spelled Wiechquaeskeck, Wechquaesqueck, Weckquaesqueek, Wecquaesgeek, Weekquaesguk, Wickquasgeck, Wickquasgek, Wiequaeskeek, Wiequashook, and Wiquaeskec.The meaning of the name, however spelled, has been given as &quot;the end of the marsh, swamp or wet meadow&quot;, &quot;place of the bark kettle&quot;, and &quot;birch bark country&quot;. See:

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trail originally snaked through swamps and rocks along the length of Manhattan Island.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;According to author [[Russell Shorto]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;Broadway does not follow the precise course of the Indian trail, as some historians would have it. To follow the Wickquasgeck trail today, one would take Broadway north from the [[Alexander Hamilton U. S. Custom House|Customs House]], jog eastward along [[Park Row (Manhattan)|Park Row]], then follow the [[Bowery]] to [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|Twenty-third Street]]. From there, the trail snaked up the east side of the island. It crossed westward through the top of [[Central Park]]; the paths of Broadway and the Wickquasgeck trail converge again at the top of the island. The trail continued into [[the Bronx]]; [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|Route 9]] follows it northward.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Upon the arrival of the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]], the trail was widened&lt;ref name=shortobroad&gt;[[Russell Shorto|Shorto, Russell]] (2005) ''[[The Island at the Center of the World]]'' New York: Vintage Books. p.60,note {{isbn|978-1-4000-7867-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon became the main road through the island from ''Nieuw Amsterdam'' at the southern tip. The Dutch explorer and entrepreneur [[David Pietersz. de Vries]] gives the first mention of it in his journal for the year 1642 (&quot;the Wickquasgeck Road over which the Indians passed daily&quot;). The Dutch called it the ''Heeren Wegh'' or ''Heeren Straat'', meaning &quot;Gentlemen's Way&quot; or &quot;Gentlemen's Street&quot; &amp;ndash; echoing the name of a similar street in Amsterdam &amp;ndash; or &quot;High Street&quot; or &quot;the Highway&quot;; it was re-named &quot;Broadway&quot; after the British took over the city, because of its unusual width.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lorenzini |first1=Michael |title=The Dutch and the English, Part 2: A Wall by any other name |url=http://www.archives.nyc/blog/2017/2/23/the-dutch-the-english-part-2-a-wall-by-any-other-name |website=New York Department of Records and Information Services |publisher=NYC Archives|date=February 23, 2017 |accessdate=August 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gotham|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shortobroad /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite streetbook|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite naming|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;It is also claimed that the Dutch called it &quot;''Breede Weg''&quot;, of which &quot;Broadway&quot; is a literal translation.

Accessed June 16, 2016. &quot;One other thing which came from the Dutch is the name of our street, Broadway, which by them was called the Breede Weg, the translation being afterward made by the English.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Although currently the name of the street is simply &quot;Broadway&quot;, in a 1776 map of New York City, it is labeled as &quot;Broadway Street&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;1776 NYC Map&quot;&gt;See the map inset.

In the 18th century, Broadway ended at the town commons north of [[Wall Street]], where traffic continued up the [[East Side (Manhattan)|East Side]] of the island via [[Eastern Post Road]] and the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]] via Bloomingdale Road.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The latter, which opened in 1703, continued up to 117th Street and contributed to the development of the modern [[Upper West Side]] into an upscale area with mansions.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYCL-2464&quot;/&gt;{{rp|8}} In 1868, Bloomingdale Road between 59th Street (at the Grand Circle, now [[Columbus Circle]]) and 155th Streets would be paved and widened, becoming an avenue with landscaped medians.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYCL-2464&quot;/&gt;{{rp|10}} It was called &quot;Western Boulevard&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gpxBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130 Traffic regulations for the Western Boulevard] General Ordinances of the City of New York&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;The Boulevard&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYCL-2464&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/2464.pdf|title=Riverside-West End Historic District Extension II Designation Report|date=June 23, 2015|website=|publisher=[[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} An 1897 official map of the city shows a segment of what is now Broadway as &quot;Kingsbridge Road&quot; in the vicinity of [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NYC_Reference_Map_ACC_6027.tif|title=NYC Manhattan Borough President's Office City Map Reference Map ACC 6027|author=New York City Manhattan Borough President's Office|date=December 1, 1897|accessdate=March 22, 2017|via=[[Wikimedia Commons]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 1899, the name &quot;Broadway&quot; was extended to the entire Broadway / Bloomingdale / Boulevard /  Kingsbridge complex.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120906001428/http://www.ny1.com/6-bronx-news-content/features/4215/february-14th-in-nyc-history February 14th in NYC History: 1899], referred to as &quot;the 'Western' Boulevard&quot;; called &quot;the 'Grand' Boulevard&quot; in ''The New York Times'', February 1869, quoted in Michael V.

===Traffic flow===
Broadway once was a [[two-way street]] for its entire length. The present status, in which it runs [[one-way traffic|one-way]] southbound south of [[Columbus Circle]] ([[59th Street (Manhattan)|59th Street]]), came about in several stages. On June 6, 1954, [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] became southbound and [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]] became northbound south of Broadway. None of Broadway became one-way, but the increased southbound traffic between Columbus Circle (Eighth Avenue) and [[Times Square]] (Seventh Avenue) caused the city to re-stripe that section of Broadway for four southbound and two northbound lanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=7th and 8th Aves.

[[File:Broadway, looking north from Broome Street, Manhattan (circa 1853-1855).jpg|thumb|right|267px|Looking north from Broome Street (circa 1853-55)]]

Another change was made on November 10, 1963, when Broadway became one-way southbound from Herald Square to [[Madison Square]] ([[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]]) and [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]] ([[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]]) to Canal Street, and two routes – [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] south of Herald Square and [[Centre Street (Manhattan)|Centre Street]], [[Lafayette Street]], and [[Fourth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fourth Avenue]] south of Union Square – became one-way northbound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=City to Extend One-Way Traffic to 3 Manhattan Routes Sunday |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/11/05/archives/city-to-extend-oneway-traffic-to-3-manhattan-routes-sunday-broadway.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 5, 1963 |page=1 |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, at the same time as [[Madison Avenue]] became one-way northbound and [[Fifth Avenue]] became one-way southbound, Broadway was made one-way southbound between Madison Square (where Fifth Avenue crosses) and [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]] on January 14, 1966, completing its conversion south of Columbus Circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=5th and Madison Will Go One-Way Early Next Year |first=Joseph C. |last=Ingraham |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1965/05/12/archives/5th-and-madison-will-go-oneway-early-next-year-barnes-also-says.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 12, 1965 |page=1 |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Barnes Suggests Express Bus Runs|first=Farnsworth|last=Fowle|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1966/01/17/archives/barnes-suggests-express-bus-runs-says-oneway-traffic-flow-will.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 17, 1966|page=1|accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, a one-block section of Broadway between [[72nd Street (Manhattan)|72nd Street]] and [[73rd Street (Manhattan)|73rd Street]] at [[Verdi Square]] was reconfigured. Its easternmost lanes, which formerly hosted northbound traffic, were turned into a public park when a new subway entrance for the [[72nd Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|72nd Street]]  station was built in the exact location of these lanes. Northbound traffic on Broadway is now channeled onto [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Amsterdam Avenue]] to 73rd Street, makes a left turn on the three-lane 73rd Street, and then a right turn on Broadway shortly afterward.

In August 2008, two traffic lanes from 42nd to 35th Streets were taken out of service and converted to public plazas. Additionally, bike lanes were added on Broadway from 42nd Street down to Union Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=City to Make Two Broadway Lanes Bikes, Walkers Only for Seven Blocks |first=Pete |last=Donohue |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/07/10/2008-07-10_city_to_make_two_broadway_lanes_bikes_wa.html |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |location=New York |date=July 10, 2008 |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/broadwayblvd.pdf Broadway Boulevard I]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Broadway-1885-APL.jpeg|thumb|left|267px|In 1885, the Broadway commercial district was overrun with telephone, telegraph, and electrical lines. This view was north from Cortlandt and [[Maiden Lane (Manhattan)|Maiden Lane]].]]

Since May 2009, the portions of Broadway through Duffy Square, Times Square, and Herald Square have been closed entirely to automobile traffic, except for cross traffic on the Streets and Avenues, as part of a traffic and pedestrianization experiment, with the pavement reserved exclusively for walkers, cyclists, and those lounging in temporary seating placed by the city. The city decided that the experiment was successful and decided to make the change permanent in February 2010. Though the anticipated benefits to traffic flow were not as large as hoped, pedestrian injuries dropped dramatically and foot traffic increased in the designated areas; the project was popular with both residents and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New York Traffic Experiment Gets Permanent Run |first=Michael M. |last=Grynbaum |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 11, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/nyregion/12broadway.html |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current portions converted into pedestrian plazas are between West 47th Street and West 42nd Street within Times and Duffy Squares, and between West 35th Street and West 33rd Street in the Herald Square area. Additionally, portions of Broadway in the Madison Square and Union Square have been dramatically narrowed, allowing ample pedestrian plazas to exist along the side of the road.

In May 2013, the [[New York City Department of Transportation|NYCDOT]] decided to redesign Broadway between 35th and 42nd Streets for the second time in five years, owing to poor connections between pedestrian plazas and decreased vehicular traffic. With the new redesign, the bike lane is now on the right side of the street; it was formerly on the left side adjacent to the pedestrian plazas, causing conflicts between pedestrian and bicycle traffic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/2012-10-22-broadway-blvd-35-42.pdf Broadway Boulevard II]&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring 2017,  as part of a capital reconstruction of Worth Square, Broadway between 24th and 25th Street was converted to a &quot;[[Shared space|shared street]]&quot; where through vehicles are banned and delivery vehicles are restricted to {{convert|5|mph|km/h}}. Delivery vehicles go northbound from Fifth Avenue to 25th Street for that one block, reversing the direction of traffic and preventing vehicles from going south on Broadway south of 25th Street. The capital project expands on a 2008 initiative where part of the intersection of Broadway and Fifth Avenue was repurposed into a public plaza, simplifying that intersection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.madisonsquarepark.org/about-the-park/worth-square-project|title=Worth Square Project|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Madison Square Park Conservancy|access-date=May 14, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the 2017 project, Worth Square was expanded, converting the adjoining block of Broadway into a &quot;shared street.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/flatiron-shared-street-mar2017.pdf|title=Flatiron Shared Street CB 5 Transportation Committee|publisher=[[New York City Department of Transportation]]|date=March 27, 2017|accessdate=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Route==
{{For|the concurrency with U.S. 9 north of 178th Street|U.S. Route 9 in New York}}

===Route description===
Broadway runs the length of Manhattan Island, roughly parallel to the [[North River (Hudson River)|North River]] (the portion of the [[Hudson River]] bordering Manhattan), from [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]] at the south to [[Inwood, Manhattan|Inwood]] at the northern tip of the island. South of [[Columbus Circle]], it is a one-way southbound street. Since 2009, vehicular traffic has been banned at [[Times Square]] between [[47th Street (Manhattan)|47th]] and [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Streets]], and at [[Herald Square]] between 35th and 33rd Streets as part of a pilot program; the right-of-way is intact and reserved for cyclists and pedestrians. From the northern shore of Manhattan, Broadway crosses [[Spuyten Duyvil Creek]] via the [[Broadway Bridge (Manhattan)|Broadway Bridge]] and continues through [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]] (a discontinuous portion of the borough of Manhattan) and [[the Bronx]] into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|U.S. 9]] continues to be known as Broadway until its junction with [[New York State Route 117|NY 117]].

====Lower Manhattan====
[[File:Upbroadway e.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A view up Broadway from Bowling Green, with the [[Chrysler Building]] visible in the background]]

The section of lower Broadway from its origin at Bowling Green to City Hall Park is the historical location for the city's [[ticker-tape parade]]s, and is sometimes called the &quot;[[#Canyon of Heroes|Canyon of Heroes]]&quot; during such events. West of Broadway, as far as [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]], was the city's fashionable residential area until circa 1825; landfill has more than tripled the area, and the [[Hudson River]] shore now lies far to the west, beyond [[Tribeca]] and [[Battery Park City]].

Broadway marks the boundary between [[Greenwich Village]] to the west and the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] to the east, passing [[Astor Place]]. It is a short walk from there to [[New York University]] near [[Washington Square Park]], which is at the foot of [[Fifth Avenue]]. A bend in front of [[Grace Church (Manhattan)|Grace Church]] allegedly avoids an earlier tavern; from 10th Street it begins its long diagonal course across Manhattan, headed almost due north.

====Midtown Manhattan====
[[File:Bway.jpg|thumb|right|175px|A view of Broadway in 1909]]

Because Broadway preceded the grid that the [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]] imposed on the island, Broadway crosses [[midtown Manhattan]] diagonally, intersecting with both the east-west streets and north-south avenues. Broadway's intersections with avenues, marked by &quot;[[town square|squares]]&quot; (some merely triangular slivers of open space), have induced some interesting architecture, such as the [[Flatiron Building]].

At [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]], Broadway crosses [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]], merges with [[Park Avenue|Fourth Avenue]], and continues its diagonal uptown course from the Square's northwest corner; Union Square is the only location wherein the physical section of Broadway is discontinuous in Manhattan (other portions of Broadway in Manhattan are pedestrian-only plazas). At [[Madison Square]], the location of the Flatiron Building, Broadway crosses Fifth Avenue at [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]], and is discontinuous to vehicles for a one-block stretch between 24th and 25th Streets. At [[Greeley Square]] (West 33rd Street), Broadway crosses [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] (Avenue of the Americas), and is discontinuous to vehicles. [[Macy's Herald Square]] department store, one block north of the vehicular discontinuity, is located on the northwest corner of Broadway and West 34th Street and southwest corner of Broadway and West 35th Street; it is one of the largest [[department store]]s in the world.

[[File:Broadway looking north from 48th Street Manhattan.jpeg|thumb|left|Broadway looking north from 48th Street in the Theater District]]
One famous stretch near [[Times Square]], where Broadway crosses Seventh Avenue in [[midtown Manhattan]], is the home of many [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[theatre (structure)|theatres]], housing an ever-changing array of commercial, large-scale plays, particularly [[musical theatre|musicals]]. This area of Manhattan is often called the [[Theater District, Manhattan|Theater District]] or the Great White Way, a nickname originating in the headline &quot;Found on the Great White Way&quot; in the edition of February 3, 1902 of the ''[[New York Evening Telegram]]''. The journalistic nickname was inspired by the millions of lights on theater [[Marquee (sign)|marquees]] and [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] advertisements that illuminate the area. After becoming the city's de facto [[red-light district]] in the 1960s and 1970s (as can be seen in the films ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]''), since the late 1980s Times Square has emerged as a family tourist center, in effect being [[Disneyfication|Disneyfied]] following the company's purchase and renovation of the [[New Amsterdam Theatre]] on 42nd Street in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlap, David W. [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/28/nyregion/after-a-decade-disney-chief-sees-new-flair-on-42nd-st.html &quot;After a Decade, Disney Chief Sees New 'Flair' on 42nd St.&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 28, 2004.

He emerged from under the marquee of the New Amsterdam Theater, whose opulent revival in Disney's hands has been credited as a key catalyst in the redevelopment of 42nd Street.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'', from which the Square gets its name, was published at offices at 239 West 43rd Street; the paper stopped printing papers there on June 15, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Copy! |first=David W. |last=Dunlap |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/10/weekinreview/10dunlap.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 10, 2007 |accessdate=October 10, 2008 |quote=The sound is muffled by wall-to-wall carpet tiles and fabric-lined cubicles.

====Upper West Side====

At the southwest corner of [[Central Park]], Broadway crosses [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]] (called Central Park West north of 59th Street) at [[59th Street (Manhattan)|West 59th Street]] and [[Columbus Circle]]; on the site of the former [[New York Coliseum]] convention center is the new shopping center at the foot of the [[Time Warner Center]], headquarters of [[Time Warner]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregor, Alison. [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/18/realestate/commercial/18circle.html &quot;A New Star in the Columbus Circle Orbit&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 18, 2006. Accessed June 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; From Columbus Circle northward, Broadway becomes a wide [[boulevard]] to 169th Street; it retains landscaped [[median (road)|center islands]] that separate northbound from southbound traffic.  The medians are a vestige of the central mall of &quot;The Boulevard&quot; that had become the spine of the [[Upper West Side]], and many of these contain public seating.

Broadway intersects with [[Columbus Avenue (Manhattan)|Columbus Avenue]] (known as Ninth Avenue south of [[59th Street (Manhattan)|West 59th Street]]) at West 65th and 66th Streets where the [[Juilliard School]] and [[Lincoln Center]], both well-known performing arts landmarks, as well as the [[Manhattan New York Temple]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] are located.

[[File:72Bway.png|thumb|right|175px|X-shaped intersection of Broadway (from lower right to upper left) and Amsterdam Avenue (lower left to upper right), looking north from Sherman Square to West 72nd Street and the treetops of Verdi Square]]

Between West 70th and 73rd Streets, Broadway intersects with [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Amsterdam Avenue]] (known as 10th Avenue south of West 59th Street).  The wide intersection of the two thoroughfares has historically been the site of numerous traffic accidents and pedestrian casualties, partly due to the long crosswalks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Safety Fixes Slated for One of Manhattan's Most Dangerous Intersections | url = http://www.streetsblog.org/2010/09/23/safety-fixes-slated-for-one-of-manhattans-most-dangerous-intersections/ | accessdate = February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two small triangular plots of land were created at points where Broadway slices through Amsterdam Avenue.  One is a tiny fenced-in patch of shrubbery and plants at West 70th Street called [[Sherman Square]] (although it and the surrounding intersection have also been known collectively as Sherman Square), and the other triangle is a lush tree-filled garden bordering Amsterdam Avenue from just above West 72nd Street to West 73rd Street. Named [[Verdi Square]] in 1921 for its monument to Italian composer [[Giuseppe Verdi]], which was erected in 1909, this triangular sliver of public space was designated a Scenic Landmark by the Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1974, one of nine city parks that have received the designation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/verdi-square Verdi Square], [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]]. Accessed June 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s, the area surrounding both Verdi Square and Sherman Square was known by local drug users and dealers as &quot;Needle Park&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard F.|last=Shepard|title=Strolling Up Broadway, The West Side's Spine|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/08/books/strolling-up-broadway-the-west-side-s-spine.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 8, 1988|accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was featured prominently in the gritty 1971 dramatic film ''[[The Panic in Needle Park]]'', directed by [[Jerry Schatzberg]] and starring [[Al Pacino]] in his second onscreen role.

The original brick and stone shelter leading to the entrance of the [[72nd Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|72nd Street]] subway station, one of the [[Early history of the IRT subway|first 28 subway stations]] in Manhattan, remains located on one of the wide islands in the center of Broadway, on the south side of West 72nd Street.  For many years, all traffic on Broadway flowed on either side of this median and its subway entrance, and its uptown lanes went past it along the western edge of triangular Verdi Square.  In 2001 and 2002, renovation of the historic 72nd Street station and the addition of a second subway control house and passenger shelter on an adjacent center median just north of 72nd Street, across from the original building, resulted in the creation of a public plaza with stone pavers and extensive seating, connecting the newer building with Verdi Square, and making it necessary to divert northbound traffic to Amsterdam Avenue for one block.  While Broadway's southbound lanes at this intersection were unaffected by the new construction, its northbound lanes are no longer contiguous at this intersection.  Drivers can either continue along Amsterdam Avenue to head uptown or turn left on West 73rd Street to resume traveling on Broadway.

Several notable apartment buildings are in close proximity to this intersection, including [[The Ansonia]], its ornate architecture dominating the cityscape here. After the Ansonia first opened as a hotel, live seals were kept in indoor fountains inside its lobby.  Later, it was home to the infamous [[Plato's Retreat]] nightclub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=deCourcy Hinds|title=A Conversion Plan Roils the Ansonia|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/realestate/a-conversion-plan-roils-the-ansonia.html?smid=pl-share|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 8, 1987|accessdate=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately north of Verdi Square is the formidable [[Apple Bank for Savings]] building, formerly the Central Savings Bank, which was built in 1926 and designed to resemble the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amsterdammin' from West 72nd–110th|url=http://forgotten-ny.com/2010/11/amsterdammin-from-west-72nd-110th/|date=November 2010|accessdate=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadway is also home to the [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]] at West 74th Street, designated a national landmark in 1979 and still in operation as a concert venue after its establishment in 1929 as a vaudeville and music hall, and &quot;sister&quot; venue to [[Radio City Music Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beacon Theatre History|url=http://www.beacontheatre.com/about/history.html|accessdate=February 10, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214014236/http://www.beacontheatre.com/about/history.html|archivedate=February 14, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its intersection with West 78th Street, Broadway shifts direction and continues directly uptown and aligned approximately with the Commissioners' grid. Past the bend are the historic  [[the Apthorp|Apthorp]] apartment building, built in 1908, and the [[First Baptist Church in the City of New York]], incorporated in New York in 1762, its current building on Broadway erected in 1891. The road heads north and passes historically important apartment houses such as [[the Belnord]], the [[Astor Court Building]], and the [[Art Nouveau]] [[The Cornwall|Cornwall]].&lt;ref&gt;Horsley, Carter B.

At Broadway and 95th Street is [[Symphony Space]], established in 1978 as home to avant-garde and classical music and dance performances in the former Symphony Theatre, which was originally built in 1918 as a premier &quot;music and motion-picture house&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Written on the Screen| url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/04/21/102693641.pdf | date = April 21, 1918 | accessdate=February 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Symphony Space History | url = http://www.symphonyspace.org/history | accessdate=February 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At 99th Street, Broadway passes between the controversial skyscrapers of [[the Ariel]] East and West.

At 107th Street, Broadway merges with [[West End Avenue]], with the intersection forming [[Straus Park]] with its Titanic Memorial by [[Augustus Lukeman]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/straus-park/history Straus Park], [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]].

Broadway then passes the campus of [[Columbia University]] at [[116th Street (Manhattan)|116th Street]] in [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]], in part on the tract that housed the [[Bloomingdale Insane Asylum]] from 1808 until it moved to [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Lombardi, Kate Stone. [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/16/nyregion/hospital-marking-its-100th-year.html &quot;Hospital Marking Its 100th Year&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 16, 1994. Accessed June 16, 2016. &quot;When lower Broadway became more urbanized, the asylum was moved to upper Manhattan, on what is now the site of Columbia University. (The area was referred to as Bloomingdale -- vale of flowers -- by early Dutch settlers, and the hospital was named the Bloomingdale Asylum.) &quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Still in Morningside Heights, Broadway passes the park-like campus of [[Barnard College]]. Next, the Gothic quadrangle of [[Union Theological Seminary (Manhattan)|Union Theological Seminary]] and the brick buildings of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] with their landscaped interior courtyards face one another across Broadway. On the next block is the [[Manhattan School of Music]].

Broadway then runs past the proposed uptown campus of Columbia University, and the main campus of [[City College of New York|CUNY–City College]] near 135th Street; the Gothic buildings of the original City College campus are out of sight, a block to the east. Also to the east are the [[brownstone]]s of Hamilton Heights. Hamilton Place is a surviving section of Bloomingdale Road, and originally the address of [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s house, [[Hamilton Grange National Memorial|The Grange]], which has been moved.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Eleanor Booth [http://myinwood.net/where-cobwebs-thrive-on-manhattan-isle/ Where Cobwebs Thrive on Manhattan Isle] ''New York Tribune;'' November 6, 1921&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadway achieves a verdant, park-like effect, particularly in the spring, when it runs between the uptown [[Trinity Church Cemetery]] and the former Trinity Chapel, now the [[Church of the Intercession (Manhattan)|Church of the Intercession]] near 155th Street.

[[NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital]] lies on Broadway near 166th, 167th, and 168th Streets in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]]. The intersection with [[St. Nicholas Avenue]] at 167th Street forms [[Mitchell Square Park]]. At 178th Street, [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|U.S. 9]] becomes concurrent with Broadway.

Broadway crosses the [[Harlem River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Manhattan)|Broadway Bridge]] to [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]]. Afterward, it then enters [[the Bronx]], where it is the eastern border of [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] and the western border of [[Van Cortlandt Park]]. At 253rd Street, [[New York State Route 9A|NY 9A]] joins with U.S. 9 and Broadway. (NY 9A splits off Broadway at Ashburton Avenue in Yonkers.)

====Westchester County====
[[File:US_Route_9_-_North_Broadway_-_Yonkers,_NY.jpg|thumb|right|287px|North Broadway ([[U.S. Route 9 in New York|U.S. 9]]) in [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]]]]
 
The northwestern corner of the park marks the city limit and Broadway enters [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]], where it is now known as South Broadway. It trends ever westward, closer to the [[Hudson River]], remaining a busy urban commercial street. In downtown Yonkers, it drops close to the river, becomes North Broadway and 9A leaves via Ashburton Avenue. Broadway climbs to the nearby ridgetop runs parallel to the river and the railroad, a few blocks east of both as it passes [[St. John's Riverside Hospital]]. The neighborhoods become more residential and the road gently undulates along the ridgetop.&lt;ref name=&quot;nymap07&quot;/&gt; In Yonkers, Broadway passes the historic [[Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site|Philipse Manor]] house, which dates back to colonial times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nysparks.com/historic-sites/37/details.aspx|title=Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It remains Broadway as it leaves Yonkers for [[Hastings-on-Hudson, New York|Hastings-on-Hudson]], where it splits into separate north and south routes for {{convert|0.6|mi|km|1}}. The trees become taller and the houses, many separated from the road by stone fences, become larger. Another National Historic Landmark, the [[John William Draper House]], was the site of the first [[astrophotograph]] of the [[Moon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nymap07&quot;&gt;{{cite map|title=1977–2007 I Love New York State Map|year=2007|publisher=[[I Love New York]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the next village, [[Dobbs Ferry, New York|Dobbs Ferry]], Broadway has various views of the Hudson River while passing through the residential section. Broadway passes by the [[Old Croton Aqueduct]] and nearby the shopping district of the village. After intersecting with Ashford Avenue, Broadway passes [[Mercy College (New York)|Mercy College]], then turns left again at the center of town just past [[South Presbyterian Church]], headed for equally comfortable [[Ardsley-on-Hudson, New York|Ardsley-on-Hudson]] and [[Irvington, New York|Irvington]].

Entering into the southern portion of Tarrytown, Broadway passes by historic [[Lyndhurst (mansion)|Lyndhurst mansion]], a massive mansion built along the Hudson River built in the early 1800s.

North of here, at the [[Kraft Foods]] technical center, the [[Tappan Zee Bridge (2017-present)|Tappan Zee Bridge]] becomes visible. After crossing under the [[New York State Thruway|Thruway]] and I-87 again, here concurrent with [[Interstate 287|I-287]], and then intersecting with the four-lane [[New York State Route 119|NY&amp;nbsp;119]], where 119 splits off to the east, Broadway becomes the busy main street of [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]].

Many high quality restaurants and shops are along this main road. This downtown ends at the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 448|NY&amp;nbsp;448]], where Broadway slopes off to the left, downhill, and four signs indicate that Broadway turns left, passing the [[Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow]], another NHL. The road then enters [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] (formerly North Tarrytown), passing the visitors' center for [[Kykuit]], the [[National Historic Landmark]] that was (and partially still is) the [[Rockefeller family]]'s [[Estate (house)|estate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nymap07&quot;/&gt; Broadway then passes the historic [[Sleepy Hollow Cemetery]], which includes the resting place of Washington Irving and the setting for [[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sleepyhollowcemetery.org/|title=The Original Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in New York|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadway expands to four lanes at the trumpet intersection with [[New York State Route 117|NY&amp;nbsp;117]], where it finally ends and U.S.&amp;nbsp;9 becomes [[Albany Post Road]] (and Highland Avenue) at the northern border of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]].

''Canyon of Heroes'' is occasionally used to refer to the section of lower Broadway in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] that is the location of the city's [[ticker-tape parade]]s. The traditional route of the parade is northward from [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]] to [[City Hall Park]]. Most of the route is lined with tall office buildings along both sides, affording a view of the parade for thousands of office workers who create the snowstorm-like jettison of shredded paper products that characterize the parade.

While typical sports championship parades have been showered with some 50 tons of confetti and shredded paper, the [[Victory over Japan Day|V-J Day]] parade on August 14–15, 1945 – marking the end of [[World War II]] – was covered with 5,438 tons of paper, based on estimates provided by the [[New York City Department of Sanitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Q &amp; A: Today's Giants Ticker-Tape Parade|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/q-a-todays-giants-ticker-tape-parade/ |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 5, 2008 |accessdate=August 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Great White Way====

&quot;The Great White Way&quot; is a nickname for a section of Broadway in [[Midtown Manhattan]], specifically the portion that encompasses the [[Theater District, Manhattan|Theater District]], between [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd]] and [[53rd Street (Manhattan)|53rd Streets]], and encompassing [[Times Square]].

In 1880, a stretch of Broadway between [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]] and [[Madison Square]] was illuminated by [[Charles F. Brush|Brush]] [[arc lamp]]s, making it among the first electrically lighted streets in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, p. 1063&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1890s, the portion from [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]] to [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]] was so brightly illuminated by electrical advertising signs, that people began calling it &quot;The Great White Way&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, p. 1066&lt;/ref&gt; When the theater district moved uptown, the name was transferred to the Times Square area.

The phrase &quot;Great White Way&quot; has been attributed to Shep Friedman, columnist for the ''[[New York Morning Telegraph]]'' in 1901, who lifted the term from the title of a book about the Arctic by [[Albert Paine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bloom&quot;&gt;Bloom, Ken. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GBiEO8q59f0C&amp;pg=PA499&amp;dq=%22great+white+way%22+Shep+Friedman&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TDzQTNneAsKclgf-mOi9Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22great%20white%20way%22%20Shep%20Friedman&amp;f=false Broadway: its history, people, and places : an encyclopedia], p.499 (2003) ({{ISBN|978-0415937047}})&lt;/ref&gt;  The headline &quot;Found on the Great White Way&quot; appeared in the February 3, 1902, edition of the ''[[New York World-Telegram|New York Evening Telegram]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;bloom&quot;/&gt;

A portrait of Broadway in the early part of the 20th century and &quot;The Great White Way&quot; late at night appeared in &quot;Artist In Manhattan&quot; (1940)&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Myers, Artist in Manhattan, New York: American Artists Group, Inc. 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; written by the artist-historian [[Jerome Myers]]:

{{quote|Early morn on Broadway, the same light that tips the mountain tops of the Colorado canyons gradually discloses the quiet anatomy, the bare skeletons of the huge iron signs that trellis the sky, now denuded of the attractions of the volcanic night. Almost lifeless, the tired entertainers of the night clubs and their friends straggle to their rooms, taximen compare notes and earnings, the vast street scene has had its curtain call, the play is over.

Dear old Broadway, for many years have I dwelt on your borders. I have known the quiet note of your dawn. Even earlier I would take my coffee at Martin's, at 54th Street–now, alas, vanished–where I would see creatures of the night life before they disappeared with the dawn.

One night a celebrated female impersonator came to the restaurant in all his regalia, directly from a club across the street. Several taximen began to poke fun at him. Unable any longer to bear their taunts, he got up and knocked all the taximen out cold. Then he went back to the club, only to lament under his bitter tears, &quot;See how they've ruined my dress!&quot;

Gone are the old-time Broadway oyster bars and chop houses that were the survivors of a tradition of their sporting patrons, the bon vivants of Manhattan. Gone are the days when the Hoffman House flourished on Madison Square, with its famous nudes by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau|Bouguereau]]; when barrooms were palaces, on nearly every corner throughout the city; when [[Steve Brodie (bridge jumper)|Steve Brodie]], jumping from Brooklyn Bridge, splashed the entire country with publicity; when [[Bowery]] concert halls dispensed schooners of beer for a nickel, with a stage show thrown in; when Theis's Music Hall still resounded on 14th Street with its great mechanical organ, the wonder of its day, a place of beauty, with fine paintings and free company and the frankest of female life. Across the street was [[Tammany Hall]], and next to it [[Tony Pastor]]'s, where stars of the stage were born. Tony himself, in dress clothes and top hat, sang his ballads, a gallant trouper introducing [[Lillian Russell]] and others to fame through his audience.}}

* The BMT Broadway Line runs under it from [[City Hall (BMT Broadway Line)|City Hall]] to [[Times Square–42nd Street (BMT Broadway Line)|Times Square–42nd Street]] ({{NYCS trains|Broadway}}).
* The IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line runs under and over Broadway from [[Times Square–42nd Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|Times Square]] to [[168th Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|168th Street]] ({{NYCS trains|Broadway-Seventh}}), and again from 218th Street to its terminal in [[the Bronx]] at [[Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street]] ({{NYCS trains|Broadway-Seventh north local}}).
* The northern portion of the IND Eighth Avenue Line runs under Broadway from [[Dyckman Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Dyckman Street]] to [[Inwood–207th Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Inwood–207th Street]] ({{NYCS trains|Eighth far north}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/nyct/maps/subwaymap.pdf|title=NYC Subway Map|publisher=MTA|accessdate=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early [[street railway]]s on Broadway included the Broadway and Seventh Avenue Railroad's Broadway and University Place Line (1864?) between [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]] ([[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]]) and [[Times Square]] ([[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]]), the Ninth Avenue Railroad's [[Ninth and Amsterdam Avenues Line]] (1884) between 65th Street and 71st Street, the Forty-second Street, Manhattanville and St. Nicholas Avenue Railway's [[Broadway Branch Line]] (1885?) between Times Square and [[125th Street (Manhattan)|125th Street]], and the Kingsbridge Railway's Kingsbridge Line&lt;!--when?--&gt; north of 169th Street. The Broadway Surface Railroad's [[Broadway Line (Lower Manhattan surface)|Broadway Line]], a [[cable car (railway)|cable car]] line, opened on lower Broadway (below Times Square) in 1893, and soon became the core of the [[Metropolitan Street Railway]], with two cable branches: the [[Broadway and Lexington Avenue Line]] and [[Broadway and Columbus Avenue Line]].

These streetcar lines were replaced with [[bus route]]s in the 1930s and 1940s. Before Broadway became one-way, the main bus routes along it were the [[New York City Omnibus Company]]'s (NYCO) [[6 (NYCO)|6]] (Broadway below Times Square), [[7 (NYCO)|7]] (Broadway and Columbus Avenue), and [[11 (NYCO)|11]] (Ninth and Amsterdam Avenues), and the [[Surface Transportation Corporation]]'s [[M100 (New York City bus)|M100]] (Kingsbridge) and [[M104 (New York City bus)|M104]] (Broadway Branch). Additionally, the [[Fifth Avenue Coach Company]]'s (FACCo) [[4 (FACCo)|4]] and 5 used Broadway from [[135th Street (Manhattan)|135th Street]] north to Washington Heights, and their 5 and 6 used Broadway between [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]] and [[72nd Street (Manhattan)|72nd Street]]. With the implementation of one-way traffic, the northbound 6 and 7 were moved to [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]].

{{As of|2017}}, Broadway is served by the [[M4 (New York City bus)|M4]] (ex-FACCo 4), [[M7 (New York City bus)|M7]] (ex-NYCO 7), [[M55 (New York City bus)|M55]], [[M100 (New York City bus)|M100]], and [[M104 (New York City bus)|M104]]. Other routes that use part of Broadway include the [[M5 (New York City bus)|M5]] (ex-FACCo 5), [[M10 (New York City bus)|M10]], [[M20 (New York City bus)|M20]], [[M60 (New York City bus)|M60]] [[Select Bus Service#M60 route|Select Bus Service]], [[Bx7 (New York City bus)|Bx7]], [[Bx9 (New York City bus)|Bx9]], and [[Bx20 (New York City bus)|Bx20]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite NYC bus map|M}}&lt;/ref&gt;
