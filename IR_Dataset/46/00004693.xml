They comprise a group of closely related languages spoken by the [[Berbers]], who are indigenous to [[North Africa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Hayward, Richard J., chapter ''Afroasiatic'' in Heine, Bernd &amp; Nurse, Derek, editors, ''African Languages: An Introduction'' Cambridge 2000. {{ISBN|0-521-66629-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The languages were traditionally written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script, which now exists in the form of [[Tifinagh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Briggs|first1=L. Cabot|title=A Review of the Physical Anthropology of the Sahara and Its Prehistoric Implications|journal=Man|volume=56|pages=20–23|date=February 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berber is spoken by large populations of [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]] and [[Libya]], by smaller populations of [[Tunisia]], northern [[Mali]], western and northern [[Niger]], northern [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Mauritania]] and in the [[Siwa Oasis]] of [[Egypt]]. Large Berber-speaking migrant communities, today numbering about 4 million, have been living in Western Europe, spanning over three generations, since the 1950s. The number of Berber people is much higher than the number of Berber speakers.

Around 90% of the Berber-speaking population speak one of seven major varieties of Berber, each with at least 2 million speakers. They are, in order of number of speakers: [[Shilha language|Shilha]] (''Tacelḥiyt''), [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]] (''Taqbaylit''), [[Central Atlas Tamazight]] (''Tamaziɣt''), [[Riffian language|Riffian]] (internal: ''Tmaziɣt'', external: ''Tarifiyt''), [[Shawiya language|Shawiya]] (''Tacawit'') and [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]] (''Tamaceq/Tamajeq/Tamaheq''). The now extinct [[Guanche language]] spoken on the [[Canary Islands]] by the [[Guanches]], as well as possibly the languages of the ancient [[C-Group culture]] in today's southern Egypt and northern [[Sudan]], are believed to have belonged to the Berber branch of the Afroasiatic family.

The Berber languages and dialects have had a written tradition, on and off, for about 2,500 years, although the tradition has been frequently disrupted by cultural shifts and invasions. They were first written in the Libyco-Berber [[abjad]], which is still used today by the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] in the form of Tifinagh. The oldest dated inscription is from 3rd century BCE. Later, between about 1000 CE and 1500 CE, they were written in the [[Arabic script]], and since the 20th century they have been written in the [[Berber Latin alphabet]], especially among the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] and [[Riffian people|Riffian]] communities of Morocco and Algeria. The Berber Latin alphabet was also used by most European and Berber linguists during the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrederechercheberbere.fr/la-langue-berbere.html|title=Centre de Recherche Berbère - La Langue Berbère|website=www.centrederechercheberbere.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modernised form of the Tifinagh alphabet, called [[Neo-Tifinagh]], was adopted in Morocco in 2003 for writing Berber, but many Moroccan Berber publications still use the Berber Latin alphabet. Algerians mostly use the Berber Latin alphabet in Berber-language education at public schools, while Tifinagh is mostly used for artistic symbolism. Mali and Niger recognise a Tuareg Berber Latin alphabet customised to the Tuareg phonological system. However, traditional Tifinagh is still used in those countries.

There is a cultural and political movement among speakers of the closely related varieties of Northern Berber to promote and unify them under a written [[standard language]] called ''Tamaziɣt'' (or ''Tamazight''). The name ''Tamaziɣt'' is the current native name of the Berber language in the Moroccan [[Middle Atlas]] and [[Rif]] regions and the Libyan [[Zuwarah]] region. In other Berber-speaking areas, this name was lost. There is historical evidence from medieval Berber manuscripts that all indigenous North Africans from Libya to Morocco have at some point called their language ''Tamaziɣt''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/1268712/Some_grammatical_features_of_Ancient_Eastern_Berber_the_language_of_the_Mudawwana_|title=Some grammatical features of Ancient Eastern Berber (the language of the Mudawwana)|first=Vermondo|last=Brugnatelli|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemorocco.com/tamkardit-library/Grammatical_features_of_Eastern_Berber.pdf |format=PDF|title=Some grammatical features of ancient Eastern Berber |first= Vermondo |last=Brugnatelli|year= 2011|website=www.freemorocco.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Muhammad_Awzal_and_the_Berber_Literary_T.html?id=tsn7jwEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Muhammad Awzal and the Berber Literary Tradition of the Sous|first=Nico Van den|last=Boogert|date=22 August 1995|publisher=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Tamaziɣt'' is currently being used increasingly by educated Berbers to refer to the written Berber language, and even to Berber as a whole, including Tuareg.

In 2001, Berber became a constitutional [[national language]] of Algeria, and in 2011 Berber became a constitutionally [[official language]] of Morocco. In 2016, Berber became a constitutionally official language of Algeria alongside [[Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-35515769|title=Algeria reinstates term limit and recognises Berber language|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The term ''Berber'' has been used in Europe since at least the 17th century and is still used today. It was borrowed from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:barbari#Noun 3|barbari]]''. The Latin word is also found in the Arabic designation for these populations, البربر (''al-Barbar''); see [[Names of the Berber people]].

Etymologically, the Berber root ''M-Z-Ɣ'' (''Mazigh'') (singular noun: ''Amazigh'', feminine: ''Tamazight'') means &quot;free man&quot;, &quot;noble man&quot;, or &quot;defender&quot;. The feminine ''Tamazight'' traditionally referred specifically to the [[Riffian language|Riffian]] and [[Central Atlas Tamazight]] languages. Many Berber linguists prefer to consider the term ''Tamazight'' as a pure Berber word to be used only in Berber text while using the European word &quot;Berber/''Berbero''/''Berbère''&quot; in European texts to follow the traditions of European writings about the Berbers. European languages distinguish between the words &quot;Berber&quot; and &quot;[[Barbarian#Berber and North African cultures|barbarian]]&quot;, while Arabic has the same word ''al-Barbari'' for both meanings.

Some other Berber writers, especially in Morocco, prefer to refer to Berber with ''Amazigh'' when writing about it in French or English.

Traditionally, the term ''Tamazight'' (in various forms: ''Thamazighth'', ''Tamasheq'', ''Tamajaq'', ''Tamahaq'') was used by many Berber groups to refer to the language they spoke, including the [[Central Atlas Tamazight|Middle Atlas]], the [[Riffian people|Riffians]], the [[Sened language|Sened]] in Tunisia and the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]]. However, other terms were used by other groups; for instance, some Berber populations of Algeria called their language ''Taznatit'' ([[Zenata|Zenati]]) or ''Shelha'', while the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]]s called theirs ''Taqbaylit'', and the inhabitants of the [[Siwa Oasis]] called their language ''Siwi''. In Tunisia, the local Amazigh language is usually referred to as ''Shelha'', a term which has been observed in Morocco as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosettaproject.org/live/search/showpages?ethnocode%3DZEN%26doctype%3Ddetail%26version%3D0%26scale%3Dsix |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 28, 2004 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927144458/http://www.rosettaproject.org/live/search/showpages?ethnocode=ZEN&amp;doctype=detail&amp;version=0&amp;scale=six |archivedate=September 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One group, the [[Linguasphere Observatory]], has attempted to introduce the [[neologism]] &quot;Tamazic languages&quot; to refer to the Berber languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linguasphere.info/lcontao/tl_files/pdf/master/OL-SITE%201999-2000%20MASTER%20ONE%20Sectors%201-Intro.pdf  ''Afro-Asian Phylosector''] linguasphere.info.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
{{main article|Proto-Berber language}}
Berber is a branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Christopher Ehret; Bernd Heine, Derek Nurse (ed.)|title=African Languages: An Introduction|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521666295|page=290|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=C7XhcYoFxaQC&amp;pg=PA290|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since modern Berber languages are relatively homogeneous, the date of the [[Proto-Berber language]] from which the modern group is derived was probably comparatively recent, comparable to the age of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] or [[Romance languages|Romance]] subfamilies. In contrast, the split of the group from the other Afroasiatic sub-phyla is much earlier, and is therefore sometimes associated with the local Mesolithic [[Capsian culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ddl.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/equipes/index.asp?Action=Edit&amp;Langue=EN&amp;Equipe=3%20%20&amp;Page=Action&amp;ActionNum=26 |title=DDL : Evolution - Themes and actions |publisher=Ddl.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr |date= |accessdate=2015-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of extinct populations are believed to have spoken Afroasiatic languages of the Berber branch. According to Peter Behrens and Marianne Bechaus-Gerst, linguistic evidence suggests that the peoples of the [[C-Group culture]] in present-day southern [[Egypt]] and northern [[Sudan]] spoke Berber languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bechaus-Gerst&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marianne Bechaus-Gerst|first1=Roger Blench, Kevin MacDonald (ed.)|title=The Origins and Development of African Livestock: Archaeology, Genetics, Linguistics and Ethnography – &quot;Linguistic evidence for the prehistory of livestock in Sudan&quot; (2000)|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1135434166|pages=453–457|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=-t5QAwAAQBAJ|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lbant&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Behrens|first1=Peter|title=Libya Antiqua: Report and Papers of the Symposium Organized by Unesco in Paris, 16 to 18 January 1984 – &quot;Language and migrations of the early Saharan cattle herders: the formation of the Berber branch&quot;|date=1986|publisher=Unesco|isbn=9231023764|page=30|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=p_hwAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] [[Nobiin language]] today contains a number of key pastoralism related [[loanword]]s that are of Berber origin, including the terms for sheep and water/[[Nile]]. This in turn suggests that the C-Group population — which, along with the [[Kerma Culture|Kerma culture]], inhabited the Nile valley immediately before the arrival of the first [[Nubian languages|Nubian]] speakers — spoke Afro-Asiatic languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bechaus-Gerst&quot;/&gt;

[[Roger Blench]] has suggested that Proto-Berber speakers had spread from the Nile River valley to North Africa 4,000-5,000 years ago due to the spread of pastoralism, and experienced intense language leveling about 2,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blench2018&quot;&gt;Blench, Roger. 2018. [https://www.academia.edu/36664366/Reconciling_archaeological_and_linguistic_evidence_for_Berber_prehistory Reconciling archaeological and linguistic evidence for Berber prehistory].&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, although Berber had split off from Afroasiatic several thousand years ago, Proto-Berber itself can only be reconstructed to a period as late as 200 A.D. Blench noted that Berber is considerably different from other Afroasiatic branches, but modern-day Berber languages display low internal diversity. The presence of [[Punic language|Punic]] borrowings in Proto-Berber points to the diversification of modern Berber language varieties subsequent to the fall of [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] in 146 B.C.; only [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]] lacks Punic loanwords.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blench2018&quot;/&gt; Additionally, [[Latin language|Latin]] loanwords in Proto-Berber point to the breakup of Proto-Berber between 0-200 A.D. During this time period, Roman innovations including the ox-plough, camel, and orchard management were adopted by Berber communities along the ''[[limes]]'', or borders of the Roman Empire, as evidenced by the frequency of Latin loanwords from this period in these semantic domains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blench2018&quot;/&gt; This resulted in a new trading culture involving the use of a [[lingua franca]] which became Proto-Berber.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blench2018&quot;/&gt;

==Orthography==
{{Main article|Berber orthography}}
[[File:Prehistory-draa16.jpg|thumb|Ancient [[Tifinagh|Libyco-Berber]] inscriptions in [[Zagora, Morocco|Zagora]], Morocco]]
Various orthographies have been used to transcribe the Berber languages. In antiquity, the Libyco-Berber script ([[Tifinagh]]) was utilised to write Berber. Early uses of the script have been found on [[rock art]] and in various [[sepulchre]]s. Among these are the 1,500 year old [[Tin Hinan Tomb|monumental tomb]] of the Tuareg matriarch [[Tin Hinan]], where vestiges of a Tifinagh inscription have been found on one of its walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Briggs|first1=L. Cabot|title=A Review of the Physical Anthropology of the Sahara and Its Prehistoric Implications|journal=Man|date=February 1957|volume=56|pages=20–23|jstor=2793877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the spread of [[Islam]], some Berber scholars also utilised the [[Arabic script]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sec14&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ben-Layashi|2007|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now three writing systems in use for Berber languages: Tifinagh, the Arabic script, and the [[Berber Latin alphabet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;choice&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| last = Larbi| first = Hsen| title = Which Script for Tamazight, Whose Choice is it ?| journal = Amazigh Voice (Taghect Tamazight)| volume = 12| issue = 2| year = 2003| publisher = Amazigh Cultural Association in America (ACAA)| location = New Jersey| url = http://www.tamazgha.fr/Which-Script-for-Tamazight-Whose-Choice-is-it,359.html| accessdate = December 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status==
After independence, all the [[Maghreb]] countries to varying degrees pursued a policy of [[Arabization|Arabisation]], aimed partly at displacing French from its colonial position as the dominant language of education and literacy. Under this policy the use of the Amazigh/Berber languages was suppressed or even banned. This state of affairs has been contested by Berbers in Morocco and Algeria—especially [[Kabylie]]—and was addressed in both countries by affording the language official status and introducing it in some schools.

The 2011 constitution of Morocco makes &quot;Amazigh&quot; an official language alongside Arabic. Morocco is a country with several competing linguistically different languages, including French, [[Modern Standard Arabic]], [[Moroccan Darija|Moroccan Arabic]] and Amazigh. As the higher status of Modern Standard Arabic grew, so did the relation between the male population and the language, as well as the female population and the lower status language Amazigh. Women became the main carriers of the Amazigh language as the lower-status language in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Sadiqi, F. (2007). The Role of Moroccan Women in Preserving Amazigh Language and Culture. Museum International,59(4), 26-33. {{doi|10.1111/j.1468-0033.2007.00620.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 June 2011 King [[Mohammed VI of Morocco|Mohammed VI]] announced in a speech of new constitutional reform that &quot;Tamazight&quot; became an official language of Morocco alongside Arabic and will be used in all the administrations in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110617/wl_africa_afp/moroccopoliticsunrest |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622061307/http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110617/wl_africa_afp/moroccopoliticsunrest |archivedate=June 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 April 2012 Fatima Chahou, alias ''Tabaamrant'', member of the [[House of Representatives (Morocco)|Moroccan House of Representatives]] and former singer became the first person to [[Question time|ask questions]] and discuss the minister's answer in Tamazight inside the [[Parliament of Morocco]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Although regional councils in Libya's [[Nafusa Mountains]] affiliated with the [[National Transitional Council]] reportedly use the Berber language of [[Nafusi language|Nafusi]] and have called for it to be granted co-official status with Arabic in a prospective new constitution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/05/26/libya-berber-idUKLDE74O19G20110526|agency=Reuters|date=26 May 2011|title=Libya's mountain Berber see opportunity in war|accessdate=5 July 2011|first=Matt|last=Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/09/world/africa/09berbers.html|date=8 August 2011|title=Amid a Berber Reawakening in Libya, Fears of Revenge|accessdate=10 August 2011|first=C.J.|last=Chivers|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; it does not have official status in Libya as in Morocco and Algeria. As areas of Libya south and west of [[Tripoli]] such as the Nafusa Mountains were taken from the control of [[Muammar Gaddafi|Gaddafi]] government forces in early summer 2011, Berber workshops and exhibitions sprang up to share and spread the Tamazight culture and language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14026216 Waiting game for rebels in western Libya], BBC News, John Simpson, 5 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mali and Niger, there are a few schools that teach partially in [[Tuareg languages]].

== Population ==
&lt;!-- NOTE: this section is intended only for estimates backed up by a referenced academic or academic organization. Many sites (eg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libyamazigh.org/|title=Libya Mazigh|website=Libya Mazigh}}&lt;/ref&gt; for Libya) make claims about population backed up neither by data nor by academic reputation. --&gt;

The exact population of Berber speakers is hard to ascertain, since most North African countries do not record language data in their censuses. [[Ethnologue]] provides a useful academic starting point; however, its bibliographic references are very inadequate, and it rates its own accuracy at only B-C for the area. Early colonial censuses may provide better documented figures for some countries; however, these are also very much out of date.

: ''Few census figures are available; all countries (Algeria and Morocco included) do not count Berber languages. The 1972 Niger census reported Tuareg, with other languages, at 127,000 speakers. Population shifts in location and number, effects of urbanization and education in other languages, etc., make estimates difficult. In 1952, André Basset (LLB.4) estimated the number of Berberophones at 5,500,000. Between 1968 and 1978 estimates ranged from eight to thirteen million (as reported by Galand, LELB 56, pp. 107, 123–25); Voegelin and Voegelin (1977, p. 297) call eight million a conservative estimate. In 2006, [[Salem Chaker]] estimated that the Berberophone populations of Kabylie and the three Moroccan groups numbered more than one million each; and that in Algeria, 9,650,000, or one out of five Algerians, speak a Berber language (Chaker 1984, pp. 8–9).''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isp.msu.edu/AfrLang/Berber-root.html |title=African Languages at Michigan State University (ASC) &amp;#124; Michigan State University |publisher=Isp.msu.edu |date=2010-10-08 |accessdate=2013-04-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420050102/http://www.isp.msu.edu/afrlang/Berber-root.html |archivedate=April 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Morocco''': In 1952, André Basset (&quot;La langue berbère&quot;, ''Handbook of African Languages'', Part I, Oxford) estimated that a &quot;small majority&quot; of Morocco's population spoke Berber. The 1960 census claimed that 34 percent of Moroccans spoke Berber, including bi-, tri- and quadrilingual people.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} In 2000, [[Karl Prasse]] cited &quot;more than a third&quot; in an interview conducted by Brahim Karada at Tawalt.com.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} A 2007 estimate put the number of Amazigh speakers in Morocco at 7.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language Diversity Endangered|last=Brenzinger|first=Matthias|publisher=Walter de Gruyter.|year=2007|isbn=978-3-11-017049-8|location=Berlin, Germany|pages=133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ethnologue]] (by deduction from its Moroccan Arabic figures), the Berber-speaking population should be estimated at 35 percent or around 10.5 million speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/14/show_country.asp?name%3DMorocco |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 20, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119004808/http://www.ethnologue.com/14/show_country.asp?name=Morocco |archivedate=November 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the figures it gives for individual languages only add up to 7.5 million, divided into three languages:
** [[Riffian language|Riffian]]: 3 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrederechercheberbere.fr/rifain.html |title=Inalco Crb |publisher=Centrederechercheberbere.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** [[Central Atlas Tamazight]]: 4–5 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrederechercheberbere.fr/tamazit.html |title=Inalco Crb |publisher=Centrederechercheberbere.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey included in the official [[2004 Moroccan census|Moroccan census of 2004]] and published by several Moroccan newspapers gave the following figures: 34 percent of people in rural regions spoke a Berber language and 21 percent in urban zones did; the national average would be 28.4 percent or 8.52 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bladi.net/marocain-berbere.html |title=Bladi.net |publisher=Bladi.net |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible, however, that the survey asked for the language &quot;used in daily life&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cfieljadida2009.blogvie.com/2008/12/11/les-derniers-chiffres-du-recensement-28-de-la-population-parlent-une-langue-amazighe/ |title=Al Bayane Newspaper, 10/07/2005 |publisher=Cfieljadida2009.blogvie.com |date=2005-10-07 |accessdate=2013-04-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708072943/http://cfieljadida2009.blogvie.com/2008/12/11/les-derniers-chiffres-du-recensement-28-de-la-population-parlent-une-langue-amazighe/ |archive-date=2011-07-08 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; which would result in figures lower than those of native speakers, as the language is not recognised for official purposes and many Berbers who live in an Darija-Arabic-speaking area cannot use Berber as a working language in some work environments like schools and administration; also, the use of Berber as a communication language in governement institutions was usually frowned upon or even rediculed as &quot;peasant speech&quot; until recent times which may have affected the results of the survey.

Adding up the population (according to the official census of 2004) of the Berber-speaking regions as shown on a 1973 map from the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] results in at least 10 million speakers, not counting the numerous Berber population which lives outside these regions in the bigger cities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Moroccan linguist [[Mohamed Chafik]] claims that 80 percent of [[Demographics of Morocco|Moroccans]] are Berbers. It is not clear, however, whether he means &quot;speakers of Berber languages&quot; or &quot;people of Berber descent&quot;.

The division of Moroccan Berber languages into three groups, as used by Ethnologue, is common in linguistic publications, but is significantly complicated by the presence of local differences: Shilha is subdivided into Shilha of the [[Draa River]] valley, Tasusit (the language of the [[Sous]]s) and several other mountain languages. Moreover, linguistic boundaries are blurred, such that certain languages cannot accurately be described as either Central Morocco Tamazight (spoken in the central and eastern [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas]] area) or Shilha.
* '''Algeria''': In 1906, the total population speaking Berber languages in Algeria (excluding the thinly populated Sahara region) was estimated at 1,305,730 out of 4,447,149, i.e. 29 percent. [[File:Aires linguistiques du nord-est algérien.svg|180px|thumb| [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]] and [[Shawiya language|Shawiya]] languages in the central-eastern part of Algeria]](Doutté &amp; Gautier, ''Enquête sur la dispersion de la langue berbère en Algérie, faite par l'ordre de M. le Gouverneur Général'', Alger 1913.) The 1911 census, however, found 1,084,702 speakers out of 4,740,526, i.e. 23 percent; Doutté &amp; Gautier suggest that this was the result of a serious undercounting of [[Shawiya language|Shawiya]] in areas of widespread [[bilingualism]]. A trend was noted for Berber groups surrounded by Arabic (as in the city of [[Blida]]) to adopt Arabic, while Arabic speakers surrounded by Berber (as in Sikh ou Meddour near the city of [[Tizi Ouzou]]) tended to adopt Berber. In 1952, André Basset estimated that about a third of Algeria's population spoke Berber. According to historian Charles-Robert Ageron in 1886, Algeria had around 1.2 million Berber speakers and 1.1 million Arab speakers. The Algerian census of 1966 found 2,297,997 out of 12,096,347 Algerians, or 19 percent, to speak &quot;Berber&quot;. In 1980, Salem Chaker estimated that &quot;in Algeria, 3,650,000, or one out of five Algerians, speak a Berber language&quot; (Chaker 1984, pp.&amp;nbsp;8–9). According to Ethnologue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ethnologue |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=DZ |title=Algeria |publisher=Ethnologue |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; more recent estimates include 14 percent (corresponding to the total figures it gives for each Berber language added together, 4 million) and (by deduction from its Algerian Arabic figures) 29 percent (Hunter 1996). Most of these are accounted for by three languages (percentages based on historical population data from appropriate dates):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.populstat.info/Africa/algeriac.htm |title=ALGERIA: population growth of the whole country |publisher=Populstat.info |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Berbères en Algérie occidentale.svg|180px|thumb| [[Shenwa language]] in the central-western part of Algeria]]
:* [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]]: 2,540,000 or 9 percent (Ethnologue, 1995); 6,000,000 or 20 percent (Ethnologue, 1998). Mainly in [[Algiers]], [[Béjaïa]], [[Tizi Ouzou]], [[Bouïra]], [[Sétif]] and [[Boumerdès]].
:* [[Shawiya language|Shawiya]]: ~2 million or 8.5 percent of the population as of 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrederechercheberbere.fr/chaouia.html |title=Centre de Recherche Berbère - Chaouia |publisher=Centrederechercheberbere.fr |date= |accessdate=2015-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mainly in [[Batna, Algeria|Batna]], [[Khenchela]], Sétif, [[Souk Ahras]], [[Oum El Bouaghi]] and [[Tébessa]].
:* [[Shenwa language|Shenwa]]: 56,300 speakers according to an estimate, in the [[Dahra Range]] region, more precisely [[Mount Chenoua]], just west of Algiers in the [[Provinces of Algeria|provinces]] of [[Tipaza Province|Tipaza]], [[Chlef Province|Chlef]] and [[Aïn Defla Province|Aïn Defla]]. Two main languages: Beni Menacer, west and south of the Mount Chenoua area and in the Mount Chenoua area, with 55,250 speakers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

: A fourth group, despite a very small population, accounts for most of the land area where Berber is spoken:
:* [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]]: 25,000 in Algeria (Ethnologue, 1987), mainly in the [[Hoggar Mountains]] of the Sahara. Most Tuareg live in Mali and Niger (see below). &lt;!-- It is however not clear if those numbers actually include the Berber speakers of [[Tlemcen]] and [[Blida]] provinces. --&gt;

Other Berber languages spoken in Algeria include: the Tamazight of [[Blida]], the languages of the [[Beni Snous]]s and [[Beni Boussaid]] villages in the province of [[Tlemcen Province|Tlemcen]], the [[Matmata Berber]] spoken in the [[Ouarsenis]] region, the [[Mozabite language]] spoken in the region of the province of Mzab and the language of the [[Ouargla]] oasis.
* '''Tunisia''': Basset (1952) estimated about 1 percent, as did Penchoen (1968). According to Ethnologue, there are only 26,000 speakers (1998) of a Berber language it calls &quot;[[Jerba Berber|Djerbi]]&quot;, but which Tunisians call &quot;Shelha&quot;, in Tunisia, all in the south around [[Djerba]] and [[Matmata, Tunisia|Matmata]]. The more northerly enclave of [[Sened (town)|Sened]] no longer speaks Berber. This would make 0.3 percent of the population.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Chenini is also one of the rare remaining berber-speaking villages in Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QDq4YV0VT00C&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=Berber-speaking+migrant+communities&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j8wdG-qGd8&amp;sig=v7AtlO7tCrPlVVHE8UDqmJT2seI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwioueuvlffUAhXGVj4KHe7VDi84ChDoAQgsMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Berber-speaking%20migrant%20communities&amp;f=false|title=Change in Tunisia: Studies in the Social Sciences|last=Stone|first=Russell A.|last2=Simmons|first2=John|date=1976|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780873953115|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Libya''': According to Ethnologue (by deduction from its combined Libyan Arabic and Egyptian Arabic figures) the non-Arabic-speaking population, most of which would be Berber, is estimated at 4 percent (1991, 1996). However, the individual language figures it gives add up to 162,000, i.e. about 3 percent. This is mostly accounted for by the languages:
** [[Nafusi language|Nafusi]] in the [[Nafusa Mountains]] and [[Zuwara Berber]] in the city of [[Zuwarah]] in the [[Tripolitania]] region: 184,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

** [[Tamahaq language|Tahaggart (Tamahaq) language]] of the [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg branch]] of the town of [[Ghat, Libya|Ghat]]: 17,000 (Johnstone 1993).
* '''Egypt''': The oasis of [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]] near the Libyan border speaks a Berber language; according to Ethnologue, there are 5,000 speakers there (1995). Its population in 1907 was 3,884 (according to the 1911 ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'').
* '''Mauritania''': According to Ethnologue, only 200 to 300 speakers of [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]] remain (1998). It also mentions [[Tamasheq]], but does not provide a population figure for it. Most non-Arabic speakers in Mauritania speak [[Niger–Congo languages]].
* '''Mali''': Ethnologue counts 440,000 [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] (1991) speaking:
:: [[Tamasheq]]: 250,000
:: [[Tawallammat Tamajaq language|Tamajaq]]: 190,000
* '''Niger''': Ethnologue counts 720,000 [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] (1998) speaking:
:: [[Tawallamat Tamajaq]]: 450,000
:: [[Tayart Tamajeq]]: 250,000
:: [[Tamahaq language|Tamahaq]]: 20,000
* '''Burkina Faso''': Ethnologue counts 20,000 to 30,000 [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] ([[SIL International]] 1991), speaking [[Kel Tamasheq]]. However Ethnologue is very inaccurate here, appearing to miss the largest group of Tamasheq in Burkina in the province of [[Oudalan Province|Oudalan]]. The Tamasheq-speaking population of Burkina is nearer to 100,000 (2005), with around 70,000 Tamasheq speakers in the province of Oudalan, the rest mainly in Seno, Soum, Yagha, Yatenga and Kadiogo provinces. About 10 percent of Burkina Tamasheq speak a version of the Tawallamat language.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}
* '''Nigeria''': Ethnologue notes the presence of a &quot;few&quot; [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], speaking [[Tawallamat Tamajaq]].
* '''France''': Ethnologue lists 860,000 speakers for Riffian and 537,000 speakers for Kabyle and 400,000 for [[Shilha language|Shilha]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrederechercheberbere.fr/chleuh.html|title=Centre de Recherche Berbère - Chleuh|website=www.centrederechercheberbere.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 150,000 for [[Central Morocco Tamazight]] . For the rest of Europe, it has no figures.
* '''Spain''': Tamazight is spoken amongst [[Melilla]]'s 80,000 inhabitants, but there has been no census as to the percentage of its speakers. A minority of [[Ceuta]]'s inhabitants speak Berber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uoc.edu/euromosaic/web/document/berber/an/i1/i1.html#1 |title=Euromosaic -Berber (Tamazight) in Spain |publisher=Uoc.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Israel''': Around two thousand mostly elderly Moroccan-born Israelis of [[Berber Jews|Berber Jewish]] descent use [[Judeo-Berber]] languages (as opposed to [[Moroccan Jews]] who trace descent from Spanish-speaking [[Sephardi Jews]] [[Alhambra decree|expelled from Spain]], or Arabic-speaking Moroccan Jews).

Thus, the total number of speakers of Berber languages in the [[Maghreb]] proper appears to lie anywhere between 16 and 25 million, depending on which estimate is accepted; if we take Basset's estimate, it could be as high as 30 million. The vast majority are concentrated in Morocco and Algeria. The Tuareg of the [[Sahel]] adds another million or so to the total.

==Grammar==
[[File:Qanun At Ali u Herzun.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Kabylian]] manuscript from the 18th century]]

===Nouns===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
[[Noun]]s in the Berber languages vary in [[Grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine versus feminine), [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular versus plural) and [[Grammatical state|state]] (free state versus [[construct state]]). In the case of the masculine, nouns generally begin with one of the three vowels of Berber, ''a'', ''u'' or ''i'' (in standardised orthography, ''e'' represents a [[schwa]] {{IPA|[ə]}} inserted for reasons of pronunciation):
::afus &quot;hand&quot;
::argaz &quot;man&quot;
::udem &quot;face&quot;
::ul &quot;heart&quot;
::ixef &quot;head&quot;
::iles &quot;tongue&quot;

While the masculine is unmarked, the feminine (also used to form [[diminutive]]s and [[singulative]]s, like an ear of wheat) is marked with the [[circumfix]] ''t...t''. Feminine plural takes a prefix ''t...'':
::afus → tafust
::udem → tudemt
::ixef → tixeft
::ifassen → tifassin

Berber languages have two types of [[Grammatical number|number]]: singular and [[plural]], of which only the latter is marked. Plural has three forms according to the type of nouns. The first, &quot;regular&quot; type is known as the &quot;external plural&quot;; it consists in changing the initial vowel of the noun, and adding a [[suffix]] ''-n'':
::afus → ifassen &quot;hands&quot;
::argaz → irgazen &quot;men&quot;
::ixef → ixfawen &quot;heads&quot;
::ul → ulawen &quot;hearts&quot;
The second form of the plural is known as the &quot;broken plural&quot;. It involves only a change in the vowels of the word:
::adrar → idurar &quot;mountain&quot;
::agadir → igudar &quot;wall / castle&quot;
::abaghus → ibughas &quot;monkey&quot;
The third type of plural is a mixed form: it combines a change of vowels with the suffix ''-n'':&lt;!--Sorry I can't see the difference with the first type! --&gt;
::izi → izan &quot;(the) fly&quot;
::azur → izuran &quot;roof&quot;
::iziker → izakaren &quot;rope&quot;

Berber languages also have two types of states or [[grammatical case|cases]] of the [[noun]], organized [[Ergative case|ergatively]]: one is unmarked, while the other serves for the subject of a transitive verb and the object of a preposition, among other contexts. The former is often called ''free state'', the latter ''construct state''. The construct state of the noun derives from the free state through one of the following rules:
The first involves a vowel alternation, whereby the vowel ''a'' becomes ''u'':
::argaz → urgaz
::amghar → umghar
::adrar → udrar
The second involves the loss of the initial vowel, in the case of some feminine nouns:
::tamghart → temghart &quot;woman / mature woman&quot;
::tamdint → temdint &quot;town&quot;
::tarbat → terbat &quot;girl&quot;
The third involves the addition of a semi-vowel (''w'' or ''y'') word-initially:
::asif → '''w'''asif &quot;river&quot;
::aḍu → '''w'''aḍu &quot;wind&quot;
::iles → '''y'''iles &quot;tongue&quot;
::uccen → '''w'''uccen &quot;wolf&quot;
Finally, some nouns do not change for free state:
::taddart → taddart &quot;house / village&quot;
::tuccent → tuccent &quot;female wolf&quot;

The following table gives the forms for the noun ''amghar'' &quot;old man / leader&quot;:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | masculine
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | feminine
|-
| || default || agent || default || agent
|-
| singular || ''amghar'' || ''umghar'' || ''tamghart'' || ''temghart''
|-
| plural || ''imgharen'' || ''yimgharen'' || ''timgharin'' || ''temgharin''
|}

===Pronouns===
Berber pronouns show gender distinction in the second- and third-persons, but in verbal agreement markers, the distinction is lost in the second-person.&lt;ref&gt;Bhat, D.N.S. 2004. ''Pronouns.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subclassification==
[[Image:Berber-map.png|450px|thumb|Modern Berber branches:{{col-begin|width=100%}}{{col-break|width=50%}}[[Western Berber languages|Western Berber]]:{{legend|#408E6E|[[Zenaga language]]}}[[Northern Berber languages|Northern Berber]]:{{legend|#35FE9C|[[Atlas languages]]}}

]]
A listing of the other Berber languages is complicated by their closeness; there is little distinction between language and dialect. The primary difficulty of subclassification, however, lies in the eastern Berber languages, where there is little agreement. Otherwise there is consensus on the outlines of the family:
* [[Eastern Berber languages|Eastern Berber]] (scope debated)
* [[Northern Berber languages|Northern Berber]]
** [[Zenati languages|Zenati]] (incl. Riffian and Shawiya)
** [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]]
** [[Atlas languages|Atlas]] (incl. Shilha and Central Atlas Tamazight)
* [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]]
* [[Western Berber languages|Western Berber]]

The various classifications differ primarily in what they consider to be Eastern Berber, and in how many varieties they recognise as distinct languages.

There is so little data available on [[Guanche language|Guanche]] that any classification is necessarily uncertain; however, it is almost universally acknowledged as Afro-Asiatic on the basis of the surviving glosses, and widely suspected to be Berber. Much the same can be said of the language, sometimes called &quot;[[Numidian language|Numidian]]&quot;, used in the Libyan or Libyco-Berber inscriptions around the turn of the Common Era, whose alphabet is the ancestor of [[Tifinagh]].

===Kossmann (1999)===
[[Maarten Kossmann]] (1999) describes Berber as two [[dialect continuum|dialect continua]],
* [[Northern Berber languages|Northern Berber]] and
* [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]]
plus a few peripheral languages, spoken in isolated pockets largely surrounded by Arabic, that fall outside these continua, namely
* [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]] and
* [[Eastern Berber languages|the Libyan and Egyptian varieties]].
Within Northern Berber, however, he recognises a break in the continuum between [[Zenati languages|Zenati]] and their non-Zenati neighbours; and in the east, he recognises a division between [[Ghadamès language|Ghadamès]] and [[Awjila language|Awjila]] on the one hand and [[Sokna language|Sokna]] ([[Fuqaha, Libya]]), [[Siwa language|Siwa]] and [[Nafusi language|Djebel Nefusa]] on the other. The implied tree is:
* [[Nafusi language|Nafusi]]–[[Siwa language|Siwi]] (including Sokna)
* [[Ghadamès language|Ghadamès]]–[[Awjila language|Awjila]]
* [[Northern Berber languages|Northern Berber]]
** [[Zenati languages|Zenati]]
** [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]] and [[Atlas languages|Atlas]]
* [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]]
* [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]]

===''Ethnologue''===
[[Ethnologue]], mostly following [[Alexandra Aikhenvald|Aikhenvald]] and [[Alexander Militarev|Militarev]] (1991), treats the eastern varieties differently:
* [[Guanche language|Guanche]]
* [[Eastern Berber languages|Eastern Berber]]
** [[Siwa language|Siwa]]
** [[Eastern Berber languages|Eastern Berber]] (&quot;Awjila–Sokna&quot;)
* [[Northern Berber languages|Northern Berber]] (including Nafusi and Ghadames within Zenati)
* [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]]
* [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]]

===Blench (2006)===
[[Roger Blench|Blench]] (ms, 2006) has the following classification:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerblench.info/Language/Afroasiatic/General/AALIST.pdf|format=PDF|title=AA list : Blench|date=2006|publisher=Rogerblench.info|accessdate=2015-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Guanche language|Guanche]]†
* [[East Numidian language|East Numidian]] (Old Libyan)† 
* '''Berber'''

and within Berber,
* [[Eastern Berber languages]]
** [[Siwa language|Siwa]]
** [[Awjila language|Awjila]]
** [[Sokna language|Sokna]]†
** [[Ghadamès language|Ghadames]]
* [[Northern Berber languages|Northern Berber]] (including Nafusi within Zenati)

==Influence on other languages==
The Berber languages have influenced [[Maghrebi Arabic]] languages, such as Moroccan, Algerian and Tunisian Arabic. Their influence is also seen in some languages in West Africa. F. W. H. Migeod pointed to strong resemblances between Berber and [[Hausa language|Hausa]] in such words and phrases as these: Berber: '''obanis'''; Hausa ''obansa'' (his father); Berber: '''a bat'''; Hausa ''ya bata'' (he was lost); Berber: '''eghare'''; Hausa ''ya kirra'' (he called). In addition he notes that the genitive in both languages is formed with '''n''' = &quot;of&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Migeod, F. W. H., ''The Languages of West Africa''. Kegan, Paul, Trench &amp; Trübner, London 1913. pages 232, 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extinct languages==
A number of extinct populations are believed to have spoken Afro-Asiatic languages of the Berber branch. According to Peter Behrens (1981) and Marianne Bechaus-Gerst (2000), linguistic evidence suggests that the peoples of the [[C-Group culture]] in present-day southern [[Egypt]] and northern [[Sudan]] spoke Berber languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bechaus-Gerst&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lbant&quot;/&gt; The [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] [[Nobiin language]] today contains a number of key pastoralism related [[loanword]]s that are of Berber origin, including the terms for sheep and water/[[Nile]]. This in turn suggests that the C-Group population — which, along with the [[Kerma Culture|Kerma culture]], inhabited the Nile valley immediately before the arrival of the first [[Nubian languages|Nubian]] speakers — spoke Afro-Asiatic languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bechaus-Gerst&quot;/&gt;

Additionally, historical linguistics indicate that the [[Guanche language]], which was spoken on the [[Canary Islands]] by the ancient [[Guanches]], likely belonged to the Berber branch of the Afro-Asiatic family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawyard&quot;&gt;Richard Hayward, 2000, &quot;Afroasiatic&quot;, in Heine &amp; Nurse eds, ''African Languages,'' Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
