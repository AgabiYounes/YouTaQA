'''Bees''' are flying [[insect]]s closely related to [[wasp]]s and [[ant]]s, known for their role in [[pollination]] and, in the case of the best-known bee species, the [[western honey bee]], for producing [[honey]] and [[beeswax]]. Bees are a [[monophyly|monophyletic]] lineage within the superfamily [[Apoidea]] and are presently considered a [[clade]], called '''Anthophila'''. There are over 16,000 known species of bees in seven recognized [[Family (biology)|biological families]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Danforthetal2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Danforth, B. N. |author2=Sipes, S. |author3=Fang, J. |author4=Brady, S. G. |title=The history of early bee diversification based on five genes plus morphology |journal=PNAS |volume=103 |issue=41 |pages=15118–15123 |date=October 2006 |pmid=17015826 |pmc=1586180 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0604033103|bibcode=2006PNAS..10315118D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Michener2000/&gt;  They are found on every continent except [[Antarctica]], in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated [[flowering plant]]s.

Some species — including [[honey bee]]s, [[bumblebee]]s, and [[stingless bee]]s — live [[eusociality|socially]] in colonies. Bees are adapted for feeding on [[nectar]] and [[pollen]], the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for [[protein]] and other nutrients. Most pollen is used as food for [[larva]]e. Bee pollination is important both ecologically and [[List of crop plants pollinated by bees|commercially]]. The decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees.

Bees range in size from tiny [[stingless bee]] species whose workers are less than {{convert|2|mm|inch|2}} long, to ''[[Megachile pluto]]'', the largest species of [[Megachilidae|leafcutter bee]], whose females can attain a length of {{convert|39|mm|inch|2}}. The most common bees in the Northern Hemisphere are the [[Halictidae]], or sweat bees, but they are small and often mistaken for wasps or flies. Vertebrate predators of bees include birds such as [[bee-eater]]s; insect predators include [[beewolf|beewolves]] and [[dragonfly|dragonflies]].

Human [[beekeeping]] or apiculture has been practised for millennia, since at least the times of [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Ancient Greece]]. Apart from honey and pollination, honey bees produce beeswax, [[royal jelly]] and [[propolis]]. Bees have appeared in mythology and folklore, through all phases of art and literature, from ancient times to the present day, though primarily focused in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], where beekeeping is far more common.

The analysis of 353 wild bee and hoverfly species across Britain from 1980 to 2013 found the insects have been lost from a quarter of the places they inhabited in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/26/widespread-losses-of-pollinating-insects-revealed-across-britain |title=Widespread losses of pollinating insects revealed across Britain |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=26 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancestors of bees were [[wasp]]s in the family [[Crabronidae]], which were [[Predation|predators]] of other insects. The switch from insect prey to pollen may have resulted from the consumption of prey insects which were flower visitors and were partially covered with pollen when they were fed to the wasp larvae. This same [[evolution]]ary scenario may have occurred within the [[vespoidea|vespoid]] wasps, where the [[pollen wasp]]s evolved from predatory ancestors. Until recently, the oldest non-compression bee fossil had been found in New Jersey [[amber]], ''Cretotrigona prisca'' of [[Cretaceous|Cretaceous age]], a [[Apinae|corbiculate bee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cardinal, Sophie |author2=Danforth, Bryan N. |year=2011 |title=The Antiquity and Evolutionary History of Social Behavior in Bees |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=e21086 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0021086 |pmid=21695157 |pmc=3113908|bibcode=2011PLoSO...621086C }}&lt;/ref&gt; A bee fossil from the [[early Cretaceous]] (~100 mya), ''[[Melittosphex burmensis]]'', is considered ''&quot;an extinct lineage of pollen-collecting Apoidea [[Cladistics|sister]] to the modern bees&quot;''.&lt;ref name=Poinar&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Poinar, G.

The earliest animal-pollinated flowers were shallow, cup-shaped blooms [[pollination|pollinated]] by insects such as [[beetle]]s, so the [[Pollination syndrome|syndrome of insect pollination]] was well established before the first appearance of bees. The novelty is that bees are [[specialization in bees|specialized]] as pollination agents, with behavioral and physical modifications that specifically enhance pollination, and are the most efficient pollinating insects. In a process of [[coevolution]], flowers developed floral rewards&lt;ref name=&quot;Armbruster ch. 3 Evol. Plant-pollinator relationships&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Armbruster, W.

The location and type differ among and between groups of bees. Most species have scopal hairs on their hind legs or on the underside of their abdomens. Some species in the family Apidae have [[pollen baskets]] on their hind legs, while very few lack these and instead collect pollen in their crops.&lt;ref name=Michener2000&gt;{{cite book |title=The Bees of the World |date=2000 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018--6133-0 |pages=19–25 |last1=Michener |first1=Charles D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of these structures drove the [[adaptive radiation]] of the [[Flowering plant|angiosperms]], and, in turn, bees themselves.&lt;ref name=Buchmann2012&gt;{{cite book |author1=Buchmann, Stephen L. |author2=Nabhan, Gary Paul |title=The Forgotten Pollinators |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YWTZs5fSqb8C&amp;pg=PA41 |year=2012 |publisher=Island Press |isbn=978-1-59726-908-7 |pages=41–42 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527145146/https://books.google.com/books?id=YWTZs5fSqb8C&amp;pg=PA41 |archivedate=27 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bees coevolved not only with flowers but it is believed that some species coevolved with mites.

Bees differ from closely related groups such as wasps by having branched or plume-like [[seta]]e (hairs), combs on the forelimbs for cleaning their antennae, small anatomical differences in limb structure, and the venation of the hind wings; and in females, by having the seventh dorsal abdominal plate divided into two half-plates.&lt;ref name=Grimaldi&gt;{{cite book |author1=Grimaldi, David |author2=Engel, Michael S. |title=Evolution of the Insects |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ql6Jl6wKb88C&amp;pg=PA454 |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-82149-0 |page=454 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328155201/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ql6Jl6wKb88C&amp;pg=PA454 |archivedate=28 March 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bees have the following characteristics:

* A pair of large [[compound eyes]] which cover much of the surface of the head. Between and above these are three small simple eyes ([[ocelli]]) which provide information on light intensity. 
* The [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] usually have 13segments in males and 12 in females, and are [[Insect morphology#Antennae|geniculate]], having an elbow joint part way along. They house large numbers of sense organs that can detect touch (mechanoreceptors), smell and taste; and small, hairlike mechanoreceptors that can detect air movement so as to &quot;hear&quot; sounds.
* The [[insect mouthparts|mouthparts]] are adapted for both chewing and sucking by having both a pair of [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandibles]] and a long [[proboscis]] for sucking up nectar.&lt;ref name=Extension&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.extension.org/pages/21754/anatomy-of-the-honey-bee |title=Anatomy of the Honey Bee |date=19 June 2014 |publisher=Extension |accessdate=30 June 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701141426/http://www.extension.org/pages/21754/anatomy-of-the-honey-bee |archivedate=1 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The thorax has three segments, each with a pair of robust legs, and a pair of membranous wings on the hind two segments. The front legs of corbiculate bees bear combs for cleaning the antennae, and in many species the hind legs bear pollen baskets, flattened sections with incurving hairs to secure the collected pollen. The wings are synchronised in flight, and the somewhat smaller hind wings connect to the forewings by a row of hooks along their margin which connect to a groove in the forewing. 
* The abdomen has nine segments, the hindermost three being modified into the sting.&lt;ref name=Extension/&gt;

==Sociality==
===Haplodiploid breeding system===
{{further|Haplodiploidy}}
[[File:Wasp attack.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3&lt;!--size for low image--&gt;|Willing to die for their sisters: worker honey bees killed defending their hive against [[wasp]]s, along with a dead wasp. Such [[altruism|altruistic]] behaviour may be favoured by the [[haplodiploid]] [[Sex-determination system|sex determination]] system of bees.]]

According to [[inclusive fitness]] theory, organisms can gain fitness not just through increasing their own reproductive output, but also that of close relatives. In evolutionary terms, individuals should help relatives when ''Cost &lt; Relatedness * Benefit''. The requirements for eusociality are more easily fulfilled by [[haplodiploid]] species such as bees because of their unusual relatedness structure.&lt;ref name=Hughes2008&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Hughes | first1=W. O. H. | last2=Oldroyd | first2=B. P. | last3=Beekman | first3=M. | last4=Ratnieks | first4=F. L.

In haplodiploid species, females develop from fertilized eggs and males from unfertilized eggs. Because a male is [[haploid]] (has only one copy of each gene), his daughters (which are [[diploid]], with two copies of each gene) share 100% of his genes and 50% of their mother's. Therefore, they share 75% of their genes with each other. This mechanism of sex determination gives rise to what [[W. D. Hamilton]] termed &quot;supersisters&quot;, more closely related to their sisters than they would be to their own offspring.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamilton1964II&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hamilton | first=W.

This unusual situation has been proposed as an explanation of the multiple (at least 9) evolutions of eusociality within [[Hymenoptera]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gullan |first1=P.

Haplodiploidy is neither necessary nor sufficient for eusociality. Some eusocial species such as [[termites]] are not haplodiploid. Conversely, all bees are haplodiploid but not all are eusocial, and among eusocial species many queens mate with multiple males, creating half-sisters that share only 25% of each-other's genes.&lt;ref name=&quot;NTW&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Nowak | first=Martin | author2=Tarnita, Corina | author3=Wilson, E.O. | title=The evolution of eusociality | journal=Nature | year=2010 | volume=466 | pmid=20740005 | issue=7310 | pages=1057–1062 | doi=10.1038/nature09205 | pmc=3279739| bibcode=2010Natur.466.1057N }}&lt;/ref&gt; But, monogamy (queens mating singly) is the ancestral state for all eusocial species so far investigated, so it is likely that haplodiploidy contributed to the evolution of eusociality in bees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Hughes, William O.

===Eusociality===
[[File:Bee swarm on fallen tree03.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[honey bee]] swarm]]
{{further|Eusociality}}

Bees may be solitary or may live in various types of communities. [[Eusociality]] appears to have originated from at least three independent origins in halictid bees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brady |first=Seán G. |last2=Sipes |first2=Sedonia |last3=Pearson |first3=Adam |last4=Danforth |first4=Bryan N. |date=2006 |title=Recent and simultaneous origins of eusociality in halictid bees |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences |volume=273 |issue=1594 |pages=1643–1649 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.3496 |issn=0962-8452 |pmc=1634925 |pmid=16769636 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most advanced of these are species with [[Eusociality|eusocial]] colonies; these are characterised by cooperative brood care and a [[division of labour]] into reproductive and non-reproductive adults, plus overlapping generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Insect Societies|last=Wilson|first=Edward O|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|year=1971|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Mass|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This division of labour creates specialized groups within eusocial societies which are called [[Eusociality#In insects|castes]]. In some species, groups of cohabiting females may be sisters, and if there is a division of labour within the group, they are considered [[semisocial]]. The group is called eusocial if, in addition, the group consists of a mother (the [[Queen bee|queen]]) and her daughters ([[Worker bee|workers]]). When the castes are purely behavioural alternatives, with no morphological differentiation other than size, the system is considered primitively eusocial, as in many [[paper wasp]]s; when the castes are morphologically discrete, the system is considered highly eusocial.&lt;ref name=Michener1974&gt;{{cite book|author=Michener, Charles Duncan |title=The Social Behavior of the Bees: A Comparative Study |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aordrL_D-30C&amp;pg=PA78 |year=1974 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-81175-1 |pages=22–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

True honey bees (genus ''[[Apis (genus)|Apis]]'', of which seven species are currently recognized) are highly eusocial, and are among the best known insects. Their colonies are established by [[Swarming (honey bee)|swarms]], consisting of a queen and several hundred workers. There are 29 subspecies of one of these species, ''[[Apis mellifera]]'', native to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. [[Africanized bee]]s are a hybrid strain of ''A. mellifera'' that escaped from experiments involving crossing European and African subspecies; they are extremely defensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Sanford | first1=Malcolm T. | title=The Africanized Honey Bee in the Americas: A Biological Revolution with Human Cultural Implications | url=http://apisenterprises.com/papers_htm/Misc/AHB%20in%20the%20Americas.htm | publisher=Apis Enterprises | accessdate=29 March 2015 | year=2006 | url-status=live | archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150329231615/http://apisenterprises.com/papers_htm/Misc/AHB%20in%20the%20Americas.htm | archivedate=29 March 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stingless bee]]s are also highly [[eusocial]]. They practise [[mass provisioning]], with complex nest architecture and perennial colonies also established via swarming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Roubik | first1=D.

[[File:Bumblebee 05.JPG|thumb|left|A [[bumblebee]] carrying pollen in its [[pollen basket]]s (corbiculae)]]

Many bumblebees are eusocial, similar to the eusocial [[Vespidae]] such as [[hornet]]s in that the queen initiates a nest on her own rather than by swarming. Bumblebee colonies typically have from 50 to 200 bees at peak population, which occurs in mid to late summer. Nest architecture is simple, limited by the size of the pre-existing nest cavity, and colonies rarely last more than a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCT-nest&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Bumblebee nests | url=http://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/habitats/bumblebee-nests/ | publisher=Bumblebee Conservation Trust | accessdate=26 June 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922230805/https://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/habitats/bumblebee-nests/ | archivedate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] set up the Bumblebee Specialist Group to review the threat status of all bumblebee species worldwide using the [[IUCN Red List]] criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/bumblebee_sg_proofed.pdf | title=Bumblebee Specialist Group: 2011 Update | publisher=[[IUCN]] | accessdate=7 October 2012 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203034020/http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/bumblebee_sg_proofed.pdf | archivedate=3 December 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many more species of primitively eusocial than highly eusocial bees, but they have been studied less often. Most are in the family [[Halictidae]], or &quot;sweat bees&quot;. Colonies are typically small, with a dozen or fewer workers, on average. Queens and workers differ only in size, if at all. Most species have a single season colony cycle, even in the tropics, and only mated females hibernate. A few species have long active seasons and attain colony sizes in the hundreds, such as ''[[Halictus hesperus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Brooks | first1=R. W. | last2=Roubik | first2=D.

===Solitary and communal bees===
[[File:Megachile rotundata.JPG|thumb|A leafcutting bee, ''[[Megachile rotundata]]'', cutting circles from acacia leaves]]

Most other bees, including familiar insects such as [[carpenter bee]]s, [[leafcutter bees]] and [[mason bees]] are solitary in the sense that every female is fertile, and typically inhabits a nest she constructs herself. There is no division of labor so these nests lack queens and ''worker'' bees for these species. Solitary bees typically produce neither honey nor [[beeswax]]. 
Bees collect pollen to feed their young, and have the necessary adaptations to do this. However, certain wasp species such as [[pollen wasp]]s have similar behaviours, and a few species of bee [[Scavenger|scavenge]] from carcases to feed their offspring.&lt;ref name=Grimaldi/&gt; Solitary bees are important pollinators; they gather pollen to provision their nests with food for their brood. Often it is mixed with nectar to form a paste-like consistency. Some solitary bees have advanced types of pollen-carrying structures on their bodies. Very few species of solitary bee are being cultured for commercial pollination. Most of these species belong to a distinct set of [[genus|genera]] which are commonly known by their nesting behavior or preferences, namely: carpenter bees, [[Halictidae|sweat bees]], mason bees, [[Colletes inaequalis|plasterer bees]], [[squash bee]]s, [[Ceratina|dwarf carpenter bees]], leafcutter bees, [[alkali bee]]s and [[Anthophorini|digger bees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beesource.com/resources/usda/management-of-wild-bees/ |author1=Parker, Frank D. |author2=Torchio, Philip F. |title=Management of Wild Bees |publisher=Beesource Beekeeping Community |date=1 October 1980 |accessdate=26 June 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626235657/http://www.beesource.com/resources/usda/management-of-wild-bees/ |archivedate=26 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anthidium February 2008-1.jpg|left|thumb|A solitary bee, ''[[Anthidium florentinum]]'' (family [[Megachilidae]]), visiting ''[[Lantana]]'']]

Most solitary bees nest in the ground in a variety of soil textures and conditions while others create nests in hollow [[Phragmites|reeds]] or twigs, holes in [[wood]]. The female typically creates a compartment (a &quot;cell&quot;) with an egg and some provisions for the resulting larva, then seals it off. A nest may consist of numerous cells. When the nest is in wood, usually the last (those closer to the entrance) contain eggs that will become males. The adult does not provide care for the brood once the egg is laid, and usually dies after making one or more nests. The males typically emerge first and are ready for mating when the females emerge. Solitary bees are either stingless or very unlikely to sting (only in self-defense, if ever).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Solitary Bees (Hymenoptera) |url=http://www.royensoc.co.uk/insect_info/what/solitary_bees.htm |publisher=Royal Entomological Society |accessdate=12 October 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702005458/http://www.royensoc.co.uk/insect_info/what/solitary_bees.htm |archivedate=2 July 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Other bees |url=http://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/identification/other-bees/ |publisher=Bumblebee Conservation Trust |accessdate=12 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905113303/http://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/identification/other-bees/ |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large groups of solitary bee nests are called ''aggregations'', to distinguish them from [[colony (biology)|colonies]]. In some species, multiple females share a common nest, but each makes and provisions her own cells independently. This type of group is called &quot;communal&quot; and is not uncommon. The primary advantage appears to be that a nest entrance is easier to defend from predators and parasites when there are multiple females using that same entrance on a regular basis.&lt;ref name=Eickwort/&gt;

==Biology==

===Life cycle===
{{further|Honey bee life cycle}}

The life cycle of a bee, be it a solitary or social species, involves the laying of an egg, the development through several moults of a legless [[larva]], a [[pupa]]tion stage during which the insect undergoes [[Holometabolism|complete metamorphosis]], followed by the emergence of a winged adult. Most solitary bees and bumble bees in temperate climates overwinter as adults or pupae and emerge in spring when increasing numbers of flowering plants come into bloom. The males usually emerge first and search for females with which to mate. The sex of a bee is determined by whether or not the egg is fertilised; after mating, a female stores the sperm, and determines which sex is required at the time each individual egg is laid, fertilised eggs producing female offspring and unfertilised eggs, males. Tropical bees may have several generations in a year and no [[diapause]] stage.&lt;ref name=Roubik1992&gt;{{cite book |author=Roubik, David W. |title=Ecology and Natural History of Tropical Bees |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ljlaYMeI6noC |year=1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42909-2 |page=15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617144437/https://books.google.com/books?id=ljlaYMeI6noC |archivedate=17 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The bumblebee lifecycle|url=http://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/lifecycle/|publisher=Bumblebee Conservation Trust|accessdate=1 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629043439/http://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/lifecycle/|archivedate=29 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Learning About Honey Bees |url=http://www.scmidstatebeekeepers.org/honeybeelifecycle.htm |publisher=The South Carolina Mid-State Beekeepers Association |accessdate=1 July 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701180422/http://www.scmidstatebeekeepers.org/honeybeelifecycle.htm |archivedate=1 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Solitary Bees |url=http://www.nationalbeeunit.com/downloadDocument.cfm?id=901 |publisher=National Bee Unit |accessdate=1 July 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701202809/http://www.nationalbeeunit.com/downloadDocument.cfm?id=901 |archivedate=1 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The egg is generally oblong, slightly curved and tapering at one end. Solitary bees, lay each egg in a separate cell with a supply of mixed pollen and nectar next to it. This may be rolled into a pellet or placed in a pile and is known as mass provisioning. Social bee species provision progressively, that is, they feed the larva regularly while it grows. The nest varies from a hole in the ground or in wood, in solitary bees, to a substantial structure with wax combs in bumblebees and honey bees.&lt;ref name=Shuckard&gt;{{cite book |author=Shuckard, William Edward |title=British bees: an introduction to the study of the natural history and economy of the bees indigenous to the British Isles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sReIAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA18 |year=1866 |publisher=L.

In most species, larvae are whitish grubs, roughly oval and bluntly-pointed at both ends. They have 15 segments and [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]]s in each segment for breathing. They have no legs but move within the cell, helped by tubercles on their sides. They have short horns on the head, jaws for chewing food and an appendage on either side of the mouth tipped with a bristle. There is a gland under the mouth that secretes a viscous liquid which solidifies into the silk they use to produce a cocoon. The cocoon is semi-transparent and the pupa can be seen through it. Over the course of a few days, the larva undergoes metamorphosis into an winged adult. When ready to emerge, the adult splits its skin dorsally and climbs out of the [[exuvia]]e and breaks out of the cell.&lt;ref name=Shuckard/&gt;

[[Antoine Magnan]]'s 1934 book ''Le vol des insectes'', says that he and [[André Sainte-Laguë]] had applied the equations of [[air resistance]] to [[insect]]s and found that their flight could not be explained by fixed-wing calculations, but that &quot;One shouldn't be surprised that the results of the calculations don't square with reality&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ingram, Jay (2001) ''The Barmaid's Brain'', Aurum Press, pp. 91–92, {{ISBN|0716741202}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to a common misconception that bees &quot;violate aerodynamic theory&quot;.

The ethologist [[Karl von Frisch]] studied [[animal navigation|navigation]] in the honey bee. He showed that honey bees communicate by the [[waggle dance]], in which a worker indicates the location of a food source to other workers in the hive. He demonstrated that bees can recognize a desired compass direction in three different ways: by the sun, by the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth's magnetic field. He showed that the sun is the preferred or main compass; the other mechanisms are used under cloudy skies or inside a dark [[beehive]].&lt;ref name=vonFrisch93&gt;{{cite book |last=von Frisch |first=Karl |title=The Dancing Bees |year=1953 |publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; World | pages=93–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bees navigate using spatial memory with a &quot;rich, map-like organization&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Menzel, Randolf |author2=Greggers, Uwe |author3=Smith, Alan |author4=Berger, Sandra |author5=Brandt, Robert |author6=Brunke, Sascha |author7=Bundrock, Gesine |author8=Hülse, Sandra |author9=Plümpe, Tobias |author10=Schaupp, Schaupp |author11=Schüttler, Elke |author12=Stach, Silke |author13=Stindt, Jan |author14=Stollhoff, Nicola |author15=Watzl, Sebastian |title=Honey bees Navigate According to a Map-Like Spatial Memory |journal=PNAS |year=2005 |volume=102 |issue=8 |pages=3040–3045 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0408550102 |pmid=15710880 |pmc=549458|bibcode=2005PNAS..102.3040M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digestion ===
The gut of bees is relatively simple, but multiple metabolic strategies exist in the gut [[microbiota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/12/171212141506.htm  |title=How honey bee gut bacteria help to digest their pollen-rich diet |website=ScienceDaily |accessdate=2 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollinating bees consume nectar and pollen, which require different digestion strategies by somewhat specialized bacteria. While nectar is a liquid of mostly [[monosaccharide]] sugars and so easily absorbed, pollen contains complex [[Polysaccharide |polysaccharides]]: branching [[pectin]] and [[hemicellulose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://phys.org/news/2019-12-bee-gut-microbes-division-labor.html |title=Bee gut microbes have a division of labor when it comes to metabolizing complex polysaccharides |website=phys.org |accessdate=2 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately five groups of bacteria are involved in digestion. Three groups specialize in simple sugars (''[[Snodgrassella]]'' and two groups of ''[[Lactobacillus]]''), and two other groups in complex sugars (''[[Gilliamella]]'' and ''[[Bifidobacterium]]''). Digestion of pectin and hemicellulose is dominated by bacterial [[clade]]s ''Gilliamella'' and ''[[Bifidobacterium]]'' respectively. Bacteria that cannot digest polysaccharides obtain enzymes from their neighbors, and bacteria that lack certain amino acids do the same, creating multiple [[ecological niche]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zheng |first=Hao |last2=Perreau |first2=Julie |last3=Powell |first3=J.

Although most bee species are [[Nectarivore |nectarivorous]] and [[Palynivore |palynivorous]], some are not. Particularly unusual are [[Vulture bee |vulture bees]] in the genus ''[[Trigona]],'' which consume carrion and wasp brood, turning meat into a honey-like substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mateus |first=Sidnei |last2=Noll |first2=Fernando B. |date=February 2004 |title=Predatory behavior in a necrophagous bee Trigona hypogea (Hymenoptera; Apidae, Meliponini) |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=91 |issue=2 |pages=94–96 |doi=10.1007/s00114-003-0497-1 |pmid=14991148 |issn=1432-1904|bibcode=2004NW.....91...94M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
=== Floral relationships ===

Most bees are polylectic (generalist) meaning they collect pollen from a range of flowering plants, but some are [[oligolege]]s (specialists), in that they only gather pollen from one or a few species or genera of closely related plants.&lt;ref name=Waser2006&gt;{{cite book |author=Waser, Nickolas M. |title=Plant-Pollinator Interactions: From Specialization to Generalization |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fbl5c9fUxTIC&amp;pg=PA110 |year=2006 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-87400-5 |pages=110– |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328155201/https://books.google.com/books?id=Fbl5c9fUxTIC&amp;pg=PA110 |archivedate=28 March 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialist pollinators also include bee species which gather floral oils instead of pollen, and male orchid bees, which gather aromatic compounds from [[orchid]]s (one of the few cases where male bees are effective pollinators). Bees are able to sense the presence of desirable flowers through ultraviolet patterning on flowers, floral odors,&lt;ref name=Dafni&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dafni, Amots |author2=Hesse, Michael |author3=Pacini, Ettore |title=Pollen and Pollination |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-M7yCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA80 |year=2012 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-3-7091-6306-1 |page=80 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328155201/https://books.google.com/books?id=-M7yCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA80 |archivedate=28 March 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and even electromagnetic fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suttona|first1=Gregory P.|last2=Clarkea|first2=Dominic|last3=Morleya|first3=Erica L.|last4=Robert|first4=Daniel|title=Mechanosensory hairs in bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) detect weak electric fields|journal=PNAS|date=2016|volume=113|issue=26|pages=7261–7265|doi=10.1073/pnas.1601624113|pmid=27247399|pmc=4932954}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once landed, a bee then uses nectar quality&lt;ref name=Dafni /&gt; and pollen taste&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muth|first1=Felicity|last2=Francis|first2=Jacob S.|last3=Leonard|first3=Anne S.|title=Bees use the taste of pollen to determine which flowers to visit|journal=Biology Letters|date=2016|volume=12|issue=7|page=20160356|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2016.0356|pmid=27405383|pmc=4971173|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to determine whether to continue visiting similar flowers.

In rare cases, a [[plant]] species may only be effectively pollinated by a single bee species, and some plants are [[endangered species|endangered]] at least in part because their pollinator is also threatened. But, there is a pronounced tendency for oligolectic bees to be associated with common, widespread plants visited by multiple pollinator species. For example, the [[Larrea tridentata|creosote bush]] in the arid parts of the United States southwest is associated with some 40 oligoleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hurd, P.D. Jr. |author2=Linsley, E.G. |year=1975 |title=The principal ''Larrea'' bees of the southwestern United States |journal=Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology |volume=193 |pages=1–74 |doi=10.5479/si.00810282.193 |issue=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many bees are [[aposematic]]ally coloured, typically orange and black, warning of their ability to defend themselves with a powerful sting. As such they are models for [[Batesian mimicry]] by non-stinging insects such as [[bee-flies]], [[Asilidae|robber flies]] and [[hoverflies]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ThorpHorning1983&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thorp |first1=Robbin W. |last2=Horning |first2=Donald S. |last3=Dunning |first3=Lorry L. |title=Bumble Bees and Cuckoo Bumble Bees of California (Hymenoptera, Apidae) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1eJ3fWwshIC&amp;pg=PA9 |year=1983 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-09645-5 |page=9 |quote=Of the forms of mimicry, two relate to [[Bombini]].

Bees are themselves [[Müllerian mimicry|Müllerian mimics]] of other aposematic insects with the same colour scheme, including [[wasp]]s, [[Lycidae|lycid]] and other beetles, and many butterflies and moths ([[Lepidoptera]]) which are themselves distasteful, often through acquiring bitter and poisonous chemicals from their plant food.

Bees are also mimicked by plants such as the [[Ophrys apifera|bee orchid]] which imitates both the appearance and the scent of a female bee; male bees attempt to mate ([[pseudocopulation]]) with the furry lip of the flower, thus pollinating it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bee Orchids and Insect Mimicry |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/life/plants-fungi/bee-orchids/ |publisher=Natural History Museum |accessdate=1 July 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708203045/http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/life/plants-fungi/bee-orchids/ |archivedate=8 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nocturnal bees ===
Four bee families ([[Andrenidae]], [[Colletidae]], [[Halictidae]], and [[Apidae]]) contain some species that are [[crepuscular]]. Most are tropical or subtropical, but some live in arid regions at higher latitudes. These bees have greatly enlarged [[ocellus|ocelli]], which are extremely sensitive to light and dark, though incapable of forming images. Some have refracting superposition compound eyes: these combine the output of many elements of their compound eyes to provide enough light for each retinal photoreceptor. Their ability to fly by night enables them to avoid many predators, and to exploit flowers that produce nectar only or also at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Warrant |first1=Eric J. |title=Seeing in the dark: vision and visual behaviour in nocturnal bees and wasps |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |date=June 2008 |volume=211 |issue=11 |pages=1737–1746 |doi=10.1242/jeb.015396 |pmid=18490389 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans have kept honey bee colonies, commonly in [[beehive|hives]], for millennia. [[Beekeeper]]s collect [[honey]], [[beeswax]], [[propolis]], [[pollen]], and [[royal jelly]] from hives; bees are also kept to [[pollination|pollinate]] crops and to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers.

Depictions of humans collecting honey from wild bees date to 15,000 years ago; efforts to domesticate them are shown in Egyptian art around 4,500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/timelines/topics/beekeeping.htm |title=Ancient Egypt: Bee-keeping |website=Reshafim.org.il |date=2003-04-06 |accessdate=2016-03-16 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309203227/http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/timelines/topics/beekeeping.htm |archivedate=9 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple hives and smoke were used;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://beelore.com/2008/02/23/beekeeping-in-ancient-egypt/ |title=Beekeeping in Ancient Egypt |publisher=Bee Lore |accessdate=16 March 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322224443/http://beelore.com/2008/02/23/beekeeping-in-ancient-egypt/ |archivedate=22 March 2016 |df=dmy-all |date=23 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bodenheimer1960&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | title=Animal and Man in Bible Lands | first=F.

===As food producers===
Honey is a natural product produced by bees and stored for their own use, but its sweetness has always appealed to humans. Before domestication of bees was even attempted, humans were raiding their nests for their honey. Smoke was often used to subdue the bees and such activities are depicted in [[Cave painting|rock paintings]] in Spain dated to 15,000 BC.&lt;ref name=EHSTMNWC/&gt;

Honey bees are used commercially to produce [[honey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89094204153;view=1up;seq=3 |publisher=US Department of Agriculture, Farmers' Bulletin, No. 653 |authors=Hunt, C.L.; Atwater, H.W. |date=7 April 1915 |title=Honey and Its Uses in the Home |accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also produce some substances used as dietary supplements with possible health benefits, pollen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/AA158| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113100544/http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/AA158| archivedate=13 January 2007| title=Producing Pollen | author=Sanford, Malcolm T. | publisher=University of Florida, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences | accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[propolis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/390.html |title=Propolis:MedlinePlus Supplements |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |date=19 January 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630040550/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/390.html |archivedate=30 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[royal jelly]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies | journal=EFSA Journal | year=2011 | volume=9 | issue=4 | page=2083 | title=Scientific Opinion | doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2083 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though all of these can also cause [[allergy|allergic reactions]].

===As food (bee brood)===
[[File:Botoktawon.jpg|thumb|Bee larvae as food in the [[Java]]nese dish ''[[botok|botok tawon]]'']]
Bees are partly considered [[edible insects]]. Indigenous people in many countries [[entomophagy|eat insects]], including the larvae and pupae of bees, mostly stingless species. They also gather larvae, pupae and surrounding cells, known as [[bee brood]], for consumption.&lt;ref name=Holland2013&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130514-edible-insects-entomophagy-science-food-bugs-beetles/ |title=U.N.

Bee brood (pupae and larvae) although low in [[calcium]], has been found to be high in [[protein]]  and [[carbohydrate]], and a useful source of [[phosphorus]], [[magnesium]], [[potassium]], and trace minerals [[iron]], [[zinc]], [[copper]], and [[selenium]]. In addition, while bee brood was high in fat, it contained no fat soluble vitamins (such as A, D, and E) but it was a good source of most of the water-soluble [[B-vitamins]] including [[choline]] as well as vitamin C. The fat was composed mostly of [[Saturated fat|saturated]] and [[monounsaturated fatty acids]] with 2.0% being [[polyunsaturated fatty acids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nutrient Composition of Bee Brood and its Potential as Human Food |author=Fink, Mark D. |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, Ecology Food and Nutrition|date=2007| doi=10.1080/03670240500187278 |volume=44 |issue = 4|journal=Ecology of Food and Nutrition|pages=257–270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Standard methods for Apis mellifera brood as human food |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, Journal of Apicultural Research |author=Annette Bruun Jensen |date=2016 |doi=10.1080/00218839.2016.1226606 |journal=Journal of Apicultural Research |volume = 58|issue = 2|pages=1–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As alternative medicine ===
[[Apitherapy]] is a branch of [[alternative medicine]] that uses honey bee products, including [[raw honey]], [[royal jelly]], pollen, [[propolis]], [[beeswax]] and [[apitoxin]] (Bee [[venom]]).&lt;ref name=MedicineWorld&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medicineworld.org/alternative/apitherapy/what-is-apitherapy.html |title=What is apitherapy? |publisher=MedicineWorld.Org |accessdate=20 January 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618182834/http://medicineworld.org/alternative/apitherapy/what-is-apitherapy.html |archivedate=18 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim that apitherapy treats cancer, which some proponents of apitherapy make, remains unsupported by [[evidence-based medicine]].&lt;ref name=Cass&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barry R. |first1=Cassileth |authorlink=Barrie R.

=== Stings ===
The painful [[Bee sting|stings of bees]] are mostly associated with the poison gland and the [[Dufour's gland]] which are abdominal exocrine glands containing various chemicals. In ''[[Lasioglossum leucozonium]]'', the Dufour's Gland mostly contains octadecanolide as well as some eicosanolide. There is also evidence of n-triscosane, n-[[heptacosane]],&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; and 22-docosanolide.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Systematic relationship of halictinae bees based on the pattern of macrocyclic lactones in the Dufour gland secretion|doi=10.1016/0020-1790(82)90004-X|volume=12|issue=2|pages=161–170|journal=Insect Biochemistry|year=1982 | last1=Johansson | first1=Ingela}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the secretions of these glands could also be used for nest construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|url=|title=Chemistry of the dufour's gland secretion of halictine bees|last=Hefetz|first=Abraham|date=1978|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology B|doi=10.1016/0305-0491(78)90229-8|pmid=|access-date=|last2=Blum|first2=Murray|last3=Eickwort|first3=George|last4=Wheeler|first4=James|issue=1|volume=61|pages=129–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;
