      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bill Holbrook''' (born 1958) is an American cartoonist and [[webcomic]] writer and artist, best known for his syndicated [[comic strip]] ''[[On the Fastrack]]''.

Born in [[Los Angeles]], Holbrook grew up in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], and began drawing at an early age. While majoring in illustration and visual design at [[Auburn University]], Holbrook served as art director of the student newspaper, doing editorial cartoons and a weekly comic strip. At the same time, his work was being published in the ''[[Huntsville Times]]'' and the ''[[Amasa Coleman Lee|Monroe Journal]]''. After graduation in 1980, he joined the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]'' as an editorial staff artist.

During a 1982 visit to relatives on the West Coast, Holbrook met ''[[Peanuts]]'' creator, [[Charles Schulz]]. Following his advice and encouragement, Holbrook created a strip in the fall of that year about a college graduate working in a rundown diner. It did not stir syndicate interest, but what he learned on the strip helped him when he created ''On the Fastrack''.

Eleven days before ''On the Fastrack'' made its syndicated debut (March 19, 1984), Holbrook met Teri Peitso on a blind date. They were married on [[Pearl Harbor Day]], 1985. They have two daughters, Chandler and Haviland. Peitso-Holbrook's novels have been nominated for both [[Edgar Award]]s and [[Agatha Award]]s. She is currently an assistant professor in literacy education at [[Georgia State University]]. The family lives in the [[Atlanta]] area.

In October 1989, Holbrook began his second strip, ''[[Safe Havens]]'', and his third strip, ''[[Kevin and Kell]]'' was launched in September 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onthefastrack.com/?page_id=198|title=On the Fastrack by Bill Holbrook - About|accessdate=2014-04-20|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228080119/http://www.onthefastrack.com/?page_id=198|archivedate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every week Holbrook writes the story line for the next three weeks for one of his strips and draws the next three weeks' worth of strips for another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comixtalk.com/ten_questions_with_bill_holbrook_of_kevin_and_kell|title=Ten Questions with Bill Holbrook of Kevin and Kell|publisher=Comixtalk|date=October 2004|accessdate=2007-12-22|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012100238/http://comixtalk.com/ten_questions_with_bill_holbrook_of_kevin_and_kell|archivedate=2008-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Geusz|first=Phil|url=http://www.anthrozine.com/itvw/itv.holbrook.html|title=Guess who's coming to dinner?
