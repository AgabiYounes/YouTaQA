'''BT Group plc''' ([[doing business as|trading as]] '''BT''' and formerly '''British Telecom''') is a British [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] telecommunications [[holding company]] headquartered in London, United Kingdom. It has operations in around 180 countries and is the largest provider of [[Landline|fixed-line]], [[Internet access|broadband]] and [[Mobile telephony|mobile]] services in the UK, and also provides [[Pay television|subscription television]] and [[Information technology|IT services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our company|url=http://btplc.com/Thegroup/Ourcompany/Groupbusinesses/index.htm|website=BT Group plc|accessdate=27 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814044556/http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/Ourcompany/Groupbusinesses/index.htm|archive-date=14 August 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BT's origins date back to the founding in 1846 of the [[Electric Telegraph Company]], the world's first public telegraph company, which developed a nationwide communications network. In 1912, the [[General Post Office]], a government department, became the monopoly telecoms supplier in the United Kingdom. The Post Office Act of 1969 led to the GPO becoming a public corporation. British Telecommunications, trading as ''British Telecom'', was formed in 1980, and became independent of the Post Office in 1981. British Telecommunications was privatised in 1984, becoming ''British Telecommunications plc'', with some 50 percent of its shares sold to investors. The Government sold its remaining stake in further share sales in 1991 and 1993. BT is a [[List of Royal Warrant holders of the British Royal Family|Royal Warrant holder of the British Royal Family]] and has a primary listing on the [[London Stock Exchange]], a secondary listing on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], and is a constituent of the [[FTSE 100 Index]].

BT controls a number of large subsidiaries. [[BT Global Services]] division supplies telecoms services to corporate and government customers worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/Ourcompany/Companyprofile/Groupbusinesses/BTGlobalServices/index.htm|title=BT Global Services|accessdate=24 August 2010|publisher=BT Group plc| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100810172518/http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/Ourcompany/Companyprofile/Groupbusinesses/BTGlobalServices/index.htm| archivedate= 10 August 2010 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its [[BT Consumer]] division supplies [[telephony]], [[internet access|broadband]], and [[pay television|subscription television]] services in the [[United Kingdom]] to around 18&amp;nbsp;million customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/Ourcompany/Groupbusinesses/btconsumer/index.htm|title=BT Consumer|accessdate=20 December 2014|publisher=BT Group|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220221627/http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/Ourcompany/Groupbusinesses/btconsumer/index.htm|archive-date=20 December 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
A number of privately owned [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] companies operated in Britain from 1846 onwards. Among them were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haigh|first=Kenneth Richardson|title=Cableships and Submarine Cables|publisher=Adlard Coles|year=1968|oclc=497380538 |page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Electric Telegraph Company]]
* [[British and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company]]
* British Telegraph Company
* London District Telegraph Company
* and the United Kingdom Telegraph Company
The [[Telegraph Act 1868]] passed the control of all these to the newly formed GPO ([[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Post Office]])'s Postal Telegraphs Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terramedia.co.uk/reference/law/UK_media_law/telecom_laws.htm|publisher=Terramedia|title=UK media law|accessdate=2 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170523151027/http://www.terramedia.co.uk/reference/law/UK_media_law/telecom_laws.htm|archive-date=23 May 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the invention of the [[telephone]] by [[Alexander Graham Bell]] in 1876 the GPO began to provide telephone services from some of its telegraph exchanges. In 1882  the [[United Kingdom Postmaster General|Postmaster-General]], Henry Fawcett started to issue licences to operate a telephone service to private businesses and the telephone system grew under the GPO in some areas and private ownership in others. The GPO's main competitor, the [[National Telephone Company]], emerged in this market by absorbing other private telephone companies, prior to its absorption into the GPO in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/50a5d416-8fc1-3a00-9345-9f16d7b07b73|title=Records created and used by the National Telephone Company Limited|publisher=Archives Hub|accessdate=2 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306111507/https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/50a5d416-8fc1-3a00-9345-9f16d7b07b73|archive-date=6 March 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trunk network was unified under GPO control in 1896 and the local distribution network in 1912. A few municipally owned services remained outside of GPO control. These were [[Kingston upon Hull]], [[Portsmouth]] and [[Guernsey]]. Hull still retains an independent operator, [[Kingston Communications]], though it is no longer municipally controlled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcomplc.com/about-us/our-history/ KCOM Group: Our History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112125913/http://www.kcomplc.com/about-us/our-history/ |date=12 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 the GPO, a government department, became the [[Royal Mail|Post Office]], a nationalised industry separate from government. [[Post Office Telecommunications]] was one of the divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/a985c70a-8be3-3dfb-83c4-e7f127537064|title=Post Office and British Telecommunications Public Corporations|publisher=Archives Hub|accessdate=2 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306044111/https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/a985c70a-8be3-3dfb-83c4-e7f127537064|archive-date=6 March 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formation of British Telecom ===
[[File:British Telecom 1981.svg|120px|thumb|British Telecom logo used from 1980–1991]]
The ''British Telecom'' brand was introduced in 1980. On 1 October 1981, this became the official name of [[Post Office Telecommunications]], which became a state-owned corporation independent of the Post Office under the provisions of the [[British Telecommunications Act 1981]]. In 1982 BT's monopoly on telecommunications was broken with the granting of a licence to [[Mercury Communications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1982/jun/14/mercury-communications-ltd|title=Mercury Communications Ltd|publisher=Hansard|date=14 June 1982|accessdate=2 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306043633/https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1982/jun/14/mercury-communications-ltd|archive-date=6 March 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Privatisation ===
On 19 July 1982, the Government announced its intention to sell shares in British Telecom to the public. On 1 April 1984, British Telecommunications was incorporated as a public limited company (plc) in anticipation of the passing of the Telecommunications Bill. This Bill received Royal Assent on 12 April, and the transfer to British Telecommunications plc from British Telecom as a statutory corporation of its business, its property, its rights and liabilities took place on 6 August 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://moneyweek.com/417238/3-december-1984-bt-is-sold-off-in-a-gamble-over-privatisation/|title=3 December 1984: BT is sold off in a gamble over privatisation|date=3 December 2015|publisher=Money Week|accessdate=2 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306044028/https://moneyweek.com/417238/3-december-1984-bt-is-sold-off-in-a-gamble-over-privatisation/|archive-date=6 March 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially all shares in the new plc were owned by the Government. In November 1984, 50.2% of the new company was offered for sale to the public and employees. Shares were listed in London, New York, and Toronto and the first day of trading on was 3 December 1984. The Government sold half its remaining interest in December 1991 and the other half in July 1993. In July 1997, the new Labour Government relinquished its Special Share (&quot;Golden Share&quot;), retained at the time of the flotation, which had effectively given it the power to block a takeover of the company, and to appoint two non-executive directors to the Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/government-abandons-bt-golden-share-1250939.html|title=Government abandons BT Golden Share|newspaper=The Independent|date=16 July 1997|accessdate=2 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306051445/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/government-abandons-bt-golden-share-1250939.html|archive-date=6 March 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company changed its trading name to &quot;BT&quot; on 2 April 1991. In 1996 [[Peter Bonfield]] was appointed CEO and Chairman of the Executive Committee, promising a &quot;rollercoaster ride&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;zsjoip&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1231535.stm | work=BBC News | title=Sir Peter Bonfield: A profile | date=31 October 2001 | accessdate=27 April 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040622232026/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1231535.stm | archive-date=22 June 2004 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, BT entered the Irish [[telecommunications]] market through a joint venture with the [[Electricity Supply Board]], the Irish state owned power provider. This venture, entitled Ocean, found its main success through the launch of Ireland's first subscription-free dial-up ISP, oceanfree.net.  As a telecoms company it found much less success, mainly targeting corporate customers. BT acquired 100% of this venture in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/heart-stopping-time-for-ocean-boss-in-setting-up-telecom-company-1.144051|title=Heart-stopping time for Ocean boss in setting up telecom company|date=8 January 1999|newspaper=Irish Times|accessdate=2 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306043004/https://www.irishtimes.com/business/heart-stopping-time-for-ocean-boss-in-setting-up-telecom-company-1.144051|archive-date=6 March 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BT's attempted global alliances ===
==== MCI ====
In June 1994  BT and [[MCI Communications]] launched [[Concert Communications Services]] which was a $1 billion joint venture between the two companies. Its aim was to build a network which would provide easy global connectivity to multinational corporations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontechnology.com/news/9_14/news/9537-1.html MCI and British Telecom are getting a concerted jump on the competition but is being first enough?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; 27 October 1994] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060607121754/http://www.washingtontechnology.com/news/9_14/news/9537-1.html |date=2006-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This alliance progressed further on 3 November 1996 when the two companies announced that they had agreed to a merger, creating a global telecommunications company called Concert plc. The proposal gained approval from the [[European Commission]], the [[US Department of Justice]], and the [[Federal Communications Commission|US Federal Communications Commission]] and looked set to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/mergers/cases/decisions/m856_19970514_600_en.pdf|title=Commission Decision of 14 May 1997 declaring a concentration to be compatible with the common market and the functioning of the EEA Agreement|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=2 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306042701/http://ec.europa.eu/competition/mergers/cases/decisions/m856_19970514_600_en.pdf|archive-date=6 March 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in light of pressure from investors reacting to the slide in BT's share price on the [[London Stock Exchange]], BT reduced its bid price for MCI, releasing MCI from its exclusivity clause and allowing it to speak to other interested parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;FindArticles.com - CBSi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/?noadc=1|title=FindArticles.com - CBSi|website=findarticles.com|access-date=14 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040814080003/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCO/is_1_5/ai_101337651|archive-date=14 August 2004|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 October 1997, [[MCI Inc.|Worldcom]] made a rival bid for MCI which was followed by a counter-bid from [[GTE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/|title=Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia|website=www.nytimes.com|access-date=14 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108144641/http://www.nytimes.com/|archive-date=8 January 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BT sold its stake in MCI to Worldcom in 1998 for £4,159 million. As part of the deal, BT also bought out from MCI its 24.9% interest in Concert Communications, thereby making Concert a wholly owned part of BT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://money.cnn.com/1997/11/10/deals/worldcomwins/|title=WorldCom wins MCI|date=10 November 1997|magazine=Money|accessdate=2 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306044741/https://money.cnn.com/1997/11/10/deals/worldcomwins/|archive-date=6 March 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction to the failure of the deal in the City of London was critical of then Chairman [[Iain Vallance]] and CEO [[Peter Bonfield]], and the lack of confidence from the failed merger led to their removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aurorawdc.com/mciworldcom.htm|title=MCI and WorldCom -- How British Telecom Fell Short at Competitive Intelligence -- AuroraWDC.com Competitive Intelligence, Knowledge Management, Market Research, Competitor Analysis|website=www.aurorawdc.com|access-date=14 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172412/http://www.aurorawdc.com/mciworldcom.htm|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== AT&amp;T ====
As BT now owned Concert, and still wanted access to the North American market, it needed a new partner. An [[AT&amp;T]]/BT option had been mooted in the past, but stopped on regulatory grounds due to their individual virtual monopolies in their home markets. By 1996, this had receded to the point where a deal was possible and a deal was consummated in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/27/business/at-t-and-british-telecom-merge-overseas-operations.html|title=AT&amp;T and British Telecom Merge Overseas Operations|date=27 July 1998|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=2 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306044826/https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/27/business/at-t-and-british-telecom-merge-overseas-operations.html|archive-date=6 March 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its height, the Concert managed network was extensive. Although Concert continued signing customers, its rate of revenue growth slowed, so that in 1999 David Dorman was made CEO with a brief to revive it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://money.cnn.com/2000/11/28/technology/att/|title=AT&amp;T names president|date=28 November 2000|magazine=Money|accessdate=2 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306043455/https://money.cnn.com/2000/11/28/technology/att/|archive-date=6 March 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2000 the BT and AT&amp;T boards fell-out – partly due to each partner's excess debt, and the resulting board room clear-outs – partly due to Concert's extensive annual losses. AT&amp;T recognized that Concert was a threat to its ambitions if left intact, and so negotiated a deal where Concert was split in two in 2001: North America and Eastern Asia went to AT&amp;T, the rest of the world and $400M to BT. BT's remaining Concert assets were merged into its BT Ignite, later BT Global Services group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/may/13/newmedia.business|title=2,000 jobs go as BT's Ignite seeks to stem losses|date=13 May 2002|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=2 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306044151/https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/may/13/newmedia.business|archive-date=6 March 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BT Ireland ===
In 2000, BT acquired [[BT Ireland|Esat Telecom Group plc]], and all its subsidiary companies, and [[Ireland On Line]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FindArticles.com - CBSi&quot;/&gt; It also purchased [[Telenor]]'s minority shareholding in [[O2 Ireland|Esat Digifone]]. The Esat Telecom Group was split in two with the landline and internet operations were combining with Ocean to become part of BT Ignite.  Esat Group was renamed Esat BT in July 2002, and eventually [[BT Ireland]] in April 2005. Esat Digifone became part of BT Wireless, before being spun off into a separate independent company [[Telefónica Europe|mmo2 plc]] (now [[Telefónica Europe]]). EsatBT installed the first [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]] lines in Ireland, to try and compete heavily with former state telecoms company [[Eircom]] and operate one exchange, in [[Limerick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/eircom-s-dsl-attracts-1-000-users-1.356846|title=Eircom's DSL attracts 1,000 users|date=25 April 2003|newspaper=Irish Times|accessdate=2 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2001 debt crisis ===
By 2001, BT had a debt of £30 billion, much of which was acquired during the bidding round for the [[3G|3rd generation mobile telephony]] (commonly known as 3G) licences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1322290.stm | work=BBC News | title=BT attacks debt mountain | date=10 May 2001 | accessdate=27 April 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823235812/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1322290.stm | archive-date=23 August 2007 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It had also failed in its series of proposed global mergers, and the funds flowing from its then virtual monopoly of the UK market place had been largely removed. It was also headed by two executives who had little support from the [[London Stock Exchange]], particularly in light of a 60% drop in share price in sixteen months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1297641.stm | work=BBC News | title=Vallance resigns from BT | date=26 April 2001 | accessdate=27 April 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070326014439/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1297641.stm | archive-date=26 March 2007 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe's largest rights issue ===
In May 2001  BT carried out corporate Europe's largest ever [[rights issue]], allowing it to raise £5.9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1394128.stm|title=BT wraps up share sale|date=18 June 2001|via=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=14 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123023845/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1394128.stm|archive-date=23 November 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days before, it sold stakes in [[Japan Telecom]], in mobile operator J-Phone Communications, and in [[Airtel]] of India to [[Vodafone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1306080.stm|title=BT retreats from Japan and Spain|date=1 May 2001|via=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=14 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123023452/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1306080.stm|archive-date=23 November 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sale of Yell Group and demerger of O2 ===
In June 2001 BT's directory business was sold as [[Yell Group]] to a combination of [[private equity]] firms [[Apax Partners]] and [[Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst]] for £2.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1350672.stm|title=BT sells Yell for £2.1bn|date=27 May 2001|via=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=14 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123023822/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1350672.stm|archive-date=23 November 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A demerger followed in November 2001, when the former mobile telecommunications business of BT, BT Cellnet, was hived off as a separate business named &quot;[[O2 (UK)|mmO2]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/|title=Technology News, Analysis, Comments and Product Reviews for IT Professionals|website=ZDNet|access-date=14 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190310154122/https://www.zdnet.com/|archive-date=10 March 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included BT owned or operated networks in other countries, including BT Cellnet (UK), Esat Digifone (Ireland), and Viag Interkom (Germany). All networks now owned or operated by mmO2 (except [[Manx Telecom]]) were renamed as O2. The de-merger was accomplished via a share-swap, all British Telecommunications plc shareholders received one mmO2 plc and one BT Group plc (of which British Telecommunications is now a wholly owned subsidiary) share for each share they owned. British Telecommunications plc was de-listed on 16 November, and the two new companies started trading on 19 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BT approves mobiles spin-off |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1615100.stm |work=BBC News Online |date=23 October 2001 |accessdate=7 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040628041135/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1615100.stm |archive-date=28 June 2004 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 BT made a number of acquisitions. In February 2005, BT acquired Infonet (now re-branded BT Infonet), a large telecoms company based in [[El Segundo, California]], giving BT access to new geographies. It also acquired the Italian company Albacom. Then in April 2005, it bought Radianz from Reuters (now rebranded as BT Radianz), which expanded BT's coverage and provided BT with more buying power in certain countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DUJ/is_/ai_n9772149 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903212234/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DUJ/is_/ai_n9772149 |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 September 2015 |title=BT goes home |via=Find Articles |date=1 December 2004 |accessdate=18 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, BT confirmed that it would be investing 75% of its total capital spending, put at £10&amp;nbsp;billion over five years, in its new [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) based [[BT 21CN|21st century network]] (21CN). Annual savings of £1&amp;nbsp;billion per annum were expected when the transition to the new network was to have been completed in 2010, with over 50% of its customers to have been transferred by 2008. That month the first customers on to 21CN was successfully tested at [[Adastral Park]] in Suffolk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-155608023.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105152415/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-155608023.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 November 2012 |title=BT transfers first customer lines to 21CN network  |date=1 December 2006 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days of its fibre broadband rollout, BT said it would deliver fibre-to-the-premises ([[FTTP]]) to around 25% of the Country, with the rest catered for by the slower fibre-to-the-cabinet (FTTC), which uses copper wiring to deliver the final stretch of the connection. In 2014, with less than 0.7% of the company's fibre network being FTTP, BT dropped the 25% target, saying that it was &quot;far less relevant today&quot; because of improvements made to the headline speed of FTTC, which had doubled to 80Mbit/s since its fibre broadband rollout was first announced.&lt;ref name=&quot;alphr.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = BT aimed to get true fibre to 25% of UK.

On 6 April 2011, BT launched the first online [[not-for-profit]] fundraising service for UK charities called [[BT MyDonate]] as part of its investment to the community. The service will pass on 100% of all donations made through the site to the charity, and unlike other services which take a proportion as commission and charge charities for using their services, BT will only pass on credit/debit card charges for each donation. The service allows people to register to give money to charity or collect fundraising donations.

On 1 February 2016, BT announced a new organisational structure that will take effect from April 2016 following the successful acquisition of [[EE Limited|EE]]. The EE brand, network and high street stores will be retained and will become a second consumer division, operating alongside [[BT Consumer]]. It will serve customers with mobile services, broadband and TV and will continue to deliver the Emergency Services Network contract which was awarded to EE in late 2015. There will be a new BT Business and Public Sector division that will have around £5bn of revenues and will serve small and large businesses as well as the public sector in the UK and Ireland. It will comprise the existing [[BT Business]] division along with EE's business division and those parts of [[BT Global Services]] that are UK focused. There will also be another new division; BT Wholesale and Ventures that will comprise the existing [[BT Wholesale]] division along with EE's [[Mobile virtual network operator|MVNO]] business as well as some specialist businesses such as Fleet, Payphones and Directories.

BT Group is a [[holding company]]; the majority of its businesses and assets are held by its wholly owned subsidiary British Telecommunications plc.&lt;ref name=&quot;Groupbusinesses&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/Ourcompany/Groupbusinesses/index.htm|title=Group businesses|accessdate=20 December 2014|publisher=BT Group plc|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202040853/http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/Ourcompany/Groupbusinesses/index.htm|archive-date=2 February 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; BT's businesses are operated under special government regulation by the British telecoms regulator [[Ofcom]] (formerly [[Oftel]]). BT has been found to have significant market power in some markets following market reviews by Ofcom. In these markets, BT is required to comply with additional obligations such as meeting reasonable requests to supply services and not to discriminate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/w-008-0759?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)|title=Significant market power in the UK electronic communications networks and services sector|publisher= Practical Law Competition|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BT runs the [[telephone exchange]]s, trunk network and [[local loop]] connections for the vast majority of British fixed-line telephones. Currently BT is responsible for approximately 28&amp;nbsp;million telephone lines in GB. Apart from [[KCOM Group]], which serves Kingston upon Hull, BT is the only UK telecoms operator to have a ''[[Universal service]] Obligation,'' (USO) which means it must provide a fixed telephone line to any address in the UK. It is also obliged to provide public call boxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/information-for-industry/telecoms-competition-regulation/general-authorisation-regime/universal-service-obligation|title=Universal Service Obligations|publisher=Ofcom|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as continuing to provide service in those traditional areas in which BT has an obligation to provide services or is closely regulated, BT has expanded into more profitable products and services where there is less regulation. These are principally, broadband internet service and [[bespoke]] solutions in telecommunications and information technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-8146|title=A Universal Service Obligation (USO) for Broadband|publisher=UK Parliament|date=22 December 2017|accessdate=2 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180302225336/http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-8146|archive-date=2 March 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As BT operates in around 180 countries, it [[Ownership|owns]] and [[lease]]s a range of buildings and [[Telecommunications facility|facilities]] in the UK and around the world. In 2001, it sold some of its UK property portfolio for £2.38&amp;nbsp;billion to [[Telereal Trillium]] in a 30-year [[leaseback]]. The deal included 6,700 properties and contributed towards alleviating its debt at the time, with the main advantage being flexibility as it allows BT to vacate property over time, so as to adapt to changing operational requirements.&lt;ref name=&quot;TelerealTrillium&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sabbagh |first1=Dan |title=Property sale to cost BT £40m a year |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2743456/Property-sale-to-cost-BT-40m-a-year.html |accessdate=8 September 2018 |work=The Telegraph |date=27 November 2001 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180911002340/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2743456/Property-sale-to-cost-BT-40m-a-year.html |archive-date=11 September 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
=== World Wide Web hyperlink patent ===
In 2001, BT discovered it owned a patent ({{US patent|4873662}}) which it believed gave it patent rights on the use of [[hyperlink]] technology on the [[World Wide Web]]. The corresponding UK patent had already expired, but the US patent was valid until 2006. On 11 February 2002, BT began a court case relating to its claims in a US federal court against the [[Internet service provider]] [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy Communications Corporation]].  In the case ''[[British Telecommunications plc v. Prodigy]]'', the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] ruled on 22 August 2002 that the BT patent was not applicable to web technology and granted Prodigy's request for [[summary judgment]] of non-infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nswscl.org.au/journal/51/Glen_Sauer.html |title=BT's &quot;Hyperlinking&quot; Patent Litigation Fails |publisher=Nswscl.org.au |accessdate=18 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217061413/http://www.nswscl.org.au/journal/51/Glen_Sauer.html |archive-date=17 February 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavioural targeting ===
In early 2008 it was announced that BT had entered into a contract (along with [[Virgin Media]] and [[TalkTalk Group|TalkTalk]]) with the [[spyware]] company [[Phorm]] (responsible under their 121Media guise for the Apropos [[rootkit]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.f-secure.com/sw-desc/apropos.shtml F-Secure Spyware Information Pages: Apropos] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110220950/http://www.f-secure.com/sw-desc/apropos.shtml |date=10 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f-secure.com/sw-desc/peopleonpage.shtml |title=FSecure Spyware Information Pages: PeopleOnPage |publisher=F-secure.com |accessdate=18 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524153535/http://www.f-secure.com/sw-desc/peopleonpage.shtml |archivedate=24 May 2011 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; to intercept and analyse their users' click-stream data and sell the anonymised aggregate information as part of Phorm's OIX advertising service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Williams |first=Chris |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/25/phorm_isp_advertising/page2.html |title=ISP data deal with former 'spyware' boss triggers privacy fears |work=The Register |date=25 February 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217080502/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/25/phorm_isp_advertising/page2.html |archive-date=17 December 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Williams |first=Chris |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/29/phorm_documents/ |title=How Phorm plans to tap your internet connection |work=The Register |date=29 February 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412151736/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/29/phorm_documents/ |archive-date=12 April 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice, known as &quot;[[behavioural targeting]]&quot; and condemned by critics as &quot;data pimping&quot;, came under intense fire from various internet communities and other interested-parties who believe that the interception of data without the consent of users and web site owners is illegal under UK law (RIPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-home/article-23449601-details/Web+users+angry+at+ISPs%27+spyware+tie-up/article.do |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310000649/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-home/article-23449601-details/Web+users+angry+at+ISPs'+spyware+tie-up/article.do |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 March 2008 |title=Web users angry at ISPs' spyware tie-up |work=London Evening Standard |location=London |accessdate=18 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Williams |first=Chris |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/03/04/phorm_ripa/ |title=Data pimping: surveillance expert raises illegal wiretap worries |work=The Register |date=4 March 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110402051431/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/03/04/phorm_ripa/ |archive-date=2 April 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Williams |first=Chris |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/03/17/phorm_fipr_illegal/ |title=Net think thank: Phorm is illegal |work=The Register |date=17 March 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404054947/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/03/17/phorm_fipr_illegal/ |archive-date=4 April 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fipr.org/080423phormlegal.pdf |title=The Phorm &quot;Webwise&quot; System – a Legal Analysis |format=PDF |accessdate=18 April 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110522062819/http://www.fipr.org/080423phormlegal.pdf| archivedate= 22 May 2011 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a more fundamental level, many have argued that the ISPs and Phorm have no right to sell a commodity (a user's data, and the copyrighted content of web sites) to which they have no claim of ownership. In response to questions about Phorm and the interception of data by the Webwise system Sir [[Tim Berners-Lee]], credited as the creator of the World Wide Web protocol, indicated his disapproval of the concept and is quoted as saying of his data and web history:

=== Huawei infrastructure access ===
Beginning in 2010 the UK intelligence community investigated [[Huawei]], the Chinese supplier of BT's new fibre infrastructure with increasing urgency after the United States, Canada and Australia prevented the company from operating in their countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Charles Arthur |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/08/china-huawei-zte-security-threat |title=China's Huawei and ZTE pose national security threat, says US committee |work=The Guardian |date=8 October 2012 |accessdate=4 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019024045/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/08/china-huawei-zte-security-threat |archive-date=19 October 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although BT had notified the UK government in 2003 of Huawei's interest in their £10bn network upgrade contract, they did not raise the security implications as BT failed to explain that the Chinese company would have unfettered access to critical infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/security/383125/government-admits-slip-ups-in-bt-huawei-deal|title=Government admits slip-ups in BT-Huawei deal|access-date=14 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330154517/http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/security/383125/government-admits-slip-ups-in-bt-huawei-deal|archive-date=30 March 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 December 2012 the prime minister [[David Cameron]] was supplied with an in-depth report indicating that the intelligence services had very grave doubts regarding Huawei, and that UK governmental, military, and civilian privacy may have been under serious threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cusick|first=James|title=China telecoms giant could be cyber-security risk to Britain|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/china-telecoms-giant-could-be-cybersecurity-risk-to-britain-8420432.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=16 December 2012|access-date=14 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925165835/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/china-telecoms-giant-could-be-cybersecurity-risk-to-britain-8420432.html|archive-date=25 September 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 2013, British lawmakers concluded that BT should not have allowed Huawei access to the UK's communications network without ministerial oversight, saying they were 'deeply shocked' that BT did not inform government that they were allowing Huawei and ZTE, both with ties to the Chinese military, unfettered access to critical national systems. Furthermore, ministers discovered that the agency with the responsibility to ensure Chinese equipment and code was threat-free was entirely staffed by Huawei employees. Subsequently, parliamentarians confirmed that in case of an attack on the UK there was nothing that could be done to stop Chinese infiltration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sandle |first=Paul |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/06/07/uk-britain-telecoms-huawei-idUKBRE9550RP20130607 |title=Parliamentarians say Huawei-BT deal exposes flawed security controls |agency=Reuters |date=7 June 2013 |accessdate=4 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328034745/http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/06/07/uk-britain-telecoms-huawei-idUKBRE9550RP20130607 |archive-date=28 March 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2016 Huawei had put measures in place to ensure the integrity of UK national security. Specifically their UK work is now overseen by a board that includes directors from [[GCHQ]], the [[Cabinet Office]] and the [[Home Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/07/china-huwaei-cell-uk-national-security-cyber-surveillance-hacking|title=The Chinese firm taking threats to UK national security very seriously|work=The Guardian|date=7 August 2016|accessdate=2 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411211105/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/07/china-huwaei-cell-uk-national-security-cyber-surveillance-hacking|archive-date=11 April 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ZTE]], another Chinese company that supplies extensive network equipment and subscriber hardware used with BT 'Infinity', was also under scrutiny by parliament's intelligence and security committee&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/10/huawei-international-blacklisting|title=Huawei's relationship with BT under investigation by MPs|last=Garside|first=Juliette|date=10 October 2012|work=The Guardian|access-date=9 June 2017|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116001940/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/10/huawei-international-blacklisting|archive-date=16 November 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the US, Canada, Australia and the European Union declared the company a security risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shead |first=Sam |url=http://www.zdnet.com/uk/huawei-and-zte-could-pose-security-and-business-threat-to-europe-says-eu-report-7000008751/ |title=Huawei and ZTE could pose security and business threat to Europe, says EU report |work=ZDNet |date=13 December 2012 |accessdate=4 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702235052/http://www.zdnet.com/uk/huawei-and-zte-could-pose-security-and-business-threat-to-europe-says-eu-report-7000008751/ |archive-date=2 July 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alleged complicity with drone strikes in Yemen and Somalia ===
In September 2012, BT entered into a $23&amp;nbsp;million deal with the US military to provide a key communications cable connecting [[RAF Croughton]], a US military base on UK soil, with [[Camp Lemonnier]], a large US base in Djibouti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;tab=core&amp;id=bb6b01958cbe2c2150d56ff874d2dac4&amp;_cview=0 |title=Contract Award Notice |publisher=Procurement Directorate, Defense Information Systems Agency |date=26 September 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520220004/https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;tab=core&amp;id=bb6b01958cbe2c2150d56ff874d2dac4&amp;_cview=0 |archive-date=20 May 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Camp Lemonnier is used as a base for American drone attacks in Yemen and Somalia, and has been described by ''The Economist'' as &quot;the most important base for drone operations outside the war zone of Afghanistan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21565614-america-uses-drones-lot-secret-and-largely-unencumbered-declared-rules-worries |title=Death From Afar |work=The Economist |date=3 November 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425030200/http://www.economist.com/news/international/21565614-america-uses-drones-lot-secret-and-largely-unencumbered-declared-rules-worries |archive-date=25 April 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights groups including [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]] and [[Amnesty International]] have criticised the use of armed drones outside declared war zones. Evidence produced by [[The Bureau of Investigative Journalism]] and [[Stanford University]]'s International Human Rights &amp; Conflict Resolution Clinic suggest that drone strikes have caused substantial civilian casualties, and may be illegal under international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/07/02/resources-and-graphs/ |title=Pakistan Drone Statistics Visualised |publisher=The Bureau of Investigative Journalism |date=2 July 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521031637/http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/07/02/resources-and-graphs/ |archive-date=21 May 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livingunderdrones.org/ |title=Living Under Drones |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=20 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503162734/http://www.livingunderdrones.org/ |archivedate=3 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, BT was the subject of a complaint by [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]] to the [[Department of Business, Innovation and Skills]] under the [[OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises]], following their refusal to explain whether or not their infrastructure was used to facilitate drone strikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reprieve.org.uk/media/downloads/2013_07_15_PUB_Complaint_to_UK_NCP_re_BT_plc.pdf |title=Complaint to UK National Contact Point |publisher=Reprieve |date=15 July 2013 |accessdate=20 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521031829/http://www.reprieve.org.uk/media/downloads/2013_07_15_PUB_Complaint_to_UK_NCP_re_BT_plc.pdf |archivedate=21 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent refusal of this complaint was appealed in May 2014, on the basis that the UK National Contact Point's decision did not follow the OECD Guidelines. The issue of bias was also raised, due to the appointment of Lord Ian Livingston as government minister for the department which was processing the complaint: Livingston had occupied a senior position at BT when the cable between RAF Croughton and Camp Lemonnier was originally built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/exclusive-minister-in-row-over-bts-link-to-us-drones-war-9215364.html |title=Minister in row over BT's link to US drones' war |work=The Independent |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=2 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521031322/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/exclusive-minister-in-row-over-bts-link-to-us-drones-war-9215364.html |archive-date=21 May 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
