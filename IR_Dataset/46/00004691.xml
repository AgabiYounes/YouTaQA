'''&quot;The Big Apple&quot;''' is [[list of nicknames of New York City|a nickname]] for [[New York City]]. It was first popularized in the 1920s by [[John J. Fitz Gerald]], a sports writer for the ''[[The Morning Telegraph|New York Morning Telegraph]]''. Its popularity since the 1970s is due in part to a promotional campaign by the New York tourist authorities.

== Origin of the name ==
Although the history of ''Big Apple '' was once thought a mystery,&lt;ref&gt;[[Cecil Adams|Adams, Cecil]] (February 18, 1977) [http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a1_382.html &quot;Why is New York called the Big Apple?&quot;], ''[[The Straight Dope]]''&lt;/ref&gt; a clearer picture of the term's history has emerged due to the work of historian [[Barry Popik]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Barry Popik|Popik, Barry]] [http://www.barrypopik.com/ &quot;The Big Apple&quot;]. Research by Barry Popik and others with the text of contemporary examples.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gerald Cohen of the [[Missouri University of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Gerald (1991) ''Origin of New York City's Nickname &quot;The Big Apple&quot;''. Bern, Switzerland: Peter Lang. {{ISBN|3-631-43787-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of false theories had previously existed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/category/C10/ &quot;False Etymologies&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; including a claim that the term derived from a woman named Eve who ran a brothel in the city.&lt;ref name=salwen /&gt;This was subsequently exposed as a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/big_apple_whore_hoax_1800s/ &quot;Big Apple Whore Hoax (1800s!)&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=salwen&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19971010010804/http://www.salwen.com/apple.html|title=Why Is New York City Called &quot;The Big Apple&quot;?|first=Peter|last=Salwen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known usage of &quot;big apple&quot; appears in the book ''The Wayfarer in New York'' (1909), in which Edward S. Martin writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;Kansas is apt to see in New York a greedy city ... It inclines to think that the big apple gets a disproportionate share of the national sap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first = William | last = Safire | authorlink = William Safire | title = Big Applesource | newspaper = [[The New York Times Magazine]] | date = September 17, 2000 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/17/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-9-17-00-on-language-slurvian.html?pagewanted=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = William | last = Safire | authorlink = William Safire | title = The Right Word in the Right Place at the Right Time | year = 2004 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=blcCxBWVdzgC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=big%20apple 23]| publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|ISBN=9780743242448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[William Safire]] considered this the coinage, but because the phrase is not quoted in the text, it's likely that it was used as a metaphor, and not as a nickname for the city.&lt;ref name=gothamist&gt;Hamilton, Alex (January 21, 2020) [https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/big-apple-nickname-origin-nyc-history &quot;Where Did The Nickname 'The Big Apple' Come From?&quot;] ''[[Gothamist]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horse racing origin===
''The Big Apple'' was popularized as a name for New York City by [[John J. Fitz Gerald]] in a number of horse-racing articles for the ''New York Morning Telegraph'' in the 1920s. The earliest of these was a casual reference on 3 May 1921:

{{quote|J. P. Smith, with Tippity Witchet and others of the L. T. Bauer string, is scheduled to start for &quot;the big apple&quot; to-morrow after a most prosperous Spring campaign at Bowie and Havre de Grace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/first_big_apple_may_3_1921/ &quot;First 'Big Apple': May 3, 1921&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fitz Gerald referred to the &quot;big apple&quot; frequently thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/numerous_1920s_big_apple_citations_in_the_new_york_morning_telegraph/ Numerous 1920s “Big Apple” citations in the New York Morning Telegraph].&lt;/ref&gt; He explained his use in a column dated February 18, 1924, under the headline &quot;Around the Big Apple&quot;:

{{quote|The Big Apple. The dream of every lad that ever threw a leg over a thoroughbred and the goal of all horsemen. There's only one Big Apple. That's New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/first_big_apple_explanation_february_18_1924/ First “Big Apple” explanation: February 18, 1924]. See also the original article [http://www.barrypopik.com/images/FitzGerald1.gif image].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gothamist /&gt;}}

Fitz Gerald reportedly first heard &quot;The Big Apple&quot; used to describe New York's racetracks by two African American stable hands at the New Orleans Fair Grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Hutchinson, Sean|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/31841/why-new-york-city-called-big-apple|title=Why is New York City Called The Big Apple?|date=May 8, 2018|access-date=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gothamist /&gt; Using racing records, Popik traced that conversation to January 1920.&lt;ref name=gothamist /&gt;

In recognition of Fitz Gerald's role in promulgating &quot;The Big Apple&quot; as a nickname for New York City, in 1997 Mayor [[Rudolph W. Giuliani]] signed legislation designating as &quot;Big Apple Corner&quot; the southwest corner of West [[54th Street (Manhattan)|54th Street]] and Broadway, the corner on which John J. Fitz Gerald lived from 1934 to 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/om/html/97/sp082-97.html Mayor's Press Office, Release No. 082-97, Mayor Giuliani Signs Legislation Creating &quot;Big Apple Corner&quot; in Manhattan (Feb. 12, 1997)].&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hotel Ameritania also once had a plaque which was installed in 1996, according to Popik, but it was removed during renovations to the building and was lost.&lt;ref name=gothamist /&gt;

Evidence can also be found in the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'', an African-American newspaper that had a national circulation. Writing for the ''Defender'' on September 16, 1922, &quot;Ragtime&quot; Billy Tucker used the name &quot;big apple&quot; to refer to New York in a non-horse-racing context:

{{quote|I trust your trip to 'the big apple' (New York) was a huge success and only wish that I had been able to make it with you.&lt;ref name=&quot;linguistlist_antedating_1920vaudeville&quot;&gt;[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0801D&amp;L=ADS-L&amp;P=R9794 &quot;Big Apple&quot; antedating] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220232332/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0801D&amp;L=ADS-L&amp;P=R9794 |date=February 20, 2008 }}; [http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/1920s_vaudeville_ragtime_big_apple_citations/ 1920s Vaudeville/Ragtime “Big Apple” Citations].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tucker had also earlier used &quot;big apple&quot; as a reference to [[Los Angeles]]. It is possible that he simply used &quot;big apple&quot; as a nickname for any large city:

{{quote|Dear Pal, Tony: No, Ragtime Billy Tucker hasn't dropped completely out of existence, but is still in the 'Big Apple', Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=&quot;linguistlist_antedating_1920vaudeville&quot; /&gt;}}

==Popularity==

By the late 1920s, New York writers other than Fitz Gerald were starting to use &quot;Big Apple&quot;, and were using it in contexts other than horse racing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/1920s_non_horseracing_big_apple_citations/ &quot;1920s Non-Horseracing 'Big Apple' Citations&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Big Apple&quot; was a popular song&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/big_apple_song_by_bob_emmerich/ &quot;'Big Apple”&quot;song by Bob Emmerich&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Big Apple (dance)|dance]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/big_apple_in_the_1930s_two_clubs_plus_song_and_dance/ &quot;'Big Apple' in the 1930s (Two clubs, plus song and dance)&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The dance was mentioned by name by [[Mickey Rooney]] in the 1938 movie ''[[Love Finds Andy Hardy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1930s.  Jazz musicians in the 1930s also contributed to the use of the phrase to refer to New York City,&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer, Ben (January 2, 2020) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-big-apple-new-yorks-nickname-via-new-orleans-and-the-red-delicious-11577991162 &quot;'The Big Apple': New York’s Nickname, via New Orleans and the 'Red Delicious'&quot;] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt; specifically to the city and [[Harlem]] as the jazz capital of the world.&lt;ref name=enc-nyc&gt;Cohen, Gerald Leonard &quot;Big Apple&quot; in {{cite enc-nyc2|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beside the song and the dance, two nightclubs in the city used &quot;Big Apple&quot; in their names.&lt;ref name=gothamist /&gt;

[[Walter Winchell]] and other writers continued to use the term in the 1940s and early 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/big_apple_in_the_1940s_1950s/ &quot;'Big Apple' in the 1940s-1950s&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; but by the late 1950s, if it was known at all,&lt;ref name=enc-nyc /&gt; it had come to be considered an outdated nickname for New York.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Vonnegut|Vonnegut, Kurt]] (1969) ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' New York: Dell Publishing. p.207. Quote: &quot;New York.&quot; / &quot;The Big Apple.&quot; / &quot;Hm?&quot; / &quot;That's what they used to call New York.&quot; / &quot;Oh.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, however, during [[New York City fiscal crisis|the city's fiscal crisis,]] &quot;People were looking around desperately and some of [them] seized that old phrase the Big Apple to remind people of when New York had been a strong and powerful city and might become that again,&quot; according to the official Manhattan Borough Historian, Dr. Robert Snyder.  It was then that the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau &amp;ndash; now [[NYC &amp; Company]], New York City's official marketing and tourism organization) &amp;ndash; with the help of the [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]] advertising firm,&lt;ref name=gothamist /&gt; began to promote the city's &quot;Big Apple&quot; nickname to tourists,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycvisit.com/content/index.cfm?pagePkey=20 About NYC and Company].&lt;/ref&gt; under the leadership of its president, Charles Gillett.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/big_apple_1970s_revival_charlie_gillett_and_lew_rudin/ &quot;Big Apple 1970s Revival: Charlie Gillett and Lew Rudin&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=enc-nyc /&gt; The campaign was a success,&lt;ref name=gothamist /&gt; and the nickname has remained popular since then.&lt;ref name=voa&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff|url=http://www1.voanews.com/a-23-2009-12-24-voa2-84659432.html|title=Words and Their Stories: Nicknames for New York City|date=February 23, 2010|work=[[Voice of America]]|accessdate=March 2, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413182642/http://www1.voanews.com/a-23-2009-12-24-voa2-84659432.html|archivedate=April 13, 2010|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
