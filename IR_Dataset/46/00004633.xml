{{Politics of the United Kingdom}}
'''Political scandals in the United Kingdom''' are commonly referred to by the press and commentators as &quot;''''sleaze'''&quot;.

==Sleaze==
A number of [[political scandal]]s in the 1980s and 1990s created the impression of what was described in the [[British press]] as &quot;sleaze&quot;: a perception that the then [[British Conservative Party|Conservative]] government was associated with [[political corruption]] and [[hypocrisy]]. This was revived in the late 1990s due to accounts of so-called &quot;sleaze&quot; by the Labour government.

The government was cleared of wrongdoing, while the BBC was strongly criticised by the subsequent inquiry, leading to the resignation of the BBC's chairman and director-general.
*In April 2004, [[Beverly Hughes]] was forced to resign as minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Counter Terrorism when it was shown that she had been informed of procedural improprieties concerning the granting of visas to certain categories of workers from Eastern Europe.

*[[Cash for Honours]] (2006).

==== 2011 ====

==== 2015 ====

* The [[Renewable Heat Incentive scandal]] in Northern Ireland, in which [[Arlene Foster]] set up a green energy scheme but failed to introduce cost controls, creating [[perverse incentive]]s which eventually led to a £480m bill to the Northern Ireland budget.

In January 2017, the scandal caused the resignation of the [[deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland|deputy First Minister]], [[Martin McGuinness]], after Foster refused to stand aside as [[First Minister of Northern Ireland|First Minister]] pending an investigation, collapsing the [[Executive Office of Northern Ireland|Executive Office]] and triggering an [[2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election|early election of the Northern Ireland Assembly]].
