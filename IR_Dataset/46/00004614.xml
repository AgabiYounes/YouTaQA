The '''Boeing 747''' is an American [[wide-body aircraft|wide-body]], long–range, commercial [[jet airliner]] and [[cargo aircraft]]. The first wide-body airplane produced, it was the first plane dubbed a &quot;Jumbo Jet&quot;&lt;!-- See talk.  The nickname &quot;Jumbo Jet&quot; was first coined specifically with the introduction of the Boeing 747, although in contemporary lay use, &quot;jumbo jet&quot; may be attributed to any &quot;large jet airplane with a seating capacity of several hundred passengers&quot;, according to the ''Shorter Oxford English Dictionary''. --&gt;. Its distinctive hump upper deck along the forward part of the aircraft has made it one of the most recognizable aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/747-worlds-airliner-180951414/?all&amp;no-ist |title=747: The World's Airliner |work=Air &amp; Space Magazine |last=Negroni |first=Christine |date=July 2014 |accessdate=January 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufactured by [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Commercial Airplanes|Commercial Airplane]] unit in the United States, the 747 was originally planned to have 150 percent greater capacity than the [[Boeing 707]],&lt;ref&gt;Branson, Richard.

The 747 uses a [[double-deck aircraft|double-deck]] configuration for part of its length and is available in passenger, freighter, and other versions. Boeing designed the 747's hump-like upper deck to serve as a first-class lounge or extra seating, and to allow the aircraft to be easily converted to a cargo carrier by removing seats and installing a front cargo door. Boeing expected [[Supersonic transport|supersonic airliners]]—the development of which was announced in the early 1960s—to render the 747 and other [[subsonic airliner]]s obsolete, while the demand for subsonic cargo aircraft would remain robust well into the future.&lt;ref&gt;Orlebar 2002, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the 747 was expected to become obsolete after 400 were sold,&lt;ref&gt;Haenggi 2003, pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; production passed 1,000 in 1993.&lt;ref name=Sutter_p259&gt;Sutter 2006, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; By June 2019, 1,554 aircraft had been built, with 20 of the 747-8 variants remaining on order.&lt;ref name=&quot;747_O_D_summ&quot;&gt;[http://active.boeing.com/commercial/orders/displaystandardreport.cfm?cboCurrentModel=747&amp;optReportType=AllModels&amp;cboAllModel=747&amp;ViewReportF=View+Report &quot;747 Model Orders and Deliveries data.&quot;] ''The Boeing Company'', May 2019.

==Development==

===Background===
In 1963, the [[United States Air Force]] started a series of study projects on a very large strategic transport aircraft. Although the [[C-141 Starlifter]] was being introduced, officials believed that a much larger and more capable aircraft was needed, especially to carry cargo that would not fit in any existing aircraft. These studies led to initial requirements for the CX-Heavy Logistics System (CX-HLS) in March 1964 for an aircraft with a load capacity of {{convert|180000|lb|kg|sigfig=3}} and a speed of Mach 0.75 ({{convert|500|mph|km/h|sigfig=2|abbr=on|disp=or}}), and an unrefueled range of {{convert|5000|nmi|km|sigfig=2}} with a payload of {{convert|115000|lb|kg|sigfig=3}}. The payload bay had to be {{convert|17|ft|m|sigfig=3}} wide by {{convert|13.5|ft|m|sigfig=3}} high and {{convert|100|ft|m|sigfig=2}} long with access through doors at the front and rear.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norton_C-5&quot;&gt;Norton 2003, pp. 5–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The desire to keep the number of engines to four required new engine designs with greatly increased power and better fuel economy. In May 1964, airframe proposals arrived from Boeing, [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]], [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], and [[Martin Marietta]]; engine proposals were submitted by [[GE Aviation|General Electric]], [[Curtiss-Wright]], and [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]]. Boeing, Douglas, and Lockheed were given additional study contracts for the airframe, along with General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney for the engines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norton_C-5&quot;/&gt;

The airframe proposals shared a number of features. As the CX-HLS needed to be able to be loaded from the front, a door had to be included where the cockpit usually was. All of the companies solved this problem by moving the cockpit above the cargo area; Douglas had a small &quot;pod&quot; just forward and above the wing, Lockheed used a long &quot;spine&quot; running the length of the aircraft with the wing spar passing through it, while Boeing blended the two, with a longer pod that ran from just behind the nose to just behind the wing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141014202050/http://airwaysnews.com/html/museums/boeing-archives-bellevue-washington-usa/boeing-cx-hls-model-196364/19149 Boeing CX-HLS Model at Boeing Corporate Archives - 1963/64]&lt;br /&gt;[http://bemil.chosun.com/nbrd/gallery/view.html?b_bbs_id=10044&amp;num=169918 Models of Boeing C-5A proposal and Lockheed's (Korean text] - [http://bemil.chosun.com/nbrd/bbs/view.html?b_bbs_id=10050&amp;num=4082 next page])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/PAIS/Partners/C_5.html &quot;Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, Partners in Freedom.&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214134934/http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/PAIS/Partners/C_5.html |date=December 14, 2007 }} ''NASA'', 2000, see images in &quot;Langley Contributions to the C-5&quot;. Retrieved: December 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, Lockheed's aircraft design and General Electric's engine design were selected for the new [[C-5 Galaxy]] transport, which was the largest military aircraft in the world at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norton_C-5&quot;/&gt; Boeing would carry the nose door and raised cockpit concepts over to the design of the 747.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 2000, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airliner proposal===
The 747 was conceived while air travel was increasing in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Norris_Wagner_p13&gt;Norris and Wagner 1997, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The era of commercial jet transportation, led by the enormous popularity of the [[Boeing 707]] and [[Douglas DC-8]], had revolutionized long-distance travel.&lt;ref name=Norris_Wagner_p13/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/companyoffices/gallery/images/commercial/707-03.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111124513/http://www.boeing.com/companyoffices/gallery/images/commercial/707-03.html |archivedate=January 11, 2012 |title=Boeing Multimedia Image Gallery 707|publisher=The Boeing Company |url-status=dead |accessdate=December 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even before it lost the CX-HLS contract, Boeing was asked by [[Juan Trippe]], president of [[Pan American World Airways]] (Pan Am), one of their most important airline customers, to build a passenger aircraft more than twice the size of the 707. During this time, airport congestion, worsened by increasing numbers of passengers carried on relatively small aircraft, became a problem that Trippe thought could be addressed by a larger new aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/kcet/chasingthesun/innovators/jtrippe.html &quot;Innovators: Juan Trippe.&quot;] ''PBS''. Retrieved: December 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, [[Joe Sutter]] was transferred from Boeing's [[Boeing 737|737]] development team to manage the design studies for the new airliner, already assigned the model number 747.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sutter_p80-4&quot;&gt;Sutter 2006, pp. 80–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Sutter began a design study with Pan Am and other airlines, to better understand their requirements. At the time, it was widely thought that the 747 would eventually be superseded by [[supersonic transport]] aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/852087.stm &quot;Air travel, a supersonic future?.&quot;] ''BBC News'', July 17, 2001. Retrieved: December 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Boeing responded by designing the 747 so that it could be adapted easily to carry freight and remain in production even if sales of the passenger version declined. In the freighter role, the clear need was to support the [[Containerization|containerized shipping]] methodologies that were being widely introduced at about the same time. Standard shipping containers are {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} square at the front (slightly higher due to attachment points) and available in {{convert|20|and|40|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} lengths. This meant that it would be possible to support a 2-wide 2-high stack of containers two or three ranks deep with a fuselage size similar to the earlier CX-HLS project.

In April 1966, Pan Am ordered 25 747-100 aircraft for US$525&amp;nbsp;million. During the ceremonial 747 contract-signing banquet in Seattle on Boeing's 50th Anniversary, Juan Trippe predicted that the 747 would be &quot;... a great weapon for peace, competing with [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|intercontinental missiles]] for mankind's destiny&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rfpsBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31|title=The Airbus A380: A History|last=Simons|first=Graham|year=2014|page=31|isbn=9781783030415}}&lt;/ref&gt; As launch customer,&lt;ref name=ucfc747&gt;Rumerman, Judy.

===Design effort===
Ultimately, the high-winged CX-HLS Boeing design was not used for the 747, although technologies developed for their bid had an influence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/PAIS/Partners/C_5.html &quot;Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, Partners in Freedom.&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214134934/http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/PAIS/Partners/C_5.html |date=December 14, 2007 }} ''NASA'', 2000.

===Development and testing===
[[File:Boeing 747 rollout (3).jpg|thumb|left|The prototype 747 was first displayed to the public on September 30, 1968.]]

Before the first 747 was fully assembled, testing began on many components and systems. One important test involved the evacuation of 560 volunteers from a cabin mock-up via the aircraft's emergency chutes. The first full-scale evacuation took two and a half minutes instead of the maximum of 90 seconds mandated by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA), and several volunteers were injured. Subsequent test evacuations achieved the 90-second goal but caused more injuries. Most problematic was evacuation from the aircraft's upper deck; instead of using a conventional slide, volunteer passengers escaped by using a harness attached to a reel.&lt;ref name=Irving_p383&gt;Irving 1994, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; Tests also involved taxiing such a large aircraft. Boeing built an unusual training device known as &quot;Waddell's Wagon&quot; (named for a 747 test pilot, Jack Waddell) that consisted of a mock-up cockpit mounted on the roof of a truck. While the first 747s were still being built, the device allowed pilots to practice taxi maneuvers from a high upper-deck position.&lt;ref name=hist747&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/history/boeing/747.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316193220/http://www.boeing.com/history/boeing/747.html |archivedate=March 16, 2010 |title=History – 747 Commercial Transport|publisher=The Boeing Company |url-status=dead |accessdate=April 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During later stages of the flight test program, [[Wing flutter|flutter]] testing showed that the wings suffered oscillation under certain conditions. This difficulty was partly solved by reducing the stiffness of some wing components. However, a particularly severe high-speed flutter problem was solved only by inserting [[depleted uranium]] counterweights as ballast in the outboard engine [[nacelle]]s of the early 747s.&lt;ref name=Irving_p428&gt;Irving 1994, p. 428.&lt;/ref&gt; This measure caused anxiety when these aircraft crashed, for example [[El Al Flight 1862]] at [[Amsterdam]] in 1992 with {{convert|282|kg|lb}} of uranium in the [[tailplane]] (horizontal stabilizer).&lt;ref&gt;Uijt de Haag, P.A. et al.

The [[flight test]] program was hampered by problems with the 747's JT9D engines.

The huge cost of developing the 747 and building the Everett factory meant that Boeing had to borrow heavily from a banking syndicate. During the final months before delivery of the first aircraft, the company had to repeatedly request additional funding to complete the project.

==Variants==
The 747-100 was the original variant launched in 1966. The 747-200 soon followed, with its launch in 1968. The 747-300 was launched in 1980 and was followed by the 747-400 in 1985. Ultimately, the 747-8 was announced in 2005. Several versions of each variant have been produced, and many of the early variants were in production simultaneously. The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) classifies variants using a shortened code formed by combining the model number and the variant designator (e.g. &quot;B741&quot; for all -100 models).&lt;ref name=ICAOcode&gt;[http://www.icao.int/publications/DOC8643/Pages/Search.aspx &quot;ICAO Document 8643&quot;].

====747SR====
Responding to requests from Japanese airlines for a high-capacity aircraft to serve domestic routes between major cities, Boeing developed the 747SR as a short-range version of the 747-100 with lower fuel capacity and greater payload capability. With increased economy class seating, up to 498 passengers could be carried in early versions and up to 550 in later models.&lt;ref name=Boe_747_classics/&gt; The 747SR had an economic design life objective of 52,000 flights during 20 years of operation, compared to 24,600 flights in 20 years for the standard 747.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 2000, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The initial 747SR model, the -100SR, had a strengthened body structure and landing gear to accommodate the added stress accumulated from a greater number of takeoffs and landings.&lt;ref&gt;Kane [https://books.google.com/books?id=nCFYdB2H05UC&amp;pg=PA534&amp;dq=747sr 2004, p. 534.]&lt;/ref&gt; Extra structural support was built into the wings, fuselage, and the landing gear along with a 20% reduction in fuel capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Itabashi et al. 1995, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the 747SP stemmed from a joint request between Pan American World Airways and [[Iran Air]], who were looking for a high-capacity airliner with enough range to cover Pan Am's New York–Middle Eastern routes and Iran Air's planned Tehran–New York route.

While the 747-100 powered by [[Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-3A]] engines offered enough payload and range for medium-haul operations, it was marginal for long-haul route sectors.

===Undeveloped variants===
Boeing has studied a number of 747 variants that have not gone beyond the concept stage.

====747 trijet====
During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Boeing studied the development of a shorter 747 with [[trijet|three engines]], to compete with the smaller [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar]] and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]]. The center engine would have been fitted in the tail with an [[S-duct]] intake similar to the L-1011's. Overall, the 747 trijet would have had more payload, range, and passenger capacity than both of them. However, engineering studies showed that a major redesign of the 747 wing would be necessary. Maintaining the same 747 handling characteristics would be important to minimize pilot retraining. Boeing decided instead to pursue a shortened four-engine 747, resulting in the 747SP.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 2000, pp. 69–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

====747-500====
In January 1986, Boeing outlined preliminary studies to build a larger, ultra-long haul version named the 747-500, which would enter service in the mid- to late-1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;BiggerJumbos&quot;&gt;{{cite newspaper |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=January 15, 1986 |page=1 |number=29829 |given=Chris |surname=Sherwell |location=Singapore |title=Boeing plans propfan engines for bigger jumbos in 1990s |format=PDF |url=https://archive.org/stream/FinancialTimes1986UKEnglish/Jan%2015%201986%2C%20Financial%20Times%2C%20%2329829%2C%20UK%20%28en%29#page/n0/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; The derivative would use more efficient unducted fan (UDF) engines ([[propfan]]s) made by General Electric, be stretched (including the upper deck section) to a capacity of 500 seats, have a new wing to reduce drag, cruise at a faster speed to reduce flight times, and have a range of at least {{convert|10000|mi|nmi km|abbr=on|order=out}}, which would allow airlines to fly nonstop between [[London, England]] and [[Sydney, Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LondonSydney&quot;&gt;{{cite newspaper |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=January 20, 1986 |page=5 |number=29833 |given=Michael |surname=Donne |title=Fly London to Sydney...non-stop |url=https://archive.org/stream/FinancialTimes1986UKEnglish/Jan%2020%201986,%20Financial%20Times,%20%2329833,%20UK%20(en)#page/n4/mode/1up |format=PDF |department=Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====747 ASB====
Boeing announced the 747 ASB (''Advanced Short Body'') in 1986 as a response to the [[Airbus A340]] and the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]]. This aircraft design would have combined the advanced technology used on the [[Boeing 747-400|747-400]] with the foreshortened 747SP fuselage. The aircraft was to carry 295 passengers a range of {{convert|8000|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Boeing offers 747ASB|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1986/1986%20-%201260.PDF |work=Flight International |date=June 7, 1986 |accessdate=October 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, airlines were not interested in the project and it was canceled in 1988 in favor of the [[Boeing 777|777]].

The 747-500X concept featured an increased fuselage length of 18&amp;nbsp;ft (5.5&amp;nbsp;m) to 250&amp;nbsp;ft (76.2&amp;nbsp;m) long, and the aircraft was to carry 462 passengers over a range up to 8,700&amp;nbsp;nautical miles (10,000&amp;nbsp;mi, 16,100&amp;nbsp;km), with a gross weight of over 1.0&amp;nbsp;[[Mega-|Mlb]] (450&amp;nbsp;tonnes).&lt;ref name=faa_nla/&gt; The 747-600X concept featured a greater stretch to 279&amp;nbsp;ft (85&amp;nbsp;m) with seating for 548 passengers, a range of up to 7,700&amp;nbsp;nmi (8,900&amp;nbsp;mi, 14,300&amp;nbsp;km), and a gross weight of 1.2&amp;nbsp;Mlb (540&amp;nbsp;tonnes).&lt;ref name=faa_nla/&gt; A third study concept, the 747-700X, would have combined the wing of the 747-600X with a widened fuselage, allowing it to carry 650 passengers over the same range as a 747-400.&lt;ref name=boe_1996/&gt; The cost of the changes from previous 747 models, in particular the new wing for the 747-500X and -600X, was estimated to be more than US$5&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=boe_1996/&gt; Boeing was not able to attract enough interest to launch the aircraft.&lt;ref name=FI_500X/&gt;

====747X and 747X Stretch====
As Airbus progressed with its [[Airbus A380|A3XX]] study, Boeing offered a 747 derivative as an alternative in 2000; a more modest proposal than the previous -500X and -600X that retained the 747's overall wing design and add a segment at the root, increasing the span to {{convert|229|ft|m|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=boe_747X&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000302203732/http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2000/news_release_000121a.html &quot;Boeing 747 Celebrates 30 Years In Service.&quot;] ''The Boeing Company'', September 2, 1996.

[[File:Qantas Boeing 747-438ER VH-OEI at LAX.jpg|thumb|The 747-400ER was derived from the 747-400X study.|alt=Side view of quadjet in flight.]]
Like its predecessor, the 747X family was unable to garner enough interest to justify production, and it was shelved along with the 767-400ERX in March 2001, when Boeing announced the [[Boeing Sonic Cruiser|Sonic Cruiser]] concept.&lt;ref name=shelv_747X/&gt; Though the 747X design was less costly than the 747-500X and -600X, it was criticized for not offering a sufficient advance from the existing 747-400. The 747X did not make it beyond the drawing board, but the 747-400X being developed concurrently moved into production to become the [[Boeing 747-400ER|747-400ER]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2000/news_release_001128c.html |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090706141448/http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2000/news_release_001128c.html |archivedate=July 6, 2009 |title=Boeing Launches New, Longer-Range 747-400|publisher=The Boeing Company |url-status=dead |accessdate=December 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====747-400XQLR====
After the end of the 747X program, Boeing continued to study improvements that could be made to the 747. The 747-400XQLR (Quiet Long Range) was meant to have an increased range of 7,980&amp;nbsp;nmi (9,200&amp;nbsp;mi, 14,800&amp;nbsp;km), with improvements to boost efficiency and reduce noise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boe_747-400XQLR&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020306000939/http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2002/q1/nr_020225h.html &quot;Boeing Offers New 747-400X Quiet Longer Range Jetliner.&quot;] ''The Boeing Company'', February 26, 2002.

==Operators==
{{main|List of Boeing 747 operators}}

{{as of|2018|July|}}, 462 Boeing 747s are in airline service, with [[British Airways]] being the largest operator with 36 747-400s.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

The last US passenger Boeing 747 was retired from [[Delta Air Lines]] in December 2017, after it flew for every American [[major carrier]] since its 1970 introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-us-747s-fly-into-the-sunset-441290/ |title= US 747s fly into the sunset |date= October 12, 2017 |author= Edward Russell |work= Flightglobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Delta flew three of its last four aircraft on a farewell tour, from Seattle to Atlanta on December 19 then to Los Angeles and Minneapolis/St Paul on December 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-us-747s-bow-out-with-final-delta-flight-444250/ |title= US 747s bow out with final Delta flight |date= December 19, 2017 |author= Edward Russell |work= Flightglobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] forecast an increase in [[air freight]] from 4% to 5% in 2018 fuelled by booming trade for time-sensitive goods, from [[smartphone]]s to [[Cut flowers|fresh flowers]], demand for freighters is strong while passenger 747s are phased out.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Bloomberg16may2018&gt;--&gt;
Of the 1,544 produced, 890 are retired; {{as of|2018|lc=y}}, a small subset of those which were intended to be parted-out get $3 million [[D-check]]s before flying again.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Bloomberg16may2018&gt;--&gt;
Young -400s are sold for 320 million yuan ($50 million) and Boeing stopped converting [[Cargo aircraft|freighters]], which used to cost nearly $30 million.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Bloomberg16may2018&gt;--&gt;
This comeback helped the airframer financing arm [[Boeing Capital]] to shrink its exposure to the 747-8 from $1.07 billion in 2017 to $481 million.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg16may2018&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-16/boeing-747s-given-up-for-dead-find-new-life-in-air-cargo-surge |title= Boeing 747s Are Back From the Dead |agency= Bloomberg |author= Julie Johnsson |date= May 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accidents and incidents==
{{main|Boeing 747 hull losses}}

As of February 2019, the 747 has been involved in 162 [[aviation accidents and incidents]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://aviation-safety.net/database/dblist.php?Type=104 |title= Boeing 747 occurrences |publisher= Flight Safety Foundation |date= August 30, 2017 |accessdate= August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 63 accidents and [[hull loss]]es&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://aviation-safety.net/database/dblist.php?field=typecode&amp;var=104%&amp;cat=%1&amp;sorteer=datekey&amp;page=1 |title= Boeing 747 hull-loss occurrences |publisher= Flight Safety Foundation |date= August 29, 2017 |accessdate= August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in {{#expr:2865+857+24}} fatalities.&lt;ref name=ASNstats/&gt;  The last crash was [[Turkish Airlines Flight 6491]] in January 2017.&lt;ref name=ASNstats&gt;{{cite web |url= http://aviation-safety.net/database/type/type-stat.php?type=104 |title= Boeing 747 Statistics |publisher= Flight Safety Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several hijackings of Boeing 747s, such as [[Pan Am Flight 73]] where a Boeing 747-121 was hijacked by four terrorists and resulted in 20 deaths.&lt;ref name=ASN_Pan_Am&gt;{{cite web |url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19860905-0 |title=ASN Aircraft accident Boeing 747-121 N656PA Karachi-Quaid-E-Azam International Airport |publisher=Aviation-safety.net |date= August 30, 2017 |accessdate= August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Few crashes have been attributed to design flaws of the 747. The [[Tenerife airport disaster]] resulted from pilot error and communications failure, while the [[Japan Airlines Flight 123]] and [[China Airlines Flight 611]] crashes stemmed from improper aircraft repair. [[United Airlines Flight 811]], which suffered an [[uncontrolled decompression|explosive decompression]] mid-flight on February 24, 1989, led the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) to issue a recommendation that the Boeing 747-100 and 747-200 cargo doors similar to those on the Flight 811 aircraft be modified to those featured on the Boeing 747-400. [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]] was shot down by a Soviet fighter aircraft in 1983 after it had strayed into Soviet territory, causing U.S. President Ronald Reagan to authorize the then-strictly military [[global positioning system]] (GPS) for civilian use.&lt;ref name=KAL007&gt;[http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/article/2006/02/20060203125928lcnirellep0.5061609.html#axzz3z8AmijAm &quot;United States Updates Global Positioning System Technology.&quot;] ''america.gov,'' February 3, 2006. Retrieved: January 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accidents due to design deficiencies included [[TWA Flight 800]], where a 747-100 exploded in mid-air on July 17, 1996, probably due to sparking electricity wires inside the fuel tank;&lt;ref name=TWA_800_final&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=NTSB/Aar-00/03 |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |date=August 23, 2000 |accessdate=June 24, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615201201/http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |archivedate=June 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this finding led the FAA to propose a rule requiring installation of an [[inerting system]] in the center fuel tank of most large aircraft that was adopted in July 2008, after years of research into solutions.  At the time, the new safety system was expected to cost US$100,000 to $450,000 per aircraft and weigh approximately {{convert|200|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121621918865158639 &quot;Airlines Ordered to Cut Fuel-Tank Explosion Risk.&quot;] ''Wall Street Journal'', July 17, 2008, p.

Note: Cargo aircraft and smaller regional jets and commuter aircraft are not subject to this rule.&lt;/ref&gt; [[El Al Flight 1862]] crashed after the fuse pins for an engine broke off shortly after take-off due to metal fatigue. Instead of dropping away from the wing, the engine knocked off the adjacent engine and damaged the wing.&lt;ref name=ASN_Bijlmer&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19921004-2 |title=ASN Aircraft accident Boeing 747-258F 4X-AXG Amsterdam |publisher=Aviation-safety.net |date= |accessdate=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As increasing numbers of &quot;classic&quot; 747-100 and 747-200 series aircraft have been retired, some have found their way into museums or other uses. In recent years, some older 747-300s and 747-400s have also found their way into museums as well.

Upon its retirement from service, the 747 number two in the production line was dismantled and shipped to Hopyeong, [[Namyangju]], [[Gyeonggi-do]], South Korea where it was re-assembled, repainted in a livery similar to that of [[Air Force One]] and converted into a restaurant.
