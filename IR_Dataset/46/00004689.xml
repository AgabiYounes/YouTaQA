'''Balsall Heath''' is a working class, [[inner-city]] area of [[Birmingham]], West Midlands, England. It has a diverse cultural mix of people and is the location of the [[Balti Triangle]].

==History==

Balsall Heath was agricultural land between [[Moseley]] village and the city of Birmingham until the 1850s when expansion along Moseley Road joined the two. The area was originally part of the [[Worcestershire]] parish of [[King's Norton]], and was added to the [[county borough]] of Birmingham in [[Warwickshire]] on 1 October 1891.

During negotiations in the previous year it had been promised a public baths and a free library. In 1895, the library was opened on Moseley Road and, in 1907, [[Public Library and Baths, Balsall Heath|Balsall Heath Baths]] were opened in an adjoining building.  

In 1900, the city's [[College of Art, Balsall Heath|College of Art]] was also opened on Moseley Road. By this time the small lake (&quot;Lady Pool&quot; on old maps) at the end of Ladypool Road had been filled in to create a park. 

Balsall Heath initially had a reasonably affluent population, which can still be seen in the dilapidated grandeur of some of the larger houses. A railway station on Brighton Road (on the Birmingham to [[Bristol]] line) led to further expansion, and the end of the 19th century saw a proliferation of high-density small [[terraced house]]s.

A [[Muslim]] community was started in June 1940 when two [[Yemen]]is purchased an artisan cottage on Mary Street. With the mosque being located in the area, more Muslim immigrants began to move into private lodgings in Balsall Heath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Abner Cohen|title=Urban Ethnicity|pages=96|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-32982-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Balsall Heath has one of the largest Muslim communities in Birmingham. It is also home to diverse communities from across the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].

By the 1980s, many of Balsall Heath's houses were in a dilapidated condition; some still lacked bathrooms or indoor toilets. The local council considered demolishing these properties but chose to refurbish them as part of an [[urban renewal]] scheme. Most of these Victorian terraces still exist and, along with more modern [[social housing]], characterise the area today. The area's traditional 'brick' pavements were replaced at this time by the more modern and conventional paving slabs.  

Balsall Heath's low rents also attracted a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] student population. Its proximity to the [[University of Birmingham]], the city centre and the &quot;trendy&quot; area of [[Moseley]] were all contributing factors. There was little conflict between the students and locals despite their vastly differing lifestyles. However, a knife-incident in 1991 led to an article in ''[[Redbrick (Newspaper)|Redbrick]]'' warning students not to live in the area.

In July 2005, Balsall Heath was hit by a [[Birmingham Tornado (UK)|tornado]], which devastated many buildings around Church Road and Ladypool Road. Birmingham City Council offered loans to those who would otherwise be unable to repair their properties, and the area has now made a full recovery.

===Red light era===
[[Street prostitution]] first appeared in Balsall Heath during the 1950s. Property values fell, attracting Birmingham's poorer migrants. By the 1970s, the area was notorious for [[robbery|street robberies]] and [[drug dealing]]. Cheddar Road was the centre of a red-light district worked by 450 women. About half of the 50 houses on this road had prostitutes advertising themselves in the windows, similar to [[De Wallen|Amsterdam]]. It was labelled Britain's busiest cul-de-sac.&lt;ref name=Sky&gt;{{cite web |author=David Crabtree |title=Big Society Alive and Kicking in Inner City |url=http://news.sky.com/home/uk-news/article/15929966 |work=Sky News |publisher= |date=14 February 2011 |accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period of the area's history is depicted in the 1980 film ''[[Prostitute (1980 film)|Prostitute]]''.

In 1986, an organisation called ANAWIM was formed by the [[Sisters of Charity]] to provide outreach support to the prostitutes.&lt;ref name=bh308&gt;{{Cite news |title=ANAWIM Celebrates Silver Jubilee | newspaper=The Balsall Heathan | number= 308| date=November 2011| publisher=St. Paul's Community Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In September 1992, a report was published encouraging the formation of a zone of tolerance towards prostitution in Balsall Heath. This was opposed by residents and a local police inspector. In the following year Samo Paull, a woman working as a prostitute, was abducted from Balsall Heath and murdered. 

In 1994, residents began to organise street patrols forcing the prostitutes and street criminals out of the area. These patrols had the qualified support of the police but were regarded as [[vigilante]]s by some. There was an immediate two-thirds reduction in street and [[window prostitution]].&lt;ref name=Sky/&gt; By November 1995, they had been almost completely eliminated.

The area has enjoyed a slow revival. House prices are now similar to those in other inner-city areas, while the crime rate is among the lowest.

&lt;!--This page appears to have been written by middle-class lefties, the houses (slums) were knocked down long after crime rates rocketed. Anyway, it still backs-up what I wrote about street crime and prostitution--&gt;
