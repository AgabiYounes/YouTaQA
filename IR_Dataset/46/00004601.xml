'''Björn Rune Borg''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈbjœːɳ ˈbɔrj|-|sv-Björn Borg.ogg}}; born 6 June 1956) is a [[Swedes|Swedish]] former [[List of ATP number 1 ranked singles players|world No. 1]] [[tennis player]] widely considered to be one of the greatest players in the history of the sport.&lt;ref&gt;''Tennis'' magazine ranked Borg the [[Tennis (magazine)#&quot;The 40 Greatest Players of the TENNIS Era&quot; (2005)|second best male player]] of the period 1965–2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bjorn Borg - Top 10 Men's Tennis Players of All Time |work=Sports Illustrated |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/1009/top.ten.tennis/content.6.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918225840/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/1009/top.ten.tennis/content.6.html |archivedate=18 September 2010 |accessdate=2017-06-10 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pears&gt;{{cite news |author=Pears, Tim |title=When he was king |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/jun/05/tennis.features1 |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=5 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1974 and 1981 he became the first man in the [[Open Era]] to win 11 [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles titles (six at the [[French Open]] and five consecutive at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]]), although he was never able to win the US Open in four finals appearances. He also won three [[Open Era tennis records – men's singles#Year-end championships|year-end championships]] and 16 [[Grand Prix Super Series]] titles. Overall, he set [[Björn Borg#Records|numerous records]] that still stand. Borg was the first player to win six French Open singles titles.

A teenage sensation at the start of his career, Borg's unprecedented stardom and consistent success helped propel the rising popularity of tennis during the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/2006-05-24-borg-cover_x.htm |title=Borg still making the shots |author=Douglas Robson |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=25 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the professional tour became more lucrative, and in 1979 he was the first player to earn more than one million dollars in prize money in a single season. He also made millions in endorsements throughout his career. However, the constant attention and pressure eventually caused [[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]] and his retirement at the age of 26.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeoPLzGt7Ig ''Champions: Bjorn Borg''], a 1983 documentary covering the end of Borg's career&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Björn Borg was born in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, on 6 June 1956, as the only child of Rune (1932-2008) and Margaretha Borg (b. 1934).&lt;ref name=pears /&gt; He grew up in nearby [[Södertälje]]. As a child, Borg became fascinated with a golden tennis racket that his father won at a [[table-tennis]] tournament. His father gave him the racket, beginning his tennis career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/sports/2011/07/14/oc.bjorn.borg.greatest.cnn?&amp;hpt=hp_c2 |work=CNN |title=CNN.com Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A player of great athleticism and endurance, he had a distinctive style and appearance—[[bowlegged]] and very fast. His muscularity allowed him to put heavy topspin on both his forehand and two-handed backhand. He followed [[Jimmy Connors]] in using the two-handed backhand. By the time he was 13 he was beating the best of Sweden's under-18 players, and Davis Cup captain [[Lennart Bergelin]] (who served as Borg's primary coach throughout his professional career) cautioned against anyone trying to change Borg's rough-looking, jerky strokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dn.se/sport/bjorn-borg-ar-bast-av-dem-alla/ |title=Björn Borg är bäst av dem alla |work=DN.SE |accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1972/73 – Davis Cup debut and first year on the tour===
At the age of 15 Borg represented Sweden in the 1972 [[Davis Cup]] and won his debut singles rubber in five sets against veteran [[Onny Parun]] of [[New Zealand]]. Later that year, he won the Wimbledon junior singles title, recovering from a 5–2 deficit in the final set to overcome Britain's [[Buster Mottram]]. Then in December he won the [[Dunlop Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl Junior Championship]] for boys 18 and under after a straight-sets victory in the final over [[Vitas Gerulaitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Sam Pollak |title=Californian tires at end, loses to Sweden's Borg |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WdVWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gkINAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3638%2C2824328 |work=The Miami News |date=28 December 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Jim Martz |title=Orange Bowl Celebrates 60th Anniversary |url=http://www.usta.com/Archive/News/Juniors/Junior/383333_Orange_Bowl_Celebrates_60th_Anniversary/ |website=www.usta.com |publisher=USTA |date=25 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borg joined the professional circuit in 1973, and reached his first singles final in April at the [[1973 Monte Carlo Open|Monte Carlo Open]] which he lost to [[Ilie Năstase]].&lt;ref name=wot74&gt;{{cite book|title=World of Tennis '74|year=1974|publisher=Queen Anne Press|location=London|isbn=9780362001686|pages=330, 331|editor=[[John Barrett (tennis)|John Barrett]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was unseeded at his first [[1973 French Open|French Open]] and reached the fourth round where he lost in four sets to eight-seeded [[Adriano Panatta]]. Borg was seeded sixth at his first [[1973 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon Championships]], in large part due to a [[1973 Wimbledon Championships#ATP boycott|boycott by the ATP]], and reached the quarterfinal where he was defeated in a five-set match by [[Roger Taylor (tennis)|Roger Taylor]].&lt;ref name=wot1974&gt;{{cite book|title=World of Tennis '74|year=1974|publisher=Queen Anne|location=London|isbn=978-0362001686|pages=15–17, 30–32, 45–47|editor=[[John Barrett (tennis)|John Barrett]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of 1973 he was runner-up in [[1973 Pacific Coast Open|San Francisco]], [[1973 Stockholm Open|Stockholm]] and [[1973 South American Open (tennis)|Buenos Aires]] and finished the year ranked No. 18.&lt;ref name=wot74/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ATP Singles Ranking|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/rankings/singles?rankDate=1973-12-14&amp;rankRange=0-100|website=[[Association of Tennis Professionals]] (ATP)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1974 – First French Open title===
[[File:Bjorn borg el grafico.jpg|thumb|250px|Borg in 1974]]
Borg made his only appearance at the Australian Open, at the age of 17, and reached the third round where he lost in straight sets to eventual finalist [[Phil Dent]]. In January he won his first career singles title at the [[1974 New Zealand Open|New Zealand Open]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sports Whirl|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NA5OAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9K0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6488%2C1746137|work=[[The Virgin Islands Daily News]]|agency=[[Associated Press|AP]]|date=17 January 1974|page=23|via=[[Google News Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by titles in [[1974 Rothmans International Tennis Tournament|London]] and [[São Paulo WCT|São Paulo]] in February and March respectively. Just before his 18th birthday in June [[1974 French Open – Men's Singles|1974]], Borg won his first top-level singles title at the [[Rome Masters|Italian Open]], defeating defending champion and top-seeded [[Ilie Năstase]] in the final and becoming its youngest winner.&lt;ref name=wot75&gt;{{cite book|title=World of Tennis '75: a BP and Commercial Union yearbook|year=1975|publisher=Queen Anne Press|location=London|isbn=9780362002171|pages=75–78|editor=[[John Barrett (tennis)|John Barrett]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Borg Surprises Nastase for Title|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=R2gtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OIkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1466%2C772517|newspaper=Schenectady Gazette|date=4 June 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sept&gt;{{cite news|title=Tireless Borg halts Nastase for crown|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2vdRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=R3MDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2263%2C3252675|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=4 June 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later he won the singles title at the [[French Open]], his first [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournament title, defeating [[Manuel Orantes]] in the final in five sets. Barely 18, Borg was the youngest-ever male French Open champion up to that point.

===1975 – Retained French Open title===
In early 1975, Borg defeated [[Rod Laver]], then 36 years old, in a semifinal of the [[World Championship Tennis]] (WCT) finals in [[Dallas]], Texas, in five sets. Borg subsequently lost to [[Arthur Ashe]] in the final.
Borg retained his French Open title in [[1975 French Open – Men's Singles|1975]], beating [[Guillermo Vilas]] in the final in straight sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110642392 |title=Borg's second French win |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=49 |issue=14,094 |date=17 June 1975 |page=13 |via=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borg then reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals, where he lost to eventual champion Ashe. Borg did not lose another match at Wimbledon until 1981. Borg won two singles and one doubles rubber in the 1975 Davis Cup final, as Sweden beat [[Czechoslovakia]] 3–2. With these singles wins, Borg had won 19 consecutive Davis Cup singles rubbers since 1973. That was already a record at the time. However, Borg never lost another Davis Cup singles rubber, and, by the end of his career, he had stretched that winning streak to 33.&lt;ref name=Daviscup&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.daviscup.com/en/news/224439.aspx |date=3 Mar 2016 |title=Davis Cup - Baghdatis breaks Borg's record in Europe Zone Group III }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1976 – First Wimbledon title===
In early 1976, Borg won the [[World Championship Tennis]] year-end [[WCT Finals]] in [[Dallas]], Texas, with a four-set victory over [[Guillermo Vilas]] in the final. At the 1976 French Open, Borg lost to the Italian [[Adriano Panatta]], who remains the only player to defeat Borg at this tournament. Panatta did it twice: in the fourth round in 1973, and in the 1976 quarterfinals. Borg won Wimbledon in [[1976 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|1976]] without losing a set, defeating the favored [[Ilie Năstase]] in the final. Borg became the youngest male Wimbledon champion of the modern era at 20 years and 1 month (a record subsequently broken by [[Boris Becker]], who won Wimbledon aged 17 in 1985). It would be the last time Borg played Wimbledon as an underdog. Năstase later exclaimed, &quot;We're playing tennis, he's [Borg] playing something else.&quot; Borg also reached the final of the [[1976 US Open – Men's Singles|1976]] U.S. Open, which was then being played on clay courts. Borg lost in four sets to world no. 1 [[Jimmy Connors]].

===1977 – Second Wimbledon title and world No.1 ranking===
In February 1977 [[World Championship Tennis]] (WCT) sued Borg and his management company [[IMG (company)|IMG]] claiming that Borg had committed a breach of contract by electing to participate in the competing [[1977 Grand Prix (tennis)|1977 Grand Prix circuit]] instead of the [[1977 World Championship Tennis circuit|WCT circuit]]. Borg eventually played, and won, a single WCT event, the Monte Carlo WCT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=W.C.T. Sues Borg and Colgate, Alleging a Breach of Contract|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50C11FB3B5F167493C7A91789D85F438785F9|newspaper=The New York Times|date=4 February 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Borg Being Sued|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=r4UwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iNwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5540%2C2449736|newspaper=Ludington Daily News|date=2 February 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; An out-of-court settlement was reached whereby Borg committed to play six or eight WCT events in 1978 which were then part of the [[1978 Grand Prix (tennis)|Grand Prix circuit]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author1=Barry Lorge|title=Peace Still Eludes Men's Pro Tennis|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1978/04/13/peace-still-eludes-mens-pro-tennis/18fc28e9-9f90-4c99-ba46-d453146cd609/|website=[[The Washington Post]]|date=13 April 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borg skipped the French Open in 1977 because he was under contract with [[World Team Tennis|WTT]], but he repeated his Wimbledon triumph, although this time he was pushed much harder. He defeated his good friend [[Vitas Gerulaitis]] in a semifinal in five sets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/wimbledon_history/3742097.stm &quot;Classic Matches: Borg v Gerulaitis&quot;], [[BBC Sport]], 31 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1977 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|1977]] final Borg was pushed to five sets for the third time in the tournament, this time by Connors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110853131 |title=Bjorn Borg wins thrilling final |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=51 |issue=14,819  |date=4 July 1977 |page=14 |via=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The win propelled Borg to the No. 1 ranking in the ATP point system, albeit for just one week in August. Prior to the 1977 US Open, Borg aggravated a shoulder injury while waterskiing with Vitas Gerulaitis. This injury ultimately forced him to retire from the Open during a Round of 16 match vs Dick Stockton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Head 2 Head: Dick Stockton vs Bjorn Borg|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/players/fedex-head-2-head/dick-stockton-vs-bjorn-borg/S090/B058|website=ATP World Tour|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of tennis authorities considered Borg to be the No. 1 player in the world for 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Tennis Magazine US ranking&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtonpost1978&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;imgur1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google1978&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google2&quot;/&gt; Through 1977, he had never lost to a player younger than himself.

===1978 – French and Wimbledon titles===
Borg was at the height of his career from 1978 through 1980, completing the French Open-Wimbledon double all three years. In [[1978 French Open – Men's Singles|1978]], Borg won the French Open with a win over Vilas in the final. Borg did not drop a set during the tournament, a feat only he, Năstase (in 1973), and [[Rafael Nadal]] (in 2008, 2010 and 2017) have accomplished at the French Open during the open era. Borg defeated Connors in straight sets in the [[1978 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|1978]] Wimbledon final. At the [[1978 US Open – Men's Singles|1978]] US Open, now held on hard courts in Flushing Meadow, New York, he lost the final in straight sets to Connors. Borg was suffering from a bad blister on his thumb that required pre-match injections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1978/09/11/page/85/article/hot-connors-blisters-borg-for-open-title |title=Hot Connors blisters Borg |date=September 11, 1978 |work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; That autumn, Borg faced [[John McEnroe]] for the first time in a semifinal of the Stockholm Open, and lost. Borg was considered the No. 1 male tennis player in the world for 1978 by most tennis authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;atptour1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;imgur1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;itftennis1&quot;/&gt;

===1979 – French and Wimbledon titles and year-end No.1 ranking===
[[File:Björn Borg in aktie, Bestanddeelnr 930-2092.jpg|thumb|250px|Björn Borg playing a double-handed backhand shot at the [[1979 ABN World Tennis Tournament]]]]
Borg lost to McEnroe again in four sets in the final of the 1979 WCT Finals but was now overtaking Connors for the top ranking. Borg established himself firmly in the top spot with his fourth French Open singles title and fourth straight Wimbledon singles title, defeating Connors in a straight-set semifinal at the latter tournament. At the [[1979 French Open – Men's Singles|1979]] French Open, Borg defeated big-serving [[Victor Pecci]] in a four-set final, and in the [[1979 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|1979]] Wimbledon final Borg came from behind to overcome an even bigger server, [[Roscoe Tanner]]. Borg was upset by Tanner at the US Open, in a four-set quarterfinal played under the lights. At the season-ending [[Tennis Masters Cup|Masters]] tournament in January 1980, Borg survived a close semifinal against McEnroe. He then beat Gerulaitis in straight sets, winning his first Masters and first title in New York. Borg finished the year at No. 1 in the ATP Point rankings and was considered the No. 1 player in the world by most authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;atptour1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;imgur1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;itftennis1&quot;/&gt;

===1980 – Fifth consecutive Wimbledon title===
In June [[1980 French Open – Men's Singles|1980]] he overcame Gerulaitis, again in straight sets, for his fifth French Open title. Again, he did not drop a set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110961595 |title=Borg wins French Open |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=54 |issue=16,329 |date=10 June 1980 |page=24 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borg won his fifth consecutive Wimbledon singles title, the [[1980 Wimbledon Men's Singles final]], by defeating McEnroe in a five-set match, often cited as the best Wimbledon final ever played – the only comparable match being the [[2008 Wimbledon Championships – Men's singles final|2008 Federer – Nadal final]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aftonbladet.se1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwwc.aftonbladet.se/arhundradets/dagar/990705.html |title=Aftonbladet sport: Århundradets Sport |publisher= |accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sverigesradio&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/gruppsida.aspx?programid=3913&amp;grupp=20314&amp;artikel=3946915 |title=Klassiska referat: Tennis |author=Sveriges Radio |publisher= |accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having lost the opening set to an all-out McEnroe assault, Borg took the next two  and had two championship points at 5–4 in the fourth. However, McEnroe averted disaster and went on to level the match in Wimbledon's most memorable 34-point tiebreaker, which he won 18–16. In the fourth-set tiebreak, McEnroe saved five match points, and Borg six set points, before McEnroe won the set.&lt;ref name=&quot;sverigesradio&quot; /&gt; Björn served first to begin the 5th set and fell behind 15–40. Borg then won 19 straight points on serve in the deciding set and prevailed after 3 hours, 53 minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;aftonbladet.se1&quot; /&gt; Borg himself commented years later that this was the first time that he was afraid that he would lose, as well as feeling that it was the beginning of the end of his dominance.&lt;ref name=&quot;sverigesradio&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer 2007-01-07&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Tim |last=Adams |title='I can't explain except to say I wanted to play again. It was madness' |date=7 January 2007 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jan/07/tennis.features2 |work=The Observer |accessdate=7 July 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, [[1980 US Open – Men's Singles|1980]] Borg reached the final of the U.S. Open for the third time, losing to John McEnroe in five sets in a match that cemented what had become the greatest contemporary rivalry, albeit short-lived, in men's tennis.

He defeated McEnroe in the final of the 1980 Stockholm Open, and faced him one more time that year, in the round-robin portion of the year-end Masters, actually played in January 1981. With 19,103 fans in attendance, Borg won a deciding third-set tie-break for the second year in a row. Borg then defeated [[Ivan Lendl]] for his second Masters title.&lt;ref name=&quot;sverigesradio&quot; /&gt; Borg again finished the year at No. 1 in the ATP Point Rankings and was considered the No. 1 player in the world by most tennis authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;atptour1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;imgur1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;itftennis1&quot;/&gt;

===1981 – Sixth and final French Open title===
Borg won his last Grand Slam title at the French Open in [[1981 French Open – Men's Singles|1981]], defeating Lendl in a five-set final. Borg's six French Open Grand Slam titles was a record bettered only by [[Rafael Nadal]] in 2012.

In reaching the Wimbledon final in [[1981 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|1981]], Borg stretched his winning streak at the [[All England Club]] to a record 41 matches. In a semifinal, Borg was down to Connors by two sets to love, before coming back to win the match. However, Borg's streak was brought to an end by McEnroe, who defeated him in four sets. Years afterward, Borg remarked &quot;And when I lost what shocked me was I wasn't even upset. That was not me: losing a Wimbledon final and not upset. I hate to lose.&quot; Borg around that time felt that his desire to play was gone, despite McEnroe's desperate efforts to persuade him not to retire and continue their rivalry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer 2007-01-07&quot;/&gt;

Borg went on to lose to McEnroe at the [[1981 US Open – Men's Singles|1981]] US Open. After that defeat, Borg walked off the court and out of the stadium before the ceremonies and press conference had begun, and headed straight for the airport.&lt;ref name=&quot;sverigesradio&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer 2007-01-07&quot; /&gt; There are reports that Borg received threats after his semifinal win over Connors. In later years, Borg apologized to McEnroe. The 1981 US Open would be the Swede's last Grand Slam final. Major tournaments and tour organizers were enforcing a new rule; by 1982, that players had to play at least 10 official tournaments per year. However, Borg wanted to curtail his schedule after many years of winning so often. Although he felt in good condition physically, he recognized that the relentless drive to win and defy tour organizers had begun to fade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer 2007-01-07&quot;/&gt;

Borg failed to win the US Open in nine tries, losing four finals, [[1976 US Open – Men's Singles|1976]] (the surface was clay that year) and [[1978 US Open – Men's Singles|1978]] to [[Jimmy Connors]], and [[1980 US Open – Men's Singles|1980]] and [[1981 US Open – Men's Singles|1981]] to John McEnroe.  The surface was hard court from 1978 onward and Borg reached the final there on hard court on three occasions, in 1978, 1980 and 1981. He led 3–2 in the fifth set of the 1980 final, before losing. That match followed Borg's classic encounter with McEnroe at the 1980 Wimbledon. In 1978, 1979 and 1980, Borg was halfway to a Grand Slam after victories at the French and Wimbledon (the Australian Open being the last Grand Slam tournament of each year at the time) only to falter at Flushing Meadows, lefty Tanner his conqueror in 1979.

===1982–1984 - Retirement===
In 1982, Borg played only one tournament, losing to [[Yannick Noah]] in the quarterfinals of [[Monte Carlo Masters|Monte Carlo]] in April. Nevertheless, Borg's announcement in January 1983 that he was retiring from the game at the age of 26 was a shock to the tennis world. McEnroe tried unsuccessfully to persuade Borg to continue. He did, however, play Monte Carlo again in March 1983, reaching the second round, and Stuttgart in July 1984.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

===Retirement===
[[File:Björn Borg2.jpg|right|thumb|Borg in 1991]]
Upon retirement, Borg had three residences: a penthouse in Monte Carlo, not far from his [[pro shop]]; a mansion on Long Island, New York and a small island off the Swedish coast.

Borg later bounced back as the owner of the Björn Borg fashion label. In Sweden, his label has become very successful, second only to [[Calvin Klein]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer 2007-01-07&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bjornborg.com/en/ |title=Index of /en |publisher=Bjornborg.com |date=27 October 2010 |accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Failed comeback===
In 1991–1993, Borg attempted a comeback on the men's professional tennis tour, coached by  Welsh karate expert  Ron Thatcher. Before his 1991 return, Borg grew his hair out as it had been during his previous professional tennis career and he returned to using a wooden racket; he had kept his hair cut and used modern graphite rackets in exhibitions he played during the late 1980s. Borg, however, failed to win a single match. He faced [[Jordi Arrese]] in his first match back, again at Monte Carlo but without practising or playing any exhibition matches, and fell in two sets. In his first nine matches, played in 1991 and 1992, Borg failed to win a single set. He fared slightly better in 1993, taking a set off his opponent in each of the three matches he played. He came closest to getting a win in what turned out to be his final tour match, falling to [[Alexander Volkov (tennis)|Alexander Volkov]].

In 1992 Borg, aged 35, using a graphite racket, defeated [[John Lloyd (tennis)|John Lloyd]], 37, at the Inglewood Forum Tennis Challenge. Borg later joined the Champions tour, returning to shorter hair and using modern rackets.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

==Playing style==
Borg had one of the most distinctive playing styles in the Open Era.&lt;ref name=&quot;jonasarnesen&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.svd.se/borg-ser-tillbaka-pa-sin-tennisrevolution |title=Borg ser tillbaka på sin tennisrevolution |author=Jonas Arnesen |work=SvD.se |accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played from the baseline, with powerful ground-strokes. His highly unorthodox backhand involved taking his racket back with both hands but actually generating his power with his dominant right hand, letting go of the grip with his left hand around point of contact, and following through with his swing as a one-hander.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150703004013/http://www.slagproffset.se/Tennisboken/Analys%20av%20bra%20spelares%20teknik%20-%20del%20II/Servetekniken%20hos%20en%20rekordh%C3%A5llare.html Aanalys av bra spelares teknik – Slagproffset] Retrieved 2 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He hit the ball hard and high from the back of the court and brought it down with considerable [[topspin]], which made his ground strokes very consistent.&lt;ref name=bbc_legends&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/wimbledon_history/3742099.stm |title=Wimbledon legends: Bjorn Borg |accessdate=20 January 2009 |work=BBC Sport |date=31 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; There had been other players, particularly [[Rod Laver]] and [[Arthur Ashe]], who played with topspin on both the forehand and backhand, yet Laver and Ashe used topspin only as a way to mix up their shots to pass their opponents at the net easily. Borg was one of the first top players to use heavy topspin on his shots consistently.&lt;ref name=&quot;jonasarnesen&quot; /&gt;

Complementing his consistent ground-strokes was his fitness. Both of these factors allowed Borg to be dominant at the French Open.&lt;ref name=&quot;dn.se&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dn.se/sport/johan-esk-han-ar-solklar-etta-pa-150-listan/ |title=Johan Esk: Han är solklar etta på 150-listan |work=DN.SE |accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the factors that made Borg unique was his dominance on the grass courts of Wimbledon, where, since World War II, baseliners did not usually succeed. Some experts attributed his dominance on this surface to his consistency, an underrated serve, equally underrated volleys, and his adaptation to grass courts. Against the best players, he almost always served-and-volleyed on his first serves, while  he naturally played from the baseline after his second serves.&lt;ref name=&quot;dn.se&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aftonbladet.se&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/tennis/article19119729.ab |title=Största ögonblicket i idrottshistorien... |work=Aftonbladet |accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another trait usually associated with Borg was his grace under pressure. His calm court demeanor earned him the nickname of the &quot;Ice Man&quot; or &quot;Ice-Borg.&quot;&lt;ref name=UKTelegraph&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2007/10/25/stborg125.xml |title=Bjorn Borg: My life is perfect |accessdate=13 May 2008 |first=Mark |last=Hodgkinson |date=25 October 2007 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Borg's physical conditioning was unrivalled by contemporaries. He could outlast most of his opponents under the most grueling conditions. Contrary to popular belief, however, this was not due to his exceptionally low resting heart rate, often reported to be near 35 beats per minute. In his introduction to Borg's autobiography ''My Life and Game'', Eugene Scott relates that this rumor arose from a medical exam the 18-year-old Borg once took for military service, where his pulse was recorded as 38. Scott goes on to reveal Borg's true pulse rate as &quot;about 50 when he wakes up and around 60 in the afternoon.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Borg, Björn, and Eugene L. Scott. ''My Life and Game'' (1980), page 11&lt;/ref&gt; Borg is credited with helping to develop the style of play that has come to dominate the game today.&lt;ref name=&quot;aftonbladet.se&quot; /&gt;

==Mental approach==
Borg's first wife has said that he was &quot;always very placid and calm, except if he lost a match – he wouldn’t talk for at least three days. He couldn't stand losing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/tennis/bjorn-borg-mariana-simionescu-wife-11216165&lt;/ref&gt; This mental approach changed by 1981, when he has said that when he lost the Wimbledon final &quot;what shocked me was I wasn't even upset.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Adams, Tim |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jan/07/tennis.features2 |title='I can't explain except to say I wanted to play again.

==Personal life==
[[File:Björn Borg and Mariana Simionescu 1980.jpg|thumb|Borg and Simionescu in [[Snagov]], Romania, on 24 July 1980]]
Borg and Romanian tennis pro [[Mariana Simionescu]] began their relationship in 1976&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/tennis/bjorn-borg-mariana-simionescu-wife-11216165&lt;/ref&gt; and married in [[Bucharest]] on 24 July 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article125612212 |title=TENNIS Bjorn Borg weds in Bucharest |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=54 |issue=16,374 |date=25 July 1980 |page=18 |via=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage ended in divorce in 1984. He fathered a child, Robin, in 1985, by the Swedish model [[:sv:Jannike Björling|Jannike Björling]], and he was married to the Italian singer [[Loredana Bertè]] from 1989 to 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer 2007-01-07&quot; /&gt; On 8 June 2002, Borg married for a third time; his new wife being Patricia Östfeld. Together they have a son, Leo, born in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hello!|url=http://us.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/2002/06/10/borg/ |website=us.hellomagazine.com |publisher=Hello!

He narrowly avoided personal bankruptcy when business ventures failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Duncan |last=Campbell |title=Borg trophies sale highlights aces and double faults of tennis stars |date=4 March 2006 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/mar/04/sport.tennis |work=The Guardian |accessdate=7 July 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |title=Borg Bankruptcy Sought |date=24 October 1996 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01EEDF1030F937A15753C1A960958260 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=7 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
In 2017, a biographical sports [[Borg vs McEnroe|drama film]] was made focusing on the famous rivalry between tennis players Björn Borg and John McEnroe

==Memorabilia preserved==
In March 2006, [[Bonhams]] Auction House in London announced that it would auction Borg's Wimbledon trophies and two of his winning rackets on 21 June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/2006-03-03-borg-trophies-auction_x.htm |title=Borg to auction off Wimbledon trophies |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=3 March 2006 |accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several players then called Borg in an attempt to make him reconsider, including Jimmy Connors and Andre Agassi, who volunteered to buy them to keep them together. According to ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' – who had talked to Borg – McEnroe called Borg from New York and asked, &quot;What's up? Have you gone mad?&quot; and said &quot;What the hell are you doing?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=672&amp;a=532512&amp;previousRenderType=3 |title=McEnroe fick Borg på andra tankar |language=Swedish |newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |date=28 March 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930222742/http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=672&amp;a=532512&amp;previousRenderType=3 |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conversation with McEnroe, paired with pleas from Connors and Agassi, eventually persuaded Borg to buy out the trophies from Bonhams for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer 2007-01-07&quot; /&gt;

==Distinctions and honors==
* Borg was ranked by the ATP rankings world no. 1 in six different stretches between 1977 and 1981, totaling 109 weeks.
* During his career, he won a total of 77 (64 listed on the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] website) top-level singles and four doubles titles.
* Borg won the [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year Overseas Personality]] Award in 1979.
* Borg was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 1987.
* On 10 December 2006, the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] gave Borg a Lifetime Achievement Award, which was presented by [[Boris Becker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/front_page/6220542.stm |title=Sports Personality: The winners |work=BBC Sport |date=10 December 2006 |accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In December 2014 he was elected Sweden's top sportsperson of all time by the newspaper ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dn.se/sport/bjorn-borg-ar-bast-av-dem-alla/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053956/http://www.dn.se/sport/bjorn-borg-ar-bast-av-dem-alla/ |newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |title=Björn Borg är bäst av dem alla |first=Johan |last=Esk |date=23 December 2014 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |access-date=18 May 2017 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
With 11 Grand Slam titles, Borg ranks sixth in the list of male tennis players who have won the most Grand Slam singles titles behind [[Roger Federer]] (20), [[Rafael Nadal]] (19), [[Novak Djokovic]] (17), [[Pete Sampras]] (14) and [[Roy Emerson]] (12). The French Open—Wimbledon double he achieved three times consecutively was called by Wimbledon officials &quot;the most difficult double in tennis&quot;&lt;ref name=Wimbledonrecords /&gt; and &quot;a feat considered impossible among today's players.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/09/13/SPGGPL4KST1.DTL &quot;Strokes for Agassi: He belongs among the 10 greatest ever&quot;], Bruce Jenkins, ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 13 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Only Nadal (in 2008 and 2010) and Federer (in 2009) have managed to achieve this double since, and [[Andre Agassi]], Nadal, Federer and Djokovic are the only male players since Borg to have won the French Open and Wimbledon men's singles titles over their career. [[Ilie Năstase]] once said about Borg, &quot;We're playing tennis, and he's playing something else&quot;.

In his 1979 autobiography, [[Jack Kramer (tennis player)|Jack Kramer]], the long-time tennis promoter and great player himself, had already included Borg in his list of the 21 greatest players of all time. And in 2003, [[Bud Collins]] chose Borg as one of his top-five male players of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070309144832/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14489546/ &quot;Top Stars of Tennis&quot;], [[Bud Collins]], [[MSNBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[ESPN.com]] asked tennis analysts, writers, and former players to build the perfect open era player. Borg was the only player mentioned in four categories: defense, footwork, intangibles, and mental toughness—with his mental game and footwork singled out as the best in open era history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/flash/perfect |title=ESPN.com – Tennis – The Perfect Player |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borg famously never won the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]], losing in the final four times. Borg also never won the Australian Open, although he only played in the event once, in 1974 as a 17-year-old. The only players to defeat Borg in a Grand Slam final were fellow World No. 1 tennis players [[John McEnroe]] and [[Jimmy Connors]]. Even though it was then played on grass, a surface where he enjoyed much success, Borg chose to play the Australian Open only once, in 1974, where he lost in the third round. [[Phil Dent]], a contemporary of Borg, has pointed out that skipping Grand Slam tournaments—especially the Australian Open—was not unusual then, before counting Grand Slam titles became the norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Bonnie DeSimoneArchive |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/french07/columns/story?columnist=desimone_bonnie&amp;id=2882705 |title=Chris Evert owned Roland Garros like no other |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=26 May 2007 |accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, another contemporary [[Arthur Ashe]] told ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', &quot;I think Bjorn could have won the US Open. I think he could have won the Grand Slam, but by the time he left, the historical challenge didn't mean anything. He was bigger than the game. He was like [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] or [[Liz Taylor]] or somebody.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Curry Kirkpatrick |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1140719/index.htm |title=Unbjorn |publisher=Vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=6 May 1991 |accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laver Cup==
From 22–24 September 2017, Borg was the victorious captain of Team Europe in the first ever edition of the [[2017 Laver Cup|Laver Cup]], held in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]. Borg's Team Europe defeated a rest of the world team, known as Team World, who were coached by Borg's old rival, [[John McEnroe]]. Europe won the contest 15 points to 9, with [[Roger Federer]] achieving a narrow vital victory over [[Nick Kyrgios]] in the last match played.

Borg returned as the coach of Team Europe for the [[2018 Laver Cup|second edition]] in [[Chicago]], Illinois from September 21–23, 2018. McEnroe also returned as the coach for Team World. Borg again lead Europe to victory as [[Alexander Zverev]] defeated [[Kevin Anderson (tennis)|Kevin Anderson]] to secure the title 13–8, after trailing Anderson in the match tiebreak until the last few points.

* John Barrett, editor, ''World of Tennis Yearbooks'', London, from 1976 through 1983.
* Michel Sutter, ''Vainqueurs Winners 1946–2003'', Paris, 2003. Sutter has attempted to list all tournaments meeting his criteria for selection beginning with 1946 and ending in the fall of 1991. For each tournament, he has indicated the city, the date of the final, the winner, the runner-up, and the score of the final. A tournament is included in his list if: (1) the draw for the tournament included at least eight players (with a few exceptions, such as the Pepsi Grand Slam tournaments in the second half of the 1970s which included only players that had won a Grand Slam tournament); and (2) the level of the tournaments was at least equal to the present day challenger tournaments. Sutter's book is probably the most exhaustive source of tennis tournament information since World War II, even though some professional tournaments held before the start of the open era are missing. Later, Sutter issued a second edition of his book, with only the players, their wins, and years for the 1946 through 27 April 2003, period.
