'''Breton''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|ɛ|t|ən|}}, {{IPA-fr|bʁətɔ̃|lang}}; {{lang|br|brezhoneg}} {{IPA-br|bʁeˈzõːnɛk||brezhoneg.ogg}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Linguistic Student's Handbook |last=Bauer |first=Laurie |date=2007 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;small&gt;or&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-br|brəhõˈnek|}} &lt;small&gt;in [[Morbihan]]&lt;/small&gt;) is a [[Southwestern Brittonic language|Southwestern]] [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]] language of the [[Celtic language family]] spoken in [[Brittany]].

Breton was brought from Great Britain to [[Armorica]] (the ancient name for the coastal region that includes the Brittany peninsula) by migrating [[Britons (Celtic people)|Britons]] during the Early Middle Ages; it is thus an [[Insular Celtic language]], though closely related to the Continental Celtic [[Gaulish language]] which had been spoken in pre-Roman Gaul.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacAulay1992&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald MacAulay|title=The Celtic Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y3kIq1DYAkMC&amp;pg=PA371|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-23127-5|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breton is most closely related to [[Cornish language|Cornish]], both being [[Southwestern Brittonic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Breton-language|title=Breton language|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and the extinct [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]] are the more distantly related [[Western Brittonic languages]].

The other regional  language of Brittany, [[Gallo language|Gallo]], is a [[Romance language]] descended from Latin (unlike the similarly named ''Gaulish''). As a [[langue d'oïl]], Gallo is a close relative of standard French.

Having declined from more than a million speakers around 1950 to about 200,000 in the first decade of the 21st century, Breton is classified as &quot;severely endangered&quot; by the UNESCO [[Red Book of Endangered Languages|Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger]]. However, the number of children attending bilingual classes has risen 33% between 2006 and 2012 to 14,709.&lt;ref name=&quot;Broudic2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ofis-stats&quot;/&gt;

==History and status==
{{see also|Linguistic boundary of Brittany}}
Breton is spoken in [[Lower Brittany]] ({{lang-br|Breizh-Izel}}), roughly to the west of a line linking [[Plouha]] (west of [[Saint-Brieuc]]) and [[La Roche-Bernard]] (east of [[Vannes]]). It comes from a Brittonic language community that once extended from Great Britain to [[Armorica]] (present-day Brittany) and had even established a toehold in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] (in present-day Spain). Old Breton is attested from the 9th century. It was the language of the upper classes until the 12th century, after which it became the language of commoners in Lower Brittany. The nobility, followed by the [[bourgeoisie]], adopted [[French language|French]]. The written language of the [[Duchy of Brittany]] was [[Latin]], switching to French in the 15th century. There exists a limited tradition of [[Breton literature]]. Some Old Breton vocabulary remains in the present day as [[Philosophy|philosophical]] and scientific terms in Modern Breton. The recognized stages of the Breton language are: '''Old Breton''' - c.800 to c.1100, '''Middle Breton''' - c.1100 to c.1650, '''Modern Breton''' - c.1650 to present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia |last=Koch |first=John T. |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2006 |location=Santa Barbara, California |oclc=62381207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French monarchy was not concerned with the [[Minority language|minority]] [[languages of France]] spoken by the lower classes, and required the use of French for government business as part of its policy of national unity. During the [[French Revolution]], the government introduced policies favouring French over the regional languages, which it pejoratively referred to as {{lang|fr|[[patois]]}}. The revolutionaries assumed that [[reactionary]] and [[monarchy|monarchist]] forces preferred [[regional language]]s to try to keep the peasant masses underinformed. In 1794, [[Bertrand Barère]] submitted his &quot;report on the {{lang|fr|patois}}&quot; to the [[Committee of Public Safety]] in which he said that &quot;federalism and superstition speak Breton&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;breizh&quot;/&gt;

Since the 19th century, under the [[French Third Republic|Third]], [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth]] and [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republics]], the government has attempted to stamp out minority languages, including Breton, in state schools, in an effort to build a national culture. Teachers humiliated students for using their regional languages, and such practices prevailed until the late 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;breizh&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.breizh.net/icdbl/saozg/endangered.htm#Image%2520No.%25202:%2520Breton%2520is%2520a%2520hindrance%2520to%2520good%2520citizenship |title=Breton – An Endangered Language of Europe |last=Kuter |first=Lois  |date=May 2004 |website=breizh.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 21st century, due to the political centralization of France, the influence of the media, and the increasing mobility of people, only about 200 thousand people can speak Breton, a dramatic decline from more than a million in 1950. The majority of today's speakers are more than 60 years old, and Breton is now classified as an [[endangered language]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Broudic2009&quot; /&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, half of the population of Lower Brittany knew only Breton; the other half were bilingual. By 1950, there were only 100,000 [[monolingualism|monolingual]] Bretons, and this rapid decline has continued, with likely no monolingual speakers left today. A statistical survey in 1997 found around 300 thousand speakers in Lower Brittany, of whom about 190 thousand were aged 60 or older. Few 15- to 19-year-olds spoke Breton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Qui parle breton aujourd'hui? Qui le parlera demain? |last=Broudic |first=Fañch |publisher=Brud Nevez |year=1999 |location=Brest |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival efforts==
In 1925, Professor [[Roparz Hemon]] founded the Breton-language review ''[[Gwalarn]].'' During its 19-year run, ''Gwalarn'' tried to raise the language to the level of a great international language.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Favereau, &quot;Anthologie de la littérature bretonne au XXe siècle : 1919-1944&quot;, &quot;Tome 2 : Breiz Atao et les autres en littérature&quot;, Skol Vreizh, 2003, {{ISBN|2-911447-94-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its publication encouraged the creation of original literature in all genres, and proposed Breton translations of internationally recognized foreign works. In 1946, ''[[Al Liamm]]'' replaced ''Gwalarn''. Other Breton-language periodicals have been published, which established a fairly large body of literature for a minority language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Minority Literatures and Modernism: Scots, Breton, and Occitan, 1920-1990 |last=Calin |first=William |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2000 |isbn=9780802083654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, [[Diwan (school)|Diwan schools]] were founded to teach Breton by [[Language immersion|immersion]]. They taught a few thousand young people from elementary school to high school. See the [[#Education|education section]] for more information.

The ''[[Asterix]]'' comic series has been translated into Breton. According to the comic, the [[Gaul]]ish village where Asterix lives is in the [[Armorica|Armorica peninsula]], which is now Brittany. Some other popular comics have also been translated into Breton, including ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', ''[[Spirou et Fantasio|Spirou]]'', ''[[Titeuf]]'', ''[[Hägar the Horrible]]'', ''[[Peanuts]]'' and ''[[Yakari]]''.

Some original media are created in Breton. The sitcom, ''Ken Tuch'', is in Breton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media  | last1 = an Henaff | first1 = Goulwena | last2 = Strubel | first2 = Etienne |year= 2008 |title= Ken Tuch' |medium= Web videos |language= Breton |url= http://www.breizhvod.com/video/product/ken-tuch-l-integrale.html |access-date= 25 February 2015 |location= An Oriant, Breizh |publisher= Dizale }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Adkins | first1 = Madeleine | last2 = Davis | first2 = Jenny L. | title = The naïf, the sophisticate, and the party girl: Regional and gender stereotypes in Breton language web videos | journal = Gender and Language | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 291–308 | doi = 10.1558/genl.v6i2.291 | date = September 2012 | ref = harv }} [https://www.academia.edu/1927936/The_na%C3%AFf_the_sophisticate_and_the_party_girl_Regional_and_gender_stereotypes_in_Breton_language_web_videos Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radio Kerne]], broadcasting from [[Finistère]], has exclusively Breton programming. Some movies (''[[Lancelot du Lac (film)|Lancelot du Lac]]'', ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'', ''[[Marion du Faouet]]'', ''[[Sezneg]]'') and TV series (''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'') have also been translated and broadcast in Breton.  Poets, singers, linguists, and writers who have written in Breton, including [[Yann-Ber Kalloc'h]], [[Roparz Hemon]], [[Anjela Duval]], [[Xavier de Langlais]], [[Pêr-Jakez Helias]], [[Youenn Gwernig]], [[Glenmor]] and [[Alan Stivell]] are now known internationally.

Today, Breton is the only living [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]] that is not recognized by a national government as an official or regional language.

The first Breton dictionary, the ''[[Catholicon (trilingual dictionary)|Catholicon]]'', was also the first French dictionary. Edited by Jehan Lagadec in 1464, it was a trilingual work containing Breton, French and Latin. Today bilingual dictionaries have been published for Breton and languages including English, Dutch, German, Spanish and Welsh. A new generation{{clarify|date=March 2016}} is determined to gain international recognition for Breton. The monolingual dictionary, {{lang|br|Geriadur Brezhoneg an Here}} (1995), defines Breton words in Breton. The first edition contained about 10 thousand words, and the second edition of 2001 contains 20 thousand words.

In the early 21st century, the {{lang|br|[[Ofis ar Brezhoneg]]}} (&quot;Office of the Breton language&quot;) began a campaign to encourage daily use of Breton in the region by both businesses and local communes. Efforts include installing bilingual signs and posters for regional events, as well as encouraging the use of the [[Spilhennig]] to let speakers identify each other. The office also started an [[Internationalization and localization]] policy asking [[Google]], [[Firefox]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mozilla.org/br/firefox/fx/|title=Browse Freely}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|br}} [http://www.drouizig.org/index.php/br/troidigezh-br/kenrouedad-br/231-firefox-ha-thunderbird Firefox ha Thunderbird]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[SPIP]] to develop their interfaces in Breton. In 2004, the [[Breton Wikipedia]] started, which now counts more than 65 thousand articles. In March 2007, the ''Ofis ar Brezhoneg'' signed a [[wikt:tripartite|tripartite agreement]] with [[Regional Council of Brittany]] and [[Microsoft]]&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.agencebretagnepresse.com/article.php?id=6519 Microsoft au secours des langues celtiques y compris du breton]&lt;/ref&gt; for the consideration of the Breton language in Microsoft products. In October 2014, [[Facebook]] added Breton as one of its 121 languages&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.ouest-france.fr/facebook-et-maintenant-une-version-en-breton-2873502 Facebook. Et maintenant une version en breton]&lt;/ref&gt; after three years of talks between the ''Ofis'' and Facebook.

==Geographic distribution and dialects==
[[File:Breton dialectes-en.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Dialects of Breton]]
Breton is spoken mainly in Lower Brittany, but also in a more dispersed way in Upper Brittany (where [[Gallo language|Gallo]] is spoken alongside Breton and French), and in areas around the world that have Breton emigrants.

The four traditional dialects of Breton correspond to medieval bishoprics rather than to linguistic divisions.  They are {{lang|br|leoneg}} ({{lang|fr|léonard}}, of the [[Viscounty of Léon|county of Léon]]), {{lang|br|tregerieg}} ({{lang|fr|[[Trégorrois Breton dialect|trégorrois]]}}, of [[Trégor]]), {{lang|br|kerneveg}} ({{lang|fr|cornouaillais}}, of {{lang|fr|[[Cornouaille]]}}), and {{lang|br|[[gwenedeg]]}} ({{lang|fr|vannetais}}, of [[Vannes]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Celtic-languages#toc74852|title=Celtic languages|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{lang|fr|Guérandais}} was spoken up to the beginning of the 20th century in the region of [[Guérande]] and [[Batz-sur-Mer]].  There are no clear boundaries between the dialects because they form a [[dialect continuum]], varying only slightly from one village to the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Breton Orthographies and Dialects: The Twentieth-century, Vol. 2|last=Wmffre|first=Iwan|publisher=Peter Lang AG, Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften|year=2008|isbn=978-3039113651|location=|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|br|[[Gwenedeg]]}}, however, requires a little study to be intelligible with most of the other dialects.&lt;ref name=kergoat&gt;Kergoat, Lukian.

[[File:Ofis ar Brezhoneg vehicle.jpg|thumb|''[[Ofis Publik ar Brezhoneg]]'', the Breton language agency, was set up in 1999 by the Brittany region to promote and develop the use of Breton.]]

===Nation===
As noted, only French is an [[official language]] of [[France]]. Supporters of Breton and other minority languages continue to argue for their recognition, and for their place in education, public schools, and public life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoopes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=France a 'rogue state' on regional languages|author=Simon Hooper|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|accessdate=30 March 2012|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/03/201232943156736852.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Constitution====
In July 2008, the legislature amended the [[Constitution of France|French Constitution]], adding article 75-1: {{lang|fr|les langues régionales appartiennent au patrimoine de la France}} (the [[regional languages]] belong to the heritage of [[France]]).

The [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], which obliges signatory states to recognize minority and regional languages, was signed by France in 1999 but has not been ratified.  On 27 October 2015, the [[Senate (France)|Senate]] rejected a draft constitutional law ratifying the charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.franceinfo.fr/actu/politique/article/le-senat-rejette-le-projet-de-loi-de-ratification-de-la-charte-europeenne-des-langues-regionales-741405 |title=Le Sénat dit non à la Charte européenne des langues régionales |date=27 October 2015 |work=www.franceinfo.fr |access-date=1 November 2015 |agency=franceinfo |language=French |trans-title=The Senate says no to the European Charter for Regional Languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bilingual sin in Gwened.jpg|thumb]]

===Region===
Regional and departmental authorities use Breton to a very limited extent, for example in signage. Some bilingual signage has also been installed, such as street name signs in Breton towns. One station of the [[Rennes Metro|Rennes metro system]] has signs in both French and Breton.

Under the French law known as [[Toubon Law|Toubon]], it is illegal for commercial signage to be in Breton alone. Signs must be bilingual or French only. Since commercial signage usually has limited physical space, most businesses have signs only in French.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

{{lang|br|[[Ofis Publik ar Brezhoneg]]}}, the Breton language agency, was set up in 1999 by the Brittany region to promote and develop the daily use of Breton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ofis-bzh.org |title=Ofis ar Brezhoneg |publisher=Ofis-bzh.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It created the {{lang|br|[[Ya d'ar brezhoneg]]}} campaign, to encourage enterprises, organisations and communes to promote the use of Breton, for example by installing bilingual signage or translating their websites into Breton.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Education==
[[File:Breton school sign in Rennes.jpg|thumb|Sign in French and partly in Breton in Rennes, outside a school with bilingual classes]]

In the late 20th century, the French government considered incorporating the independent Breton-language immersion schools (called {{lang|br|[[Diwan (school)|Diwan]]}}) into the state education system. This action was blocked by the French [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] based on the 1994 amendment to the Constitution that establishes French as the language of the republic. Therefore, no other language may be used as a language of instruction in state schools. The [[Toubon Law]] implemented the amendment, asserting that French is the language of public education.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The [[Diwan (school)|Diwan schools]] were founded in Brittany in 1977 to teach Breton by [[Language immersion|immersion]]. A few thousand young people have been taught in Diwan schools from elementary school to high school over the years. The schools have gained fame owing to their high level of results in school exams.&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.diwanbreizh.org/sections.php4?op=viewarticle&amp;artid=6 Diwan FAQ, #6].&lt;/ref&gt; Breton-language schools do not receive funding from the national government, though the Brittany Region may fund them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://carla.umn.edu/immersion/acie/vol8/Feb2005_guest_diwan.html|title=The Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition (CARLA):Articulation of Language Instruction|website=carla.umn.edu|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another teaching method is a bilingual approach by {{lang|br|Div Yezh}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://div-yezh.org/|title=Actualités|first=Yannick /|last=Rostrenn|publisher=div-yezh.org|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; (&quot;Two Languages&quot;) in the State schools, created in 1979. {{lang|br|Dihun}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dihun.com/|title=Dihun - Dihun Language}}&lt;/ref&gt; (&quot;Awakening&quot;) was created in 1990 for bilingual education in the Catholic schools.

===Statistics===
In 2018, 18,337&lt;ref name=&quot;ofis-stats&quot; /&gt; pupils (about 2.00% of all pupils in Brittany) attended Diwan, Div Yezh and Dihun schools, and their number has increased yearly. The goal of [[Jean-Yves Le Drian]] (president of the [[Regional Council of Brittany|Regional Council]]) of 20 thousand, and of “their recognition” for “their place in education, public schools, and public life”, by 2010, was not achieved, but he describes being encouraged by their progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agencebretagnepresse.com/fetch.php?id=11436|title=Interview with Jean-Yves Le Drian, the president of the Region Council|publisher=angencebretagnepresse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, some 4500 to 5 thousand adults followed such a Breton language course as an evening or correspondence one.{{Vague|reason = A course distributed by mail?

===Other forms of education===
In addition to bilingual education (including Breton-medium education) the region has introduced the Breton language in primary education, mainly in the department of Finistère. These &quot;initiation&quot; sessions are generally one to three hours per week, and consist of songs and games.

Schools in secondary education (''[[collège]]s'' and ''[[lycée]]s'') offer some courses in Breton. In 2010, nearly 5,000 students in Brittany were reported to be taking this option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://studi.canalblog.com/archives/2010/06/20/18372084.html |title=L'option de breton : que faire ? |date=2010-06-20 |website=Studi : enseigner le breton et en breton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the University of Rennes 2 has a Breton language department offering courses in the language along with a master's degree in Breton and Celtic Studies.

==Phonology==
{{IPA notice}}

===Vowels===
Vowels in Breton may be [[vowel length|short or long]]. All unstressed vowels are short; stressed vowels can be short or long (vowel lengths are not noted in usual orthographies as they are implicit in the phonology of particular dialects, and not all dialects pronounce stressed vowels as long).

All vowels can also be [[nasalization|nasalized]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hemon |first1=Roparz |authorlink1=Roparz Hemon |last2=Everson |first2=Michael |authorlink2=Michael Everson |title=Breton Grammar |edition=2 |year=2007 |publisher=Evertype/Al Liamm |isbn=978-1-904808-11-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is noted by appending an 'n' letter after the base vowel, or by adding a combining tilde above the vowel (most commonly and easily done for ''a'' and ''o'' due to the [[Portuguese orthography|Portuguese letters]]), or more commonly by non-ambiguously appending an {{Angle bracket|ñ}} letter after the base vowel (this depends on the orthographic variant).

* The pronunciation of the letter {{angbr|r}} varies nowadays: {{IPA|[ʁ]}} is used in the French-influenced standard language and, generally speaking, in the central parts of Lower Brittany (including the south of Trégor, the west of Vannetais and virtually all parts of Cornouaille) whereas {{IPA|[r]}} is the common realisation in Léon and often in the Haut-Vannetais dialect of central Morbihan (in and around the city of Vannes and the Pays de Pontivy), though in rapid speech mostly a tapped {{IPA|[ɾ]}} occurs. In the other regions of Trégor {{IPA|[ɾ]}} or even {{IPA|[ɹ]}} may be found.
* The voiced dental fricative ({{IPAslink|ð}}) is a conservative realisation of the [[lenition]] (or the &quot;spirant mutation&quot; in cases where the phenomenon originates from the mutation of {{IPA|/t~θ/}}, respectively) of the consonants {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/t/}} which is to be found in certain varieties of Haut-Vannetais. Most of the Breton dialects do not inherit the sound and thus it is mostly not orthographically fixed. The ''Peurunvan'', for instance, uses {{angbr|z}} for both mutations, which are regularly and more prominently pronounced {{IPA|[z]}} in Léonais, Cornouaillais, Trégorrois and Bas-Vannetais. In traditional literature written in the Vannetais dialect, two different graphemes are employed for representing the dental fricative, depending on the scripture's historical period. There once was a time when {{angbr|d}} was used to transcribe the sound, but today mostly the regular {{angbr|z}} is instead used, and this practice can be traced back to at least the end of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Christmas Hymns in the Vannes Dialect of Breton|publisher=Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies|year=1956|isbn=|editor-last=Hemon|editor-first=Roparz|location=Dublin|pages=x, xxvi|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area this phenomenon has been found to be evident in encompasses the towns of [[Pontivy]] and [[Baud, Morbihan|Baud]] and surrounding smaller villages like [[Cléguérec]], [[Noyal-Pontivy]], [[Pluméliau]], [[Saint-Allouestre|St. Allouestre]], [[Saint-Barthélemy, Morbihan|St. Barthélemy]], [[Pluvigner]] and also parts of [[Belle Île|Belle-Île]]. The only known place where the mutation occurs outside of the Vannes country is the [[Île de Sein]], an island located off [[Finistère]]'s coast. Some scholars also used {{IPA|[ẓ]}} as the symbol for the sound to indicate that it was rather an &quot;infra-dental&quot; consonant than a clear interdental, which is the sound the symbol {{IPA|/ð/}} is usually describes. Other linguists, however, did not draw that distinction, either because they identified the sound to actually be an interdental fricative (such as Roparz Hemon in his phonetic transcription of the dialect used in Pluméliau or Joseph Loth in his material about the dialect of [[Sauzon]] in Belle-Île) or due to the fact that they attached no importance to it and ascertained that their descriptions were not in need of a further clarification of the sound's phonetic realisation as it was a clearly distinguishable phoneme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Historical Phonology of Breton|last=Jackson|first=Kenneth H.|publisher=Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies|year=1968|isbn=|location=Dublin|pages=661 ff|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Historical Morphology and Syntax of Breton|last = Hemon|first = Roparz|publisher = Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies|year = 1975|isbn = 978-0901282637|location = Dublin|pages = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
{{main|Breton grammar}}
&lt;!-- Description of the grammar of the language. --&gt;

===Verbal aspect===
Like in other Celtic languages as well as [[English language|English]], a variety of verbal constructions are available to express [[grammatical aspect]], for example: showing a distinction between [[progressive tense|progressive]] and habitual actions:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;

| {{lang|kw|My '''a gews''' orth ow hentrevek (pub myttin)}}
|}

===Inflected prepositions===
As in other modern [[Celtic languages]], Breton pronouns are fused into preceding prepositions to produce a sort of [[inflected preposition]]. Below are some examples in Breton, [[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scottish Gaelic]], and [[Manx language|Manx]], along with English translations.

|}
Note that in the examples above the [[Goidelic languages]] (Irish, Scottish Gaelic, and Manx) use the preposition meaning ''at'' to show possession, whereas the [[Brittonic languages]] use ''with''. The Goidelic languages, however, do use the preposition ''with'' to express &quot;belong to&quot; (Irish {{lang|ga|is liom an leabhar}}, Scottish {{lang|gd|is leam an leabhar}}, Manx {{lang|gv|s'lhiams yn lioar}}, The book belongs to me).

The Welsh examples are in [[literary Welsh morphology#Prepositions|literary Welsh]]. The order and preposition may differ slightly in [[colloquial Welsh morphology#Prepositions|colloquial Welsh]] (Formal {{lang|cy|mae car gennym}}, North Wales {{lang|cy|mae gynnon ni gar}}, South Wales {{lang|cy|mae car gyda ni}}).

===Initial consonant mutations===
{{Main|Breton mutations}}
Breton has four initial [[consonant mutation]]s: though modern Breton lost the nasal mutation of [[Welsh language|Welsh]], it also has a &quot;hard&quot; mutation, in which voiced stops become voiceless, and a &quot;mixed&quot; mutation, which is a mixture of hard and soft mutations.

===Word order===
Normal word order, like the other [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]] languages, is VSO (Verb, Subject Object). It is however perfectly possible to put the Subject or the Object at the beginning of the sentence. This largely depends on the focus of the speaker. The following options are possible (all with a little difference in meaning):

*the first places the verbal [[infinitive]] in initial position (as in (1)), followed by the [[Auxiliary verb|auxiliary]] ''ober'' 'to do'.
*the second places the Auxiliary verb ''bezañ'' 'to be' in initial position (as in (2)), followed the Subject, and the construction ''o(c'h) + infinitive''. At the end comes the Object.
*the third places the construction ''o(c'h) + infinitive'' in the initial position (as in (3)), followed by the Auxiliary verb ''bezañ'', the Subject, and the Object.
*the fourth option places the Object in initial position (as in (4)), followed by an inflected verb, followed by the Subject.
*the fifth, and originally least common, places the Subject in initial position (as in (5)), followed by an inflected verb, followed by the Object, just like in English (SVO).

==Vocabulary==
&lt;!-- This section should contain a discussion of any special features of the vocabulary (or lexicon) of the language, like if it contains a large number of borrowed words or a different set of words for different politeness levels, taboo groups, etc. --&gt;
&lt;!-- This paragraph underneath doesn't deal with Breton vocabulary but English vocabulary. This paragraph belongs on a page about English borrowings, not on a page about the Breton language. --&gt;

===Words that passed into French and into English===
The English words {{wikt-lang|en|dolmen}} and {{wikt-lang|en|menhir}} have been borrowed from French, which took them from Breton. However, this is uncertain: for instance, ''menhir'' is ''peulvan'' or ''maen hir'' (&quot;long stone&quot;), ''maen sav'' (&quot;straight stone&quot;) (two words: noun + adjective) in Breton. ''Dolmen'' is a misconstructed word (it should be ''taol-'''''v'''''aen''). Some studies state{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} that these words were borrowed from [[Cornish language|Cornish]]. {{lang|cy|Maen hir}} can be directly translated from Welsh as &quot;long stone&quot; (which is exactly what a {{lang|br|menhir}} or {{lang|br|maen hir}} is). The Cornish surnames Mennear, Minear and Manhire all derive from the Cornish ''{{wikt-lang|kw|men}} {{wikt-lang|kw|hyr}}'' (&quot;long stone&quot;), as does Tremenheere &quot;settlement by the long stone&quot;.

The French word {{wikt-lang|fr|baragouiner}} (&quot;to jabber in a foreign language&quot;) is derived from Breton ''{{wikt-lang|br|bara}}'' (&quot;bread&quot;) and ''{{wikt-lang|br|gwin}}'' (&quot;wine&quot;).  The French word {{wikt-lang|fr|goéland}} (&quot;large seagull&quot;) is derived from Breton ''{{wikt-lang|br|gwelan}}'', which shares the same root as English &quot;gull&quot; (Welsh ''{{wikt-lang|cy|gwylan}}'', Cornish ''{{wikt-lang|kw|goelann}}'').

==Orthography==
The first extant Breton texts, contained in the Leyde manuscript, were written at the end of the 8th century: 50 years prior to the [[Strasbourg Oaths]], considered to be the earliest example of [[French language|French]]. Like many medieval orthographies, Old- and Middle Breton orthography was at first not standardised, and the spelling of a particular word varied at authors' discretion. In 1499, however, the ''[[Catholicon (trilingual dictionary)|Catholicon]]'', was published; as the first dictionary written for both French and Breton, it became a point of reference on how to transcribe the language. The orthography presented in the ''Catholicon'' was largely similar to that of French, in particular with respect to the representation of vowels, as well as the use of both the Latinate digraph {{angbr|qu}}—a remnant of the sound change /kʷ/ &gt; /k/ in Latin—and Brittonic {{angbr|cou-}}or {{angbr|cu-}} to represent /k/ before front vowels.

As phonetic and phonological differences between the dialects began to magnify, many regions, particularly the Vannes country, began to devise their own orthographies. Many of these orthographies were more closely related to the French model, albeit with some modifications. Examples of these modifications include the replacement of Old Breton {{angbr|-z}} with {{angbr|-h}} to denote word-final /x~h/ (an evolution of Old Breton /θ/ in the Vannes dialect) and use of {{angbr|-h}} to denote the initial mutation of /k/ (today this mutation is written {{angbr|c'h}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Historical Morphology and Syntax of Breton|last=Hemon|first=Roparz|publisher=Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies|year=1975|isbn=|location=Dublin|pages=5|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus needed another transcription.

In the 1830s [[Jean-François Le Gonidec]] created a modern phonetic system for the language.

During the early years of the 20th century, a group of writers known as {{lang|br|Emglev ar Skrivanerien}} elaborated and reformed Le Gonidec's system. They made it more suitable as a super-dialectal representation of the dialects of [[Cornouaille]], Leon and Trégor (known as from ''Kernev'', ''Leon'' and ''Treger'' in Breton). This '''KLT''' orthography was established in 1911. At the same time writers of the more divergent Vannetais dialect developed a phonetic system also based on that of Le Gonidec.

Following proposals made during the 1920s, the KLT and Vannetais orthographies were merged in 1941 to create an orthographic system to represent all four dialects. This {{lang|br|Peurunvan}} (&quot;wholly unified&quot;) orthography was significant for the inclusion of the ''zh'' [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]], which represents a {{IPA|/h/}} in Vannetais and corresponds to a {{IPA|/z/}} in the KLT dialects.

In 1955 [[François Falc'hun]] and the group Emgleo Breiz proposed a new orthography. It was designed to use a set of [[graphemes]] closer to the conventions of French. This {{lang|fr|Orthographie Universitaire}} (&quot;University Orthography&quot;, known in Breton as {{lang|br|Skolveurieg}}) was given official recognition by the French authorities as the &quot;official orthography of Breton in French education.&quot; It was opposed in the region and today is used only by the magazine ''Brud Nevez'' and the publishing house Emgléo Breiz.

In the 1970s, a new standard orthography was devised — the {{lang|br|etrerannyezhel}} or {{lang|fr|interdialectale}}. This system is based on the derivation of the words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hewitt |first1=Steve |title=Background Information on Breton |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/30212311/Hewitt_-_Background_information_on_Breton.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1550776177&amp;Signature=EiVR6A1seunpeqSW3DzV9VtYT64%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DBackground_information_on_Breton.pdf}}{{dead link|date=March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the majority of writers continue to use the ''Peurunvan orthography'', and it is the version taught in most Breton-language schools.

===Alphabet===
Breton is written in the [[Latin script]]. ''Peurunvan'', the most commonly used orthography, consists of the following letters:

: a, b, ch, c'h, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, t, u, v, w, y, z

The [[circumflex]], [[grave accent]], [[trema (diacritic)|trema]] and [[tilde]] appear on some letters. These [[diacritic]]s are used in the following way:

: â, ê, î, ô, û, ù, ü, ñ

See [[v:Introduction to Breton/Breton pronunciation]] for an introduction to the Breton alphabet and pronunciation.

===Differences between {{lang|br|Skolveurieg}} and {{lang|br|Peurunvan}}===
Both orthographies use the above alphabet, although ''é'' is used only in {{lang|br|Skolveurieg}}.

Differences between the two systems are particularly noticeable in word endings. In Peurunvan, final [[obstruent]]s, which are devoiced in absolute final position and voiced in [[sandhi]] before voiced sounds, are represented by a grapheme that indicates a voiceless sound. In OU they are written as voiced but represented as voiceless before suffixes: {{lang|br|braz}} (big), {{lang|br|brasoc'h}} (bigger).

In addition, Peurunvan maintains the KLT convention, which distinguishes noun/adjective pairs by nouns written with a final voiced consonant and adjectives with a voiceless one. No distinction is made in pronunciation, e.g. '''{{lang|br|brezhoneg}}''' ''Breton language'' vs. '''{{lang|br|brezhonek}}''' ''Breton (adj)''.

'''Notes:'''
# {{Note|Pron-1}} Vocative particle: ''â Vreizh'' O Brittany!
# {{Note|Pron-2}} Word-initially.
# {{Note|Pron-3}} Word-finally.
# {{Note|Pron-4}} Unwritten lenition of ''ch, c'h, f, s'' and spirantization of ''p'' &gt; ''f'' {{IPA|[v]}}.
# {{Note|Pron-5}} Unstressed vowels ''e, eu, o'' are pronounced {{IPA|[ɛ, œ, ɔ]}} in Leoneg but {{IPA|[e, ø, o]}} in the other dialects. The pronunciation {{IPA|[ɛ̞, œ̞, ɔ̞]}} appears mainly in front of clusters ''lc'h, rc'h'' (less often also before ''c'h''), before semivowels {{IPA|[j, w]}}, before other clusters beginning with ''r, l'' and before ''rr''. Stressed long ''e, eu, o'' are realized as {{IPA|[eː, øː, oː]}}.
# {{Note|Pron-6}} In Gwenedeg velars or labialized velars are palatalized when followed by ''e'' and ''i'': ''k, g, kw/kou, c'hw/c'hou, gw/gou, w/ou, sk'' to {{IPA|[c, ɟ, cɥ, hɥ, ɟɥ, ɥ, sc/ʃc]}}. Instead of {{IPA|[c, ɟ]}} also {{IPA|[tʃ, dʒ]}} may appear.
# {{Note|Pron-7}} In Gwenedeg word-final ''g'' and ''k'' is palatalized to [c] after preceding ''i''.
# {{Note|Pron-8}} But before a vowel other than ''i'' the digraph ''ni'' is written instead of ''gn'', e.g. ''bleniañ'' to drive', radical ''blegn'', 1PS preterite ''blegnis'', 3PS preterite ''blenias''.
# {{Note|Pron-9}} But mute in words such as '''''h'''a(g), '''h'''e(c'h), '''h'''o(c'h), '''h'''oll, '''h'''on/'''h'''or/'''h'''ol''. Silent in Gwenedeg and Leoneg.
# {{Note|Pron-10}} ''I'' is realized as {{IPA|[j]}} when it precedes or follows a vowel (or when between vowels), but in words such as ''l'''i'''en, l'''i'''orzh, rakd'''i'''azezañ'' the letter ''i'' is pronounced as {{IPA|[iː]}} (in orthography ''ï'' may be used:''lïen, lïorzh, rakdïazezañ'').
# {{Note|Pron-11}} Group ''ilh'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ʎ]}} when it follows a vowel, following a consonant the group is pronounced [iʎ]. But before a vowel other than ''i'' ''li'' is written instead of ''ilh'', e.g. ''heuliañ'' to follow, radical ''heuilh'', 1PS preterite ''heuilhis'', 3PS preterite ''heulias''. In some regions instead of {{IPA|[ʎ]}} may appear pronunciation {{IPA|[j]}}.
# {{Note|Pron-12}} Word-finally following a cluster of unvoiced consonants.
# {{Note|Pron-13}} In front of ''k, g''.
# {{Note|Pron-14}} The digraph ''ou'' is realized same as the letter ''w'' when preceded or followed by a vowel (or when between vowels), but in words such as ''Doue, douar, gouarn'' the digraph ''ou'' is pronounced {{IPA|[uː]}}.
# {{Note|Pron-15}} The digraph ''où'' marks plural ending. Its pronunciation varies throughout Brittany: {{IPA|[u, o, ø, ow, aw, aɥ, ɔɥ]}} rating geographically from Northwest Leon to Southeast Gwened.
# {{Note|Pron-16}} The letter ''v'' is usually pronounced {{IPA|[v]}}, but word-finally (except word-final ''ñv'') is pronounced usually as {{IPA|[w]}} or in KLT, as {{IPA|[ɥ]}} in Gwenedeg and as {{IPA|[f]}} in Goëlo. The pronunciation {{IPA|[v]}} is retained word-finally in verbs. In words ''bli'''v''', Gwiskri'''v''', gwi'''v''', li'''v''', pi'''v''', ri'''v''''' are ''v'' is pronounced {{IPA|[u]}} in KLT, {{IPA|[ɥ]}} in Gwenedeg and {{IPA|[f]}} in Goëlo. Word-finally following ''r, l, n, z'' it is pronounced {{IPA|[o]}}.
# {{Note|Pron-17}} But mute in words such as ''goue'''z''', bloa'''z''', goa'''z''', ru'''z'''iañ, klei'''z''', rakdïaze'''z'''añ, be'''z'''añ, Roa'''zh'''on, de'''zh'''añ, koue'''zh'''añ, ''''z''', a'''z''', e'''z''', da''''z''', gwirione'''z''', enep(g)wirione'''z''', monei'''z''', falsvonei'''z''', karante'''z''', kengarante'''z''', neve'''z''', neve'''z'''c'hanet, nado'''z'''ioù, abardae'''z''', gwe'''z''', bemde'''z''', kri'''z''', blei'''z''', morvlei'''z''', de'''zh'''i ''. ''Z'' is generally mute in Kerneweg, Tregerieg and Gwenedeg, but in Leoneg ''z(h)'' is always pronounced.
# {{Note|Pron-18}} Used to distinguish words ''stêr'' river, ''hêr'' heir, ''kêr'' town (written also ''kaer'') from ''ster'' sense, ''her ''bold, ''ker'' dear.
# {{Note|Pron-19}} Used to distinguish ''trôad'' circuit/tour from ''troad'' foot.
# {{Note|Pron-20}} In northern dialects (mainly in Leoneg), there is a tendency to voice ''c'h'' between vowels. Pronunciation {{IPA|[ɣ]}} appears also in forms of lenition of ''g, c'h'' and mixed mutation of ''g''.
# {{Note|Pron-21}} The lenition of ''d'' and the spirantization of ''t'' is also transcribed as ''z'' and is most prominently pronounced {{IPA|[z]}} although in certain regions also {{IPA|[s]}} (for ''t'', particularly in Cornouaille) and {{IPA|[ð]}} (in some Haut-Vannetais varieties, see note 31) occur.
# {{Note|Pron-22}} Pronunciation of ''r'' varies in Brittany, nowadays uvular {{IPA|[ʀ]}} (or {{IPA|[ʁ]}}) is a standard; in Leoneg ''r'' is pronounced {{IPA|[r]}}, in Tregerieg {{IPA|[ɾ]}} or {{IPA|[ɹ]}}, in Kerneveg {{IPA|[ʀ]}} and {{IPA|[ʁ]}} are most common, in Gwenedeg {{IPA|[ʀ], [ʁ], [r], [ɾ]}} occur.
# {{Note|Pron-23}} In Gwenedeg unstressed ''e'' often {{IPA|[ə]}}.
# {{Note|Pron-24}} Lenited varieties of ''r, l, n'' may appear word-initially in case of soft mutation.
# {{Note|Pron-25}} In Leoneg {{IPA|[u(ː)]}} in front of a nasal.
# {{Note|Pron-26}} In Leoneg ''w'' in front of ''e, i'' {{IPA|[v]}}.
# {{Note|Pron-27}} In Leoneg ''z(h)'' in front of ''i'' {{IPA|[ʃ]}} or {{IPA|[ʒ]}}.
# {{Note|Pron-28}} In Leoneg ''gwr'' {{IPA|[ɡr]}}.
# {{Note|Pron-29}} Before a vowel.
# {{Note|Pron-30}} Forms of the indefinite article.
# {{Note|Pron-31}}A conservative realisation of the initial mutation of ''d'' and ''t'', used in certain parts of the Vannes country.
