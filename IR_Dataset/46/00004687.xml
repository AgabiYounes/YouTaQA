'''Balochistan''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ə|ˌ|l|oʊ|tʃ|ɪ|ˈ|s|t|ɑː|n}}; {{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|بلوچِستان}}}}) 
is one of the four [[Administrative units of Pakistan|provinces of Pakistan]]. It is the largest province in terms of land area, forming the southwestern region of the country, but is the least populated. Its provincial capital and largest city is [[Quetta]].

Balochistan shares borders with [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] and the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] to the northeast, [[Sindh]] to the east and southeast, the [[Arabian Sea]] to the south, [[Iran]] to the west and [[Afghanistan]] to the north and northwest.

The main ethnic groups in the province are the [[Baloch people]] and the [[Pashtuns]], who constitute 52% and 36% of the population respectively (according to the preliminary 2011 census).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/708123|title=The tricky demographics of Balochistan|date=April 5, 2012|first=Muhammad|last=Lakdawalla|accessdate=May 16, 2017|publisher=[[Dawn News]]|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125045435/http://www.dawn.com/news/708123|archivedate=25 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining 12% comprises smaller communities of [[Brahui people|Brahuis]], [[Hazaras]] along with other settlers such as [[Sindhis]], [[Punjabis]], [[Uzbeks]] and [[Turkmens]]. The name &quot;[[Balochistan]]&quot; means &quot;the land of the Baloch&quot;. Largely underdeveloped, its [[Economy of Balochistan, Pakistan|provincial economy]] is dominated by natural resources, especially its [[Oil and Gas Development Company|natural gas fields]], estimated to have sufficient capacity to supply Pakistan's demands over the medium to long term. Aside from Quetta, the second-largest city of the province is [[Turbat]] in the south, while another area of major economic importance is [[Gwadar Port]] on the Arabian Sea.

Balochistan is noted for its unique culture and extremely dry [[List of deserts of Pakistan|desert climate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Balochistan|title=Balochistan {{!}} province, Pakistan|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405173533/https://www.britannica.com/place/Balochistan|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
{{more citations needed section|date=September 2012}}
[[File:IVC-major-sites-2.jpg|thumb|upright|Map showing the sites and extent of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]]. [[Mohenjo-Daro]] and [[Mehrgarh]] were among centers of the Indus Valley Civilisation in the modern-day province. Balochistan marked the westernmost territory of the civilisation, which was one of the most developed in the old [[Bronze Age]] in the world.]]
Balochistan occupies the very southeastern-most portion of the [[Iranian Plateau]], the setting for the earliest known farming settlements in the pre-[[Indus Valley Civilisation]] era, the earliest of which was [[Mehrgarh]], dated at 7000 BC, within the province. Balochistan marked the westernmost extent of the Civilisation. Centuries before the arrival of [[Islam]] in the 7th Century, parts of Balochistan was ruled by the [[Paratarajas]], an [[Indo-Scythians|Indo-Scythian]] dynasty. At certain times, the [[Kushans]] also held political sway in parts of Balochistan.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

A theory of the origin of the [[Baloch people]], the largest ethnic group in the region, is that they are of [[Medes|Median]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;M. Longworth Dames, Balochi Folklore, ''Folklore'', Vol. 13, No. 3 (29 Sep. 1902), pp. 252–274&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival of Islam===
In 654, Abdulrehman ibn Samrah, governor of Sistan and the newly emerged [[Rashidun caliphate]] at the expense of Sassanid Persia and the Byzantine Empire, sent an Islamic army to crush a revolt in [[Zaranj]], which is now in southern Afghanistan. After conquering Zaranj, a column of the army pushed north, conquering [[Kabul]] and [[Ghazni]], in the [[Hindu Kush]] mountain range, while another column moved through [[Quetta District]] in north-western Balochistan and conquered the area up to the ancient cities of ''Dawar'' and ''Qandabil'' ([[Bolan District|Bolan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tabqat ibn Saad, Vol. 8, p. 471&lt;/ref&gt; It is documented that the major settlements, falling within today's province, became in 654 controlled by the Rashidun caliphate, except for the well-defended mountain town of ''QaiQan'' which is now [[Kalat, Pakistan|Kalat]].

During the caliphate of [[Ali ibn Abi Talib|Ali]], a revolt broke out in southern Balochistan's Makran region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saxena|first=Sunil K.|title=History of Medieval India|publisher=Pinnacle Technology|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 663, during the reign of [[Umayyad]] Caliph [[Muawiyah I]], his Muslim rule lost control of north-eastern Balochistan and Kalat when Haris ibn Marah and a large part of his army died in battle against a revolt in Kalat.&lt;ref&gt;Tarikh al Khulfa, Vol. 1, pp. 214–215, 229&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-modern era===
In the 15th century, [[Mir Chakar Khan Rind]] became the first [[Sirdar]] of Afghani, Irani and Pakistani Balochistan. He was a close aide of the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] ruler [[Humayun]], and was succeeded by the [[Khanate of Kalat]], which owed allegiance to the [[Mughal Empire]]. Later, [[Nader Shah]] won the allegiance of the rulers of eastern Balochistan. He ceded [[Kalhora]], one of the [[Sindh]] territories of [[Sibi]]-Kachi, to the [[Khanate of Kalat]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://urdukhabrain.pk/2018/01/01/urdu-news-11685 urdukhabrain.pk] {{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranica.com/newsite/index.isc?Article=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v3f6/v3f6a030.html Iranica.com] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://panhwar.org/Article26.htm|title=Ghulam Shah Kalhora and Relations With Kutch|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2014|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219221911/http://panhwar.org/Article26.htm|archivedate=19 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]], founder of the Afghan Empire, also won the allegiance of that area's rulers, and many Baloch fought under him during the [[Third Battle of Panipat]]. Most of the area would eventually revert to local Baloch control after Afghan rule.

===British era===

During the period of the [[British Raj]] from the fall of the [[Durrani Empire]] in 1823, four [[princely state]]s were recognised and reinforced in Balochistan: [[Makran (princely state)|Makran]], [[Kharan (princely state)|Kharan]], [[Las Bela (princely state)|Las Bela]] and [[Kalat (princely state)|Kalat]]. In 1876, [[Robert Groves Sandeman|Robert Sandeman]] negotiated the [[Treaty of Kalat]], which brought the Khan's territories, including Kharan, Makran, and Las Bela, under British protection even though they remained independent princely states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Naseer|last1=Dashti|title=The Baloch and Balochistan: A Historical Account from the Beginning to the Fall of the Baloch State|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xIjyLNpusbAC|year=2012|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4669-5896-8|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Second Afghan War]] was ended by the [[Treaty of Gandamak]] in May 1879, the [[Mohammad Yaqub Khan|Afghan Emir]] ceded the districts of Quetta, [[Pishin District|Pishin]], [[Harnai District|Harnai]], Sibi and [[Thal Chotiali]] to British control. On 1 April 1883, the British took control of the [[Bolan Pass]], south-east of Quetta, from the [[Khan of Kalat]]. In 1887, small additional areas of Balochistan were declared British territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter R. Blood|title=Pakistan: A Country Study|publisher=DIANE Publishing|year=1996|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, Sir [[Mortimer Durand]] negotiated an agreement with the [[Amir]] of Afghanistan, [[Abdur Rahman Khan]], to fix the [[Durand Line]] running from [[Chitral]] to Balochistan as the boundary between the [[Emirate of Afghanistan]] and British-controlled areas.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Two devastating earthquakes occurred in Balochistan during British colonial rule: the [[1935 Quetta earthquake]], which devastated [[Quetta]], and the [[1945 Balochistan earthquake]] with its epicentre in the Makran region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=|title=Foreign Affairs Pakistan, Volume 32, Issues 11–12|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs|year=2005|page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balochistan contained a [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioner's Province)|Chief Commissioner's province]] and four princely states under the British Raj.

==Geography==
[[File:Astola Island.jpg|thumb|[[Astola Island]]]]
Balochistan is situated in the southwest of Pakistan and covers an area of {{convert|347,190|km2|mi2}}. It is Pakistan's largest province by area, constituting 44% of Pakistan's total land mass. The province is bordered by [[Afghanistan]] to the north and north-west, Iran to the south-west, [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]], and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] to the north-east. To the south lies the [[Arabian Sea]]. Balochistan is located on the south-eastern part of the Iranian plateau. It borders the geopolitical regions of the Middle East and Southwest Asia, Central Asia and South Asia. Balochistan lies at the mouth of the [[Strait of Hormuz]] and provides the shortest route from seaports to Central Asia. Its geographical location has placed the otherwise desolate region in the scope of competing for global interests for all of recorded history.

The capital city Quetta is located in a densely populated portion of the [[Sulaiman Mountains]] in the north-east of the province. It is situated in a river valley near the Bolan Pass, which has been used as the route of choice from the coast to Central Asia, entering through Afghanistan's [[Kandahar]] region. The British and other historic empires have crossed the region to invade Afghanistan by this route.&lt;ref&gt;Bolan Pass – Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Balochistan is rich in exhaustible and renewable resources; it is the second major supplier of natural gas in Pakistan. The province's renewable and human resource potential has not been systematically measured or exploited due to pressures from within and without Pakistan. Local inhabitants have chosen to live in towns and have relied on sustainable water sources for thousands of years.

===Climate===
The climate of the upper highlands is characterised by very cold winters and hot summers. In the lower highlands, winters vary from extremely cold in northern districts [[Ziarat]], Quetta, Kalat, Muslim Baagh and Khanozai to milder conditions closer to the Makran coast. Winters are mild on the plains, with temperature never falling below freezing point. Summers are hot and dry, especially in the arid zones of Chagai and Kharan districts. The plains are also very hot in summer, with temperatures reaching {{convert|50|C|F}}. The record highest temperature, {{convert|53|C|F}}, was recorded in Sibi on 26 May 2010,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pakmet.com.pk/latest%20news/Latest%20News.html Pakmet.com.pk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902112830/http://www.pakmet.com.pk/latest%20news/Latest%20News.html |date=2 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; exceeding the previous record, {{convert|52|C|F}}. Other hot areas include [[Turbat]] and [[Dalbandin]]. The desert climate is characterised by hot and very arid conditions. Occasionally, strong windstorms make these areas very inhospitable.

==Tourism==
Balochistan has a lot of tourist potential, though the province has not seen much of it. There are many sites and places within the province, which can attract a lot of [[tourism]]. Tourism was cut down significantly in Balochistan after the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terror attacks]] due to [[terrorism]]. However, recently, tourism is growing in Balochistan and fights against terrorists have proved successful. The [[China–Pakistan Economic Corridor|China-Pakistan Economic Corridor]] ([[CPEC]]) also aims to revive the growing tourism industry by improving road networks which would generate jobs and income for the [[Baloch people|Balochi people]] as well as help [[Pakistan]] in improving its [[Gross domestic product|GDP]].

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Government of Balochistan, Pakistan|List of cities in Balochistan}}
In common with the other provinces of Pakistan, Balochistan has a parliamentary form of government. The ceremonial head of the province is the [[Governor of Balochistan (Pakistan)|Governor]], who is appointed by the [[President of Pakistan]] on the advice of the provincial [[Chief Minister of Balochistan|Chief Minister]]. The Chief Minister, the province's chief executive, is normally the leader of the largest political party or alliance of parties in the provincial assembly.

[[File:Gov-house-side-view.jpg|thumb|Balochistan Governor House Quetta]]

The [[unicameral]] [[Provincial Assembly of Balochistan]] comprises 65 seats of which 11 are reserved for women and 3 reserved for non-Muslims. The judicial branch of government is carried out by the [[Balochistan High Court]], which is based in Quetta and headed by a Chief Justice.

Besides dominant Pakistan-wide political parties (such as the [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)]] and the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]]), Balochistan nationalist parties (such as the [[National Party (Pakistan)|National Party]] and the [[Balochistan National Party (Mengal)]]) have been prominent in the province.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hussain-4-25-13&quot;/&gt;

=== Administration ===
[[File:Balochistan Districts.svg|thumb|'''Note:''' In this map, Lehri is shown within Sibi District on #27. Sohbatpur is shown within Jafarabad District on #8.]]

For administrative purposes, the province is divided into six divisions – Kalat, Makran, Nasirabad, Quetta, Sibi and Zhob. This divisional level was abolished in 2000, but restored after the 2008 election. Each division is under an appointed commissioner. The six divisions are further subdivided into 34 districts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.balochistan.gov.pk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=32&amp;Itemid=49 |title = Districts |publisher = Government of Balochistan |access-date = 13 August 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100807000609/http://www.balochistan.gov.pk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=32&amp;Itemid=49 |archive-date= 7 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balochistan's population density is low due to the mountainous terrain and scarcity of water. In March 2012, preliminary census figures showed that the population of Balochistan had reached 13,162,222, not including the districts of Khuzdar, Kech and Panjgur, a 139.3% increase from 5,501,164 in 1998, representing 6.85% of Pakistan's total population. This was the largest increase in population by any province of Pakistan during that time period.&lt;ref name=&quot;POP&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=census1998&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/fbs/publications/yearbook2008/Population/16-5.pdf |title=Population, Area and Density by Region/Province |year=1998 |publisher=Federal Bureau of Statistics, Government of Pakistan |format=PDF |accessdate=20 July 2009 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118145343/http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/fbs/publications/yearbook2008/Population/16-5.pdf |archivedate=18 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2012Census1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-13514-Population-shoots-up-by-47-percent-since-1998 |title=Population shoots up by 47 percent since 1998 |publisher=Thenews.com.pk |date=29 March 2012 |accessdate=14 August 2012 |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701193658/http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-13514-Population-shoots-up-by-47-percent-since-1998 |archivedate=1 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Official estimates of Balochistan's population grew from approximately 7.45 million in 2003 to 7.8 million in 2005.&lt;ref name=worldbankpop&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/PAKISTANEXTN/Resources/293051-1241610364594/6097548-1257441952102/balochistaneconomicreportvol2.pdf Pakistan Balochistan Economic Report: From Periphery to Core (In Two Volumes) – Volume II: Full Report.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501074227/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/PAKISTANEXTN/Resources/293051-1241610364594/6097548-1257441952102/balochistaneconomicreportvol2.pdf |date=1 May 2011 }} The World Bank.
