'''Telecommunications in Ecuador''' include [[telephone]], [[radio]], [[television]], and the [[Internet]].

Ecuador's state regulatory agency is the National Telecommunications Council (CONATEL), which is part of the Telecommunications Ministry (MINTEL).&lt;ref name=FOTN-Ecuador-2013&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2013/ecuador &quot;Ecuador&quot;], ''Freedom on the Net 2013'', Freedom House.

** International: landing points for the PAN-AM and South America-1 submarine cables that provide links to the west coast of South America, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, and extending onward to Aruba and the US Virgin Islands in the Caribbean; satellite earth station - 1 [[Intelsat]] (Atlantic Ocean) (2011).&lt;ref name=WFB-2013-Ecuador/&gt;

There are three cell phone providers in Ecuador: Claro ([[Telcel]]), [[Movistar]], and [[CNT EP|CNT]]. Mobile networks are diverse and include [[GSM]] 850&amp;nbsp;MHz (largest) as well as [[CDMA]] ([[Bell South]]'s old network before being acquired by [[Telefónica]] Spain which rebranded Movistar), TDMA63. CNT is the state owned firm and uses CDMA.

==Radio and television==

Ecuador has multiple TV networks and many local channels, as well as more than 300 radio stations. Many TV and radio stations are privately owned. The government owns or controls 5 national TV stations and multiple radio stations. Radio and television broadcasters are required by law to give the government free air time to broadcast programs produced by the state (2007).&lt;ref name=WFB-2013-Ecuador/&gt;

The government has an ongoing campaign to increase Internet access across the country, with a goal of extending Internet connectivity to 50 percent of households by 2015. Public Internet access centers, known as Infocentros, have been installed in 377 (48 percent) of Ecuador's 810 rural parishes, with a projection of 100 percent by 2014. [[Internet cafes]] are also becoming increasingly common. During the February 2013 elections for president and National Assembly, the Internet provided a real-time forum for candidates to launch proposals, solicit votes, discuss issues, and increase the scope of their publicity campaigns.&lt;ref name=FOTN-Ecuador-2013/&gt;

Broadband (commonly used in urban zones) and satellite connections (often used in rural areas) are increasingly popular, eclipsing dial-up plans. According to industry estimates, between 33 and 66 percent of Internet users have broadband speeds between 2 and 3Mbit/s, at a cost of $20 to $25 per month. In May 2012, the Superintendent of Telecommunications indicated that the overall average speed of an Internet connection in Ecuador is 128kbit/s, although speeds are lower in rural areas.&lt;ref name=FOTN-Ecuador-2013/&gt;

===Internet censorship and surveillance===
* In its ''Freedom on the Net 2013'' report, [[Freedom House]] gives Ecuador a &quot;freedom on the net status&quot; of &quot;partly free&quot;.&lt;ref name=FOTN-Ecuador-2013/&gt;

There is no widespread blocking or filtering of websites in Ecuador and access to blogs and social media platforms such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[YouTube]] is generally free and open. Diverse sources of national and international information are available via the Internet. Anonymous communication, encrypted communications, and the use of security tools is not prohibited.&lt;ref name=FOTN-Ecuador-2013/&gt;

There were no government restrictions on access to the Internet or credible reports that the government monitored e-mail or Internet chat rooms. However, on 11 July 2012 the government passed a new telecommunications regulation, requiring that Internet service providers fulfill all information requests from the superintendent of telecommunications, allowing access to client addresses and information without a judicial order.&lt;ref&gt;[https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2012&amp;dlid=204448 &quot;Ecuador&quot;], ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012'', Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. department of State. Retrieved 27 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard [[defamation]] laws apply to content posted online. Attempts to censor statements made in times of heightened political sensitivity have been reported, as have alleged instances of censorship via the overly broad application of [[copyright]] to content critical of the government. Lawsuits have been filed against digital news sites for comments critical of the government. In order to utilize the services provided by cybercafes, the national secretary of telecommunications, SENATEL, requires that users register with the following information: full name, phone number, passport number, voting certificate number, email address, and home address.&lt;ref name=FOTN-Ecuador-2013/&gt;

[[Self-censorship]] of comments critical of the government is encouraged. In January 2013, for example, [[Rafael Correa|President Correa]] called for the National Secretary of Intelligence (SENAIN) to investigate two Twitter users who had published disparaging comments about him, an announcement which sent a warning to others not to post comments critical of the president. After receiving criticism from the government, news site [[La Hora]] indefinitely suspended the reader comments section on its website. At the president's request, the comments section was shut down completely. Print and digital news outlet [[El Comercio (Ecuador)|El Comercio]] faced similar pressure related to its readers' comments and the comments section was ultimately disabled after President Correa sent a letter of complaint. While there are no official constraints on organizing protests over the Internet, warnings from the president stating that the act of protesting will be interpreted as &quot;an attempt to destabilize the government&quot; have undoubtedly discouraged some from organizing and participating in protests.&lt;ref name=FOTN-Ecuador-2013/&gt;

Ecuador's new &quot;Organic Law on Communications&quot; was passed in June 2013. The law recognizes a right to communication.  Media companies are required to collect and store user information. &quot;Media lynching&quot;, which appears to extend to any accusation of corruption or investigation of a public official—even those that are supported with evidence, is prohibited. Websites bear &quot;ultimate responsibility&quot; for all content they host, including content authored by third parties. The law creates a new media regulator to prohibit the dissemination of &quot;unbalanced&quot; information and bans non-degreed journalists from publishing, effectively outlawing much investigative reporting and citizen journalism. Human rights organizations fear that the new law will stifle critical voices in the media, due to its vague wording, arbitrary sanctions, and the threat of civil and criminal penalties.&lt;ref name=FOTN-Ecuador-2013/&gt;
