{{History of Eritrea}}
{{weasel words|date=December 2017}} {{npov|date=December 2017}} 
&quot;Eritrea&quot; is an ancient name, associated in the past with its [[Greek language|Greek]] form ''Erythraia'', Ἐρυθραία, and its derived [[Latin]] form ''Erythræa''. This name relates to that of the [[Red Sea]], then called the ''Erythræan Sea'', from the Greek for &quot;red&quot;, ἐρυθρός, ''erythros''. The [[Italians]] created the colony of Eritrea in the 19th century around [[Asmara]], and named it with its current name. After [[World War II]] Eritrea was annexed to Ethiopia. In 1991 the [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front]] defeated the [[Ethiopia]]n government. [[Eritrea]] officially celebrated its 1st anniversary of independence on May 24, 1991.

==Prehistory==
{{contains Ethiopic text|compact=yes}}
At Buya in Eritrea, one of the oldest [[hominid]]s representing a possible link between ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and an archaic ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'' was found by Italian scientists. Dated to over 1 million years old, it is the oldest skeletal find of its kind and provides a link between hominids and the earliest [[anatomically modern humans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=0-07-913665-6|title=[[McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology]]|edition=9th|publisher=The McGraw Hill Companies Inc.|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the section of the [[Danakil Depression]] in Eritrea was also a major player in terms of human evolution, and may contain other traces of evolution from ''Homo erectus'' hominids to anatomically modern humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exn.ca/hominids/pleistocenepark.cfm|title=Pleistocene Park|accessdate=2006-10-02|date=1999-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last interglacial period, the [[Red Sea]] coast of Eritrea was occupied by early anatomically modern humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10811218&quot;&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Walter RC, Buffler RT, Bruggemann JH, etal |title=Early human occupation of the Red Sea coast of Eritrea during the last interglacial |journal=Nature |volume=405 |issue=6782 |pages=65–9 |year=2000|pmid=10811218 |doi=10.1038/35011048}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the area was on the route out of Africa that some scholars suggest was used by early humans to colonize the rest of the Old World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walter|first=Robert C.|date=2000-05-04|title=Early human occupation of the Red Sea coast of Eritrea during the lastinterglacial|journal=Nature|volume=405|pages=65–69|doi=10.1038/35011048|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v405/n6782/full/405065a0.html|accessdate=2006-10-02|pmid=10811218|last2=Buffler|first2=RT|last3=Bruggemann|first3=JH|last4=Guillaume|first4=MM|last5=Berhe|first5=SM|last6=Negassi|first6=B|last7=Libsekal|first7=Y|last8=Cheng|first8=H|last9=Edwards|first9=RL|last10=von Cosel|first10=Rudo|last11=Néraudeau|first11=Didier|last12=Gagnon|first12=Mario|issue=6782|display-authors=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the Eritrean Research Project Team composed of Eritrean, Canadian, American, Dutch and French scientists discovered a [[Paleolithic]] site with stone and obsidian tools dated to over 125,000 years old near the [[Gulf of Zula|Bay of Zula]] south of [[Massawa]], along the Red Sea littoral. The tools are believed to have been used by early humans to harvest marine resources like clams and oysters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exn.ca/hominids/outofafrica.cfm|accessdate=2006-10-02|title=Out of Africa|date=1999-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to linguists, the first [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]-speaking populations arrived in the region during the ensuing [[Neolithic]] era from the family's proposed [[Afroasiatic Urheimat|urheimat]] (&quot;original homeland&quot;) in the [[Nile Valley]],&lt;ref&gt;Zarins, Juris (1990), &quot;Early Pastoral Nomadism and the Settlement of Lower Mesopotamia&quot;, (Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research)&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;Diamond J, Bellwood P (2003) Farmers and Their Languages: The First Expansions SCIENCE 300, {{doi|10.1126/science.1078208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars propose that the Afroasiatic family developed in situ in the Horn, with its speakers subsequently dispersing from there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blench143144&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blench|first1=R.|title=Archaeology, Language, and the African Past|date=2006|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=0759104662|pages=143–144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esFy3Po57A8C|accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Punt===
{{main article|Land of Punt}}
[[File:Queen of punt.jpg|thumb|right|Queen Ati, wife of King Perahu of the [[Land of Punt]], as depicted on Pharaoh [[Hatshepsut]]'s temple at [[Deir el-Bahri]].]]
Together with [[Djibouti]], [[Ethiopia]], northern [[Somalia]], and the [[Red Sea]] coast of [[Sudan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andebrhan Welde Giorgis|title=Eritrea at a Crossroads: A Narrative of Triumph, Betrayal and Hope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CzlEAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21|year=2014|publisher=Strategic Book Publishing|isbn=978-1-62857-331-2|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eritrea is considered the most likely location of the land known to the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians as ''[[Land of Punt|Punt]]'', whose first mention dates to the 25th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Najovits, Simson (2004) ''Egypt, trunk of the tree, Volume 2'', Algora Publishing, p. 258, {{ISBN|087586256X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Puntites were a nation of people that had close relations with [[Pharaoh|Pharaonic Egypt]] during the times of [[Pharaoh]] [[Sahure]] and [[Queen regnant|Queen]] [[Hatshepsut]].

In 2010, a genetic study was conducted on the mummified remains of [[baboon]]s that were brought back as gifts from Punt by the ancient Egyptians. Led by a research team from the [[Egyptian Museum]] and the [[University of California]], the scientists used oxygen [[isotope]] analysis to examine hairs from two baboon mummies that had been preserved in the [[British Museum]]. One of the baboons had distorted isotopic data, so the other's oxygen isotope values were compared to those of present-day baboon specimens from regions of interest. The researchers found that the mummies most closely matched modern baboon specimens in Eritrea and Ethiopia, which they suggested implied that Punt was likely a narrow region that included eastern Ethiopia, Somalia, and all of Eritrea.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.co.uk&quot;&gt;Owen Jarus ,{{cite web|title= Baboon mummy analysis reveals Eritrea and Ethiopia as location of land of Punt |accessdate= 26 April 2010 |work= The Independent|date= 26 April 2010 |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/history/baboon-mummy-analysis-reveals-eritrea-and-ethiopia-as-location-of-land-of-punt-1954547.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ona Culture===
[[File:SembelExcavation.jpg|thumb|right|Excavation of archaeological site outside of [[Sembel]].]]
Excavations at [[Sembel]] found evidence of an ancient pre-[[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksumite]] civilization in greater Asmara. This Ona urban culture is believed to have been among the earliest pastoral and agricultural communities in the Horn region. Artefacts at the site have been dated to between 800 BC and 400 BC, contemporaneous with other pre-Aksumite settlements in the Eritrean and Ethiopian highlands during the mid-first millennium BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmidt&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmidt|first1=Peter R.|title=The 'Ona' culture of greater Asmara: archaeology's liberation of Eritrea's ancient history from colonial paradigms|journal=Journal of Eritrean Studies|date=2002|volume=1|issue=1|pages=29–58|url=http://www.africabib.org/rec.php?RID=270036407&amp;DB=p|accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the Ona culture may have had connections with the ancient Land of Punt. In a tomb in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] dated to the reign of Pharaoh [[Amenhotep II|Amenophis II]] (Amenhotep II), long-necked pots similar to those made by the Ona people are depicted as part of the cargo in a ship from Punt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Avanzini&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Avanzini|first1=Alessandra|title=Profumi d'Arabia: atti del convegno|date=1997|publisher=L'ERMA di BRETSCHNEIDER|isbn=8870629759|page=280|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3zOlYZmJiiAC|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kingdom of D'mt===
{{main article|Dʿmt}}
[[File:Africa in 400 BC.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the Kingdom of [[D'mt]] in Eritrea and northern [[Ethiopia]], circa 400 BC.]]
[[D'mt]] was a kingdom that encompassed most of Eritrea and the northern fringes of Ethiopia, it existed during the 8th and 7th centuries BC. Given the presence of a massive temple complex, its capital was most likely [[Yeha, Ethiopia|Yeha]]. [[Qohaito]], often identified as the town ''Koloe'' in the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'',&lt;ref&gt;G.W.B. Huntingford, ''Historical Geography of Ethiopia from the first century AD to 1704'' (London: British Academy, 1989), pp. 38f&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Matara, Eritrea|Matara]] were important ancient D'mt kingdom cities in southern Eritrea.

The realm developed [[irrigation]] schemes, used [[plow]]s, grew [[millet]], and made [[iron]] tools and weapons. After the fall of Dʿmt in the 5th century BC, the plateau came to be dominated by smaller successor kingdoms until the rise of one of these polities during the first century, the [[Kingdom of Aksum]], which was able to reunite the area.&lt;ref&gt;Pankhurst, Richard K.P.

===Kingdom of Aksum===
{{main article|Kingdom of Aksum}}
[[File:LocationAksumiteEmpire.png|thumb|right|The [[Kingdom of Aksum]]'s realm.]]
The [[Kingdom of Aksum]] was a trading empire centered in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=1 Nov 2012|edition=Second|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xeJMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=Aksum+eritrea&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Hh7NUozMMKb07AaFmYCADQ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Aksum%20eritrea&amp;f=false|author=David Phillipson: revised by Michael DiBlasi|editor=Neil Asher Silberman}}&lt;/ref&gt; It existed from approximately 100–940 AD, growing from the proto-Aksumite [[Iron Age]] period c. 4th century BC to achieve prominence by the 1st century AD.

The Aksumites established bases on the northern highlands of the Ethiopian Plateau and from there expanded southward. The [[Sassanid Empire|Persia]]n religious figure [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] listed Axum with [[Roman Empire|Rome]], Persia, and [[China]] as one of the four great powers of his time. The origins of the Axumite Kingdom are unclear, although experts have offered their speculations about it. Even whom should be considered the earliest known king is contested: although [[Carlo Conti Rossini]] proposed that [[Zoskales]] of Axum, mentioned in the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'', should be identified with one Za Haqle mentioned in the Ethiopian King Lists (a view embraced by later historians of Ethiopia such as Yuri M. Kobishchanov&lt;ref&gt;Yuri M. Kobishchanov, ''Axum'', Joseph W. Michels, editor; Lorraine T. Kapitanoff, translator, (University Park, Pennsylvania: University of Pennsylvania, 1979), pp.54–59.&lt;/ref&gt; and Sergew Hable Sellasie), [[G.W.B. Huntingford]] argued that Zoskales was only a sub-king whose authority was limited to [[Adulis]], and that Conti Rossini's identification can not be substantiated.&lt;ref&gt;Expressed, for example, in his ''The Historical Geography of Ethiopia'' (London: the British Academy, 1989), p.39.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the medieval ''Liber Axumae'' ([[Book of Aksum]]), Aksum's first capital, Mazaber, was built by Itiyopis, son of Cush.&lt;ref name=&quot;Agrvt&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Africa Geoscience Review, Volume 10|date=2003|publisher=Rock View International|page=366|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QWBPAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munro-Hay cites the Muslim historian [[Abu Ja'far al-Khwarazmi]]/Kharazmi (who wrote before 833) as stating that the capital of &quot;the kingdom of Habash&quot; was [[Jarma]] (hypothetically from Ge'ez ''girma'', &quot;remarkable, revered&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', pp.95–98.&lt;/ref&gt; The capital was later moved to [[Axum|Aksum]] in northern Ethiopia. The Kingdom used the name &quot;Ethiopia&quot; as early as the 4th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Munro-Hay57&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | author=Stuart Munro-Hay | url=http://www.dskmariam.org/artsandlitreature/litreature/pdf/aksum.pdf | title=Aksum: An African Civilization of Late Antiquity | location=Edinburgh | publisher=University Press | year=1991 | page=57 | accessdate=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul B. Henze, ''Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aksumites erected a number of large [[Stele|stelae]], which served a religious purpose in pre-[[Christianity|Christian]] times. One of these granite columns is the largest such structure in the world, standing at 90 feet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eospvo&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Brockman|first=Norbert|title=Encyclopedia of Sacred Places, Volume 1|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=159884654X|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JkSk4euA-TEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 320–360), Aksum later adopted [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Munro-Hay&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Munro-Hay|first1=Stuart C.|title=Aksum: An African Civilisation of Late Antiquity|date=1991|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=0748601066|page=77|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RlRzAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 615, during the lifetime of [[Muhammad]], the Aksumite King [[Sahama]] provided asylum to early [[Muslim]]s from [[Mecca]] fleeing persecution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stuart Munro-Hay, Aksum, p.56&quot;&gt;Stuart Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', p.56.&lt;/ref&gt; This journey is known in [[Islamic history]] as the [[Migration to Abyssinia|First Hijra]]. The area is also the alleged resting place of the [[Ark of the Covenant]] and the purported home of the [[Queen of Sheba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Paul |last=Raffaele|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/ark-covenant-200712.html?c=y&amp;page=1 |title=Keepers of the Lost Ark?|journal=Smithsonian Magazine|date=December 2007 |accessdate= 5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Stela aksum.jpg|thumb|left|[[King Ezana's Stele]] in [[Axum]].]]
The kingdom is mentioned in the ''Periplus of the Erythraean Sea'' as an important market place for [[Ivory trade|ivory]], which was exported throughout the ancient world. Aksum was at the time ruled by Zoskales, who also governed the port of Adulis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Periplusme&quot;&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/periplus.html ''Periplus of the Erythreaean Sea''], chs. 4, 5&lt;/ref&gt; The Aksumite rulers facilitated trade by minting their own [[Aksumite currency]].

The state also established its hegemony over the declining [[Kingdom of Kush]] and regularly entered the politics of the kingdoms on the [[Arabian peninsula]], eventually extending its rule over the region with the conquest of the [[Himyarite Kingdom]]. Inscriptions have been found in [[Southern Arabia]] celebrating victories over one [[GDRT]], described as &quot;''nagashi'' of [[Habesha people|Habashat]] [i.e. Abyssinia] and of Axum.&quot; Other dated inscriptions are used to determine a ''floruit'' for GDRT (interpreted as representing a Ge'ez name such as Gadarat, Gedur, or Gedara) around the beginning of the 3rd century. A bronze scepter or wand has been discovered at [[Atsbi Dera]] with in inscription mentioning &quot;GDR of Axum&quot;. Coins showing the royal portrait began to be minted under King [[Endubis]] toward the end of the 3rd century.

Additionally, expeditions by [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]] into the [[Kingdom of Kush]] at [[Meroe]] in Sudan may have brought about the latter polity's demise, though there is evidence that the kingdom was experiencing a period of decline beforehand. As a result of Ezana's expansions, Aksum bordered the Roman [[Aegyptus (Roman province)|province of Egypt]]. The degree of Aksum's control over Yemen is uncertain. Though there is little evidence supporting Aksumite control of the region at that time, his title, which includes ''king of Saba and Salhen, Himyar and Dhu-Raydan'' (all in modern-day Yemen), along with gold Aksumite coins with the inscriptions, &quot;king of the ''[[Habesha|Habshat]]''&quot; or &quot;Habashite,&quot; indicate that Aksum might have retained some legal or actual footing in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Details of the Aksumite Kingdom, never abundant, become even more scarce after this point. The last king known to mint coins is [[Armah]], whose coinage refers to the Persian conquest of Jerusalem in 614. Stuart Munro-Hay believes that Axum had been abandoned as the capital by Sahama's reign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stuart Munro-Hay, Aksum, p.56&quot;/&gt; However, Kobishchanov suggests that Ethiopians retained hegemony over the Arabian ports until at least as late as 702.&lt;ref&gt;Kobishchanov, ''Axum'', p.116.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-classical period==

===Early developments===
[[File:Sheikh Hanafi Mosque (8529064326).jpg|thumb|right|[[Massawa]]'s Sheikh Hanafi Mosque, built in the 15th century.]]
From the late first to early second millenium Eritrea witnessed a period of migrations: Since the late 7th century, so with the decline of Aksum, large parts of Eritrea, including the highlands, were overrun by pagan [[Beja people|Beja]], who supposedly founded several kingdoms on its soil, like [[Kingdom of Belgin|Baqlin]], [[Kingdom of Jarin|Jarin]] and [[Kingdom of Qita'a|Qata]].&lt;ref&gt;Dan Connell, Tom Killion (2011): &quot;Historical Dictionary of Eritrea&quot;. The Scarecrow. Lanham, Toronto, Plymouth. p. 118-119&lt;/ref&gt; The Beja rule declined in the 13th century. Subsequently, the Beja were expelled from the highlands by Abyssinian settlers from the south.&lt;ref&gt;Kjetil Tronvoll (1998): &quot;Mai Weini, a Highland Village in Eritrea: A Study of the People&quot;. p. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; An other people, the [[Bellou (people)|Bellou]], originated from a smiliar millieu as the Beja. They appeared first in the 12th century, from then on they dominated parts of northwestern Eritrea until the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Connell, Tom Killion (2011): &quot;Historical Dictionary of Eritrea&quot;. The Scarecrow. Lanham, Toronto, Plymouth. p. 120-121&lt;/ref&gt; After 1270, with the destruction of the [[Zagwe Dynasty|Zagwe Kingdom]], many [[Agaw]] fled to what is now Eritrea. Most were culturally and linguistically assimilated  into the local Tigrinya culture, with the notable exception of the [[Bilen people|Bilen]].&lt;ref&gt;Mussie Tesfagiorgis (2010): &quot;Eritrea&quot;. ABC-CLIO. p. 33-34&lt;/ref&gt; Yet an other people that arrived after the fall of Aksum were the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic-speaking]] [[Saho people|Saho]], who had established themselves in the highlands until the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Connell, Tom Killion (2011): &quot;Historical Dictionary of Eritrea&quot;. The Scarecrow. Lanham, Toronto, Plymouth. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Eritrea witnessed a very slow, but steady intrusion of Islam. Muslims had already reached Eritrea in 613/615, during the [[First Hijra]]. In 702, muslim pirates conquered the [[Dahlak archipelago|Dahlak islands]]. In 1060, a Yemeni dynasty fled to Dahlak and proclaimed the [[Sultanate of Dahlak]], which would last for almost 500 years. This sultanate also had sovereignty over the port town of [[Massawa]].&lt;ref&gt;Dan Connell, Tom Killion (2011): &quot;Historical Dictionary of Eritrea&quot;. The Scarecrow. Lanham, Toronto, Plymouth. p. 159-160&lt;/ref&gt;

===15th century to the Italian arrival===
The 15th century saw the rise of a new kingdom, [[Medri Bahri]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pankhurst (1997): &quot;The Ethiopian Borderlands: Essays in Regional History from Ancient Times to the End of the 18th Century&quot;.

Lawrenceville.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, this area has been known as ''Ma'ikele Bahr'' (&quot;between the seas/rivers,&quot; i.e. the land between the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Mareb River|Mereb river]]), but during the reign of emperor [[Zara Yaqob of Ethiopia|Zara Yaqob]] it was rebranded as the domain of the Bahr Negash, the [[Medri Bahri]] (&quot;Sea land&quot; in Tigrinya, although it included some areas like [[Shire, Ethiopia|Shire]] on the other side of the Mereb, today in Ethiopia).&lt;ref&gt;Taddesse Tamrat, Church and State in Ethiopia (1270–1527) (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972), p.74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Kendie, ''The Five Dimensions of the Eritrean Conflict 1941–2004: Deciphering the Geo-Political Puzzle''.

(page 20)&lt;/ref&gt; the state's main provinces were [[Hamasien]], [[Serae]] and [[Akele Guzai]].

===Establishment===
[[File:Italian Eritrea 1922.jpg|thumb|right|1922 map of [[Italian Eritrea]].]]
The boundaries of the present-day Eritrea nation state were established during the [[Scramble for Africa]]. In 1869&lt;ref name=Ully&gt;[[Edward Ullendorff|Ullendorff, Edward]]. ''The Ethiopians: An Introduction to Country and People'' 2nd&amp;nbsp;ed., p.&amp;nbsp;90. [[Oxford University Press]] (London), 1965). {{ISBN|0-19-285061-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or ’70, the then ruling Sultan of [[Raheita]] sold lands surrounding the Bay of [[Assab]] to the Rubattino Shipping Company.&lt;ref name=EBAb&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Eritrea |volume=9 |page=747}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area served as a [[coaling station]] along the [[shipping lane]]s introduced by the recently completed [[Suez Canal]]. It had long been part of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Habesh Eyalet]] centered in [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Egypt/3 History |display=Egypt: Section III: History |volume=9 |page=90–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Italian settlers arrived in 1880.&lt;ref name=EBAb/&gt;

Later, as the Egyptians retreated out of Sudan during the [[Mahdist War|Mahdist rebellion]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] brokered an agreement whereby the Egyptians could retreat through Ethiopia, and in exchange they would allow the Emperor to occupy those lowland districts that he had disputed with the Turks and Egyptians. Emperor [[Yohannes IV of Ethiopia|Yohannes IV]] believed this included Massawa, but instead, the port was handed by the Egyptians and the British to the Italians, who united it with the already colonised port of [[Asseb]] to form a coastal Italian possession. The Italians took advantage of disorder in northern Ethiopia following the death of Emperor Yohannes IV in 1889 to occupy the highlands and established their new colony, henceforth known as Eritrea, and received recognition from [[Menelik II]], Ethiopia's new Emperor.

The Italian possession of maritime areas previously claimed by Abyssinia/Ethiopia was formalized in 1889 with the signing of the [[Treaty of Wuchale]] with [[Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia]] (r. 1889–1913) after the defeat of Italy by Ethiopia at the battle of [[Adua]] where Italy launched an effort to expand its possessions from Eritrea into the more fertile Abyssinian hinterland. Menelik would later renounce the Wuchale Treaty as he had been tricked by the translators to agree to making the whole of Ethiopia into an Italian protectorate. However, he was forced by circumstance to live by the tenets of Italian sovereignty over Eritrea.

In the vacuum that followed the [[Battle of Gallabat|1889 death]] of [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Yohannes IV|Yohannes&amp;nbsp;II]], Gen.&amp;thinsp;[[Oreste Baratieri]] occupied the highlands along the Eritrean coast and Italy proclaimed the establishment of the new colony of [[Italian Eritrea]], a colony of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]]. In the [[Treaty of Wuchale]] (It.&amp;nbsp;''Uccialli'') signed the same year, [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|King Menelik]] of [[Shewa]], a southern Ethiopian kingdom, recognized the Italian occupation of his rivals' lands of [[Bogos]], [[Hamasien]], [[Akkele Guzay]], and [[Serae]] in exchange for guarantees of financial assistance and continuing access to European arms and ammunition. His subsequent victory over his rival kings and enthronement as [[emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelek&amp;nbsp;II]] (r.&amp;nbsp;1889–1913) made the treaty formally binding upon the entire territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Abyssinia |volume=1 |pages=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Asmara Church.jpeg|thumb|left|Church of Our Lady of the Rosary built in 1923 in Asmara.]]

In 1888, the Italian administration launched its first development projects in the new colony. The [[Eritrean Railway]] was completed to [[Saati]] in 1888,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. engineer Emilio Olivieri's {{cite web|url=http://www.ferroviaeritrea.it/la_ferrovia_massauasaati.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012032531/http://www.ferroviaeritrea.it/la_ferrovia_massauasaati.htm |archivedate=2013-10-12 |df= }} report on the construction of the Massawa–Saati Railway] (1888), hosted at ''Ferrovia Eritrea''. {{in lang|it}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reached [[Asmara]] in the highlands in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.ferroviaeritrea.it/contenuti.htm Eritrean Railway] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203050814/http://www.ferroviaeritrea.it/contenuti.htm |date=2008-02-03 }}&quot; at ''Ferrovia Eritrea''. {{in lang|it}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Asmara-Massawa Cableway|Asmara–Massawa Cableway]] was the longest line in the world during its time, but was later dismantled by the British in World War II. Besides major infrastructural projects, the colonial authorities invested significantly in the agricultural sector. It also oversaw the provision of urban amenities in Asmara and Massawa, and employed many Eritreans in public service, particularly in the police and public works departments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ferroviaeritrea.it/contenuti.htm Eritrea- Contenuti] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203050814/http://www.ferroviaeritrea.it/contenuti.htm |date=2008-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thousands of Eritreans were concurrently enlisted in the army, serving during the [[Italo-Turkish War]] in Libya as well as the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War|First]] and [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|second]] Italo-Abyssinian Wars.

Additionally, the Italian Eritrea administration opened a number of new factories, which produced buttons, cooking oil, pasta, construction materials, packing meat, tobacco, hide and other household commodities. In 1939, there were around 2,198 factories and most of the employees were Eritrean citizens. The establishment of industries also made an increase in the number of both Italians and Eritreans residing in the cities. The number of Italians residing in the territory increased from 4,600 to 75,000 in five years; and with the involvement of Eritreans in the industries, trade and fruit plantation was expanded across the nation, while some of the plantations were owned by Eritreans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shabait.com/about-eritrea/history-a-culture/450-italian-administration-in-eritrea  Italian administration in Eritrea]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, [[Benito Mussolini]]'s rise to power in Italy brought profound changes to the colonial government in Italian Eritrea. After ''[[il Duce]]'' declared the birth of the [[Italian Empire]] in May 1936, Italian Eritrea (enlarged with northern Ethiopia's regions) and [[Italian Somaliland]] were merged with the just conquered Ethiopia in the new [[Italian East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana'') administrative territory. This [[Fascists|Fascist]] period was characterized by imperial expansion in the name of a &quot;new Roman Empire&quot;. Eritrea was chosen by the Italian government to be the industrial center of Italian East Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dankalia.com/history/04503.htm Italian industries in colonial Eritrea] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429102012/http://www.dankalia.com/history/04503.htm |date=April 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italians brought to Eritrea a huge [[Roman Catholicism in Eritrea|development of Catholicism]]. By 1940, nearly one third of the territory's population was Catholic, mainly in Asmara where many churches were built.

===Asmara development===
[[File:Fiat tagliero, 08.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Fiat Tagliero Building]] in Asmara, built in 1938.]]
[[Asmara, Eritrea|Italian Asmara]] was populated by a large Italian community and the city acquired an Italian architectural look. One of the first building was the [[Asmara President's Office]]: this former &quot;Italian government's palace&quot; was built in 1897 by [[Ferdinando Martini]], the first Italian governor of Eritrea. The Italian government wanted to create in [[Asmara]] an impressive building, from where the Italian Governors could show the dedication of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] to the &quot;colonia primogenita&quot; (first daughter-colony) as was called Eritrea.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinando Martini.''RELAZIONE SULLA COLONIA ERITREA'' – Atti Parlamentari – Legislatura XXI – Seconda Sessione 1902 – Documento N. XVI -Tipografia della Camera dei Deputati. Roma, 1902&lt;/ref&gt;

Today Asmara is worldwide known for its early twentieth-century Italian buildings, including the [[Art Deco]] [[Cinema Impero]], &quot;Cubist&quot; Africa Pension, eclectic [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahdo Church|Orthodox Cathedral]] and former [[Opera House]], the [[futurist architecture|futurist]] [[Fiat Tagliero Building]], the [[neo-Romanesque architecture|neo-Romanesque]] [[Church of Our Lady of the Rosary, Asmara]], and the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] [[Governor's Palace (Asmara)|Governor's Palace]]. The city is littered with Italian [[Colonisation|colonial]] [[villa]]s and mansions. Most of central Asmara was built between 1935 and 1941, so effectively the Italians managed to build almost an entire city, in just six years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reviving Asmara&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Reviving Asmara |publisher=BBC Radio 3 |date=2005-06-19 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/africalives/ram/reviving_asmara01.ram |accessdate=2006-08-30 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Asmara, Eritrea|Italian Asmara]] had a population of 98,000, of which 53,000 were Italians according to the Italian census of 1939. This fact made Asmara the main &quot;Italian town&quot; of the [[Italian empire]] in Africa.In all Eritrea the [[Italian Eritreans]] were 75,000 in that year.[http://www.maitacli.it/]

Many industrial investments were done by the Italians in the area of Asmara and [[Massawa]], but the beginning of [[World War II]] stopped the blossoming industrialization of Eritrea. When the British army [[East African Campaign (World War II)|conquered Eritrea]] from the Italians in spring 1941, most of the infrastructure and the industrial areas were extremely damaged.
[[Image:Italian East Africa (1938–1941).svg|thumb|right|300px|The biggest extension of Eritrea was reached during the [[Italian empire]] (1936–1941), when northern parts of conquered Ethiopia were assigned to Eritrea by the Italians as a reward for the Eritrean &quot;Ascaris'&quot; help in the conquest of Ethiopia]]

The following [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia|Italian guerrilla war]] was supported by many Eritrean colonial troops until the Italian armistice in September 1943. Eritrea was placed under [[British Empire|British]] military administration after the Italian surrender in World War II.

The [[Italian Eritreans]] strongly rejected the Ethiopian annexation of Eritrea after the war: the ''Party of Shara Italy'' of Dr. [[David DiMeglio|Vincenzo Di Meglio]] was established in Asmara in July 1947, and majority of the members were former Italian soldiers and many [[Eritrean Ascari]] (the organization was even backed up by the government of Italy). This party ruled by Dr. Di Meglio obtained in 1947 the dismissal of a proposal to divide Eritrea between Sudan and Ethiopia.

The main objective of this italo-Eritrean party was Eritrea freedom, but they had a pre-condition that stated that before independence the country should be governed by Italy for at least 15 years (like happened with [[Italian Somalia]]).

==British administration and federalisation==
{{refimprove|date=April 2016}}
British forces defeated the Italian army in Eritrea in 1941 at the [[Battle of Keren]] and placed the colony under British military administration until [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] could determine its fate. The first thing the British did was to remove the Eritrean industries (of Asmara and Massawa) to Kenya, as war compensation. They even dismantled parts of the [[Eritrean Railway]] system.&lt;ref&gt;First reported by [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] in her book, ''Eritrea on the Eve'' (1947). See Michela Wrong, ''I didn't do it for you: How the World betrayed a small African nation'' (New York: HarperCollins, 2005), chapter 6 &quot;The Feminist Fuzzy-wuzzy&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of agreement amongst the Allies concerning the status of Eritrea, British administration continued for the remainder of World War II until 1950. During the immediate postwar years, the British proposed that Eritrea be divided along religious lines and parceled off to [[Sudan]] and Ethiopia. The [[Soviet Union]], anticipating an [[Italian Communist Party]] victory in the [[Italian general election, 1946|Italian polls]], initially supported returning Eritrea to Italy under [[Chapter XII of the United Nations Charter|trusteeship]] or as a colony. Soviet diplomats, led by [[Maxim Litvinov]] and backed by [[Ivan Maisky]] and [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], even attempted to have Eritrea become a trustee of the Soviet Union itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vojtech Mastny]], ''The Cold War and Soviet Insecurity: The Stalin Years'' (New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 1996), pp. 23–24; Vladimir O. Pechatnov, &quot;[https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/ACF17F.PDF The Big Three After World War II: New Documents on Soviet Thinking about Post-War Relations with the United States and Great Britain]&quot; ([[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] Cold War International History Project Working Paper 13, May 1995), pp. 19–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arab states, seeing Eritrea and its large Muslim population as an extension of the Arab world, sought the establishment of an independent state. There are only two main Christian-Muslim conflicts reported in Asmara, Eritrea (the Ethiopians supported by the Unionist Party played a big role in it), one was in 1946 where Sudanese Defence Forces were involved, and the other was in February 1950. This note is about that of 1950.

The UN Commission (UNC) arrived in Eritrea on February 9 and began its months-long inquiry 5 days later. Unionist Shifta activities supported by Ethiopia increased after its arrival, they became daring, better planned, better coordinated and innovative. The main target of the shifta was to disrupt the free movement of the UNC in areas controlled by the independence bloc supporters. The shifta attempted to prevent the rural population that supported independence from having an audience with the UNC. They targeted transportation and communication systems. Telephone lines connecting Asmara with major cities of the predominantely areas pro-independence areas of the western lowlands and Masswa were continuously cut.

An active Muslim League local leader, from Mai Derese, Bashai Nessredin Saeed was killed by the Unionist Shifta at Emba Derho train station where he worked as a station manager, on February 20. According to an account of the incident written by Mufti Sheikh Ibrahim Al Mukhtar, at 07:30 in the evening of a Monday that date  5 shifta came and fired several bullets at him while he was on duty, He was critically wounded and was taken to Asmara immediately but died on the way. The reason for the killing was that they had asked him to abandon the Muslim League and join the Unionist Party (UP), but he refused. The killing sparked an outrage among Muslims in Asmara and a lot of people turned up the next day for his funeral to show their stand against the terrorist activities of the UP. A well organised funeral procession was arranged and attended by youth and Muslim dignitaries. The procession passed through three main streets before they reached the street where the UP Office was located. According to the Mufti, then the UP members started first to throw stones at the procession which was followed by three grenades and then chaos followed. There was open confrontation between both sides and many were killed and injured from both sides. The Police intervened by firing live ammunition, but the confrontations continued. Despite all this, the procession continued to the cemetery where the body was buried. The riots then spread to other areas and took a dangerous sectarian form. Many properties were also looted and burned. On Wednesday, the British Military Administration (BMA) declared a curfew from 5{{nbsp}}pm to 5{{nbsp}}am, but the riots continued, On Friday the curfew was extended to 22 hours.

On Thursday, the BMA administrator called for a meeting that included the Mufti and Abuna Marcos and asked them to calm the people and ask for reconciliation and both agreed. The next day a convoy of four cars: (In the first car were armed Police, in the 2nd was the Asmara Administrator with his Arabic translator, in the third were the Mufti and the Abuna and in the 4th was the Asmara &amp; Hamassein Judge and the vice of the Abuna) moved to the districts of ‘Geza Berhanu’, Edaga Arbi, Akhria, Edaga Hamus, Aba Shawl, Hadish  Adi and Gaza Banda. In each location people were addressed with microphones to gather in both Arabic and Tigrinya and were told that the Police will not harm them. In places where there were a majority of Christians the Abuna will address them first and later the Mufti calling the people to end the violence and vice versa in the other locations where the majority were Muslims. Later the people were told to go back to their homes. In the evening the Mufti and the Abuna went to the Radio Station and advised the citizens to end violence. The wise men from both sides accepted the call, but the looting of properties of Muslim merchants continued for 3 more days before the riots came to an end.

On Saturday 25 February, the Copts met at the main church and Muslims at the grand mosque and discussed ways to end the violence. Both sides agreed to take an oath to prevent violence against each other. Each side appointed a four-member committee to oversee the agreements. Later 31 members from each side took an oath in front of the eight member committee. To prevent further violence in other areas, the committee of both sides decided to visit the Muslim and Christian cemeteries and lied flowers on the graveyard of the victims of both sides. More than 62 persons were killed and more than 180 were injured and the damage on the properties was huge. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} This way the riots where the Ethiopian Laison Officer played a big role to ignite was brought to an end by the wise religious leaders and elders of both sides.

Ethiopian ambition in the Horn was apparent in the expansionist ambition of its monarch when [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]] claimed Italian Somaliland and Eritrea. He made this claim in a letter to Franklin D. Roosevelt, at the Paris Peace Conference and at the First Session of the United Nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;un&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Habte Selassie |first=Bereket |title=Eritrea and the United Nations |ISBN= 0-932415-12-1 |publisher=Red Sea Press|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Nations the debate over the fate of the former Italian colonies continued. The British and Americans preferred to cede Eritrea to the Ethiopians as a reward for their support during [[World War II]]. &quot;The United States and the United Kingdom have (similarly) agreed to support the cession to Ethiopia of all of Eritrea except the Western province. The United States has given assurances to Ethiopia in this regard.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Top Secret Memorandum of 1949-03-05, written with the UN Third Session in view, from Mr. Rusk to the Secretary of State.&lt;/ref&gt; The Independence Bloc of Eritrean parties consistently requested from the UN General Assembly that a referendum be held immediately to settle the Eritrean question of sovereignty.

A [[United Nations]] (UN) commission was dispatched to the former colony in February 1950 in the absence of Allied agreement and in the face of Eritrean demands for self-determination. It was also at this juncture that the US Ambassador to the UN, [[John Foster Dulles]], said, &quot;From the point of view of justice, the opinions of the Eritrean people must receive consideration. ''Nevertheless'' the strategic interest of the United States in the Red Sea basin and the considerations of security and world peace make it necessary that the country has to be linked with our ''ally'' Ethiopia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heiden|first=Linda|title=The Eritrean Struggle for Independence|journal=Monthly Review|volume=30|issue=2|date=19 June 197978|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ambassador's word choice, along with the estimation of the British Ambassador in Addis Ababa, makes quite clear the fact that the Eritrea aspiration was for Independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;un&quot;/&gt;

The commission proposed the establishment of some form of association with Ethiopia, and the UN General Assembly on 2 December 1950 adopted that proposal along with a provision terminating British administration of Eritrea no later than 15 September 1952. The British, faced with a deadline for leaving, held [[Eritrean parliamentary election, 1952|Legislative Assembly elections]] on 25 and 26 March 1952, for a representative Assembly of 68 members, evenly divided between Christians and Muslims. This body in turn accepted a draft constitution put forward by the UN commissioner on 10 July. On 11 September 1952, Emperor Haile Selassie  ratified the constitution. The Representative Assembly subsequently became the Eritrean Assembly. In 1952 UN General Assembly Resolution 390 to federate Eritrea with Ethiopia went into effect.

The resolution ignored the wishes of Eritreans for independence, but guaranteed the population some democratic rights and a measure of autonomy. Some scholars have contended that the issue was a religious issue, between the Muslim lowland population desiring independence while the highland Christian population sought a union with Ethiopia. Other scholars, including the former Attorney-General of Ethiopia, [[Baraket Selassie|Bereket Habte Selassie]], contend that, &quot;religious tensions here and there...were exploited by the British, [but] most Eritreans (Christians and Moslems) were united in their goal of freedom and independence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;un&quot;/&gt; Almost immediately after the federation went into effect, however, these rights began to be abridged or violated. These pleas for independence and referendum augured poorly for the US, Britain and Ethiopia, as a confidential American estimate of Independence Party support amounted to 75% of Eritrea.&lt;ref&gt;Department of State, Incoming Telegram, received 1949-08-22, From Addis Ababa, signed MERREL, to Secretary of State, No. 171, 1949-08-19&lt;/ref&gt;

The details of Eritrea's association with Ethiopia were established by the [[UN General Assembly]] Resolution 390A (V) of 2 December 1950. It called for Eritrea and Ethiopia to be linked through a loose federal structure under the sovereignty of the Emperor. Eritrea was to have its own administrative and judicial structure, its own flag, and control over its domestic affairs, including police, local administration, and taxation.&lt;ref name=&quot;un&quot;/&gt; The federal government, which for all intents and purposes was the existing imperial government, was to control foreign affairs (including commerce), defense, finance, and transportation. As a result of a long history of a strong landowning peasantry and the virtual absence of serfdom in most parts of Eritrea, the bulk of Eritreans had developed a distinct sense of cultural identity and superiority vis-à-vis Ethiopians. This combined with the introduction of modern democracy into Eritrea by the British administration gave Eritreans a desire for political freedoms alien to Ethiopian political tradition. From the start of the federation, however, Haile Selassie attempted to undercut Eritrea’s independent status, a policy that alienated many Eritreans. The Emperor pressured Eritrea’s elected chief executive to resign, made Amharic the official language in place of Arabic and Tigrinya, terminated the use of the Eritrean flag, imposed censorship, and moved many businesses out of Eritrea. Finally, in 1962 Haile Selassie pressured the Eritrean Assembly to abolish the Federation and join the Imperial Ethiopian fold, much to the dismay of those in Eritrea who favored a more liberal political order.

==War for independence==
{{main article|Eritrean War of Independence}}
[[Image:Ethiopia and Eritrea attatched (Derg, PDR).png|thumb|right|Map of Eritrea attached to Ethiopia.]]
Militant opposition to the incorporation of Eritrea into Ethiopia had begun in 1958 with the founding of the [[Eritrean Liberation Movement]] (ELM), an organization made up mainly of students, intellectuals, and urban wage laborers. The ELM, under the leadership of [[Hamid Idris Awate]], a former [[Eritrean Ascari]], engaged in clandestine political activities intended to cultivate resistance to the centralizing policies of the imperial Ethiopian state. By 1962, however, the ELM had been discovered and destroyed by imperial authorities.

Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] unilaterally dissolved the Eritrean parliament and illegally  annexed the country in 1962. The war continued after Haile Selassie was ousted in a coup in 1974. The [[Derg]], the new Ethiopian government, was a [[Marxist]] military [[military dictatorship|junta]] led by [[strongman (political)|strongman]] [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]].

In 1960 Eritrean exiles in [[Cairo]] founded the [[Eritrean Liberation Front]] (ELF), which led the Eritrean independence struggle during the 1960s. In contrast to the ELM, from the outset the ELF was bent on waging armed struggle on behalf of Eritrean independence. The ELF was composed mainly of Eritrean Muslims from the rural lowlands on the western edge of the territory. In 1961 the ELF's political character was vague, but radical Arab states such as [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]] saw Eritrea as a predominantly Muslim region struggling to escape Ethiopian oppression and imperial domination. These two countries therefore supplied military and financial assistance to the ELF.

The ELF initiated military operations in 1961 and intensified its activities in response to the dissolution of the federation in 1962. By 1967 the ELF had gained considerable support among peasants, particularly in Eritrea's north and west, and around the port city of [[Massawa]]. Haile Selassie attempted to calm the growing unrest by visiting Eritrea and assuring its inhabitants that they would be treated as equals under the new arrangements. Although he doled out offices, money, and titles mainly to Christian highlanders in the hope of co-opting would-be Eritrean opponents in early 1967, the imperial secret police of Ethiopia also set up a wide network of informants in Eritrea and conducted disappearances, intimidations and assassinations among the same populace driving several prominent political figures into exile. Imperial police fired live ammunition killing scores of youngsters during several student demonstrations in Asmara in this time. The imperial army also actively perpetrated massacres until the ousting of the Emperor by the Derg in 1974.
[[File:Eritrean Independence War.gif|thumb|left|Map of the [[Eritrean War of Independence]]]]
By 1971 ELF activity had become enough of a threat that the emperor had declared [[martial law]] in Eritrea. He deployed roughly half of the Ethiopian army to contain the struggle. Internal disputes over strategy and tactics eventually led to the ELF's fragmentation and the founding in 1972 of the [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front]] (EPLF). The leadership of this multi-ethnic movement came to be dominated by leftist, Christian dissidents who spoke Tigrinya, Eritrea's predominant language. Sporadic armed conflict ensued between the two groups from 1972 to 1974, even as they fought Ethiopian forces.  By the late 1970s, the EPLF had become the dominant armed Eritrean group fighting against the Ethiopian Government, and [[Isaias Afewerki]] had emerged as its leader. Much of the material used to combat Ethiopia was captured from the army.

By 1977 the EPLF seemed poised to drive the Ethiopians out of Eritrea. However, that same year a massive airlift of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] arms to Ethiopia enabled the Ethiopian Army to regain the initiative and forced the EPLF to retreat to the bush. Between 1978 and 1986 the Derg launched eight unsuccessful major offensives against the independence movement. In 1988 the EPLF captured [[Afabet]], headquarters of the Ethiopian Army in northeastern Eritrea, putting approximately a third of the Ethiopian Army out of action and prompting the Ethiopian Army to withdraw from its garrisons in Eritrea's western lowlands. EPLF fighters then moved into position around [[Keren, Eritrea|Keren]], Eritrea's second-largest city. Meanwhile, other dissident movements were making headway throughout Ethiopia. At the end of the 1980s the Soviet Union informed Mengistu that it would not renew its defense and cooperation agreement. With the withdrawal of Soviet support and supplies, the Ethiopian Army's morale plummeted, and the EPLF, along with other Ethiopian rebel forces, began to advance on Ethiopian positions. In 1980 the [[Permanent Peoples' Tribunal]] determined that the right of the Eritrean people to self-determination does not represent a form of secession.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheEritreanCase&quot;&gt;

==Provisional Government and People's Front for Democracy and Justice==

The [[United States]] played a facilitative role in the peace talks in [[Washington, DC|Washington]] during the months leading up to the May 1991 fall of the Mengistu regime. In mid-May, Mengistu resigned as head of the Ethiopian Government and went into exile in [[Zimbabwe]], leaving a caretaker government in [[Addis Ababa]]. Having defeated the Ethiopian forces in Eritrea, EPLF troops took control of their homeland. Later that month, the United States chaired talks in [[London]] to formalize the end of the war. These talks were attended by the four major combatant groups, including the EPLF.

Following the collapse of the Mengistu government, Eritrean independence began drawing influential interest and support from the United States.  [[The Heritage Foundation|Heritage Foundation]] Africa expert Michael Johns wrote that &quot;there are some modestly encouraging signs that the front intends to abandon Mengistu's autocratic practices.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r102:E06MY2-393: &quot;Does Democracy Have a Chance?&quot;] by Michael Johns, ''The World and I'' magazine, August 1991 (entered in ''The Congressional Record'', May 6, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

A high-level U.S. delegation was also present in Addis Ababa for the July 1–5, 1991 conference that established a transitional government in Ethiopia. The EPLF attended the July conference as an observer and held talks with the new transitional government regarding Eritrea's relationship to Ethiopia. The outcome of those talks was an agreement in which the Ethiopians recognized the right of the Eritreans to hold a referendum on independence.

Although some EPLF cadres at one time espoused a Marxist ideology, Soviet support for Mengistu had cooled their ardor. The fall of [[communist]] regimes in the former Soviet Union and the [[Eastern Bloc]] convinced them it was a failed system. The EPLF now says it is committed to establishing a democratic form of government and a free-market economy in Eritrea. The United States agreed to provide assistance to both Ethiopia and Eritrea, conditional on continued progress toward democracy and human rights.

In May 1991 the EPLF established the Provisional Government of Eritrea (PGE) to administer Eritrean affairs until a referendum was held on independence and a permanent government established. EPLF leader Afewerki became the head of the PGE, and the EPLF Central Committee served as its legislative body.

Eritreans voted overwhelmingly in favor of independence between 23 and 25 April 1993 in a UN-monitored [[Eritrean independence referendum, 1993|referendum]]. The result of the referendum was 99.83% for Eritrea's independence. The Eritrean authorities declared Eritrea an independent state on 27 April. The government was reorganized and the National Assembly was expanded to include both EPLF and non-EPLF members. The assembly chose Isaias Afewerki as President. The EPLF reorganized itself as a political party, the [[People's Front for Democracy and Justice]] (PFDJ).

==1990s==
[[Image:Eritrea-CIA WFB Map.png|thumb|right|300px|Eritrea after the independence in 1993]]
In July 1996 the [[Constitution of Eritrea]] was ratified, but it has yet to be implemented.

In 1998 a border dispute with Ethiopia, over the town of [[Badme]], led to the [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War]] in which thousands of soldiers from both countries died. Eritrea suffered from significant economic and social stress, including massive population displacement, reduced economic development, and one of Africa's more severe [[land mine]] problems.

The border war ended in 2000 with the signing of the [[Algiers Agreement (2000)|Algiers Agreement]]. Amongst the terms of the agreement was the establishment of a UN peacekeeping operation, known as the [[United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea]] (UNMEE); with over 4,000 UN peacekeepers. The UN established a temporary security zone consisting of a 25-kilometre [[demilitarized zone|demilitarized buffer zone]] within Eritrea, running along the length of the disputed border between the two states and patrolled by UN troops. Ethiopia was to withdraw to positions held before the outbreak of hostilities in May 1998. The Algiers agreement called for a final demarcation of the disputed border area between Eritrea and Ethiopia by the assignment of an independent, UN-associated body known as the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC), whose task was to clearly identify the border between the two countries and issue a final and binding ruling. The peace agreement would be completed with the implementation of the Border Commission's ruling, which would also end the task of the peacekeeping mission. After extensive study, the Commission issued a final border ruling in April 2002, which awarded some territory to each side, but Badme (the flash point of the conflict) was awarded to Eritrea. The Commission's decision was rejected by Ethiopia. The border question remains in dispute, with Ethiopia refusing to withdraw its military from positions in the disputed areas, including Badme, while a &quot;difficult&quot; peace remains in place.

The UNMEE mission was formally abandoned in July 2008, after experiencing serious difficulties in sustaining its troops after fuel stoppages.

Furthermore, Eritrea's diplomatic relations with [[Djibouti]] were briefly severed during the border war with Ethiopia in 1998 due to a dispute over Djibouti's intimate relation with Ethiopia during the war but were restored and normalized in 2000. Relations are again tense due to a renewed border dispute. Similarly, Eritrea and [[Yemen]] had a border conflict between 1996 and 1998 over the Hanish Islands and the maritime border, which was resolved in 2000 by the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] in [[the Hague]].

==Contemporary Eritrea==
{{weasel words|date=December 2017}} {{npov|date=December 2017}}
Roughly 10% of the population of Eritrea works in the public sector, fuel is strictly rationed, and all media outlets are state-run. Health care is cheaply available where it exists, and there are state-run campaigns concerning issues such as HIV infection and [[female genital mutilation]].

Due to his frustration with the stalemated peace process with Ethiopia, the President of Eritrea [[Isaias Afewerki]] wrote a series of [[s:Eleven Letters|Eleven Letters]] to the [[UN Security Council]] and [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]].  Despite the Algiers Agreement, tense relations with Ethiopia have continued and led to regional instability.

His government has also been condemned for allegedly arming and financing the [[insurgency in Somalia]]; the [[United States]] is considering labeling Eritrea a &quot;State Sponsor of Terrorism,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/worldlatest/story/0,,-6857330,00.html |title=US Considers Terror Label for Eritrea |accessdate=2007-11-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029163732/http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0%2C%2C-6857330%2C00.html |archivedate=2007-10-29 |location=London |url-status=live |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, many experts on the topic have shied from this assertion, stating that &quot;If there is one country where the fighting of extremists and terrorists was a priority when it mattered, it was Eritrea.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/world/africa/18eritrea.html|title=Eritreans Deny American Accusations of Terrorist Ties|accessdate=2007-11-19 | work=The New York Times | first=Jeffrey | last=Gettleman | date=2007-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, an estimated 4000 Eritrean troops remained in the 'demilitarized zone' with a further 120,000 along its side of the border.  Ethiopia maintained 100,000 troops along its side.&lt;ref&gt;[http://economist.com/world/africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10286359 &quot;Ethiopia and Eritrea: Bad words over Badme&quot;], ''[[The Economist]]'', 13 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, 2012, the Israeli 'Haaretz' newspaper published an expose on Eritrea. There are over 40,000 Eritrean refugees in Israel. The NGO 'Reporters Without Borders' has ranked Eritrea in last in freedom of expression since 2007, even lower than North Korea. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Halper|first=Yishai|title='The North Korea of Africa': Where you need a permit to have dinner with friends|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/the-north-korea-of-africa-where-you-need-a-permit-to-have-dinner-with-friends.premium-1.463319|accessdate=7 September 2012|newspaper=Haaretz|date=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to southern [[Somalia]]:

In December 2009, the [[United Nations Security Council]] imposed sanctions on [[Eritrea]], accusing it of arming and providing financial aid to militia groups in southern Somalia's conflict zones, including [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Erunribsr&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2010/03/16/idUKLDE62F297|title=Eritrea rejects U.N. report it backs Somali rebels|publisher=Reuters|date= March 16, 2010|accessdate=February 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plane loads of weapons said to be coming from Eritrea were sent to anti-government rebels in southern Somalia.
