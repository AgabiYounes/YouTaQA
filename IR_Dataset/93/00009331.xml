'''Euclid''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|juː|k|l|ɪ|d}}; {{lang-grc|[[Wikt:Εὐκλείδης|Εὐκλείδης]]}} – ''Eukleídēs'', {{IPA-grc|eu̯.kleː.dɛːs|pron}}; [[floruit|fl.]] 300 BC), sometimes called '''Euclid of Alexandria'''&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Math and Mathematicians: The History of Math Discoveries Around the World|2=|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|isbn=978-0-7876-3813-9|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mathmathematicia00brun/page/125 125]|oclc=41497065|url=https://archive.org/details/mathmathematicia00brun/page/125}}&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish him from [[Euclid of Megara]], was a [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]], often referred to as the &quot;founder of [[geometry]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; or the &quot;father of geometry&quot;. He was active in [[Alexandria]] during the reign of [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;I]] (323–283 BC). His ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' is one of the most influential works in the [[history of mathematics]], serving as the main textbook for teaching [[mathematics]] (especially [[geometry]]) from the time of its publication until the late 19th or early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, pp. 50–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, pp. 100–19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macardle, et al. (2008). ''Scientists: Extraordinary People Who Altered the Course of History.'' New York: Metro Books. g. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Elements'', Euclid deduced the theorems of what is now called [[Euclidean geometry]] from a small set of [[axiom]]s. Euclid also wrote works on [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]], [[conic section]]s, [[spherical geometry]], [[number theory]], and [[Rigour#Mathematical_proof | mathematical rigour]].

== Biography ==
Very few original references to Euclid survive, so little is known about his life. He was likely born c. 325 BC, although the place and circumstances of both his birth and death are unknown and may only be estimated roughly relative to other people mentioned with him. He is mentioned by name, though rarely, by other Greek mathematicians from [[Archimedes]] (c. 287 BC – c. 212 BC) onward, and is usually referred to as &quot;ὁ στοιχειώτης&quot; (&quot;the author of Elements&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Heath (1981), p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; The few historical references to Euclid were written by [[Proclus]] c. 450 AD, centuries after Euclid lived.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, David. ''Euclid''. Clark University Department of Mathematics and Computer Science. [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/Euclid.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed biography of Euclid is given by Arabian authors, mentioning, for example, a birth town of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. This biography is generally believed to be fictitious.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, John J.; Robertson, Edmund F., &quot;Euclid of Alexandria&quot;; Heath 1956, p. 4; Heath 1981, p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt; If he came from Alexandria, he would have known the [[Serapeum of Alexandria]], and the [[Library of Alexandria]], and may have worked there during his time. Euclid's arrival in Alexandria came about ten years after its founding by [[Alexander the Great]], which means he arrived c. 322 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|isbn=978-0-7876-3813-9|location=Detroit, Mich.|page=[https://archive.org/details/mathmathematicia00brun/page/126 126]|oclc=41497065|url=https://archive.org/details/mathmathematicia00brun/page/126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proclus introduces Euclid only briefly in his ''Commentary on the Elements''. According to Proclus, Euclid supposedly belonged to [[Plato]]'s &quot;persuasion&quot; and brought together the ''Elements'', drawing on prior work of [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] and of several pupils of Plato (particularly [[Theaetetus (mathematician)|Theaetetus]] and [[Philip of Opus]].) Proclus believes that Euclid is not much younger than these, and that he must have lived during the time of [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy I]] (c. 367 BC – 282 BC) because he was mentioned by Archimedes. Although the apparent citation of Euclid by Archimedes has been judged to be an interpolation by later editors of his works, it is still believed that Euclid wrote his works before Archimedes wrote his.&lt;ref&gt;Proclus, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JZEHj2fEmqAC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;vq=euclid&amp;dq=proclus+commentary+elements&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0#PPR30,M1 p. XXX]; O'Connor, John J.; Robertson, Edmund F., &quot;Euclid of Alexandria&quot; &lt;/ref&gt; Proclus later retells a story that, when Ptolemy I asked if there was a shorter path to learning geometry than Euclid's ''Elements'', &quot;Euclid replied there is no royal road to geometry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Proclus, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JZEHj2fEmqAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 57]&lt;/ref&gt; This anecdote is questionable since it is similar to a story told about [[Menaechmus]] and Alexander the Great.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Euclidis quae supersunt omnia.tif|thumb|''Euclidis quae supersunt omnia'' (1704)]]

Euclid died c. 270 BC, presumably in Alexandria.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; In the only other key reference to Euclid, [[Pappus of Alexandria]] (c. 320 AD) briefly mentioned that [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]] &quot;spent a very long time with the pupils of Euclid at Alexandria, and it was thus that he acquired such a scientific habit of thought&quot; c. 247–222&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Heath (1956), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~cherlin/History/Papers1999/schmarge.html|title=Conic Sections in Ancient Greece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the lack of biographical information is unusual for the period (extensive biographies being available for most significant Greek mathematicians several centuries before and after Euclid), some researchers have proposed that Euclid was not a historical personage, and that his works were written by a team of mathematicians who took the name Euclid from [[Euclid of Megara]] (à la [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]]). However, this hypothesis is not well accepted by scholars and there is little evidence in its favor.&lt;ref&gt; O'Connor, John J.; Robertson, Edmund F., &quot;Euclid of Alexandria&quot;; {{cite book|title=Les livres arithmétiques d'Euclide|author=Jean Itard|year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Elements'' ==
[[File:Oxyrhynchus papyrus with Euclid's Elements.jpg|right|thumb|250px|One of the oldest surviving fragments of Euclid's ''Elements'', found at [[Oxyrhynchus]] and dated to circa AD 100 ([[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 29|P.

{{anchor|The ''Elements''|Elements}}
{{main|Euclid's Elements}}

Although many of the results in ''Elements'' originated with earlier mathematicians, one of Euclid's accomplishments was to present them in a single, logically coherent framework, making it easy to use and easy to reference, including a system of rigorous [[mathematical proof]]s that remains the basis of mathematics 23 centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;Struik p.&amp;nbsp;51 (&quot;their logical structure has influenced scientific thinking perhaps more than any other text in the world&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no mention of Euclid in the earliest remaining copies of the ''Elements''. Most of the copies say they are &quot;from the edition of [[Theon of Alexandria|Theon]]&quot; or the &quot;lectures of Theon&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Heath (1981), p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt; while the text considered to be primary, held by the Vatican, mentions no author. Proclus provides the only reference ascribing the ''Elements'' to Euclid.

Although best known for its geometric results, the ''Elements'' also includes [[number theory]]. It considers the connection between [[perfect numbers]] and [[Mersenne primes]] (known as the [[Euclid–Euler theorem]]), the [[Euclid's theorem|infinitude of prime numbers]], [[Euclid's lemma]] on factorization (which leads to the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] on uniqueness of [[integer factorization|prime factorizations]]), and the [[Euclidean algorithm]] for finding the [[greatest common divisor]] of two numbers.

The geometrical system described in the ''Elements'' was long known simply as ''[[geometry]]'', and was considered to be the only geometry possible. Today, however, that system is often referred to as ''[[Euclidean geometry]]'' to distinguish it from other so-called ''[[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]]'' discovered in the 19th century.

===Fragments===
{{See also|Oxyrhynchus Papyri}}
The [[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 29]] (P. Oxy. 29) is a fragment of the second book of the ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' of Euclid, unearthed by [[Bernard Grenfell|Grenfell]] and [[Arthur Surridge Hunt|Hunt]] 1897 in [[Oxyrhynchus]]. More recent scholarship suggests a date of 75–125 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Fowler |year=1999 |title=The Mathematics of Plato's Academy |edition=Second |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-850258-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HuwwIdk-xL8C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fragment contains the statement of the 5th proposition of Book 2, which in the translation of [[T. L. Heath]] reads:&lt;ref name=&quot;Cass&quot;&gt;[[Bill Casselman (mathematician)|Bill Casselman]], [http://www.math.ubc.ca/~cass/Euclid/papyrus/papyrus.html One of the oldest extant diagrams from Euclid]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cube to dodecahedron 240px.gif|thumb|Construction of a dodecahedron by placing faces on the edges of a cube.]]

In addition to the ''Elements'', at least five works of Euclid have survived to the present day. They follow the same logical structure as ''Elements'', with definitions and proved propositions.
* ''[[Data (Euclid)|Data]]'' deals with the nature and implications of &quot;given&quot; information in geometrical problems; the subject matter is closely related to the first four books of the ''Elements''.
* ''On Divisions of Figures'', which survives only partially in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translation, concerns the division of geometrical figures into two or more equal parts or into parts in given [[ratio]]s. It is similar to a first-century AD work by [[Heron of Alexandria]].
* ''[[Catoptrics]]'', which concerns the mathematical theory of mirrors, particularly the images formed in plane and spherical concave mirrors. The attribution is held to be anachronistic however by J J O'Connor and E F Robertson who name [[Theon of Alexandria]] as a more likely author.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, John J.; Robertson, Edmund F., &quot;Theon of Alexandria&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Phaenomena'', a treatise on [[spherical astronomy]], survives in Greek; it is quite similar to ''On the Moving Sphere'' by [[Autolycus of Pitane]], who flourished around 310 BC.

[[File:EuclidStatueOxford.jpg|thumb|right|upright|19th-century statue of Euclid by [[Joseph Durham]] in the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]]]]
* ''[[Euclid's Optics|Optics]]'' is the earliest surviving Greek treatise on perspective. In its definitions Euclid follows the Platonic tradition that vision is caused by [[Emission theory (vision)|discrete rays which emanate from the eye]]. One important definition is the fourth: &quot;Things seen under a greater angle appear greater, and those under a lesser angle less, while those under equal angles appear equal.&quot; In the 36 propositions that follow, Euclid relates the apparent size of an object to its distance from the eye and investigates the apparent shapes of cylinders and cones when viewed from different angles. Proposition 45 is interesting, proving that for any two unequal magnitudes, there is a point from which the two appear equal. [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] believed these results to be important in astronomy and included Euclid's ''Optics'', along with his ''Phaenomena'', in the ''Little Astronomy'', a compendium of smaller works to be studied before the ''Syntaxis'' (''Almagest'') of [[Claudius Ptolemy]].

=== Lost works ===
Other works are credibly attributed to Euclid, but have been lost.
* ''Conics'' was a work on [[conic section]]s that was later extended by [[Apollonius of Perga]] into his famous work on the subject. It is likely that the first four books of Apollonius's work come directly from Euclid. According to Pappus, &quot;Apollonius, having completed Euclid's four books of conics and added four others, handed down eight volumes of conics.&quot; The Conics of Apollonius quickly supplanted the former work, and by the time of Pappus, Euclid's work was already lost.
* ''[[Porism]]s'' might have been an outgrowth of Euclid's work with conic sections, but the exact meaning of the title is controversial.
* ''Pseudaria'', or ''Book of Fallacies'', was an elementary text about errors in [[reasoning]].
* ''Surface Loci'' concerned either [[Locus (mathematics)|loci]] (sets of points) on surfaces or loci which were themselves surfaces; under the latter interpretation, it has been hypothesized that the work might have dealt with [[Quadric|quadric surfaces]].
* Several works on [[mechanics]] are attributed to Euclid by Arabic sources. ''On the Heavy and the Light'' contains, in nine definitions and five propositions, Aristotelian notions of moving bodies and the concept of specific gravity. ''On the Balance'' treats the theory of the lever in a similarly Euclidean manner, containing one definition, two axioms, and four propositions. A third fragment, on the circles described by the ends of a moving lever, contains four propositions. These three works complement each other in such a way that it has been suggested that they are remnants of a single treatise on mechanics written by Euclid.

==Legacy==
The [[European Space Agency]]'s (ESA) [[Euclid (spacecraft)|Euclid]] [[spacecraft]] was named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Delivers Detectors for ESA's Euclid Spacecraft|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6840|work=NASA|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
