[[Eritrea]] is located in the [[Horn of Africa]] and is bordered on the northeast and east by the [[Red Sea]], on the west and northwest by [[Sudan]], on the south by [[Ethiopia]], and on the southeast by [[Djibouti]]. The country has a high central plateau that varies from {{convert|1,800|to(-)|3,000|m|ft|0|sp=us}} [[above sea level]]. A coastal plain, western lowlands, and some 350 islands comprise the remainder of Eritrea's land mass. 

== Climate ==
The climate of Eritrea is shaped by its diverse topography and its location within the tropics. 
The diversity in landscape and topography in the highlands and lowlands of Eritrea result in the diversity of climate across the 
country. The highlands  have temperate climate throughout out the year. The climate of most lowland zones is arid and semiarid. The distribution of rainfall and vegetation types varies markedly throughout the country. Eritrean climate varies on the basis of seasonal and altitudinal differences. Based on variations in temperature Eritrea can be broadly divided into three major climate zones: a temperate zone, a subtropical climate zone and a tropical climate zone.&lt;ref name=Mussie&gt;{{cite book|author=Mussie Tesfagiorgis G.|title=Eritrea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f0R7iHoaykoC&amp;pg=PA10 |year=2010 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-59884-232-6 |pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eritrea can be divided into three major climate zones : the central highlands, the coastal region, and the western lowlands. Each has a different climate pattern. According to [[Köppen climate classification]], Eritrea have either a [[hot semi-arid climate]] (''BSh'') or a [[hot desert climate]] (''BWh''), although temperatures are much moderated at the highest elevations.&lt;ref name=Mussie/&gt;

In the central highlands, the hottest month is usually May to June with highs around 27&amp;nbsp;°C (80.6&amp;nbsp;°F) to 30&amp;nbsp;°C (86&amp;nbsp;°F). Winter is between December and February with lows at night that can be near freezing point. [[Asmara]] itself enjoys a pleasant climate all year round, although it can be quite cold at night in winter. There are two rainy seasons: the short rains in March and April and the main rains from late June to the beginning of September.
Over there, the climate is usually sunny and dry as sunshine durations turn around 3,000 h and averages annual rainfall hover around 500&amp;nbsp;mm (19.68&amp;nbsp;in).&lt;ref name=Mussie/&gt;
 
On the coast along the [[Red Sea]], the summertime is long, from June to September and extremely hot with averages high temperatures ranging from 40&amp;nbsp;°C (104&amp;nbsp;°F) to 46&amp;nbsp;°C (114.8&amp;nbsp;°F), and it's even hotter in Denkalia. The wintertime is nearly non-existent and averages high temperatures remain above 28&amp;nbsp;°C (82.4&amp;nbsp;°F) during the least hot month of the year and averages low temperatures exceed 20&amp;nbsp;°C (68&amp;nbsp;°F). The rainy season along the coast north of [[Denkalia]] falls during the winter months but rainy days still remain scarce ; rainfall is even more rare in Denkalia Region. The climate is always sunny and dry in this zone and cloudy days are rare.&lt;ref name=Mussie/&gt;

In the western lowlands, the high temperatures are comparable to those on the coast in the hottest months of April until June. December is the coolest month with averages low temperatures falling as low as 15&amp;nbsp;°C (59&amp;nbsp;°F). The rainy seasons are the same as for the highlands.&lt;ref name=Mussie/&gt;

'''Location:'''
Eastern [[Africa]], bordering the [[Red Sea]], between [[Djibouti]] and [[Sudan]], also bordering on [[Ethiopia]].

&lt;br&gt;''border countries:''
[[Djibouti]] 125&amp;nbsp;km, [[Ethiopia]] 1,033&amp;nbsp;km, [[Sudan]] 682&amp;nbsp;km

Note that the border between Eritrea and Ethiopia is disputed.

'''Coastline:'''

'''Maritime claims:'''
territorial sea: 12&amp;nbsp;nm

'''Terrain:'''
dominated by extension of Ethiopian north-south trending highlands, descending on the east to a coastal desert plain, on the northwest to hilly terrain and on the southwest to flat-to-rolling plains

'''Ecoregions:'''
Most of Eritrea's coast is part of the [[Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands]] semi-desert [[ecoregion]]. The southern part of the Red Sea coast, along with the Red Sea coast of Djibouti, has been described as the [[Eritrean coastal desert]], a harsh sand and gravel coastal strip covered in dune grasses and shrubs that is important as a channel for the mass migration of birds of prey.

'''Elevation extremes:'''

[[Amba Soira|Soira]] 3 018 m

'''Natural resources:'''
[[gold]], [[potash]], [[zinc]], [[copper]], [[salt]], possibly [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]], [[fish]]

'''Environment - current issues:'''

'''Environment - international agreements:'''
&lt;br&gt;''party to:''
[[Biodiversity]], Climate Change, [[Desertification]], Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Ozone Layer Protection

'''Geography - note:'''
strategic geopolitical position along world's busiest shipping lanes; Eritrea retained the entire coastline of Ethiopia along the Red Sea upon ''de jure'' independence from Ethiopia on 24 May 1993.
