{{Politics of Estonia}}
The Republic of Estonia gained its independence from the [[Russian Empire]] on 24 February 1918 and established diplomatic relations with many countries via membership of the [[League of Nations]]. The forcible incorporation of Estonia into the Soviet Union in 1940 was not generally recognised by the international community and the [[Estonian diplomatic service]] continued to operate in some countries. Following the restoration of independence from the [[Soviet Union]], [[Russia]] was one of the first nations to re-recognize [[Estonia]]'s independence (the first country to do so was [[Iceland]] on 22 August 1991). Estonia's immediate priority after regaining its independence was the withdrawal of [[Russia]]n (formerly Soviet) forces from Estonian territory. In August 1994, this was completed. However, relations with Moscow have remained strained primarily because [[Russia]] decided not to ratify the border treaty it had signed with Estonia in 1999.

==Trends following re-independence==
Since regaining independence, Estonia has pursued a foreign policy of close cooperation with Western European nations. [[Image:GW Bush, TH Ilves 2006-2.jpg|thumb|270px|left|President [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]] and President [[George W. Bush]], in Estonia 2006.]] The two most important policy objectives in this regard have been accession into [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]], achieved in March and May 2004 respectively. Estonia's international realignment toward the West has been accompanied by a general deterioration in relations with [[Russia]], most recently demonstrated by the controversy surrounding relocation of the [[Bronze Soldier]] WWII memorial in Tallinn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6604647.stm | work=BBC News | title=Estonia blames Russia for unrest | date=29 April 2007 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Estonia has become an increasingly strong supporter of deepening European integration. The decision to participate in the preparation of a [[financial transaction tax]] in 2012 reflects this shift in Estonia’s EU policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.fiia.fi/en/publication/288/estonia_strives_to_be_at_the_core_of_the_eu/ | work=[[The Finnish Institute of International Affairs]] | title=Estonia strives to be at the core of the EU | date=17 October 2012 | accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important element in Estonia's post-independence reorientation has been closer ties with the [[Nordic countries]], especially [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]]. Indeed, Estonians consider themselves a Nordic people due to being [[Finno-Ugric]] people like the Finns rather than [[Balts]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://web-static.vm.ee/static/failid/220/eesti_elu.pdf  Estonian foreign ministry publication] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325013626/http://web-static.vm.ee/static/failid/220/eesti_elu.pdf |date=25 March 2009 }}, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web-static.vm.ee/static/failid/273/Eesti%20elu.pdf  Estonian foreign ministry publication] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307050758/http://web-static.vm.ee/static/failid/273/Eesti%20elu.pdf |date=7 March 2008 }}, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; based on their historical ties with [[Denmark]] and particularly [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]]. In December 1999 Estonian foreign minister (and since 2006, [[president of Estonia]]) [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]] delivered a speech entitled &quot;Estonia as a Nordic Country&quot; to the [[Swedish Institute for International Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vm.ee/eng/nato/1210.html|title=NATO :: NATO :: Estonia as a Nordic Country&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the [[foreign ministry]] also hosted an exhibit called &quot;Estonia: Nordic with a Twist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sm.ee/eng/pages/goproweb0689|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208100817/http://www.sm.ee/eng/pages/goproweb0689|url-status=dead|title=Estonia - Nordic with a Twist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|archivedate=8 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; And in 2005, Estonia joined the [[European Union]]'s [[Nordic Battle Group]]. It has also shown continued interest in becoming a full member in the [[Nordic Council]].

Whereas in 1992 Russia accounted for 92% of Estonia's international trade,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/WorldwideFreedom/bg2060.cfm|title=The Estonian Economic Miracle|work=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; today there is extensive economic interdependence between Estonia and its Nordic neighbors: three quarters of [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] in Estonia originates in the Nordic countries (principally Finland and Sweden), to which Estonia sends 42% of its exports (as compared to 6.5% going to Russia, 8.8% to Latvia, and 4.7% to Lithuania). On the other hand, the Estonian political system, its [[flat tax|flat rate]] of income tax, and its non-welfare-state model distinguish it from the other Nordic states, and indeed from many other European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investinestonia.com/pdf/ForeignTrade2007.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307050806/http://www.investinestonia.com/pdf/ForeignTrade2007.pdf |archivedate=7 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }} Foreign investment&lt;/ref&gt;

Estonia is a party to 181 international organizations, including the [[Bank for International Settlements|BIS]], [[Council of the Baltic Sea States|CBSS]], [[Council of Europe|CE]], [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council|EAPC]], [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development|EBRD]], [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|ECE]], [[European Union|EU]] (member since 1 May 2004), [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]], [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|IBRD]], [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|ICRM]], [[International Finance Corporation|IFC]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|IFRCS]], [[International Hydrographic Organization|IHO]], [[International Labour Organization|ILO]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[International Maritime Organization]], [[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]], [[IOC]], [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]] (observer), [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] (correspondent), [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]], [[International Trade Union Confederation|ITUC]], [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation|NATO]], [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons|OPCW]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], [[Partnership for Peace|PFP]], [[United Nations|UN]], [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|UNCTAD]], [[UNESCO]], [[United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina|UNMIBH]], [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]], [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization|UNTSO]], [[Universal Postal Union|UPU]], [[World Customs Organization|WCO]], [[Western European Union|WEU]] (associate partner), [[World Health Organization|WHO]], [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]], [[World Meteorological Organization|WMO]], [[World Trade Organization|WTO]].

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] Estonia had hoped for the return of more than 2,000 square kilometers of territory annexed to Russia after [[World War II]] in 1945. The annexed land had been within the borders Estonia approved by Russia in the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)|1920 Tartu Peace Treaty]]. However, the [[Boris Yeltsin]] government disavowed any responsibility for acts committed by the [[Soviet Union]].

After signing the border treaty by the corresponding foreign minister in 2005, it was ratified by the Estonian government and president. The Russian side interpreted the preamble as giving Estonia a possibility for future territorial claim, and [[Vladimir Putin]] notified Estonia that Russia will not consider these. Negotiations were reopened in 2012 and the Treaty was signed in February 2014. Ratification is still pending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.postimees.ee/1250918/estonia-russia-to-exchange-128-6-hectares-of-land-under-border-treaty|title=Estonia, Russia to exchange 128.6 hectares of land under border treaty|date=28 May 2013|website=Estonian news - news.postimees.ee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uruguay was among the countries that refused to recognize the Soviet occupation of the Baltic countries. Uruguay re-recognised Estonia’s independence on 28 August 1991. Estonia and Uruguay established diplomatic relations on 30 September 1992. Estonia is represented in Uruguay through an honorary consulate in Montevideo. Uruguay is represented in Estonia through its embassy in Helsinki (Finland) and an honorary consulate in Tallinn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vm.ee/et|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130213045423/http://www.vm.ee/?q=en%2Fnode%2F125%2F|url-status=dead|title=Avaleht &amp;#124; Välisministeerium|website=vm.ee|archive-date=13 February 2013|access-date=23 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of February 2012, Estonia has not established diplomatic relations with three countries: [[North Korea]], [[Sudan]], and [[Myanmar]]. Foreign minister [[Urmas Paet]] has indicated that after the [[2011–2012 Burmese political reforms]] Estonia is reconsidering its stance in regard to the government in Myanmar and is now considering establishing formal diplomatic relations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postimees.ee/756800/millise-kahe-riigiga-pole-eestil-diplomaatilisi-suhteid/ &quot;Millise kahe riigiga pole Eestil diplomaatilisi suhteid?&quot;] ''[[Postimees]]'' 1. march 2012. {{in lang|et}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contractual and legal framework of relations between Ukraine and Estonia covers a wide range of branches of bilateral cooperation, including political, trade and economic, scientific and technical, humanitarian, law enforcement and other spheres. This base is ramified and efficient enough and includes 53 bilateral documents, among which are 3 interstate agreements, 15 intergovernmental and 35 interdepartmental.

Ukraine and Estonia bring together common aspirations in the political, economic, social and other spheres. Recognizing Ukraine as its foreign policy priority, Estonia is one of the most consistent supporters of Ukraine's European choice, supported the signing of the Agreement on the Association of Ukraine with the EU.

Intensive bilateral contacts between state and non-governmental institutions are developing, and interaction within the framework of international organizations is active. At the state level, the important role played by Ukraine in ensuring stability and security in Europe is constantly stressed. Estonia supports political and socio-economic reforms in Ukraine, provides substantial humanitarian, financial and advisory and technical assistance.
