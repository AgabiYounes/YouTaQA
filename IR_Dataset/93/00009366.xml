Formerly the colony of [[Spanish Guinea]], its post-independence name evokes its location near both the [[Equator]] and the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. Equatorial Guinea is the only sovereign African state in which [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is an official language. {{As of|2015}}, the country had an estimated population of 1,222,245.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inege.gq/|title=INEGE {{!}} INSTITUTO NACIONAL DE ESTADÍSTICA DE GUINEA ECUATORIAL|website=www.inege.gq|language=es-ES|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equatorial Guinea consists of two parts, an insular and a mainland region. The [[Islands of Equatorial Guinea|insular region]] consists of the islands of [[Bioko]] (formerly ''Fernando Pó'') in the Gulf of Guinea and [[Annobón Province|Annobón]], a small volcanic island which is the only part of the country south of the [[equator]]. Bioko Island is the northernmost part of Equatorial Guinea and is the site of the country's capital, [[Malabo]]. The Portuguese-speaking island nation of [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] is located between Bioko and Annobón. The mainland region, [[Río Muni]], is bordered by [[Cameroon]] on the north and [[Gabon]] on the south and east. It is the location of [[Bata, Equatorial Guinea|Bata]], Equatorial Guinea's largest city, and [[Ciudad de la Paz]], the country's planned future capital. Rio Muni also includes several small offshore islands, such as [[Corisco]], [[Elobey Grande]], and [[Elobey Chico]]. The country is a member of the [[African Union]], [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|Francophonie]], [[OPEC]] and the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries|CPLP]].

Since the mid-1990s, Equatorial Guinea has become one of [[sub-Saharan Africa]]'s largest oil producers. It is subsequently the richest country per capita in Africa,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?c=mr&amp;v=67 GDP – per capita (PPP) – Country Comparison]. Indexmundi.com. Retrieved on 5 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and its [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) adjusted for [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP) per capita ranks 43rd in the world;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html GDP – per capita (PPP)], [[The World Factbook]], [[Central Intelligence Agency]].&lt;/ref&gt; however, the wealth is distributed extremely unevenly, with few people benefiting from the oil riches. The country ranks 135th on the 2016 [[Human Development Index]],&lt;ref name=&quot;HDI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/2018_human_development_statistical_update.pdf|title=2018 Human Development Report|date=2016|accessdate=21 March 2017|publisher=United Nations Development Programme}}&lt;/ref&gt; with less than half the population having access to clean drinking water and 20% of children dying before the age of five.

Equatorial Guinea's government is authoritarian and has one of the [[Human rights in Equatorial Guinea|worst human rights records in the world]], consistently ranking among the &quot;worst of the worst&quot; in [[Freedom House]]'s [[Freedom in the World|annual survey of political and civil rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110131191445/http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/special_report/88.pdf Worst of the Worst 2010.

{{Main|History of Equatorial Guinea}}
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
[[Pygmy peoples|Pygmies]] probably once lived in the continental region that is now Equatorial Guinea, but are today found only in isolated pockets in southern Río Muni. [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] migrations started probably around 2,000 BCE from between south-east Nigeria and north-west Cameroon (the Grassfields).&lt;ref&gt;Bostoen (K.), Clist (B.), Doumenge (C.), Grollemund (R.), Hombert (J.-M.), Koni Muluwa (J.) &amp; Maley (J.), 2015, Middle to Late Holocene Paleoclimatic Change and the Early Bantu Expansion in the Rain Forests of Western Central Africa, Current Anthropology, 56 (3), pp.354-384. &lt;/ref&gt; They must have settled continental Equatorial Guinea around 500 BCE at the latest.&lt;ref&gt;Clist (B.). 1990, Des derniers chasseurs aux premiers métallurgistes : sédentarisation et débuts de la métallurgie du fer (Cameroun, Gabon, Guinée-Equatoriale).

L'Anthropologie 102 (2) : 213-217&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest settlements on Bioko Island are dated to 530 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Sánchez-Elipe Lorente (M.). 2015. Las comunidades de la eda del hierro en África Centro-Occidental: cultura material e identidad, Tesi Doctoral, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Annobonese Creole|Annobón]] population, originally native to [[Angola]], was introduced by the Portuguese via [[São Tomé island]].

===First European contact and Portuguese rule (1472-1778)===
[[File:1729 West Africa map (Cameroon &amp; Nigeria).jpg|thumb|left|[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] rule in Equatorial Guinea lasted from the arrival of [[Fernão do Pó]] (Fernando Pó) in 1472 until the [[Treaty of El Pardo (1778)|1778 Treaty of El Pardo]].]]
The [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese explorer]] [[Fernão do Pó|Fernando Pó]], seeking a path to [[India]], is credited as being the first European to discover the island of Bioko, in 1472. He called it ''Formosa'' (&quot;Beautiful&quot;), but it quickly took on the name of its European discoverer. [[Fernando Pó (island)|Fernando Pó]] and Annobón were colonized by [[Portugal]] in 1474. The first factories were established on the islands around 1500 as the Portuguese quickly recognized the positives of the islands including volcanic soil and disease-resistant highlands. Despite natural advantages, initial Portuguese efforts in 1507 to establish a sugarcane plantation and town near what is now Concepción on Fernando Pó failed due to Bubi hostility and fever.&lt;ref&gt;Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 5. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main island's rainy climate, extreme humidity and temperature swings took a major toll on European settlers from the beginning, and it would be centuries before attempts restarted.

===Early Spanish rule and lease to Britain (1778–1844)===
In 1778, Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]] and King [[Charles III of Spain]] signed the [[Treaty of El Pardo (1778)|Treaty of El Pardo]] which ceded [[Bioko]], adjacent islets, and commercial rights to the [[Bight of Bonny|Bight of Biafra]] between the [[Niger River|Niger]] and [[Ogoue River|Ogoue]] rivers to [[Spanish Empire|Spain]]. Brigadier Felipe José, Count of Arjelos sailed from [[Uruguay]] to formally take possession of Bioko from Portugal, landing on the island on October 21 1778. After sailing for Annobón to take possession, the Count died of disease caught on Bioko and the fever-ridden crew mutinied. The crew landed on São Tomé instead where they were imprisoned by the Portuguese authorities after having lost over 80% of their men to sickness.&lt;ref&gt;Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 6. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}&lt;/ref&gt;As a result of this disaster, Spain was thereafter was hesitant to invest heavily in their new possession. However, despite the setback Spaniards began to use the island as a base for slave-hunting on the nearby mainland with the support of British merchants. Between 1778 and 1810, the territory of what became Equatorial Guinea was administered by the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]], based in [[Buenos Aires]].

Unwilling to invest heavily in the development of Fernando Pó, from 1827 to 1843, the Spanish leased a base at Malabo on [[Bioko]] to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] which they had sought as part of their efforts to control the Atlantic [[slavery|slave trade]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Fernando Po&quot;, Encyclopædia Britannica, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;. Without Spanish permission, the British moved the headquarters of the Mixed Commission for the Suppression of Slave Traffic to Fernando Pó in 1827, before moving it back to [[Sierra Leone]] under an agreement with Spain in 1843. Spain's decision to abolish slavery in 1817 at British insistence damaged the colony's perceived value to the authorities and so leasing naval bases was an effective revenue earner from an otherwise unprofitable possession.&lt;ref&gt;Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 6-7. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was from Fernando Pó that governor [[John Beecroft]] launched the [[Reduction of Lagos|seizure of Lagos]] that marked the first British incursion into Nigeria. An agreement by Spain to sell their African colony to the British was frustrated in 1841 by metropolitan public opinion and angry parliamentarians in Madrid.

===Late 19th century (1844–1900)===
In 1844, the British restored the island to Spanish sovereignty and the area became known as the &quot;Territorios Españoles del Golfo de Guinea.&quot; Due to brutal epidemics Spain still refused to invest much in the colony, and in 1862 a brutal outbreak of yellow fever killed many of the whites that had settled on the island. Despite this, plantations continued to be established by private citizens through third quarter of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 13. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[plantation]]s of [[Bioko|Fernando Pó]] were mostly run by a black [[Creole elite]], later known as [[Fernandino peoples|Fernandinos]]. The British settled some 2,000 Sierra Leoneans and freed slaves there during their rule, and limited immigration from West Africa and the West Indies continued after the British left. A number of freed Angolan slaves, Portuguese-African creoles and immigrants from Nigeria and Liberia also began to be settled in the colony where they quickly began to join the new group.&lt;ref&gt;Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 9. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the local mix were added Cubans, Filipinos, Catalans, Jews and Spaniards of various colours, many of who had deported to Africa for political or other crimes, as well as some settlers backed by the government. 

By 1870 the prognosis of whites that lived on the island was much improved after recommendations that they live in the highlands, and by 1884 much of the minimal administrative machinery and key plantations had moved to [[Pico Basilé|Basile]] hundreds of metres above sea level. [[Henry Morton Stanley]] had labelled Fernando Pó &quot;a jewel which Spain did not polish&quot; for refusing to enact such a policy. Despite the improved survival chances of Europeans living on the island, [[Mary Kingsley]], who was staying on the island still described Fernando Pó as 'a more uncomfortable form of execution' for Spaniards appointed there.&lt;ref&gt;Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 13. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a trickle of immigration from the neighbouring Portuguese islands, escaped slaves and prospective planters. Although a few of the [[Fernandino peoples|Fernandinos]] were Catholic and Spanish-speaking, about nine-tenths of them were Protestant and English-speaking on the eve of the First World War, and [[pidgin English]] was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the island. The Sierra Leoneans were particularly well placed as planters while labor recruitment on the [[Ivory Coast|Windward coast]] continued, for they kept family and other connections there and could easily arrange a supply of labor. The Fernandinos proved to become effective traders and middlemen between the natives and Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 9. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}&lt;/ref&gt; A freed slave from the West Indies by way of Sierra Leone named William Pratt established the cocoa crop on Fernando Pó, forever altering the destiny of the colony.

===Early 20th century (1900–1945)===
Spain had neglected to occupy the large area in the [[Bight of Biafra]] to which it had right by [[treaty]], and the French had busily expanded their occupation at the expense of the area claimed by Spain. Madrid had failed to back the explorations of men like [[Manuel Iradier]] who had signed treaties in the interior as far as Gabon and Cameroon, leaving much of the land out of 'effective occupation' as demanded by the terms of the 1885 [[Berlin Conference]], and events in Cuba and the [[Spanish–American-War]] distracted Madrid at an inopportune moment. Minimal government backing for mainland annexation came solely as a result of public opinion and a need for labour on Fernando Pó.&lt;ref&gt;Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 18. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The eventual [[Treaty of Paris (1900)|treaty of Paris]] in 1900 left Spain with the continental [[enclave and exclave|enclave]] of Rio Muni, a mere 26,000&amp;nbsp;km{{sup|2}} out of the 300,000 stretching east to the [[Ubangi River|Ubangi river]] which the Spaniards had initially claimed.&lt;ref name=Clarence-Smith&gt;Clarence-Smith, William Gervase (1986) [http://es.scribd.com/doc/63545279/The-Cambridge-History-of-Africa-Volume-7-From-1905-to-1940-0521225051-1986 &quot;Spanish Equatorial Guinea, 1898–1940&quot;] in ''The Cambridge History of Africa: From 1905 to 1940'' Ed.

The humiliation of the Franco-Spanish negotiations, combined with the disaster in Cuba led to the head of the Spanish negotiating team, Pedro Gover y Tovar committing suicide on the voyage home on 21 October 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 19. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iradier himself died in despair in 1911, and it would be decades before his achievements would be recognised by Spanish popular opinion when the port of [[Cogo, Equatorial Guinea|Cogo]] was renamed Puerto Iradier in his honour.

The opening years of the twentieth century saw a new generation of Spanish immigrants. Land regulations issued in 1904–1905 favoured Spaniards, and most of the later big planters arrived from Spain after that. An agreement made with Liberia made in 1914 to import cheap labor greatly favoured wealthy men with ready access to the state, and the shift in labor supplies from Liberia to Río Muni increased this advantage. Due to malpractice however, the Liberian government eventually ended the treaty after embarrassing revelations about the state of Liberian workers on Fernando Pó in the Christy Report which brought down the country's president [[Charles D. B. King]] in 1930. In 1940, an estimated 20% of the colony's cocoa production came from African-owned land, nearly all of it was in the hands of Fernandinos.

The greatest constraint to [[economic development]] was a chronic shortage of labour. Pushed into the interior of the island and decimated by alcohol addiction, venereal disease, [[smallpox]], and [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], the indigenous [[Bubi people|Bubi]] population of [[Bioko]] refused to work on [[plantation]]s. Working their own small [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] farms gave them a considerable degree of autonomy.

By the late nineteenth century, the Bubi were protected from the demands of the planters by Spanish [[Claretians|Claretian]] missionaries, who were very influential in the colony and eventually organised the Bubi into little mission theocracies reminiscent of the famous [[Jesuit]] [[Reducciones|reductions]] in [[Paraguay]]. Catholic penetration was furthered by two small insurrections in 1898 and 1910 protesting [[conscription]] of [[Forced labor|forced labour]] for the plantations. The Bubi were disarmed in 1917, and left dependent on the missionaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clarence-Smith&quot; /&gt; Serious labour shortages were temporarily solved by a massive influx of refugees from German [[Kamerun]], along with thousands of white German soldiers who stayed on the island for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 19. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1926 and 1959 Bioko and Rio Muni were united as the colony of [[Spanish Guinea]]. The economy was based on large [[cocoa bean|cacao]] and [[coffee]] plantations and [[logging]] concessions and the workforce was mostly immigrant [[contract labour]] from [[Liberia]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Cameroun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Martino, Enrique|title=Clandestine Recruitment Networks in the Bight of Biafra: Fernando Pó's Answer to the Labour Question, 1926–1945|journal=International Review of Social History|volume=57|pages=39–72|url=http://www.opensourceguinea.org/2013/03/enrique-martino-clandestine-recruitment.html|doi=10.1017/s0020859012000417|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1914 and 1930, an estimated 10,000 Liberians went to Fernando Po under a labour treaty that was stopped altogether in 1930.

With Liberian workers no longer available, planters of Fernando Po turned to Rio Muni. Campaigns were mounted to subdue the [[Fang people]] in the 1920s, at the time that Liberia was beginning to cut back on recruitment. There were garrisons of the colonial guard throughout the enclave by 1926, and the whole colony was considered 'pacified' by 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/14636204.2013.790703|title=La última selva de España: Antropófagos, misioneros y guardias civiles.

The [[Spanish Civil War]] had a major impact on the colony. 150 Spanish whites, including the Governor-General and Vice-Governor-General of Río Muni created a socialist party called the Popular Front in the enclave which served to oppose the interests of the Fernando Pó plantation elite. When the War broke out [[Francisco Franco]] ordered Nationalist forces based in the Canaries to ensure control over Equatorial Guinea. In September 1936 Nationalist forces backed by Falangists from Fernando Pó, in a mirror of what happened in Spain proper 'cleansed' Río Muni, which under Governor-General Luiz Sanchez Guerra Saez and his deputy Porcel had backed the Republican government. By November the Popular Front and its supporters had been defeated, its leaders executed and Equatorial Guinea secured for Franco. The commander in charge of the occupation, Juan Fontán Lobé was appointed Governor-General by Franco and began to exert more effective Spanish control over the enclave interior.&lt;ref&gt;Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 20-21. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rio Muni had a small population, officially a little over 100,000 in the 1930s, and escape across the frontiers into [[Cameroun]] or [[Gabon]] was very easy. Also, the [[timber]] companies needed increasing numbers of workers, and the spread of [[coffee]] cultivation offered an alternative means of paying taxes{{clarify|date=November 2016}}. Fernando Pó thus continued to suffer from labour shortages. The French only briefly permitted recruitment in Cameroun, and the main source of labour came to be [[Igbo people|Igbo]] smuggled in canoes from [[Calabar]] in [[Nigeria]]. This resolution to the worker shortage allowed Fernando Pó to become one of Africa's most productive agricultural areas after the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clarence-Smith&quot; /&gt;

===Final years of Spanish rule (1945–1968)===
Politically, post-war colonial history has three fairly distinct phases: up to 1959, when its status was raised from 'colonial' to 'provincial', following the approach of the [[Portuguese Empire]]; between 1960 and 1968, when Madrid attempted a partial [[decolonisation]] aimed at keeping the territory as part of the Spanish system; and from 1968 on, after the territory became an independent [[republic]]. The first phase consisted of little more than a continuation of previous policies; these closely resembled the policies of Portugal and France, notably in dividing the population into a vast majority governed as 'natives' or non-citizens, and a very small minority (together with whites) admitted to civic status as ''[[emancipados]]'', [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] to the metropolitan culture being the only permissible means of advancement.&lt;ref&gt;Crowder, Michael, ed. (1984)  ''The Cambridge History of Africa: Volume 8, from C. 1940 to C. 1975''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521224098}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This 'provincial' phase saw the beginnings of [[nationalism]], but chiefly among small groups who had taken refuge from the ''[[Caudillo]]''{{'}}s paternal hand in Cameroun and Gabon. They formed two bodies: the [[Atanasio Ndongo Miyone|Movimiento Nacional de Liberación de la Guinea]] (MONALIGE), and the [[Idea Popular de Guinea Ecuatorial]] (IPGE). The pressure they could bring to bear was weak, but the general trend in West Africa was not, and by the late 1960s much of the African continent had been granted independence. Aware of this trend, the Spanish began to increase efforts to prepare the country for independence and massively stepped up development. The Gross National Product per capita in 1965 was $466 which was the highest in black Africa, and the Spanish constructed an international airport at Santa Isabel, a television station and increased the literacy rate to a relatively high 89%. At the same time measures were taken to battle sleeping sickness and leprosy in the enclave, and by 1967 the number of hospital beds per capita in Equatorial Guinea was higher than Spain itself, with 1637 beds in 16 hospitals. All the same, measures to improve education floundered and like in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] by the end of colonial rule the number of Africans in higher education was in only the double digits, and political education necessary to a functioning state was negligible.&lt;ref&gt;Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 59-60. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A decision of 9 August 1963, approved by a referendum of 15 December 1963, gave the territory a measure of autonomy and the administrative promotion of a 'moderate' group, the {{ILL|Movimiento de Unión Nacional de la Guinea Ecuatorial|es}} (MUNGE). This proved a feeble instrument, and, with growing pressure for change from the UN, Madrid was gradually forced to give way to the currents of nationalism. Two General Assembly resolutions were passed in 1965 ordering Spain to grant independence to the colony, and in 1966 a UN Commission toured the country before recommending the same thing. In response, the Spanish declared that they would hold a constitutional convention on 27 October 1967 to negotiate a new constitution for an independent Equatorial Guinea. The conference was attended by 41 local delegates and 25 Spaniards. The Africans were principally divided between Fernandinos and Bubi on one side, who feared a loss of privileges and 'swamping' by the Fang majority, and the Río Muni Fang nationalists on the other. At the conference the leading Fang figure, the later first president [[Francisco Macías Nguema]] gave a controversial speech in which he claimed that [[Adolf Hitler]] had 'saved Africa'&lt;ref&gt;Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 51-52. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}&lt;/ref&gt; After nine sessions the conference was suspended due to deadlock between the 'unionists' and 'separatists' who wanted a separate Fernando Pó. Macías resolved to travel to the UN to bolster international awareness of the issue, and his firebrand speeches in New York contributed to Spain naming a date for both independence and general elections. In July 1968 virtually all Bubi leaders journed to the UN in New York to try and raise awareness for their cause, but the world community was uninterested in quibbling over the specifics of colonial independence. The 1960s were a time of great optimism over the future of the former African colonies, and groups that had been close to European rulers like the Bubi were not viewed positively.&lt;ref&gt;Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 55. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence under Macías (1968–1979)===
Independence from Spain was gained on 12 October 1968 and the region became the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. Macías became president in the country's [[Equatorial Guinean presidential election, 1968|only free and fair election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Campos, Alicia|title=The decolonization of Equatorial Guinea: the relevance of the international factor|journal=Journal of African History|year=2003|pages=95–116|volume=44|issue=1|url=http://www.egjustice.org/publications/decolonization-equatorial-guinea-relevance-international-factor|doi=10.1017/s0021853702008319}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish had backed Macías in the election due to his perceived loyalty, however while on the campaign trail he had proven to be far less easy to handle than they had expected. Much of his campaigning involved visiting rural areas of Río Muni and promising young Fang that they would have the houses and wives of the Spanish if they voted for him. In the towns he had instead presented himself as the urbane leader who had bested the Spanish at the UN, and he had won in the second round of voting - greatly helped by the vote-splitting of his rivals. 

The euphoria of independence became quickly overshadowed by problems emanating from the [[Nigerian Civil War]]. Fernando Pó was inhabited by many Biafra-supporting Ibo migrant workers and many refugees from the breakaway state fled to the island, straining it to breaking point. The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] began running relief flights out of Equatorial Guinea, but Macías quickly became spooked and shut the flights down, refusing to allow them to fly diesel fuel for their trucks nor oxygen tanks for medical operations. Very quickly the Biafran separatists were starved into submission without international backing.&lt;ref&gt;Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 60. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Public Prosecutor complained about &quot;excesses and maltreatment&quot; by government officials, Macías had 150 alleged coup-plotters executed in a purge on Christmas Eve 1969, all of whom happened to be political opponents.&lt;ref name=tufts&gt;{{cite web|title=Equatorial Guinea - Mass Atrocity Endings|work=Tufts University|date=7 August 2015|url=https://sites.tufts.edu/atrocityendings/2015/08/07/equatorial-guinea/#_edn27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macias Nguema further consolidated his [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian powers]] by [[One-party state|outlawing opposition political parties]] in July 1970 and making himself [[president for life]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egjustice.org/post/equatorial-guinea|title=Equatorial Guinea - EG Justice|author=|date=|website=www.egjustice.org|access-date=17 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1979/08/07/equatorial-guineas-president-said-to-be-retired-not-ousted/b21f82be-7401-4b7c-b6ea-1774dc0639e5/|title=Equatorial Guinea's President Said to Be Retired, Not Ousted|last=|first=|date=|website=The Washington Post|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He broke off ties with Spain and the West. In spite of his condemnation of [[Marxism]], which he deemed &quot;[[Neo-colonialism|neo-colonialist]]&quot;, Equatorial Guinea maintained very special relations with [[communist state]]s, notably [[China]], [[Cuba]], and the [[USSR]]. Macias Nguema signed a preferential [[trade agreement]] and a shipping treaty with the Soviet Union. The Soviets also made loans to Equatorial Guinea.&lt;ref name=&quot;aworawo103&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aworawo|first=David|title=Decisive Thaw: The Changing Pattern of Relations between Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea, 1980–2005|journal=Journal of International and Global Studies|volume=1|issue=2|page=103|url=http://www.lindenwood.edu/jigs/docs/volume1Issue2/essays/89-109.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124030353/http://www.lindenwood.edu/jigs/docs/volume1Issue2/essays/89-109.pdf|archivedate=24 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shipping agreement gave the Soviets permission for a pilot [[fishery]] development project and also a naval base at [[Luba, Equatorial Guinea|Luba]]. In return the USSR was to supply fish to Equatorial Guinea. China and Cuba also gave different forms of financial, military, and technical assistance to Equatorial Guinea, which got them a measure of influence there.

The current president of Equatorial Guinea is Teodoro Obiang. The 1982 constitution of Equatorial Guinea gives him extensive powers, including naming and dismissing members of the cabinet, making laws by decree, dissolving the Chamber of Representatives, negotiating and ratifying treaties and serving as commander in chief of the armed forces. Prime Minister [[Francisco Pascual Obama Asue]] was appointed by Obiang and operates under powers delegated by the President. 

During the four decades of his rule, Obiang has shown little tolerance for opposition. While the country is nominally a multiparty democracy, its elections have generally been considered a sham. According to [[Human Rights Watch]], the dictatorship of President Obiang used an [[oil boom]] to entrench and enrich itself further at the expense of the country's people.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13317174 BBC News – Equatorial Guinea country profile – Overview].

The tension may be rooted in a power shift arising from the dramatic increase in oil production which has occurred since 1997.

The anti-corruption lobby [[Transparency International]] put Equatorial Guinea in the top 12 of its list of most corrupt states. Freedom House, a pro-democracy and human rights NGO, described Obiang as one of the world's &quot;most kleptocratic living autocrats,&quot; and complained about the US government welcoming his administration and buying oil from it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://freedomhouse.org/blog/equatorial-guinea-ignorance-worth-fistfuls-dollars Equatorial Guinea: Ignorance worth fistfuls of dollars].

In November 2011, a new constitution was approved. The vote on the constitution was taken though neither the text or its content was revealed to the public before the vote. Under the new constitution the president was limited to a maximum of two seven-year terms and would be both the head of state and head of the government, therefore eliminating the prime minister. The new constitution also introduced the figure of a vice president and called for the creation of a 70-member senate with 55 senators elected by the people and the 15 remaining designated by the president. Surprisingly, in the following cabinet reshuffle it was announced that there would be two vice-presidents in clear violation of the constitution that was just taking effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guineaecuatorialpress.com/noticia.php?id=2668&amp;lang=en Ignacio Milam Tang, new Vice President of the Nation]. guineaecuatorialpress.com. 22 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, during an interview with [[Christiane Amanpour]] on [[CNN]], Obiang was asked whether he would step down at the end of the current term (2009–2016) since the new constitution limited the number of terms to two and he has been reelected at least 4 times. Obiang answered he refused to step aside because the new constitution was not retroactive and the two- term limit would only become applicable from 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1210/05/ampr.01.html Interview with President Teodoro Obiang of Equatorial Guinea]. CNN. 5 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

26 May 2013 elections combined the senate, lower house and mayoral contests all in a single package. Like all previous elections, this was denounced by the opposition and it too was won by Obiang's PDGE. During the electoral contest, the ruling party hosted internal elections which were later scrapped as none of the president's favorite candidates led the internal lists. Ultimately, the ruling party and the satellites of the ruling coalition decided to run not based on the candidates but based on the party. This created a situation where during the election the ruling party's coalition did not provide the names of their candidates so effectively individuals were not running for office, instead the party was the one running for office.

The May 2013 elections were marked by a series of events including the popular protest planned by a group of activists from the MPP (Movement of Popular Protest) which included several social and political groups. The MPP called for a peaceful protest at the Plaza de la Mujer square on 15 May. MPP coordinator Enrique Nsolo Nzo was arrested and official state media portrayed him as planning to destabilize the country and depose the president. However, and despite speaking under duress and with clear signs of torture, Nsolo said that they had planned a peaceful protest and had indeed obtained all the legal authorizations required to carry out the peaceful protest. In addition to that, he firmly stated that he was not affiliated with any political party. The Plaza de la Mujer square in Malabo was occupied by the police from 13 May and it has been heavily guarded ever since. The government embarked on a [[censorship]] program that affected social sites including Facebook and other websites that were critical to the government of Equatorial Guinea. The censorship was implemented by redirecting online searches to the official government website.

Shortly after the elections, opposition party CPDS announced that they were going to protest peacefully against the 26 May elections on 25 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cpds-gq.org/attachments/article/269/Comunicado_convocatoria_manifestacion.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221031810/http://www.cpds-gq.org/attachments/article/269/Comunicado_convocatoria_manifestacion.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-02-21|title=Convocatorial de Manifestacion, 25 de Junio 2013|work=cpds-gq.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interior minister Clemente Engonga refused to authorize the protest on the grounds that it could &quot;destabilize&quot; the country and CPDS decided to go forward, claiming constitutional right. On the night of 24 June, the CPDS headquarters in Malabo were surrounded by heavily armed police officers to keep those inside from leaving and thus effectively blocking the protest. Several leading members of CPDS were detained in Malabo and others in Bata were kept from boarding several local flights to Malabo.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Equatorial Guinea}}
Equatorial Guinea is on the west coast of [[Central Africa]]. The country consists of a mainland territory, [[Río Muni]], which is bordered by Cameroon to the north and Gabon to the east and south, and five small islands, [[Bioko]], [[Corisco]], [[Annobón]], [[Elobey Chico]] (Small Elobey), and [[Elobey Grande]] (Great Elobey). Bioko, the site of the capital, [[Malabo]], lies about {{convert|40|km|sp=us}} off the coast of Cameroon. Annobón Island is about {{convert|350|km|sp=us}} west-south-west of [[Cape Lopez]] in Gabon. Corisco and the two Elobey islands are in Corisco Bay, on the border of Río Muni and Gabon.

Equatorial Guinea lies between latitudes [[4th parallel north|4°N]] and [[2nd parallel south|2°S]], and longitudes [[5th meridian west|5°]] and [[12th meridian east|12°E]]. Despite its name, no part of the country's territory lies on the equator—it is in the northern hemisphere, except for the insular [[Annobón Province]], which is about {{convert|155|km|abbr=on}} south of the equator.

===Climate===

[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map GNQ present.svg|thumb|Köppen climate classification of Equatorial Guinea.]]

Equatorial Guinea has a tropical climate with distinct wet and dry seasons. From June to August, Río Muni is dry and Bioko wet; from December to February, the reverse occurs. In between there is gradual transition. Rain or mist occurs daily on Annobón, where a cloudless day has never been registered. The temperature at Malabo, Bioko, ranges from {{convert|16|C}} to {{convert|33|C}}, though on the southern [[Moka Plateau]] normal high temperatures are only {{convert|21|C}}. In Río Muni, the average temperature is about {{convert|27|C}}. Annual [[rainfall]] varied from {{convert|1930|mm|abbr=on}} at Malabo to {{convert|10920|mm|abbr=on}} at [[San Antonio de Ureca|Ureka]], Bioko, but Río Muni is somewhat drier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Equatorial-Guinea-CLIMATE.html Nations Encyclopedia]. Nations Encyclopedia (10 April 2011). Retrieved on 5 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecology===
Equatorial Guinea spans several [[ecoregion]]s. Río Muni region lies within the [[Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests]] ecoregion except for patches of [[Central African mangroves]] on the coast, especially in the [[Muni River]] estuary. The [[Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests]] ecoregion covers most of Bioko and the adjacent portions of [[Cameroon]] and [[Nigeria]] on the African mainland, and the [[Mount Cameroon and Bioko montane forests]] ecoregion covers the highlands of Bioko and nearby [[Mount Cameroon]].

The [[São Tomé, Príncipe, and Annobón moist lowland forests]] ecoregion covers all of Annobón, as well as São Tomé and Príncipe.

===Administrative divisions===

[[File:Tree map exports 2009 Equatorial Guinea.jpeg|thumb|A proportional representation of Equatorial Guinea's exports.]]
Before independence Equatorial Guinea exported [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], coffee and timber, mostly to its colonial ruler, Spain, but also to Germany and the UK. On 1 January 1985, the country became the first non-[[wikt:Francophone|Francophone]] African member of the [[franc zone]], adopting the [[CFA franc]] as its currency. The national currency, the [[ekwele]], had previously been linked to the [[Spanish peseta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;web.archive.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equatorialguinea.org/information1387/information.htm|title=Equatorial Guinea|publisher=equatorialguinea.org|accessdate=3 May 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991003081314/http://www.equatorialguinea.org/information1387/information.htm|archivedate=3 October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of large [[oil reserves]] in 1996 and its subsequent exploitation contributed to a dramatic increase in government revenue. {{As of|2004}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A1101-2004Sep6.html|title=U.S. Oil Firms Entwined in Equatorial Guinea Deals|publisher=washingtonpost.com|author=Justin Blum|date=7 September 2004|accessdate=9 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equatorial Guinea is the third-largest oil producer in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Its oil production has risen to {{convert|360000|oilbbl/d}}, up from 220,000 only two years earlier.

Forestry, farming, and fishing are also major components of GDP. Subsistence farming predominates. The deterioration of the rural economy under successive brutal regimes has diminished any potential for agriculture-led growth.

In July 2004, the [[United States Senate]] published an investigation into [[Riggs Bank]], a Washington-based bank into which most of Equatorial Guinea's oil revenues were paid until recently, and which also banked for [[Chile]]'s [[Augusto Pinochet]]. The Senate report showed at least $35 million siphoned off by Obiang, his family and regime senior officials. The president has denied any wrongdoing. Riggs Bank in February 2005 paid $9 million in restitution for Pinochet's banking, no restitution was made with regard to Equatorial Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innercitypress.org/finwatch.html|title=Inner City Press / Finance Watch: &quot;Follow the Money, Watchdog the Regulators&quot;|publisher=Innercitypress.org|date=|accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2000 to 2010, Equatorial Guinea had the highest average annual increase in GDP (Gross Domestic Product), 17%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guinness Book of Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=978-1-908843-15-9|location=|page=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/123 123]|quote=|via=|url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equatorial Guinea is a member of the [[Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa]] ([[OHADA]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;ohada.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=OHADA.com: The business law portal in Africa|url=http://www.ohada.com/index.php|accessdate=22 March 2009|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equatorial Guinea tried to be validated as an [[Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative]] (EITI)–compliant country, working toward transparency in reporting of oil revenues and prudent use of natural resource wealth. The country obtained candidate status on 22 February 2008. It was then required to meet a number of obligations to do so, including committing to working with civil society and companies on EITI implementation, appointing a senior individual to lead on EITI implementation, and publishing a fully costed Work Plan with measurable targets, a timetable for implementation and an assessment of capacity constraints. However, when Equatorial Guinea applied to extend the deadline for completing EITI validation, the EITI Board did not agree to the extension.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eitransparency.org/EquatorialGuinea Equatorial Guinea | EITI] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513205556/http://www.eitransparency.org/EquatorialGuinea |date=13 May 2010 }}. Eitransparency.org (27 September 2007). Retrieved on 5 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[World Bank]], Equatorial Guinea has the highest GNI (Gross National Income) per capita of any African country, 83 times larger than the GNI per capita of [[Burundi]], the poorest country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=50 Things You Didn't Know About Africa|work=[[World Bank]]|url=http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/polsc325-4.1-50-Things-you-didnt-know-about-Africa.pdf|accessdate=7 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725192911/http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/polsc325-4.1-50-Things-you-didnt-know-about-Africa.pdf|archive-date=25 July 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet despite its impressive GNI figure, Equatorial Guinea is plagued by extreme poverty because its [[Gini coefficient]] of 65.0 is the highest in the entire world.

===Transportation===
{{Main|Transport in Equatorial Guinea}}

Due to the large oil industry in the country, internationally recognized carriers fly to [[Malabo International Airport]] which, in May 2014, had several direct connections to [[Europe]] and [[West Africa]]. There are three airports in Equatorial Guinea — [[Malabo International Airport]], [[Bata Airport]] and the new [[Annobon Airport]] on the island of [[Annobon]]. [[Malabo International Airport]] is the only international airport.

Every airline registered in Equatorial Guinea appears on the list of air carriers prohibited in the [[European Union]] (EU) which means that they are banned from operating services of any kind within the EU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/transport/air-ban/doc/list_en.pdf List of banned EU air carriers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404114740/http://ec.europa.eu/transport/air-ban/doc/list_en.pdf |date=4 April 2012 }}.

[[File:bubi children.jpg|thumb|Equatorial Guinean children of [[Bubi people|Bubi]] descent.]]
The majority of the people of Equatorial Guinea are of [[Bantu people|Bantu]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Well Oiled: Oil and Human Rights in Equatorial Guinea|first=Alex|last=Vines|page=9|publisher=Human Rights Watch|year=2009|isbn=1-56432-516-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnlkA-QBizAC&amp;pg=PA9|accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest ethnic group, the [[Fang people|Fang]], is indigenous to the mainland, but substantial migration to [[Bioko Island]] since the 20th century means the Fang population exceeds that of the earlier [[Bubi people|Bubi]] inhabitants. The Fang constitute 80% of the population&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Equatorial Guinea's God|accessdate=26 May 2011|newspaper=BBC|date=26 July 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3098007.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and comprise around 67 clans. Those in the northern part of [[Río Muni]] speak Fang-Ntumu, while those in the south speak Fang-Okah; the two dialects have differences but are mutually intelligible. Dialects of Fang are also spoken in parts of neighboring Cameroon (Bulu) and Gabon. These dialects, while still intelligible, are more distinct. The [[Bubi people|Bubi]], who constitute 15% of the population, are indigenous to Bioko Island. The traditional demarcation line between Fang and 'Beach' (inland) ethnic groups was the village of [[Niefang]] (limit of the Fang), east of Bata.

Coastal ethnic groups, sometimes referred to as [[Ndowe]] or &quot;Playeros&quot; (''Beach People'' in Spanish): [[Combe people|Combes]], [[Bujeba people|Bujebas]], [[Balengue people|Balengues]], and [[Benga people|Bengas]] on the mainland and small islands, and [[Fernandinos]], a [[Sierra Leone Krio people|Krio]] community on Bioko Island together comprise 5% of the population. Europeans (largely of Spanish or [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] descent, some with partial African ancestry) also live in the country, but most ethnic Spaniards left after independence.

A growing number of foreigners from neighboring [[Cameroon]], Nigeria, and [[Gabon]] have immigrated to the country. According to the ''Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations'' (2002) 7% of Bioko islanders were [[Igbo people|Igbo]], an ethnic group from southeastern Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: A-C|first=James|last=Minahan|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2002|isbn=0-313-32109-4|page=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equatorial Guinea received [[Asians]] and native Africans from other countries as workers on cocoa and coffee plantations. Other black Africans came from [[Liberia]], Angola, and [[Mozambique]]. Most of the Asian population is [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]], with small numbers of [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indians]].

Equatorial Guinea has also been a destination for fortune-seeking European settlers from Britain, France and Germany. Israelis and [[Moroccan people|Moroccans]] also live and work here. [[Petroleum|Oil extraction]] since the 1990s has contributed to a doubling of the population in Malabo. After independence, thousands of Equatorial Guineans went to Spain. Another 100,000 Equatorial Guineans went to Cameroon, Gabon, and Nigeria because of the dictatorship of [[Francisco Macías Nguema]]. Some Equatorial Guinean communities are also found in Latin America, the United States, Portugal, and France.

===Languages===
For years, the official languages were [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (the local variant is [[Equatoguinean Spanish]]) and [[French language|French]].&lt;ref name=CIA /&gt; Portuguese was also adopted as an official language in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;CPLP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cplp.org/id-258.aspx|title=Guiné Equatorial|publisher=CPLP|accessdate=28 November 2014|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sol&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sol.pt/noticia/99354|title=Formação de professores e programas televisivos introduzem português na Guiné-Equatorial|language=Portuguese |trans-title=Teacher formation and television programs introduce Portuguese in Equatorial Guinea|publisher=Sol|date=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish has been an official language since 1844. It is still the language of education and administration. 67.6% of Equatorial Guineans can speak it, especially those living in the capital, [[Malabo]].&lt;ref name=obi&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080216191116/http://actualidad.terra.es/internacional/articulo/obiang_comunidad_naciones_1710388.htm Obiang convierte al portugués en tercer idioma oficial para entrar en la Comunidad lusófona de Naciones], ''Terra''. 13 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; French was only made official in order to join the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|Francophonie]] and it is not locally spoken, except in some border towns.

Aboriginal languages are recognized as integral parts of the &quot;national culture&quot; (Constitutional Law No. 1/1998 January 21). Indigenous languages include [[Fang language|Fang]], [[Bube language|Bube]], [[Benga language|Benga]], [[Combe language|Ndowe]], [[Balengue language|Balengue]], [[Bujeba language|Bujeba]], Bissio, Gumu, Igbo, [[Pichinglis]], [[Annobonese language|Fa d'Ambô]] and the nearly extinct [[Baseke language|Baseke]]. Most African ethnic groups speak [[Bantu languages]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GEpress_noticia134en&quot;&gt;[http://www.guineaecuatorialpress.com/noticia.php?id=134&amp;lang=en Oficina de Información y Prensa de Guinea Ecuatorial, Ministerio de Información, Cultura y Turismo]. Guineaecuatorialpress.com. Retrieved on 5 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Annobonese language|Fa d'Ambô]], a Portuguese creole, has vigorous use in [[Annobón Province]], in Malabo (the capital), and among some speakers in Equatorial Guinea's mainland. Many residents of Bioko can also speak Spanish, particularly in the capital, and the local trade language [[Pichinglis]], an English-based creole. Spanish is not spoken much in Annobón. In government and education Spanish is used. Noncreolized Portuguese is used as liturgical language by local Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/fab|title=Fa d'Ambu|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Annobonese ethnic community tried to gain membership in the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP). The government financed an [[International Portuguese Language Institute|Instituto Internacional da Língua Portuguesa]] (IILP) sociolinguistic study in Annobón. It documented strong links with the Portuguese creole populations in São Tomé and Príncipe, Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau.&lt;ref name=&quot;sol&quot; /&gt;

Due to historical and cultural ties, in 2010 the legislature amended article four of the [[Constitution of Equatorial Guinea]], to establish Portuguese as an official language of the Republic. This was an effort by the government to improve its communications, trade, and bilateral relations with Portuguese-speaking countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/equatorial-guinea-adds-portuguese-as-the-countrys-third-official-language-131882808.html|title=Equatorial Guinea Adds Portuguese as the Country's Third Official Language|publisher=PRNewsWire|date=14 October 2011|accessdate=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GuineEqGov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guineaecuatorialpress.com/noticia.php?id=703l|title=El portugués será el tercer idioma oficial de la República de Guinea Ecuatorial|publisher=Gobierno de la Republica de Guinea Ecuatoria|accessdate=15 November 2010|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GuineEqGovPDF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guineaecuatorialpress.com/imgdb/2010/20-7-2010Decretosobreelportuguescomoidiomaoficial.pdf|format=PDF|title=Proyecto de Ley Constitucional|publisher=Gobierno de la Republica de Guinea Ecuatorial|date=14 October 2011|accessdate=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also recognizes long historical ties with Portugal, and with Portuguese-speaking peoples of Brazil, São Tomé and Principe, and Cape Verde.

Some of the motivations for Equatorial Guinea's membership pursuit into the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP) included access to several professional and academic exchange programs and facilitated cross-border circulation of citizens.&lt;ref name=obi /&gt; The adoption of Portuguese as an official language was the primary requirement to apply for CPLP acceptance.
