      <text xml:space="preserve">: This article deals with the '''[[diplomacy|diplomatic affairs]], [[foreign policy]] and [[international relations]] of [[Ecuador]]'''.
{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2019}}
{{Politics of Ecuador}}

Ecuador is a founding member of the UN and a member of many of its specialized agencies; it is also a member of the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), as well as many regional groups, including the [[Rio Group]], the [[Latin American Economic System]], the Latin American Energy Organization, the [[Latin American Integration Association]], and the [[Andean Pact]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35761.htm United States Department of State]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecuador's principal foreign-policy objectives have traditionally included defense of its territory from both external aggression and internal subversion as well as support for the objectives of the UN and the OAS. Although Ecuador's foreign relations were traditionally centered on the United States, Ecuador's membership in the [[Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC) in the 1970s and 1980s allowed Ecuadorian leaders to exercise somewhat greater foreign policy autonomy. Ecuador's foreign policy goals under the [[Rodrigo Borja Cevallos|Borja]] government in the late 1980s were more diversified than those of the [[León Febres Cordero|Febres Cordero]] administration, which closely identified with the United States. For example, Ecuador was more active in its relations with the [[Third World]], multilateral organizations, Western Europe, and socialist countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://countrystudies.us/ecuador/76.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecuador has offered humanitarianian aid to many countries and a supporter of the United Nations and is now contributing troops in the [[MINUSTAH|UN mission in Haiti]]. Ecuador has also been an elective member of the [[UN Security Council]].

In Antarctica, Ecuador has maintained a peaceful research station for scientific study in the British-claimed territory and is a member nation of the [[Antarctica Treaty]].

{{further|Foreign policy of Rafael Correa}}
The Presidency of Rafael Correa in the early 21st century saw a radical change in the country's foreign policy. Traditional ties with the United States grew more acrimonious and there were increased ties with the governments of Russia and Iran.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/wps/wcm/connect/cbdc99804f018bacbc18fc3170baead1/ARI61-2009_Malamud_Garcia-Calvo_Ecuador_Foreign_Policy.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CACHEID=cbdc99804f018bacbc18fc3170baead1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal relations started on 1980-01-02 and seven months later China set up its embassy in Ecuador. In July 1981, Ecuador set up its embassy in China. Sino-Ecuadorian relations have been advancing smoothly. The two sides maintain high-level political contacts and exchanges in trade, economic progress, science, technology, culture and education. In international affairs, the two countries understand and support each other.

In September 2012, the two nations signed a Commercial and Security Agreement to allow Ecuador to sell easily seafood, cocoa and bananas in China, with the Chinese agreeing to ease tariffs on further food items. In the same period China established an $80&amp;nbsp;million line of credit for Ecuador with the EximBank to help Ecuador build a road to the re-sited Quito airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cuencanewsdigest.com/ecuador-and-china-sign-a-commercial-and-security-agreement-p384-90.htm |location=Cuenca, Ecuador |work=Cuenca News Digest |title=Ecuador and China Sign a Commercial and Security Agreement |date=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Colombia's actions were condemned across the board by all South American nations, with only the US supporting Colombia. For example, Brazil's foreign minister, Celso Amorim, condemned the Colombian incursion into Ecuador.&lt;ref name=&quot;edition.cnn.com&quot; /&gt;

On November 16, 2008, the Foreign Minister of Ecuador [[Maria Isabel Salvador]] met her counterpart, [[Pranab Mukherjee]], with a close relationship in oil and defence between these geographically distant countries high on the agenda. On the oil front, the new government in [[Ecuador]] has reversed the earlier revenue-sharing arrangements with western oil companies and is now keen on striking new partnerships with state-owned [[ONGC]] Videsh of [[India]].
In the defence sector, Ecuador became the first country to sign a contract for purchasing the Indian made [[HAL Dhruv|Dhruv]] helicopters of which one will be for use by its President. The Embassy has expanded its setup with the appointment of a Military Attache and prospects appear bright for more defence exports as Ecuador has agreed to be the servicing hub in South America for Indian defence equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/11/18/stories/2008111860331100.htm |location=Chennai, India |work=The Hindu |title=India to boost oil, defence ties with Ecuador |date=November 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Paquisha War]] was a brief military clash that took place between January and February 1981 between Ecuador and Peru over the control of three watchposts. Since the 1990s, Ecuadoran foreign policy has been focused on the country's [[History of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian territorial dispute|border dispute]] with [[Peru]], an issue that has festered since independence.  The boundary dispute led to the [[Cenepa War]] between Ecuador and Peru in early 1995; after a peace agreement brokered by the four Guarantors of the Rio Protocol ([[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], and the United States), the Military Observers Mission to Ecuador-Peru (MOMEP) was set up to monitor the zone.
In 1998, Presidents [[Jamil Mahuad]] of Ecuador and [[Alberto Fujimori]] of Peru signed a comprehensive settlement over control of the disputed zone.

Relations between the United Kingdom and Ecuador were traditionally regarded as &quot;low-key but cordial&quot;, especially before the election of Rafael Correa; the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] and [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Duchess of Cornwall]] visited the country in 2009, as part of a tour celebrating the bicentenary of [[Charles Darwin]].

In 2012, relations became strained when [[Julian Assange]], founder of the [[WikiLeaks]] website, entered the [[Embassy of Ecuador, London|Ecuadorian embassy]] in London and sought asylum.

The United States and Ecuador used to maintain close ties based on mutual interests in maintaining democratic institutions; combating cannabis and cocaine; building trade, investment, and financial ties; cooperating in fostering Ecuador's economic development; and participating in inter-American organizations. Ties were further strengthened by the presence of an estimated 150,000–200,000 Ecuadorians living in the United States and by 24,000 U.S. citizens visiting Ecuador annually, and by approximately 15,000 U.S. citizens residing in Ecuador. The United States assisted Ecuador's economic development directly through the [[Agency for International Development]] (USAID) program in Ecuador and through multilateral organizations such as the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] and the [[World Bank]]. In addition, the U.S. [[Peace Corps]] operates a sizable program in Ecuador. More than 100 U.S. companies are doing business in Ecuador. The relations have deteriorated greatly in recent years, since [[Rafael Correa]] came to power in Ecuador.

Diplomatic ties trace back to the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]. With the independence both countries united under the [[Gran Colombia]] along with [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] (then [[Colombia]] and [[Panama]]).

After the dissolution of the Gran Colombia, Ecuador named Don Pedro Gual as plenipotentiary minister with the main task of resolving the debt acquired while part of the Gran Colombia union as well as to establish diplomatic relations with the [[Republic of New Granada|New Granada]] and Venezuela.  On August 4, 1852 Venezuela sent a diplomatic delegation in [[Quito]] and named José Julián Ponce as finance administrator.

The relations remained cordial and entered into a second period between 1910 and 1963 with two diplomatic incidents occurring in 1928 and 1955. Ecuador and Venezuela strengthened ties in politics, diplomacy and military.
