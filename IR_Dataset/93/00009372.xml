===Internet censorship and surveillance===

There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet or credible reports the government monitors [[e-mail]] or Internet [[chat rooms]] without judicial oversight. Most overt criticism of the government comes from the country's community in exile, and the Internet has replaced broadcast media as the primary way opposition views were expressed and disseminated.&lt;ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-EquatorialGuinea-2012&gt;[https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2012&amp;dlid=204115 &quot;Equatorial Guinea&quot;], ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012'', Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 22 March 2013. Retrieved 10 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the constitution and law provide for [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press|press]], the law grants authorities extensive powers to restrict media activities, which the government uses to limit these rights. While criticism of government policies is allowed, individuals generally can not criticize the president, his family, other high-ranking officials, or the security forces without fear of reprisal. [[Libel]] is a criminal offense, but there were no instances of the government using these laws to suppress criticism during 2012.&lt;ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-EquatorialGuinea-2012/&gt;

The constitution and law prohibit arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence, but the government often does not respect these prohibitions. Search warrants are required unless the crime is in progress or for reasons of national security. Security forces enter homes without authorization and arrest alleged criminals, foreign nationals, and others, often without required judicial orders.  The government reportedly attempts to impede criticism by monitoring the activities of the political opposition, journalists, and others. Journalists are subject to surveillance and practice [[self-censorship]].&lt;ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-EquatorialGuinea-2012/&gt;
