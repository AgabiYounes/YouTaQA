== Roads ==
[[File:Main roads of Estonia.svg|thumb|250px|Estonian main and E-roads]]
*total: 57,565&amp;nbsp;km (including 16,465 of national roads)
*paved: 12,926&amp;nbsp;km (including 99&amp;nbsp;km of [[limited-access road]]s)

===National roads===
{{main|Highways in Estonia}}
National roads form the core of Estonian road network. Their total length is 16,489&amp;nbsp;km (or 28% of all roads), 67% of them are paved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mnt.ee/failid/MNT_Aastaraamat2013_eng.pdf |title=Annual Report 2013 |publisher=Estonian Road Administration |accessdate=2013-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are divided into 4 classes according to importance:
*main roads (1,607&amp;nbsp;km)
*basic roads (2,406&amp;nbsp;km)

===Electric vehicle network===

Estonia is the first country in the [[European Union|EU]] and in the world to introduce a nationwide, publicly serviced charging system for charging the [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] of [[electric vehicle]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;http://elmo.ee/estonia-becomes-the-first-in-the-world-to-open-a-nationwide-ev-fast-charging-network/&lt;/ref&gt; The 165 fast charging stations are equipped with connectors of the [[CHAdeMO]] standard. They are located throughout the entire country, including the [[island]]s, and have a maximum distance of 40–60&amp;nbsp;km in between. The charging stations can also be navigated via a [[smartphone]] [[mobile app|app]] (currently only for [[Android (operating system)|Android]]). The relatively dense network and 30 minute quick charges are built to enable a country-wide [[electric vehicle network]]. The system offers a unitary booking service and several different tariffs, some of which appear attractively low priced.&lt;ref&gt;http://elmo.ee/pricing/&lt;/ref&gt; The charging station network puts Estonia at the forefront in [[Europe]] even though [[Norway]] actually has a higher penetration of [[electric vehicle]]s. Estonia has a rate of 1 electric vehicle per 1000 capita, whereas [[Norway]] has 4 EVs per 1000 capita.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

== Railways ==

{{main|Rail transport in Estonia}}

*total: 900&amp;nbsp;km common carrier lines only (1200&amp;nbsp;km including dedicated industrial lines)
*broad gauge: 900&amp;nbsp;km {{RailGauge|1520mm}} or {{RailGauge|1524mm}} gauge (133&amp;nbsp;km electrified)

==Light rail==
{{see also|Public transport in Tallinn}}
There has been a growing tram network in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]] since 1888, when traffic was started by horse-powered trams. The first line was electrified on October 28, 1925. The first electric trams were built by Dvigatel, Ltd., in Tallinn before [[World War II]] and for some years after that, the last one in 1954. In the 1920s and 1930s gas-powered trams were also used. Since 1955 to 1988 [[Germany|German]]-built trams were used. In total, there were 20 LOWA T54-B54 trams (in use from February 1955 to March 1977), 11 Gotha T57-B57 (in use from January 1958 to June 1978), 5 Gotha T59E-B59E (in use from June 1960 to February 1980), 14 Gotha T2-62 and B2-62 (in use from 1962 to 1981) and 50 Gotha G4 trams (in use from January 1965 to October 1988) trams. The first [[Czechoslovakia]]n-built [[ČKD Tatra]] T4SU arrived in 1973. The T4SU trams were in use from May 1973 to September 2005 and there were 60 of them. The first [[Tatra KT4|KT4SU]] arrived in Tallinn in 1981 and was first in use on March 10, 1981. In 2007, there are 56 KT4SU, 12 [[Tatra KTNF6|KTNF6]] (rebuilt KT4SUs, 10 local, one from [[Gera]] and one from [[Erfurt]]) and 23 KT4D (12 from Gera, 6 from [[Cottbus]], 1 from [[Frankfurt (Oder)]] and 5 from Erfurt) in use. As of 2018, there are four lines: 1 ([[Kopli]]-[[Kadriorg]]), 2 (Kopli-[[Ülemiste (subdistrict)|Ülemiste]]), 3 ([[Tondi, Tallinn|Tondi]]-Kadriorg) and 4 (Tondi- [[Tallinn_Airport |Lennujaam (Airport)]]). There have also been lines 5 (Kopli-[[Vana-Lõuna]], shut down in 2004 because of small usage) and 6 (Kopli-Tondi, temporarily used in time of repairs).

== Ports and harbours ==
Estonia has 45 ports in the State Port Register. With a few exceptions, all of them are on the [[Baltic Sea]].

Largest ports are [[Port of Muuga|Muuga]] (near Tallinn), [[Tallinn]] (comprises several ports), [[Paldiski]], [[Kunda, Estonia|Kunda]], [[Pärnu]] and [[Sillamäe]].

== Merchant marine ==
Since 2014, there have been no vessels over 500gt on the Estonian register. About 60 merchant vessels are beneficially owned in Estonia, with most of them registered in Malta. The government has started a drive to bring more of these vessels back into the Estonian register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Baltic Course |url=http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/good_for_business/?doc=134810 |accessdate=27 November 2018 |date=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
