The original members of what came to be known as the [[European Communities]] were the [[Inner Six]]: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and [[West Germany]]. The Communities and their successors have grown in size by [[enlargement of the European Union|the accession of new member states]] and in power by the addition of policy areas to their remit. The latest major amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], came into force in 2009.

It also led directly to the founding of the [[Council of Europe]] in 1949, the first great effort to bring the nations of Europe together, initially ten of them. The Council focused primarily on values—human rights and democracy—rather than on economic or trade issues, and was always envisaged as a forum where sovereign governments could choose to work together, with no supra-national authority. It raised great hopes of further European integration, and there were fevered debates in the two years that followed as to how this could be achieved.

But in 1952, disappointed at what they saw as the lack of progress within the Council of Europe, six nations decided to go further and created the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which was declared to be &quot;a first step in the federation of Europe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Declaration of 9 May 1950|url=http://europa.eu/abc/symbols/9-may/decl_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=5 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This community helped to economically integrate and coordinate the large number of [[Marshall Plan]] funds from the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/1084818.html|title=Europe: How The Marshall Plan Took Western Europe From Ruins To Union|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|language=en|access-date=20 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; European leaders [[Alcide De Gasperi]] from Italy, [[Jean Monnet]] and [[Robert Schuman]] from France, and [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] from Belgium understood that coal and steel were the two industries essential for waging war, and believed that by tying their national industries together, future war between their nations became much less likely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa History 45-59&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/eu-history/1945-1959/index_en.htm|title=A peaceful Europe&amp;nbsp;– the beginnings of cooperation|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These men and others are officially credited as the [[founding fathers of the European Union]].

Euratom was to integrate sectors in nuclear energy while the EEC would develop a customs union among members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/a_european_atomic_energy_community-en-19bc7f11-bea1-49c7-b534-18327c303f41.html |title=A European Atomic Energy Community |publisher=Cvce.eu |date=13 October 1997 |accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/a_european_customs_union-en-a11a5f17-d744-479e-ba75-2c70b6058608.html|title=A European Customs Union|work=cvce.eu|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, tensions began to show, with France seeking to limit supranational power. Nevertheless, in 1965 an agreement was reached and on 1 July 1967 the [[Merger Treaty]] created a single set of institutions for the three communities, which were collectively referred to as the ''[[European Communities]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ENA Merge&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/merging_the_executives-en-575850b6-f472-406a-936d-8c08a9e0db32.html|title=Merging the executives|publisher=CVCE&amp;nbsp;– Centre Virtuel de la Connaissance sur l'Europe|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvce.eu/obj/merging_the_executives-en-575850b6-f472-406a-936d-8c08a9e0db32.html Merging the executives] CVCE.eu&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Rey (politician)|Jean Rey]] [[President of the European Commission|presided over]] the first merged Commission ([[Rey Commission]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/archives/commission_2004-2009/index_en.htm Discover the former Presidents: The Rey Commission], Europa (web portal).

=== Maastricht Treaty (1992{{ndash}}2007) ===
[[File:Euro Series Banknotes (2019).jpg|thumb|right|The [[euro]] was introduced in 2002, replacing 12 national currencies. Seven countries have since joined.]]

The European Union was formally established when the [[Maastricht Treaty]]—whose main architects were [[Helmut Kohl]] and [[François Mitterrand]]—came into force on 1 November 1993.{{sfn|Craig |De Burca|2011|page=15}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treaty of Maastricht on European Union|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/economic_and_monetary_affairs/institutional_and_economic_framework/treaties_maastricht_en.htm|work=Activities of the European Union|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=20 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty also gave the name [[European Community]] to the EEC, even if it was referred as such before the treaty. With further enlargement planned to include the former [[communist state]]s of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as [[Cyprus]] and [[Malta]], the [[Copenhagen criteria]] for candidate members to join the EU were agreed upon in June 1993. The expansion of the EU introduced a new level of complexity and discord.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; In 1995, [[Austria]], [[Finland]], and [[Sweden]] [[1995 enlargement of the European Union|joined]] the EU.

In 2002, euro banknotes and coins replaced national currencies in 12 of the member states. Since then, the [[eurozone]] has increased to encompass 19 countries. The euro currency became the second largest reserve currency in the world. In 2004, the EU saw [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|its biggest enlargement to date]] when [[Cyprus]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Estonia]], [[Hungary]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Malta]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Slovenia]] joined the Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa History 00&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=A decade of further expansion |publisher=Europa web portal |url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/2000_today/index_en.htm |accessdate=25 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211143505/http://europa.eu/abc/history/2000_today/index_en.htm |archivedate=11 February 2007 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lisbon Treaty (2007{{ndash}}present)===
In 2007, [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]] became EU members. The same year, [[Slovenian euro coins|Slovenia]] adopted the euro,&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa History 00&quot;/&gt; followed in 2008 by [[Cypriot euro coins|Cyprus]] and [[Maltese euro coins|Malta]], by [[Slovak euro coins|Slovakia]] in 2009, by [[Estonian euro coins|Estonia]] in 2011, by [[Latvian euro coins|Latvia]] in 2014, and by [[Lithuania euro coins|Lithuania]] in 2015.

On 1 December 2009, the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]] entered into force and reformed many aspects of the EU. In particular, it changed the legal structure of the European Union, merging the [[Three pillars of the European Union|EU three pillars]] system into a single legal entity provisioned with a [[legal personality]], created a permanent [[President of the European Council]], the first of which was [[Herman Van Rompuy]], and strengthened the position of the [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]].{{sfn|Piris|2010|page=448}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://government.zdnet.com/?p=6266|title=European Parliament announces new President and Foreign Affairs Minister|accessdate=1 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criteria for accession to the Union are included in the [[Copenhagen criteria]], agreed in 1993, and the [[Maastricht Treaty|Treaty of Maastricht]] (Article 49). Article 49 of the Maastricht Treaty (as amended) says that any &quot;European state&quot; that respects the &quot;principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law&quot;, may apply to join the EU.

Christians in the European Union are divided among members of Catholicism (both [[Latin Church|Roman]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite]]), numerous [[Protestant]] denominations ([[Anglicans]], [[Lutherans]], and [[Reformed]] forming the bulk of this category), and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].

==Member states==
{{Main|Member state of the European Union}}
Through successive [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargements]], the European Union has grown from the [[Inner Six|six founding states]] (Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) to the current {{EUnum}}. Countries accede to the union by becoming party to the founding [[Treaties of the European Union|treaties]], thereby subjecting themselves to the privileges and obligations of EU membership. This entails a partial delegation of sovereignty to the institutions in return for representation within those institutions, a practice often referred to as &quot;pooling of sovereignty&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/pooled-sovereignty|title=Answers {{ndash}} The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|work=Answers.com|accessdate=12 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120091030/http://www.answers.com/topic/pooled-sovereignty|archive-date=20 January 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU institutions and other bodies |url=http://europa.eu/institutions/index_en.htm |publisher=Europa |accessdate=4 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601191547/http://europa.eu/institutions/index_en.htm |archivedate=1 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To become a member, a country must meet the [[Copenhagen criteria]], defined at the 1993 meeting of the European Council in Copenhagen. These require a stable democracy that respects human rights and the [[rule of law]]; a functioning [[market economy]]; and the acceptance of the obligations of membership, including EU law.

===Geography===
{{Main|Geography of the European Union}}
The EU's member states cover an area of {{convert|4,233,262|km2|sqmi|0}}.&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot; name=&quot;Area.and.population.figure&quot;&gt;This figure includes the extra-European territories of member states which are part of the European Union, and excludes the European territories of member states which are not part of the Union.

Including the overseas territories of France which are located outside the continent of Europe, but which are members of the union, the EU experiences most [[Köppen climate classification|types of climate]] from [[Polar climate|Arctic]] (north-east Europe) to tropical ([[French Guiana]]), rendering meteorological averages for the EU as a whole meaningless. The majority of the population lives in areas with a temperate [[oceanic climate|maritime climate]] (North-Western Europe and Central Europe), a [[Mediterranean climate]] (Southern Europe), or a warm summer continental or [[hemiboreal]] climate (Northern [[Balkans]] and Central Europe).&lt;ref name=&quot;Humid Continental climate&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/climate_systems/humid_continental.html |title=Humid Continental Climate |year=2007 |publisher=University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point |work=The physical environment |accessdate=29 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070530170321/http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/climate_systems/humid_continental.html |archivedate=30 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU's population is highly urbanised, with some 75% of inhabitants living in [[urban area]]s as of 2006. Cities are largely spread out across the EU with a large grouping in and around the [[Benelux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/eea_report_2006_10/eea_report_10_2006.pdf |title=Urban sprawl in Europe: The ignored challenge, European Environmental Agency |date=2006|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[European Union law|Laws made by the EU institutions]] are passed in a variety of forms.&lt;ref&gt;According to P.C. Schmitter, Comparative Politics: Its Past, Present and Future (2016), 1 Chinese Political Science Review, 397, at 410, &quot;European Union is the most complex polity in the world&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, they can be classified into two groups: those which come into force without the necessity for national implementation measures (regulations) and those which specifically require national implementation measures (directives).&lt;ref&gt;These legislative instruments are dealt with in more detail [[#Acts|below]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Constitutionally, the EU bears some resemblance to both a [[confederation]] and a [[federation]],&lt;ref&gt;Kiljunen, Kimmo (2004). The European Constitution in the Making. Centre for European Policy Studies. pp. 21–26. {{ISBN|978-92-9079-493-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Michael (2000). Federalism and European union: The building of Europe, 1950–2000. Routledge. p. 49. {{ISBN|0-415-22647-3}}. &quot;Our theoretical analysis suggests that the EC/EU is neither a federation nor a confederation in the classical sense. But it does claim that the European political and economic elites have shaped and moulded the EC/EU into a new form of international organization, namely, a species of &quot;new&quot; confederation.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; but has not formally defined itself as either. (It does not have a formal constitution: its status is defined by the [[Treaty of European Union]] and the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]). It is more integrated than a traditional confederation of states because the general level of government widely employs [[qualified majority voting]] in some decision-making among the member states, rather than relying exclusively on unanimity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/voting-system/qualified-majority/|title=Qualified majority - Consilium|website=www.consilium.europa.eu|access-date=10 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://signon.thomsonreuters.com/?comp=pluk&amp;productid=PLCUK&amp;viewproductid=UKPL&amp;lr=0&amp;culture=en-US&amp;returnto=https%3a%2f%2fuk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com%2fCosi%2fSignOn%3fcomp%3dpluk%26redirectTo%3d%252f9-503-0498%253ftransitionType%253dDefault%2526contextData%253d(sc.Default)%2526firstPage%253dtrue%2526comp%253dpluk%2526bhcp%253d1&amp;tracetoken=0410191706400iocfH6ix9aDAXboKMKljGSEQbVenO3hRbkBiVwSpjK1nPrIZleK0m_ZYArfREaHTp00rbJNn9JJiUMtpuREV-tBpbDUn6jga8Zl9POgeorx-_ajnZ8E3JYaIx_LR8_3ZDgttQ2Na2blkP5wVQ4ab8NCop3kx46Kc2OAzz_TmEl3CC7PuHaHnrnMSp6Iff0Ha6hnq7X8w-OJXGJwNOPAhExqg5qLTz6c5ZWem1fKcj3l-9-h9cvMeVpfodmsngI5XZ8ruL99SM4ZCzGSNyROceid4Z3KboCsVabuZY0E-uiLtwSweJKfAwbVwR05UE0UIdD0SkAXveKEjxj9NIp2XCOCilihh1It2arRlZYHQ0Fc|title=Practical Law UK Signon|website=signon.thomsonreuters.com|access-date=10 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is less integrated than a federal state because it is not a state in its own right: sovereignty continues to flow 'from the bottom up', from the several peoples of the separate member states, rather than from a single undifferentiated whole. This is reflected in the fact that the member states remain the 'masters of the Treaties', retaining control over the allocation of competences to the Union through constitutional change (thus retaining so-called ''Kompetenz-kompetenz''); in that they retain control of the use of armed force; they retain control of taxation; and in that they retain a right of unilateral withdrawal from the Union under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. In addition, the principle of [[subsidiarity]] requires that only those matters that need to be determined collectively are so determined.

The European Union has seven principal decision-making bodies, its [[Institutions of the European Union|institutions]]: the [[European Parliament]], the [[European Council]], the [[Council of the European Union]], the [[European Commission]], the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]], the [[European Central Bank]] and the [[European Court of Auditors]]. Competence in scrutinising and amending legislation is shared between the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, while executive tasks are performed by the European Commission and in a limited capacity by the European Council (not to be confused with the aforementioned Council of the European Union). The [[monetary policy]] of the [[eurozone]] is determined by the European Central Bank. The interpretation and the application of EU law and the treaties are ensured by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The EU budget is scrutinised by the European Court of Auditors. There are also a number of ancillary bodies which advise the EU or operate in a specific area.
* the [[European Council]], which sets the ''general political directions'' and ''priorities'' of the Union by gathering together its member states' [[Head of state|heads of state]]/[[Head of government|government]] (elected chief executives). The conclusions of its summits (held at least quarterly) are adopted by consensus.
* the [[European Commission]], the only institution empowered to propose legislation, serves as the &quot;Guardian of the Treaties&quot;. It consists of an [[Cabinet (government)|executive cabinet]] of public officials, led by an [[Indirect election|indirectly elected]] President. This ''College of Commissioners'' manages and directs the Commission's permanent civil service. It turns the consensus objectives of the European Council into [[European Union law|legislative proposals]].
* the [[Council of the European Union]] brings together ministers of member states governments' departments. It serves to represent the various governments directly and its approval is required for any proposal to enter into law.
* the [[European Parliament]] consists of 705 directly elected representatives. It shares with the Council of the EU equal legislative powers to amend, approve or reject Commission proposals for most areas of EU legislation. Its powers are limited in areas where member states' view sovereignty to be of primary concern (i.e. defence). It elects the Commission's President, must approve the College of Commissioners, and may vote to remove them collectively from office.
* the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] ensures the uniform application of EU law and resolves disputes between EU institutions and member states, and against EU institutions on behalf of individuals.
* the [[European Central Bank]] is responsible for monetary stability within member states.
* the [[European Court of Auditors]] investigates the proper management of finances within both the EU entities and EU funding provided to its member states. As well as providing oversight and advice, it can refer unresolved issues to the European Court of Justice to arbitrate on any alleged irregularities.

EU policy is in general promulgated by [[Directive (European Union)|EU directives]], which are then implemented in the [[Sovereignty|domestic legislation]] of its [[Member state of the European Union|member states]], and [[Regulation (European Union)|EU regulations]], which are immediately enforceable in all member states. [[Lobbying#European Union|Lobbying]] at EU level by special interest groups is regulated to try to balance the aspirations of private initiatives with public interest decision-making process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2013/130558/LDM_BRI(2013)130558_REV1_EN.pdf |title=EU Library Briefing:Lobbying the EU institutions |work=Europarl |access-date=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Parliament ===
[[File:European Parliament Strasbourg Hemicycle - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|The [[hemicycle]] of the [[European Parliament]] in Strasbourg]]
[[File:David Maria Sassoli.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[President of the European Parliament]], [[David Sassoli]]]]
The [[European Parliament]] is one of three [[Legislature of the European Union|legislative institutions]] of the EU, which together with the [[Council of the European Union]] is tasked with amending and approving the [[European Commission|Commission]]'s proposals.
The 705 [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] (MEPs) are directly [[Elections in the European Union|elected]] by [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizens]] every five years on the basis of [[proportional representation]]. MEPs are elected on a national basis and they sit according to [[Political groups of the European Parliament|political groups]] rather than their nationality. Each country has a set number of seats and is divided into [[European Parliament constituency|sub-national constituencies]] where this does not affect the proportional nature of the voting system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wellfire Interactive |url=http://www.fairvote.org/european-parliament-to-be-elected-with-proportional-representation-systems |title=MEPs must be elected on the basis of proportional representation, the threshold must not exceed 5%, and the electoral area may be subdivided in constituencies if this will not generally affect the proportional nature of the voting system |publisher=Fairvote.org |accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[ordinary legislative procedure]], the European Commission proposes legislation, which requires the joint approval of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union to pass. This process applies to nearly all areas, including the [[budget of the European Union|EU budget]]. The Parliament is the final body to approve or reject the proposed membership of the Commission, and can attempt motions of censure on the Commission by appeal to the [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]]. The [[President of the European Parliament]] (currently [[David Sassoli]]) carries out the role of speaker in Parliament and represents it externally.

=== European Council ===
[[File:Charles Michel (2018-01-31) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[President of the European Council]], [[Charles Michel]]]]

The European Council gives political direction to the EU. It convenes at least four times a year and comprises the [[President of the European Council]] (currently [[Charles Michel]]), the [[President of the European Commission]] and one representative per [[member state of the European Union|member state]] (either its [[head of state]] or [[head of government]]). The [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]] (currently [[Federica Mogherini]]) also takes part in its meetings. It has been described by some as the Union's &quot;supreme political authority&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;How work&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=How does the EU work|publisher=Europa (web portal)|url=http://europa.eu/abc/12lessons/lesson_4/index_en.htm|accessdate=12 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is actively involved in the negotiation of [[Treaties of the European Union|treaty changes]] and defines the EU's policy agenda and strategies.

The European Council uses its leadership role to sort out disputes between member states and the institutions, and to resolve political crises and disagreements over controversial issues and policies. It acts externally as a &quot;[[head of state|collective head of state]]&quot; and [[ratification|ratifies]] important documents (for example, international agreements and treaties).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aMsWxEnaqrUC&amp;pg=PA146 ''With US or against US?: European trends in American perspective''] Parsons, Jabko. European Union Studies Association, p.146:&lt;br /&gt;''Fourth, the European Council acts a &quot;collective head of state&quot; for the EU.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Tasks for the [[President of the European Council]] are ensuring the external representation of the EU,&lt;ref name=&quot;Council Press Release&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/111298.pdf|title=President of the European Council|accessdate=24 November 2009|date=24 November 2009|publisher=General Secretariat of the Council of the EU}}&lt;/ref&gt; driving consensus and resolving divergences among member states, both during meetings of the European Council and over the periods between them.

The European Council should not be mistaken for the [[Council of Europe]], an international organisation independent of the EU based in Strasbourg.

=== Council of the European Union ===

The [[Council of the European Union]] (also called the &quot;Council&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Latin word ''consilium'' is occasionally used when a single identifier is required, as on [http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ the Council Web site].&lt;/ref&gt; and the &quot;Council of Ministers&quot;, its former title)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/pol/inst/index_en.htm |title=Institutional affairs: Council of the European Union |date=6 January 2010 |work=Europa |publisher=European Commission |quote=It is commonly called the Council of Ministers}}.&lt;/ref&gt; forms one half of the EU's legislature. It consists of a [[minister (government)|government minister]] from each member state and meets in [[Council of the European Union#Configurations|different compositions depending on the policy area being addressed]]. Notwithstanding its different configurations, it is considered to be one single body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa Institutions Council&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Institutions: The Council of the European Union |publisher=Europa web portal |url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/council/index_en.htm |accessdate=25 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703155822/http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/council/index_en.htm |archivedate=3 July 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its legislative functions, the Council also exercises [[executive functions]] in relations to the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]].

In some policies, there are several member states that ally with strategic partners within the Union. Examples of such alliances include the [[Visegrad Group]], [[Benelux]], the [[Baltic Assembly]], the [[New Hanseatic League]], and the [[Craiova Group]].

The [[European Commission]] acts both as the EU's [[executive (government)|executive arm]], responsible for the day-to-day running of the EU, and also the [[Right of initiative (legislative)|legislative initiator]], with the sole power to propose laws for debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/about-parliament/en/powers-and-procedures/legislative-powers|work=European Parliament|title=Legislative powers|accessdate=13 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Library of European Parliament&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2013/130619/LDM_BRI(2013)130619_REV2_EN.pdf|work=Library of the European Parliament|title=Parliament's legislative initiative|date=24 October 2013|accessdate=13 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-making-process/planning-and-proposing-law_en|work=European Commission|title=Planning and proposing law|date=20 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission is 'guardian of the Treaties' and is responsible for their efficient operation and policing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cvce.eu/en/education/unit-content/-/unit/d5906df5-4f83-4603-85f7-0cabc24b9fe1/28d57ad3-6f5e-4f9c-82a8-be9535febad5 | title=Guardian of the Treaties | work=CVCE Education Unit| publisher = University of Luxembourg | accessdate = 8 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It operates ''de facto'' as a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet government]], with 27 [[European Commissioner|Commissioners]] for different areas of policy, one from each member state, though Commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home state.

One of the 27 is the [[President of the European Commission]] ([[Jean-Claude Juncker]] for 2014{{ndash}}2019), [[President of the European Commission#Appointment|appointed by the European Council]], subject to the Parliament's approval. After the President, the most prominent Commissioner is the [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]], who is ''ex-officio'' a [[Vice-President of the European Commission|Vice-President of the Commission]] and is also chosen by the European Council.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title III: Provisions on the Institutions#Article 17|Treaty on European Union: Article 17:7]]&lt;/ref&gt; The other 26 Commissioners are subsequently appointed by the [[Council of the European Union]] in agreement with the nominated President. The 27 Commissioners as a single body are subject to approval (or otherwise) by vote of the [[European Parliament]].

The EU had an agreed budget of €120.7&amp;nbsp;billion for the year 2007 and €864.3&amp;nbsp;billion for the period 2007–2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-06-204_en.htm|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES - Press release - Q&amp;amp;A on Interinstitutional Agreement on Budgetary Discipline and Sound Financial Management 2007-2013|website=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing 1.10% and 1.05% of the EU-27's [[Gross national income|GNI]] forecast for the respective periods.

In the 2010 budget of €141.5&amp;nbsp;billion, the largest single expenditure item is &quot;''[[Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund|cohesion &amp; competitiveness]]''&quot; with around 45% of the total budget.&lt;ref name=&quot;EUBudget2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=EU Budget in detail 2010 |publisher=Europa web portal |author=European Commission |format=PDF |url=http://ec.europa.eu/budget/budget_detail/current_year_en.htm |accessdate=20 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815112106/http://ec.europa.eu/budget/budget_detail/current_year_en.htm |archivedate=15 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Next comes &quot;''[[Common Agricultural Policy|agriculture]]''&quot; with approximately 31% of the total.&lt;ref name=&quot;EUBudget2010&quot;/&gt; &quot;''Rural development, environment and [[Common Fisheries Policy|fisheries]]''&quot; takes up around 11%.&lt;ref name=&quot;EUBudget2010&quot;/&gt; &quot;''Administration''&quot; accounts for around 6%.&lt;ref name=&quot;EUBudget2010&quot;/&gt; The &quot;''EU as a global partner''&quot; and &quot;''citizenship, freedom, security and justice''&quot; bring up the rear with approximately 6% and 1% respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;EUBudget2010&quot;/&gt;

The [[Court of Auditors]] is legally obliged to provide the Parliament and the Council (specifically, the [[Economic and Financial Affairs Council]]) with &quot;a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], Section 7, Article 287.{{cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=EN | title = Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union |publisher = European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court also gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa Institutions Auditors&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Institutions: Court of Auditors |publisher=Europa (web portal) |url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/auditors/index_en.htm |accessdate=8 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222001147/http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/auditors/index_en.htm |archivedate=22 December 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parliament uses this to decide whether to approve the Commission's handling of the budget.

The European Court of Auditors has signed off the European Union accounts every year since 2007 and, while making it clear that the European Commission has more work to do, has highlighted that most of the errors take place at national level.&lt;ref name=&quot;European Court of Auditors&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 annual report|publisher=Europa (web portal)|url=http://www.eca.europa.eu/en/Pages/AR_2012.aspx|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;European Commission&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ECintheUK/european-auditors-point-to-errors-but-sign-off-eus-accounts/|title=European auditors point to errors but sign off EU's accounts – some UK media decline to listen to what the auditors say|publisher=Europa (web portal)|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In their report on 2009 the auditors found that five areas of Union expenditure, [[Common Agricultural Policy|agriculture]] and the [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund|cohesion fund]], were materially affected by error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eca.europa.eu/portal/pls/portal/docs/1/5926723.PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221211745/http://eca.europa.eu/portal/pls/portal/docs/1/5926723.PDF |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 February 2011 |title=Annual Report of the Court of Auditors on the implementation of the budget concerning the financial year 2009, together with the institutions' replies |page=12 |accessdate=18 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission estimated in 2009 that the financial effect of irregularities was €1,863&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/anti_fraud/reports/commission/2009/en.pdf|title=Protection of the European Union's financial interests – Fight against fraud – Annual Report 2009 (''vid.'' pp. 6, 15)|publisher=Europa|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729063014/http://ec.europa.eu/anti_fraud/reports/commission/2009/en.pdf|archivedate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competences===
EU member states retain all powers not explicitly handed to the European Union. In some areas the EU enjoys exclusive competence. These are areas in which member states have renounced any capacity to enact legislation. In other areas the EU and its member states share the competence to legislate. While both can legislate, member states can only legislate to the extent to which the EU has not. In other policy areas the EU can only co-ordinate, support and supplement member state action but cannot enact legislation with the aim of harmonising national laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/consumers/events/2009/index.html|title=Competences and consumers|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That a particular policy area falls into a certain category of competence is not necessarily indicative of what [[Legislature of the European Union|legislative procedure]] is used for enacting legislation within that policy area. Different legislative procedures are used within the same category of competence, and even with the same policy area.

The distribution of competences in various policy areas between Member States and the Union is divided in the following three categories:
{{EU competences}}

==Legal system and justice==
{{Further|European Union law|Treaties of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union}}
The EU is based on a series of [[Treaties of the European Union|treaties]]. These first established the European Community and the EU, and then made amendments to those founding treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sources of EU law|url=http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/general_information/legal_information_and_eu_law/sources_eu_law/index_en.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228193407/http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/general_information/legal_information_and_eu_law/sources_eu_law/index_en.htm|archivedate=28 February 2008|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=5 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are power-giving treaties which set broad policy goals and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers to implement those goals. These legal powers include the ability to enact legislation&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot; name=&quot;art249&quot;&gt;See Article 288 (ex Article 249 TEC) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0047:0200:EN:PDF eur-lex.europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; which can directly affect all member states and their inhabitants.&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot; name=&quot;Direct Effect&quot;&gt;According to the principle of Direct Effect first invoked in the Court of Justice's decision in {{cite court|litigants=Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen|reporter=Eur-Lex|court=European Court of Justice|year=1963|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61962J0026:EN:NOT}} See: Craig and de Búrca, ch. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The EU has [[legal personality]], with the right to sign agreements and international treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Philippe |last=de Schoutheete|last2=Andoura |first2=Sami |title=The Legal Personality of the European Union |journal=Studia Diplomatica |volume=LX |year=2007 |issue=1 |url=http://aei.pitt.edu/9083/01/Legal.Personality.EU-PDS-SA.pdf |accessdate=15 November 2010}} Its examples are the ratifications of [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]] and [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] by EU. And Article 47 of the Consolidated Treaty on European Union.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the principle of [[Supremacy (European Union law)|supremacy]], national courts are required to enforce the treaties that their member states have ratified, and thus the laws enacted under them, even if doing so requires them to ignore conflicting national law, and (within limits) even constitutional provisions.&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot; name=&quot;Supremacy&quot;&gt;According to the principle of [[Law of the European Union#Supremacy|Supremacy]] as established by the ECJ in Case 6/64, ''Falminio Costa v. ENEL'' [1964] ECR 585. See Craig and de Búrca, ch. 7. See also: [[Factortame litigation]]: ''Factortame Ltd. v. Secretary of State for Transport (No. 2) [1991] 1 AC 603'', ''Solange II'' (''Re Wuensche Handelsgesellschaft'', BVerfG decision of 22 October 1986 [1987] 3 CMLR 225,265) and ''Frontini v. Ministero delle Finanze'' [1974] 2 CMLR 372; ''Raoul George Nicolo'' [1990] 1 CMLR 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[direct effect]] and supremacy doctrines were not explicitly set out the European Treaties but were developed by the Court of Justice itself over the 1960s, apparently under the influence of its then most influential judge, Frenchman [[Robert Lecourt]]&lt;ref&gt;William Phelan, ''Great Judgments of the European Court of Justice: Rethinking the Landmark Decisions of the Foundational Period'' (Cambridge, 2019).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Courts of Justice===
[[File:European Court of Justice - Luxembourg (1674586821).jpg|thumb|The [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]], seated in Luxembourg City]]
The [[judiciary|judicial branch]] of the EU—formally called the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]]—consists of two courts: the [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]] and the [[General Court (European Union)|General Court]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0013:0046:EN:PDF |title=Article 19 of the Treaty on European Union |publisher=eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Court of Justice primarily deals with cases taken by member states, the institutions, and [[Preliminary ruling|cases referred to it]] by the courts of member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Court of Justice: presentation |url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7024/#competences |publisher=Europa web portal |accessdate=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the doctrines of [[direct effect]] and supremacy, many judgments of the Court of Justice are automatically applicable within the internal legal orders of the member states.

The General Court mainly deals with cases taken by individuals and companies directly before the EU's courts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=General Court: presentation |url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7033/#compet |publisher=Europa web portal |accessdate=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the European Union Civil Service Tribunal adjudicates in disputes between the European Union and [[European Civil Service|its civil service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Civil Service Tribunal: presentation |url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/T5_5230/#compétence |publisher=Europa web portal |accessdate=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decisions from the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice but only on a point of law.&lt;ref&gt;Article 256(1) (ex article 225(1)) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0047:0200:EN:PDF eur-lex.europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fundamental rights===

The treaties declare that the EU itself is &quot;founded on the values of respect for [[human dignity]], [[liberty|freedom]], democracy, [[equality before the law|equality]], the [[rule of law]] and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to [[minority group|minorities]]&amp;nbsp;... in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title I: Common Provisions#Article 2|Article 2, Treaty on European Union (consolidated 1 December 2009)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Lisbon Treaty]] gave legal effect to the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]. The charter is a codified catalogue of [[fundamental right]]s against which the EU's legal acts can be judged. It consolidates many rights which were previously recognised by the Court of Justice and derived from the &quot;constitutional traditions common to the member states.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Case 11/70, Internationale Handelsgesellschaft v. Einfuhr und Vorratstelle für Getreide und Futtermittel; Article 6(2) of the Maastricht Treaty (as amended).&lt;/ref&gt; The Court of Justice has long recognised fundamental rights and has, on occasion, invalidated EU legislation based on its failure to adhere to those fundamental rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;europarl-rights&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/2_1_1_en.htm|title=Respect for fundamental rights in the EU – general development|publisher=The [[European Parliament]]|work=European Parliament Fact Sheets|accessdate=6 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Signing the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) is a condition for EU membership&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;&gt;and is effectively treated as one of the Copenhagen criteria.[http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta08/ERES1610.htm Assembly.coe.int.] This is a political and not a legal requirement for membership. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626175941/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FAdoptedText%2Fta08%2FERES1610.htm |date=26 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; previously, the EU itself could not accede to the Convention as it is neither a state&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;&gt;The European Convention on Human Rights was previously only open to members of the [[Council of Europe]] ([http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm Article 59.1 of the Convention]), and even now only states may become member of the Council of Europe ([http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/001.htm Article 4 of the Statute of the Council of Europe]).&lt;/ref&gt; nor had the competence to accede.&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;&gt;Opinion (2/92) of the European Court of Justice on &quot;Accession by the Community to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms&quot; [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61994V0002:FR:NOT 1996 E.C.R. I-1759] (in French), ruled that the European Community did not have the competence to accede to the ECHR.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lisbon Treaty and Protocol 14 to the ECHR have changed this: the former binds the EU to accede to the Convention while the latter formally permits it.

The EU is independent from the Council of Europe and they share purpose and ideas especially on rule of law, human rights and democracy. Further [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and [[European Social Charter]], the [[source of law]] of [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]] are created by Council of Europe. The EU also promoted human rights issues in the wider world. The EU opposes the death penalty and has proposed its worldwide abolition. Abolition of the death penalty is a condition for EU membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU Policy on Death Penalty|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/human_rights/adp/index_en.htm|work=Europa|publisher=European Union External Action Service|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acts===
{{see also|European Citizens' Initiative}}
The main legal acts of the EU come in three forms: [[Regulation (European Union)|regulations]], [[Directive (European Union)|directives]], and [[Decision (European Union)|decisions]]. Regulations become law in all member states the moment they come into force, without the requirement for any implementing measures,&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;&gt;See: Case 34/73, ''Variola v. Amministrazione delle Finanze'' [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61973J0034:EN:NOT &lt;nowiki&gt;[1973]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ECR 981].&lt;/ref&gt; and automatically override conflicting domestic provisions.&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot; name=&quot;art249&quot;/&gt; Directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result. The details of how they are to be implemented are left to member states.&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;&gt;To do otherwise would require the drafting of legislation which would have to cope with the frequently divergent legal systems and administrative systems of all of the now 28 member states. See Craig and de Búrca, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; When the time limit for implementing directives passes, they may, under certain conditions, have [[direct effect]] in national law against member states.

Decisions offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation. They are legal acts which only apply to specified individuals, companies or a particular member state. They are most often used in [[competition law]], or on rulings on State Aid, but are also frequently used for procedural or administrative matters within the institutions. Regulations, directives, and decisions are of equal legal value and apply without any formal hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|title=How EU takes decisions|accessdate=1 November 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102215021/http://europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|archivedate=2 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Ombudsman===
The [[European Ombudsman]] was established by the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. The [[ombudsman]] is elected by the [[European Parliament]] for the length of the Parliament's term, and the position is renewable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20191212IPR68912/emily-o-reilly-re-elected-european-ombudsman|title=Emily O'Reilly re-elected European Ombudsman &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; European Parliament|date=18 December 2019|website=www.europarl.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any EU citizen or entity may appeal to the ombudsman to investigate an EU institution on the grounds of maladministration (administrative irregularities, unfairness, discrimination, abuse of power, failure to reply, refusal of information or unnecessary delay).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/es/areas-of-work|title=European Ombudsman|website=www.ombudsman.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish [[Emily O'Reilly]] is the current ombudsman since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/es/emily-oreilly|title=European Ombudsman|website=www.ombudsman.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the creation of the EU in 1993, it has developed its competencies in the area of justice and home affairs; initially at an intergovernmental level and later by supranationalism. Accordingly, the Union has legislated in areas such as [[European Arrest Warrant|extradition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European arrest warrant replaces extradition between EU Member States|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/criminal/extradition/fsj_criminal_extradition_en.htm|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=4 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; family law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/judicial_cooperation_in_civil_matters/l33194_en.htm|title=Jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility (Brussels II)|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=5 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; asylum law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/free_movement_of_persons_asylum_immigration/l33150_en.htm|title=Minimum standards on the reception of applicants for asylum in Member States|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=5 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and criminal justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/judicial_cooperation_in_criminal_matters/l10110_en.htm|title=Specific Programme: 'Criminal Justice'|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=5 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prohibitions against sexual and nationality discrimination have a long standing in the treaties.&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot; name=&quot;art39/141 Rome&quot;&gt;See Articles 157 (ex Article 141) of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0013:0046:EN:PDF eur-lex.europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent years, these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race, religion, disability, age, and sexual orientation.&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot; name=&quot;art2(7) Amsterdam&quot;&gt;See Article 2(7) of the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/11997D/htm/11997D.html#0001010001 eur-lex.europa.eu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217024604/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/11997D/htm/11997D.html#0001010001 |date=17 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By virtue of these powers, the EU has enacted legislation on [[sexism|sexual discrimination]] in the work-place, [[ageism|age discrimination]], and [[racism|racial discrimination]].&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;&gt;Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (OJ L 180, 19 July 2000, pp. 22–26); Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation (OJ L 303, 2 December 2000, pp. 16–22).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Union has also established agencies to co-ordinate police, prosecutorial and immigrations controls across the member states: [[Europol]] for co-operation of police forces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European police office now in full swing |url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/police/europol/fsj_police_europol_en.htm|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=4 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eurojust]] for co-operation between prosecutors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurojust coordinating cross-border prosecutions at EU level|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/criminal/eurojust/fsj_criminal_eurojust_en.htm|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=4 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frontex]] for co-operation between border control authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Frontex?|url=http://www.frontex.europa.eu/|author=Frontex|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=4 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU also operates the [[Schengen Information System]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Internal borders&quot;/&gt; which provides a common database for police and immigration authorities. This co-operation had to particularly be developed with the advent of open borders through the [[Schengen Agreement]] and the associated cross border crime.

==Foreign relations==
{{Main|Foreign relations of the European Union|Common Foreign and Security Policy|European External Action Service}}
[[File:Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the G20 Summit in Hangzhou, China.jpg|thumb|The EU participates in all [[G8]] and [[G-20 major economies|G20]] summits. ([[2016 G20 Hangzhou summit|G20 summit in Hangzhou, China, 2016]]).]]
Foreign policy co-operation between member states dates from the establishment of the Community in 1957, when member states negotiated as a bloc in international trade negotiations under the [[EU's common commercial policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qualified-Majority Voting: Common commercial policy|url=http://ec.europa.eu/archives/igc2000/geninfo/fact-sheets/fact-sheet6/index_en.htm|accessdate=3 September 2007|publisher=Europa web portal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steps for a more wide-ranging co-ordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of [[European Political Cooperation]] which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies. In 1987 the European Political Cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the [[Single European Act]]. EPC was renamed as the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] (CFSP) by the [[Maastricht Treaty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EPC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708111806/http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/european_political_cooperation_en.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date= 8 July 2007 |url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/european_political_cooperation_en.htm |title=European political co-operation (EPC) |accessdate=3 September 2007 |publisher=Europa web portal |author=The European commission |work=Europa Glossary |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aims of the CFSP are to promote both the EU's own interests and those of the [[international community]] as a whole, including the furtherance of international co-operation, respect for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.&lt;ref name=&quot;art11 Union&quot;&gt;Article 21 of the [[Maastricht Treaty|Treaty on European Union]] (as inserted by the Treaty of Lisbon), on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0013:0046:EN:PDF eur-lex.europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; The CFSP requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue. The unanimity and difficult issues treated under the CFSP sometimes lead to disagreements, such as those which occurred over the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Iraq statement&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Divided EU agrees Iraq statement|work =BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=27 January 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2697667.stm|accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coordinator and representative of the CFSP within the EU is the [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]] who speaks on behalf of the EU in foreign policy and defence matters, and has the task of articulating the positions expressed by the member states on these fields of policy into a common alignment. The High Representative heads up the [[European External Action Service]] (EEAS), a unique EU department&lt;ref name=&quot;23Oct&quot;&gt;Rettman, Andrew (23 October 2009) [http://euobserver.com/9/28878 EU states envisage new foreign policy giant], EU Observer&lt;/ref&gt; that has been officially implemented and operational since 1 December 2010 on the occasion of the first anniversary of the entry into force of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European External Action Service gives Europe voice on world stage|url=http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/EN/Infoservice/Presse/Meldungen/2010/101201-EAD.html|publisher=German Foreign Ministry|accessdate=4 June 2013|date=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EEAS will serve as a foreign ministry and [[diplomatic corps]] for the European Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa EEAS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=European External Action Service|publisher=Europa web portal|year=2010|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/background/index_en.htm|accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the emerging international policy of the European Union, the international influence of the EU is also felt through [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]]. The perceived benefits of becoming a member of the EU act as an incentive for both political and economic reform in states wishing to fulfil the EU's accession criteria, and are considered an important factor contributing to the reform of European formerly Communist countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=John|date=August 2008|title=Enlargement, reform and the European Commission.

Following the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999, the [[European Council]] agreed that &quot;the Union must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and the readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO&quot;. To that end, a number of efforts were made to increase the EU's military capability, notably the [[Helsinki Headline Goal]] process. After much discussion, the most concrete result was the [[EU Battlegroup]]s initiative, each of which is planned to be able to deploy quickly about 1500&amp;nbsp;personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Council Capabilities&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=EU battlegroups |publisher=Europa web portal|author=Council of the European Union|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/090720-Factsheet-Battlegroups_EN.pdf|date=July 2009|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU uses foreign relations instruments like the [[European Neighbourhood Policy]] which seeks to tie those countries to the east and south of the European territory of the EU to the Union. These countries, primarily developing countries, include some who seek to one day become either a [[member state of the European Union]], or more closely integrated with the European Union. The EU offers financial assistance to countries within the European Neighbourhood, so long as they meet the strict conditions of government reform, economic reform and other issues surrounding positive transformation. This process is normally underpinned by an Action Plan, as agreed by both Brussels and the target country.

International recognition of sustainable development as a key element is growing steadily. Its role was recognized in three major UN summits on sustainable development: the 1992 [[Earth Summit|UN Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, [[Brazil]]; the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, [[South Africa]]; and the 2012 [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|UN Conference on Sustainable Development]] (UNCSD) in Rio de Janeiro. Other key global agreements are the [[Paris Agreement]] and the [[Sustainable Development Goals|2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]] (United Nations, 2015). The SDGs recognize that all countries must stimulate action in the following key areas - people, [[planet]], prosperity, [[peace]] and [[partnership]] - in order to tackle the global challenges that are crucial for the survival of [[human]]ity.

EU development action is based on the European Consensus on Development, which was endorsed on 20 December 2005 by EU Member States, the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/what/development-policies/european-consensus/index_en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=27 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811141039/http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/what/development-policies/european-consensus/index_en.htm |archivedate=11 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is applied from the principles of [[Capability approach]] and [[Rights-based approach to development]].

The [[European Union Association Agreement]] does something similar for a much larger range of countries, partly as a so-called soft approach ('a carrot instead of a stick') to influence the politics in those countries.
The European Union represents all its members at the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), and acts on behalf of member states in any disputes.

Two of the original core objectives of the European Economic Community were the development of a common market, subsequently becoming a [[single market]], and a [[European Union Customs Union|customs union]] between its member states. The single market involves [[Internal market|the free circulation of goods, capital, people, and services within the EU]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa Single Market&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Single Market |publisher=Europa web portal |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/index_en.htm |accessdate=27 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001122551/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/index_en.htm |archivedate= 1 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the customs union involves the application of a [[common external tariff]] on all goods entering the market. Once goods have been admitted into the market they cannot be subjected to customs duties, discriminatory taxes or [[import quota]]s, as they travel internally. The non-EU member states of [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Switzerland]] participate in the single market but not in the customs union.&lt;ref name=&quot;EEA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eeas.europa.eu/eea/ |title=The European Economic Area (EEA) |publisher=Europa web portal |author=European Commission |accessdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Half the trade in the EU is covered by legislation harmonised by the EU.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa Single Market G&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=A Single Market for goods |publisher=Europa web portal |author=European Commission |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_18_en.htm |accessdate=27 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621214532/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_18_en.htm |archivedate=21 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Free movement of capital is intended to permit movement of investments such as property purchases and buying of shares between countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa Single Market C&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=A Single Market for Capital |publisher=Europa web portal |author=European Commission |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_42_en.htm |accessdate=27 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518000627/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_42_en.htm |archivedate=18 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the drive towards [[economic and monetary union]] the development of the capital provisions had been slow. Post-Maastricht there has been a rapidly developing corpus of ECJ judgements regarding this initially neglected freedom. The free movement of capital is unique insofar as it is granted equally to non-member states.

The free movement of persons means that [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizens]] can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country. This required the lowering of administrative formalities and recognition of professional qualifications of other states.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa Single Market P&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Living and working in the Single Market |publisher=Europa web portal |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_15_en.htm |author=European Commission |accessdate=27 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613212310/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_15_en.htm |archivedate=13 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The free movement of services and of establishment allows self-employed persons to move between member states to provide services on a temporary or permanent basis. While services account for 60–70% of GDP, legislation in the area is not as developed as in other areas. This lacuna has been addressed by the recently passed [[Directive on services in the internal market]] which aims to liberalise the cross border provision of services.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa Single Market S&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=A Single Market for Services |publisher=Europa |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_19_en.htm |author=European Commission |accessdate=27 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610133514/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_19_en.htm |archivedate=10 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Treaty the provision of services is a residual freedom that only applies if no other freedom is being exercised.

The creation of a [[European Currency Unit|European single currency]] became an official objective of the European Economic Community in 1969. In 1992, having negotiated the structure and procedures of a currency union, the member states signed the [[Maastricht Treaty]] and were legally bound to fulfil the agreed-on rules including the [[Euro convergence criteria|convergence criteria]] if they wanted to join the [[Currency union|monetary union]]. The states wanting to participate had first to join the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]].

In 1999 the currency union started, first as an accounting currency with [[History of the euro|eleven member states]] joining. In 2002, the currency was fully put into place, when [[euro banknotes|euro notes]] and coins were issued and national currencies began to phase out in the eurozone, which by then consisted of 12 member states. The eurozone (constituted by the EU member states which have adopted the euro) has since grown to 19 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Almunia says 'undesirable' to act on Sweden's euro refusal |first1=Teresa |last1=Kuchler |publisher=EUobserver.com |date=25 October 2006 |url=http://euobserver.com/9/22733 |accessdate=26 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=ERM II |publisher=Danish Finance Ministry |date=20 March 2009 |url=http://uk.fm.dk/Portfolio/International%20cooperation/EU%20economic%20and%20political%20coordination/ERM2.aspx |accessdate=26 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503183816/http://uk.fm.dk/Portfolio/International%20cooperation/EU%20economic%20and%20political%20coordination/ERM2.aspx |archivedate=3 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The euro, and the monetary policies of those who have adopted it in agreement with the EU, are under the control of the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/escb/html/index.en.html|title=ECB, ESCB and the Eurosystem|publisher=European Central Bank|accessdate=15 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ECB is the central bank for the eurozone, and thus controls [[monetary policy]] in that area with an agenda to maintain [[price stability]]. It is at the centre of the [[European System of Central Banks]], which comprehends all EU national central banks and is controlled by its General Council, consisting of the [[President of the European Central Bank|President of the ECB]], who is appointed by the European Council, the Vice-President of the ECB, and the governors of the national central banks of all 27 EU member states.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECB org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=ECB, ESCB and the Eurosystem|publisher=European Central Bank|url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/escb/html/index.en.html|accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European System of Financial Supervision]] is an institutional architecture of the EU's framework of financial supervision composed by three authorities: the [[European Banking Authority]], the [[European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority]] and the [[European Securities and Markets Authority]]. To complement this framework, there is also a [[European Systemic Risk Board]] under the responsibility of the [[European Central Bank|ECB]]. The aim of this financial control system is to ensure the economic stability of the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/?aid=30866|title=Europe seals deal on financial supervision|work=euobserver.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To prevent the joining states from getting into financial trouble or crisis after entering the monetary union, they were obliged in the Maastricht treaty to fulfil important financial obligations and procedures, especially to show budgetary discipline and a high degree of sustainable economic convergence, as well as to avoid excessive government deficits and limit the government debt to a sustainable level.

 Nuclear energy and renewable energy are treated differently from oil, gas, and coal in this respect.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU has had legislative power in the area of energy policy for most of its existence; this has its roots in the original [[European Coal and Steel Community]]. The introduction of a mandatory and comprehensive European energy policy was approved at the meeting of the European Council in October 2005, and the first draft policy was published in January 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Energy Q&amp;A&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Q&amp;A: EU energy plans |publisher=BBC |date=9 March 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4783996.stm |accessdate=13 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU has five key points in its energy policy: increase competition in the [[internal market]], encourage investment and boost interconnections between electricity grids; diversify energy resources with better systems to respond to a crisis; establish a new treaty framework for energy co-operation with Russia while improving relations with energy-rich states in Central Asia&lt;ref name=&quot;oies&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Shamil Midkhatovich Yenikeyeff|url=http://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NG25-KazakhstansgasExportMarketsandExportRoutes-ShamilYenikeyeff-2008.pdf|title=Kazakhstan's Gas: Export Markets and Export Routes|publisher=[[Oxford Institute for Energy Studies]]|date=November 2008|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and North Africa; use existing energy supplies more efficiently while increasing [[renewable energy commercialisation]]; and finally increase funding for new energy technologies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Energy Q&amp;A&quot;/&gt;

In 2010 the estimated network covers: {{convert|75200|km}} of roads; {{convert|78000|km}} of railways; 330 airports; 270 maritime harbours; and 210 internal harbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The trans-European transport network: new guidelines and financial rules|publisher=[[European Commission]]|date=1 October 2003|url=http://ec.europa.eu/ten/transport/revision/doc/revision_1692_memo_en.pdf|accessdate=15 August 2007|work=Europa web portal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mirea |first=Silvia |title=The trans-European transport network: new guidelines and financial rules |publisher=The Railway Journal |url=http://www.cfr.ro/jf/engleza/0304/ten-t.htm |accessdate=15 August 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423082000/http://www.cfr.ro/JF/engleza/0304/ten-t.htm |archivedate=23 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rail transport in Europe]] is being synchronised with the [[European Rail Traffic Management System]] (ERTMS), an initiative to greatly enhance safety, increase efficiency of trains and enhance cross-border interoperability of rail transport in Europe by replacing signalling equipment with digitised mostly wireless versions and by creating a single Europe-wide standard for train control and command systems.

The developing European transport policies will increase the pressure on the environment in many regions by the increased transport network. In the pre-2004 EU members, the major problem in transport deals with congestion and pollution. After the recent enlargement, the new states that joined since 2004 added the problem of solving accessibility to the transport agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White Paper on Transport|publisher=Euractiv|date=22 September 2004|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/transport/white-paper-transport/article-129628|accessdate=15 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Highways in Poland|Polish road network]] was upgraded such as the [[A4 autostrada (Poland)|A4 autostrada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EUR 650 million for the Polish Road Network|url=http://www.eib.org/projects/press/2006/2006-113-poland-eur-650-million-for-the-polish-road-network.htm|access-date=25 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119160259/http://www.eib.org/projects/press/2006/2006-113-poland-eur-650-million-for-the-polish-road-network.htm|archive-date=19 January 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo positioning system]] is another EU infrastructure project. Galileo is a proposed [[Satellite navigation]] system, to be built by the EU and launched by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA). The Galileo project was launched partly to reduce the EU's dependency on the US-operated [[Global Positioning System]], but also to give more complete global coverage and allow for greater accuracy, given the aged nature of the GPS system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barrot&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Barrot|first=Jacques|title=Jacques Barrot Home Page, Commission vice president for transport|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/barrot/index_en.htm|accessdate=21 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RO BZ Pietroasele vineyard.jpg|thumb|left|Vineyards in [[Romania]]; EU farms are supported by the [[Common Agricultural Policy]], the largest [[Budget of the European Union|budgetary]] expenditure.]]

The [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (CAP) is one of the long lasting policies of the European Community.&lt;ref name=&quot;stead&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Stead|first=David|editor=Robert Whaples|title=Common Agricultural Policy|publisher=EH.Net Encyclopedia|date=22 June 2007|url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/common-agricultural-policy/|accessdate=30 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy has the objectives of increasing agricultural production, providing certainty in food supplies, ensuring a high quality of life for farmers, stabilising markets, and ensuring reasonable prices for consumers.&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;&gt;Article 39 (ex Article 33) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20131106072048/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ%3AC%3A2010%3A083%3A0047%3A0200%3AEN%3APDF eur-lex.europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; It was, until recently, operated by a system of subsidies and market intervention. Until the 1990s, the policy accounted for over 60% of the then [[European Economic Community|European Community]]'s annual budget, and {{As of|2013|lc=y}} accounts for around 34%.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU_CAP&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The policy's [[Incomes policy|price controls]] and market interventions led to considerable [[overproduction]]. These were [[Buffer stock scheme|intervention stores]] of products bought up by the Community to maintain minimum price levels. To dispose of surplus stores, they were often sold on the world market at prices considerably below Community guaranteed prices, or farmers were offered subsidies (amounting to the difference between the Community and world prices) to export their products outside the Community. This system has been criticised for under-cutting farmers outside Europe, especially those in the [[Third World|developing world]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian CAP&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Jeffery|first=Simon|title=The EU common agricultural policy|work=The Guardian |date=26 June 2003|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jun/26/eu.politics1|accessdate=30 August 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of CAP argue that the economic support which it gives to farmers provides them with a reasonable standard of living.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian CAP&quot;/&gt;

Since the beginning of the 1990s, the CAP has been subject to a series of reforms. Initially, these reforms included the introduction of [[set-aside]] in 1988, where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production, milk quotas and, more recently, the 'de-coupling' (or disassociation) of the money farmers receive from the EU and the amount they produce (by the Fischler reforms in 2004). Agriculture expenditure will move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce, toward direct payments based on farm size. This is intended to allow the market to dictate production levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;stead&quot;/&gt; One of these reforms entailed the modification of the EU's sugar regime, which previously divided the sugar market between member states and certain African-Caribbean nations with a privileged relationship with the EU.&lt;ref name=&quot;EC CAP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/04/915&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=1&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en|title=Sugar: Commission proposes more market-, consumer- and trade-friendly regime|date=14 April 2007|publisher=Europa|accessdate=30 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Commissioner for Competition|Competition Commissioner]], currently [[Margrethe Vestager]], is one of the most powerful positions in the Commission, notable for the ability to affect the commercial interests of trans-national corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lungescu|first=Oana|work=BBC News|title=Examining the EU executive|date=23 July 2004|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/letter_from_america/3921303.stm|accessdate=18 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2017}} For example, in 2001 the Commission for the first time prevented a merger between two companies based in the United States ([[General Electric|GE]] and [[Honeywell]]) which had already been approved by their national authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Europa web portal|title=The Commission prohibits GE's acquisition of Honeywell|date=3 July 2001|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/01/939|accessdate=12 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another high-profile case [[European Union Microsoft competition case|against Microsoft]], resulted in the Commission fining [[Microsoft]] over €777&amp;nbsp;million following nine years of legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gow|first=David|work=The Guardian |title=Microsoft caves in to European Commission|date=22 October 2007|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/oct/22/microsoft.microsoft|accessdate=12 November 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU has long sought to mitigate the effects of free markets by protecting workers rights and preventing social and environmental dumping. To this end it has adopted laws establishing minimum employment and environmental standards. These included the [[Working Time Directive]] and the [[Environmental Impact Assessment Directive 2011|Environmental Impact Assessment Directive]]. The EU has also sought to coordinate the social security and health systems of member states to facilitate individuals exercising free movement rights and to ensure they maintain their ability to access social security and health services in other member states.

The [[European Social Charter]] is the main body that recognizes the social rights of European citizens.

A [[European unemployment insurance]] has been proposed among others by the commissioner of Jobs [[Nicolas Schmit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eleconomista.es/economia/noticias/10114908/10/19/Asi-es-el-seguro-europeo-contra-el-paro-que-propone-el-futuro-comisario-de-Empleo-de-la-UE.html|title=Así es el seguro europeo contra el paro que propone el futuro comisario de Empleo de la UE - elEconomista.es|website=www.eleconomista.es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2019 there is a European Commissioner for Equality; a [[European Institute for Gender Equality]] has existed since 2007.

Housing, youth, childhood, Functional diversity or elderly care are supportive competencies of the European Union and can be financed by the European Social Fund.

In 1957, when the EEC was founded, it had no environmental policy.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, A.J. and Adelle, C. (eds)(2012) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, Virginia&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past 50 years, an increasingly dense network of legislation has been created, extending to all areas of environmental protection, including air pollution, water quality, waste management, nature conservation, and the control of chemicals, industrial hazards, and biotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;Knill, C. and Liefferink, D.(2012) The establishment of EU environmental policy, In: Jordan, A.J. and Adelle, C. (eds) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, Virginia&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Institute for European Environmental Policy]], environmental law comprises over 500 Directives, Regulations and Decisions, making environmental policy a core area of European politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;European Environmental Policy 2012&quot;&gt;Institute for European Environmental Policy (2012) Manual of European Environmental Policy, Earthscan, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

European policy-makers originally increased the EU's capacity to act on environmental issues by defining it as a trade problem.&lt;ref&gt;Knill, C. and Liefferink, D.(2012) The establishment of EU environmental policy, In: Jordan, A.J. and Adelle, C. (eds) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Trade barrier]]s and competitive distortions in the Common Market could emerge due to the different environmental standards in each member state.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, S.P. and Corcelle, G. (1989) The Environmental Policy of the European Communities, Graham &amp; Trotman, London&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years, the environment became a formal policy area, with its own policy actors, principles and procedures. The legal basis for EU environmental policy was established with the introduction of the Single European Act in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;European Environmental Policy 2012&quot;/&gt;

[[File:European Union biogeography countries.svg|thumb|right|200px|[[Biogeography|Biogeographic regions]] of the continental European Union, according to the [[European Environment Agency|European Environmental Agency]]]]
Initially, EU environmental policy focused on Europe. More recently, the EU has demonstrated leadership in global environmental governance, e.g. the role of the EU in securing the ratification and coming into force of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] despite opposition from the [[United States]]. This international dimension is reflected in the EU's Sixth Environmental Action Programme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:l28027|title=EUR-Lex – l28027 – EN – EUR-Lex|publisher=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; which recognises that its objectives can only be achieved if key international agreements are actively supported and properly implemented both at EU level and worldwide. The Lisbon Treaty further strengthened the leadership ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;Benson, D. and Adelle, C. (2012) European Union environmental policy after the Lisbon Treaty, In: Jordan, A.J. and Adelle, C. (eds) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA.&lt;/ref&gt; EU law has played a significant role in improving habitat and species protection in Europe, as well as contributing to improvements in air and water quality and waste management.&lt;ref name=&quot;European Environmental Policy 2012&quot;/&gt;

Mitigating [[climate change]] is one of the top priorities of EU environmental policy. In 2007, member states agreed that, in the future, 20% of the energy used across the EU must be [[renewable energy|renewable]], and carbon dioxide emissions have to be lower in 2020 by at least 20% compared to 1990 levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;EUO energy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jan/23/climatechange.eu1|title=EU sets 20% target for carbon cuts|accessdate=29 February 2008|work=The Guardian |first=Jessica|last=Aldred|location=London|date=23 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU has adopted an [[Emissions trading|emissions trading system]] to incorporate [[carbon emissions]] into the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets_en|title=EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)|date=23 November 2016|website=Climate Action - European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Green Capital]] is an annual award given to cities that focuses on the environment, energy efficiency, and quality of life in urban areas to create [[smart city]].

In the [[Elections to the European Parliament]] in 2019, the green parties increased their power, possibly because of the rise of post materialist values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Berman |first1=Sheri | authorlink=Sheri Berman |title=Populists, greens and the new map of European politics |url=https://www.socialeurope.eu/populists-greens-new-political-map |website=Social Europe |accessdate=21 June 2019|date=3 June 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals to reach a zero carbon economy in the European Union by 2050 were suggested in 2018 - 2019. Almost all member states supported that goal at an EU summit in June 2019. The [[Czech Republic]], [[Estonia]], [[Hungary]], and [[Poland]] disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.euronews.com/2019/06/21/eu-summit-deadlock-over-top-jobs-and-climate-discord |title = EU summit deadlock over top jobs and climate discord|date = 21 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic education is an area where the EU's role is limited to supporting national governments. In higher education, the policy was developed in the 1980s in programmes supporting exchanges and mobility. The most visible of these has been the [[Erasmus Programme]], a university exchange programme which began in 1987. In its first 20&amp;nbsp;years, it supported international exchange opportunities for well over 1.5&amp;nbsp;million university and college students and became a symbol of European student life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/news/erasmus20_en.html|title=The Erasmus programme celebrates its 20th anniversary|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|accessdate=21 July 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703000422/http://ec.europa.eu/education/news/erasmus20_en.html|archivedate=3 July 2007}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.cafebabel.co.uk/article/19702/erasmus-turns-20-time-to-grow-up.html|title=Erasmus turns 20 – time to grow up?|last=Jean-Sébastien|first=Lefebvre|date=22 January 2007|publisher=Café Babel|accessdate=10 August 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912002728/http://www.cafebabel.co.uk/article/19702/erasmus-turns-20-time-to-grow-up.html|archive-date=12 September 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are similar programmes for school pupils and teachers, for trainees in [[vocational education|vocational education and training]], and for adult learners in the [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]]. These programmes are designed to encourage a wider knowledge of other countries and to spread good practices in the education and training fields across the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=EACEA|title=About the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/index.htm|accessdate=21 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lifelong Learning Programme|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/llp/national_en.html|accessdate=21 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through its support of the [[Bologna Process]], the EU is supporting comparable standards and compatible degrees across Europe.

Scientific development is facilitated through the EU's [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|Framework Programmes]], the first of which started in 1984. The aims of EU policy in this area are to co-ordinate and stimulate research.

Sport is mainly the responsibility of the member states or other international organisations, rather than of the EU.

The European Union has had a significant positive economic impact on member states.

LXVI, no. 13 (15 August 2019), pp.&amp;nbsp;46–48.  James McAuley writes:  &quot;There was never a single moment that marked the definitive establishment of the European Union, which... has continued to define itself since [[World War II]].  [T]he major turning points have all been quiet steps on the way to further [[economic integration]] while preserving [[national sovereignty]].  Today there is only an incomplete [[monetary union]] without a real political contract to manage it...  [Nevertheless, the Union's] various peoples have grown remarkably closer...  The European Union now has open borders, a single market from Portugal to the Baltics, and more or less monthly meetings of member state leaders [the [[European Council]]].  What's more, those member states are now closer to each other than they are to the [[United States]]...  [T]his transformation has occurred informally and organically...  [R]obust supranational politics are taking root in Europe... [[Luuk van Middelaar]] writes:  '[W]hat unites us as Europeans on this continent is bigger and stronger than anything that divides us.'&quot;  (pp.&amp;nbsp;47–48.)

In reality, most large [[war]]s have contained within them a violent and persistent economic conflict.
