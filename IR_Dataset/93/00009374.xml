{{Politics of Equatorial Guinea}}
The '''Armed Forces of Equatorial Guinea''' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Fuerzas Armadas de Guinea Ecuatorial'') consists of approximately 2,500 service members. The army has almost 1,400 soldiers, the police 400 paramilitary men, the navy 200 service members, and the air force about 120 members. There is also a [[gendarmerie]], but the number of members is unknown. The Gendarmerie is a new branch of the service in which training and education is being supported by the French Military Cooperation in Equatorial Guinea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Equatorial Guinea&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last = |first = |url= http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=30337:equatorial-guinea&amp;catid=119:african-militaries|title = Equatorial Guinea |work= |publisher= Flightglobal Insight |year=  |doi = |accessdate= 20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military appointments are all reviewed by President [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo|Teodoro Obiang]], and few of the native militiamen come from outside of Obiang's [[Mongomo]]-based Esangui clan. Obiang was a general when he overthrew his uncle, [[Francisco Macías Nguema]].

Overall the military is poorly trained and equipped. It has mostly small arms, [[rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]]s, and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]]. Almost none of its [[Soviet armed forces|Soviet]]-style light-armored vehicles or trucks are operational.

The Armed Forces were reorganized in 1979. In 1988, the [[United States]] donated a 68-foot patrol boat to the [[Navy of Equatorial Guinea|Equatoguinean navy]] to patrol its exclusive economic zone. The U.S. patrol boat ''Isla de Bioko'' is no longer operational.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State, [https://2009-2017.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/equatorialguinea/26446.htm Equatorial Guinea Background Note 01/02]&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. military-to-military engagement has been dormant since 1997 (the year of the last [[Joint Combined Exchange Training]] exercise). Between 1984 and 1992, service members went regularly to the United States on the International Military Education Training program, after which funding for this program for [[Equatorial Guinea]] ceased. The government spent 6.5% of its annual budget on defense in 2000 and 4.5% of its budget on defense in 2001. It recently acquired some Chinese artillery pieces, some Ukrainian patrol boats, and some Ukrainian helicopter gunships. The number of paved airports in Equatorial Guinea can be counted on one hand, and as such the number of airplanes operated by the air force is small. The Equatoguineans rely on foreigners to operate and maintain this equipment as they are not sufficiently trained to do so. Cooper and Weinert 2010 says that all aircraft are based on the military side of [[Malabo International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooper and Weinert 2010, p142&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, a report said &quot;The oil companies do not view Equatorial Guinea's military – a product of decades of brutal dictatorial rule – with much confidence. The army is believed to have only about 1,320 men under arms, the navy 120, and the air force 100. Seven of the army's nine generals are relatives of the president; the other two are from his tribe. There is no clear command structure, the level of discipline is low, and professionalism and training are almost non-existent, according to locals and foreign oil workers. Even the presidential guard – an indication of the lack of trust in the country's forces – is composed of 350 Moroccan troops.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sunday Dare]], [http://projects.publicintegrity.org/bow/report.aspx?aid=151 The Curious Bonds of Oil Diplomacy], Center for Public Integrity, 6 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt; One general may be General Agustin Ndong Ona, reported in 2004.{{speculation-inline}}

In July 2010, after the visit of [[Brazil]]ian president, [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], the sale of a [[Brazilian corvette Barroso (V34)|Barroso-class]] [[corvette]] to be constructed in Brazil was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alide.com.br/joomla/index.php/capa/75-extra/1419-lula-anuncia-venda-de-navio-da-classe-barroso-para-guine-equatorial|title=Lula anuncia venda de navio da classe Barroso para Guiné Equatorial|author=Felipe Salles|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 November 2016 the Zimbabwe Defence Forces deployed a training contingent to the Equatorial Guinea to train the country's military officers on operational and logistic matters following an urgent request by the West African country.  The security personnel contingent, is composed of members of the Zimbabwe National Army and Air Force of Zimbabwe.{{fact|date=August 2019}}

{{Main|Navy of Equatorial Guinea}}
As piracy and robbery at sea is a significant threat in the Gulf of Guinea, the country is investing heavily in its navy to protect its oil installations from these and other security challenges. In 2010 a Brazilian corvette was purchased, and renamed the 'Bata'. On 24 June 2014 the frigate Wele Nzas was commissioned and became the navy's flagship.
