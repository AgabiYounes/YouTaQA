'''Transport in Eritrea''' includes [[highway]]s, [[airport]]s and [[seaport]]s, in addition to various forms of public and private vehicular, maritime and aerial transportation.

== Railways ==
{{main|Eritrean Railway}}
[[File:Ansaldo 442 steam locomotive in Eritrea.JPG|thumb|240px|This steam locomotive dating from the 1930s still operates, carrying both freight and tourists.]]As of 1999, there was a total of 317 kilometres of {{RailGauge|950mm}} ([[narrow gauge]]) rail line in Eritrea. The railway links [[Agordat]] and [[Asmara]] with the port of [[Massawa]]; however, it was nonoperational since 1978 except for about a 5 kilometre stretch that was reopened in Massawa in 1994. Rehabilitation of the remainder and of the rolling stock has occurred in recent years. By 2003, the line had been restored from Massawa all the way through to Asmara.

There are no rail links with adjacent countries.

== Highways ==
[[File:Rly line Massawa-Asmara 04.JPG|thumb|right|The Railway line Massawa-Asmara between [[Ghinda]] and [[Embatkalla]].]]
The Eritrean highway system is named according to the road classification. The three levels of classification are: primary (P), secondary (S), and tertiary (T). The lowest level road is tertiary and serves local interests. Typically they are improved earth roads which are occasionally paved. During the wet seasons these roads typically become impassable. The next higher level road is a secondary road and typically is a single-layered asphalt road that connects [[Districts of Eritrea|district]] capitals together and those to the regional capitals. Roads that are considered primary roads are those that are fully asphalted (throughout their entire length) and in general they carry traffic between all the major towns in Eritrea.
