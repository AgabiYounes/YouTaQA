{{Politics of Ecuador}}
The '''politics of Ecuador''' are [[multi-party system|multi-party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nimd.org/programmes/ecuador/|title=Ecuador|website=NIMD|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central government polity is a four-yearly [[republic|elected]] [[presidential system|presidential]], unicameral [[representative democracy]]. The [[President of Ecuador]] is [[head of state]] and [[head of the army]] on a [[multi-party system]], and leads a [[Cabinet of Ecuador|cabinet]] with further [[executive power]]. [[Legislative power]] is not limited to the [[National Assembly (Ecuador)|National Assembly]], as it may to a lesser degree be exercised by the executive which consists of the President convening an appointed executive cabinet. Subsequent acts of the National Assembly are supreme over Executive Orders where sufficient votes have been cast by the legislators. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. Ecuador is also considered a constitutional republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/160163.pdf|title=ECUADOR|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. Department of State|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417141453/http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/160163.pdf|archive-date=2011-04-17|url-status=dead|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of Ecuador]] provides for a four-year term of office for the President, Vice-President, and members of the National Assembly with concurrent elections. Presidents and legislators may be re-elected immediately. Citizens must be at least 16 years of age to vote: [[suffrage]] is universal and compulsory for literate persons aged 18 to 65 and optional for 16 and 17 years of age and other eligible voters.

==Political conditions==
Ecuador's [[political party|political parties]] have historically been small, loose organizations that depended more on populist, often charismatic, leaders to retain support than on programs or ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pugh|first=Jeff|date=2008|title=Vectors of Contestation: Social Movements and Party Systems in Ecuador and Colombia|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270512275_Vectors_of_Contestation_Social_Movements_and_Party_Systems_in_Ecuador_and_Colombia|journal=Latin American Essays|volume=21|pages=46–65|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequent internal splits have produced extreme factionalism. However, a pattern has emerged in which administrations from the center-left alternate with those from the center-right. Although Ecuador's political [[elite]] is highly factionalized along regional, ideological, and personal lines, a strong desire for consensus on major issues often leads to compromise. Opposition forces in Congress are loosely organized, but historically they often unite to block the administration's initiatives and to remove cabinet ministers.

Constitutional changes enacted by a specially elected National Constitutional Assembly in 1998 took effect on 10 August 1998. The new constitution strengthens the executive branch by eliminating mid-term congressional elections and by circumscribing Congress' power to challenge cabinet ministers. Party discipline is traditionally weak, and routinely many deputies switch allegiance during each Congress. However, after the new Constitution took effect, the Congress passed a Code of Ethics which imposes penalties on members who defy their party leadership on key votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/16/world/americas/16ecuador.html|title=Ecuador Appears Likely to Rewrite Constitution|last=Romero|first=Simon|date=2007-04-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-26|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the 1996 election, the more indigenous, less Spanish-rooted, ethnic groups abandoned their traditional policy of shunning the official political system and participated actively. The indigenous population has established itself as a significant force in Ecuadorian politics, as shown by the selection of indigenous representative [[Nina Pacari]], who led the indigenous political party, Pachakutik, as Second Vice-President of the 1998 Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/specials/cambio_de_mando_en_ecuador/newsid_2616000/2616341.stm|title=Pacari, primera indigena ministra en Ecuador|last=|first=|date=2002-12-31|work=BBC World|access-date=2019-04-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial branch==
=== The former Supreme Court of Ecuador ===
New justices of the Supreme Court of Ecuador were elected by the sitting members of the court. A bare majority of Congress, acting in a special session called by former President [[Lucio Gutiérrez]] in December 2004, ousted 27 of the 31 justices and replaced them with new members chosen by Congress; notwithstanding, the lack of any provisions permitting impeachment of Supreme Court justices by Congress and the specific provisions giving the Court the power to select new members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/18/world/americas/firings-on-ecuadors-top-court-stir-oppositions-wrath.html|title=Firings on Ecuador's Top Court Stir Opposition's Wrath|last=Forero|first=Juan|date=2004-12-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-26|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, in November 2004, Congress replaced the majority of judges on the country's Electoral Court and Constitutional Court by a similar process.

=== Reorganization of Court (2008) ===
After the adoption of a new Constitution in 2008, the judicial branch of the country was completely renewed to provide a cooperative leadership by having a judicial and an administrative head. As such, the bodies of Ecuador's judicial branch now consisted of the National Court of Justice, provincial courts (created by the National Court), tribunals and judges, National Council of the Judicature, Public Defendants' Office, and State Attorneys' Office. The 2008 Constitution also led to the creation of the Constitutional Court of Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://caj.fiu.edu/national-cj-systems/south-america/ecuador/index.html.gz|title=Ecuador|last=|first=|date=|website=FIU Center for the Administration of Justice|access-date=2019-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4083847.stm|title=Supreme Court in Ecuador replaced|last=|first=|date=2004-12-10|work=BBC World|access-date=2019-04-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== National Court of Justice ====
The National Court of Justice seats 21 judges elected for a period of 9 years. They are elected by the Judiciary Council based on a merits contest held by that office. They are the final stage of any judicial process serving as a Court of Cassation and create binding precedent based on Triple Reiterative Rulings from the Chambers of the Court. The President of the Court is elected among the members of the Court for a Period of three years where s/he will represent the Judicial Branch before the State.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cortenacional.gob.ec/cnj/index.php/pages/196%20-18-estructura-organica|title=La Corte|website=www.cortenacional.gob.ec|language=es-es|access-date=2019-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Judiciary Council ====
The administrative branch of the judicial power consists of the Judiciary Council. The Council is formed by 9 Vocals who are elected by the Branch of Transparency and Social Control, which is formed by the Control Authorities of the State. The Vocals are elected also by a merits contest and it shall be formed by six experts in law and 3 experts in management, economics and other related areas. However, after the National Referendum that took place on 5 May 2011 led to the passing of a proposition impulsed by the government, the Judiciary Council changed its formation by making a constitutional amendment. Currently, a Tri-Party Commission is serving as a Transitional Council with delegates from the Legislative, Executive and Transparency Branch, in order to reform the broken judicial system of the country.

=== Constitutional Court of Ecuador ===
The Constitutional Court of Ecuador does not exercise legal revision, but rather constitutional control of situations where constitutional rights are violated. Also they are the sole body in the State to interpret what the Constitution says.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dplf.org/sites/default/files/1260463478.pdf|title=Cambios en la justicia ecuatoriana|last=|first=|date=3 November 2009|website=Revista de la Fundación para el Debido Proceso Legal (DPLF)|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
