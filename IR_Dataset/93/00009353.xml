'''[[Transport]] in [[Egypt]]''' is centered in [[Cairo]] and largely follows the pattern of settlement along the [[Nile]]. The [[Ministry of Transportation (Egypt)|Ministry of Transportation]] and other government bodies are responsible for transportation in Egypt, whether by sea, land or air.

With regards to rail, air and waterway travel, the main line of the nation's rail system follows along the Nile river and is operated by [[Egyptian National Railways]]. In addition to overseas routes, [[Egypt Air]] provides domestic air service to major tourist destinations from its Cairo hub. The Nile River system (about 1,600&amp;nbsp;km or 1,000&amp;nbsp;mi) and the principal canals (1,600&amp;nbsp;km.) are important locally for transportation. People still travel via the Nile, mainly between Cairo and Aswan. The [[Suez Canal]] is a major waterway for international commerce and navigation, linking the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Red Sea]]. Major ports are [[Alexandria]], [[Port Said]], [[Damietta]] on the Mediterranean and [[Suez]] and [[Safaga]] on the Red Sea.

With regards to driving, Egypt has one of the highest incidents of road fatalities, per miles driven, in the world.&lt;ref name=travel&gt;[https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1108.html &quot;Egypt&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022140939/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1108.html |date=2013-10-22 }}. [[Travel.state.gov]] (March 19, 2008). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; The badly maintained road network has expanded rapidly to over 21,000 miles, covering the [[Nile Valley]] and [[Nile Delta]], [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Red Sea]] coasts, the [[sinai peninsula|Sinai]] and the Western oasis. Traffic rules are routinely ignored by impatient drivers.&lt;ref name=travel/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Accident_2015&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Two Ukrainian tourists killed in Hurghada bus crash |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/130009/Egypt/Politics-/UPDATED-Two-Ukrainian-tourists-killed-in-Hurghada-.aspx |accessdate=20 September 2018 |work=English Ahram |date=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Road system==
[[File:Qesm Marsa Alam, Red Sea Governorate, Egypt - panoramio (6).jpg|thumb|280px|Road in [[Marsa Alam]].]]
Two routes in the [[Trans-African Highway network]] originate in [[Cairo]]. Egypt also has multiple highway links with [[Asia]] through the [[Arab Mashreq International Road Network]].
Egypt has a developing [[motorway]] network, connecting Cairo with Alexandria and other cities. Though most of the transport in the country is still done on the national highways, motorways are becoming increasingly an option in road transport within the country. The existing motorways in the country are:

*Cairo - Alexandria Desert Road: It runs between [[Cairo]] and [[Alexandria]], with an extension of 215&amp;nbsp;km, it is the main motorway in Egypt.
*International Coastal Road: It runs from [[Alexandria]] to [[Port Said]], along the Northern Nile Delta. It has a length of 280&amp;nbsp;km. Also, amongst other cities, it connects [[Damietta]] and [[Baltim]].
*Geish Road: It runs between [[Helwan]] and [[Asyut]], along the Nile River, also connecting [[Beni Suef]] and [[Minya, Egypt|Minya]]. Its length is 306&amp;nbsp;km.
*Ring Road: It serves as an inner ring-road for [[Cairo]]. It has a length of 103&amp;nbsp;km.
*Regional Ring Road: It serves as an outer ring road for [[Cairo]], also connecting its suburbs like [[Helwan]] and [[10th of Ramadan City]]. Its length is 130&amp;nbsp;km.

Plus, Egypt has developed an extensive system of 4-lane highways that can be classified as [[Controlled-access highway|freeways]], because they serve as normal roads and do not discriminate the traffic on it, thus rendering them slower than motorways.

== Railways ==
{{Main|Egyptian National Railways}}
[[File:Railways in Egypt.svg|thumb|Egypt railway network&lt;br/&gt;{{nowrap|([[ShareMap:jkan/railway/Railways in Egypt|interactive version]])}}&lt;br/&gt;{{RailGauge|1435mm|allk=on|al=on}}]]
The Egyptian railway system is the oldest railway network in [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]. The first line between Alexandria and Kafer Eassa was opened in 1854. In 2018, the system is about 5,085&amp;nbsp;km long&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA World Factbook&quot; /&gt; and is operated by the [[Egyptian National Railways]]. ENR carries about 800 million passengers and 12 million tonnes of freight annually.

A major investment programme was planned to begin in 2007 with the aim of modernizing the rail network and improving safety standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.railwaygazette.com/features_view/article/2007/08/7643/egyptian_investment_will_raise_safety_standards.html Egyptian investment will raise safety standards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023213414/http://www.railwaygazette.com/features_view/article/2007/08/7643/egyptian_investment_will_raise_safety_standards.html |date=2007-10-23 }}. ''[[Railway Gazette International]]'' August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Trains are usually a safe means of transportation in Egypt.&lt;ref name=travel/&gt;

The city of Cairo is served by the [[Cairo Metro]], which is run by the National Authority for Tunnels.
In addition to the city of [[Alexandria]] that is served by the [[Alexandria Tram]]

There are 3,500&amp;nbsp;km of waterways in Egypt, including the [[Nile]], [[Lake Nasser]], Alexandria-Cairo Waterway, and many smaller canals in the [[Nile Delta]].

The [[Suez Canal]], 193.5&amp;nbsp;km (including approaches), is used by oceangoing vessels, drawing up to 17.68 m of water (2011).&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA World Factbook&quot; /&gt;
