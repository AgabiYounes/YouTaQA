The '''economy of Estonia''' is an [[advanced economy]] and the country is a member of the [[European Union]] and of the [[eurozone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World Economic and Financial Surveys / World Economic Outlook |work=Database—WEO Groups and Aggregates Information |publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]] |date=April 2011 |url= http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2011/01/weodata/groups.htm#ae |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estonia]]'s economy is heavily influenced by developments in the Finnish and Swedish economies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.seb.ee/foorum/majanduskeskkond/kuidas-laheb-soome-majandusel]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Before the [[Second World War]], Estonia's economy was based on agriculture, but there was a significant knowledge sector, with the university city of [[Tartu]] known for scientific contributions, and a growing industrial sector, similar to that of neighbouring [[Finland]]. Products, such as butter, milk, and cheese were widely known in the [[west Europe]]an markets. The main markets were Germany and the United Kingdom, and only 3% of all commerce was with the neighbouring [[USSR]]. Estonia and [[Finland]] had a relatively similar standard of living.&lt;ref name=&quot;maddison185&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Maddison|2006|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USSR's [[Estonian SSR|annexation of Estonia]] in 1940 and the ensuing [[Nazism|Nazi]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] destruction during World War II crippled the Estonian economy. The subsequent Soviet occupation and post-war [[Sovietization]] of life continued with the integration of Estonia's economy and industry into the [[USSR]]'s centrally planned structure. Estonia's GDP per capita was just $100 in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;ÄP&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Eesti majandus oli võrdsel tasemel Paapua Uus-Guineaga |language=Estonian |trans-title=Estonia's economy was on the same level with Papua New Guinea |publisher=Äripäev |date=2007-01-30 |url= https://www.aripaev.ee/uudised/2007/01/29/eesti-majandus-oli-vordsel-tasemel-paapua-uus-guineaga |accessdate=2019-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Estonia]] moved away from communism in the late 1980s, restored its independence in 1991 and became a market economy, it emerged as a pioneer in the global economy. In 1992, the country adopted the [[Estonian kroon]] as its own currency, and this greatly stabilised the economy. In 1994, it became one of the first countries in the world to adopt a [[flat tax]], with a uniform rate of 26% regardless of personal income. Estonia received more foreign investment per capita in the second half of the 1990s than any other country in Central and Eastern Europe. Between 2005 and 2008, the personal income tax rate was reduced from 26% to 21% in several steps.&lt;ref name=&quot;heritage&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Laar |first=Mart |authorlink=Mart Laar |title=The Estonian Economic Miracle |publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]] |date=7 August 2007 |url= http://www.heritage.org/Research/WorldwideFreedom/bg2060.cfm |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country has been quickly catching up with the [[EU-15]]; its GDP per capita having grown from 34.8% of the EU-15 average in 1996 to 65% in 2007, similar to that of Central European countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;heritage&quot; /&gt; It is already rated a high-income country by the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]]. The [[Purchasing power parity|GDP (PPP) per capita]] of the country, a good indicator of wealth, was $35,974 in 2018 according to the World Bank, between that of [[Lithuania]] and [[Cyprus]], but below that of most long-time EU members such as [[Spain]] or [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GDP per capita, PPP (current international $) |publisher=[[World Bank]] |url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD |accessdate=6 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its economic performance after the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet breakup]], Estonia has been termed one of the [[Baltic Tiger]]s.

In 2008, Estonia was ranked 12th of 162 countries in the [[Index of Economic Freedom]] 2008, the best of any former Soviet republic. The same year, the country was at the bottom of the list of European states by labour market freedom, but the government is drafting improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Koovit |first=Kaja |title=Estonia on bottom of Europe by labour market freedom |date=20 May 2008 |agency=Baltic Business News |url= http://www.bbn.ee/?PublicationId=60cb40ba-e355-4d36-88ee-1ba221201681 |accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Estonia, the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]] was comparatively easier to weather, because Estonia's budget has consistently been kept balanced, and this meant that Estonia's public debt relative to the country's GDP has remained the lowest in Europe. The economy recovered in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kattel_and_Raudla&quot; /&gt;

On 1 January 2011, Estonia joined the euro,&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters-2011-01-01&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Mardiste |first=David |title=Estonia joins crisis-hit euro club |date=1 January 2011 |work=[[Reuters]] |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6BU0S720110101 |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became the first ex-Soviet republic to join the [[eurozone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HS&quot; /&gt;

In 2013, the [[World Bank Group]] rated Estonia as 21st on the [[Ease of Doing Business Index]].

==History==
===Early history===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
Until the early 13th century, the territory that is now known as Estonia was independent. The economy was largely an agricultural one, but Estonia being a country with a long coastline, there were also many maritime activities. Autonomous development was brought to an end by the [[Northern Crusades]] undertaken by the King of Denmark, the German Livonian and the Teutonic military orders. The Estonian world was transformed by military conquest. The war against the invaders lasted from 1208–1227. The last Estonian county to fall was the island of Saaremaa in 1261.

Thereafter, through many centuries until [[World War I|WWI]], Estonian agriculture consisted of native peasants working large feudal-type estates held by ethnic [[Baltic Germans|German]] [[landlord]]s. In the decades prior to independence, centralised [[Czar]]ist rule had created a rather large industrial sector dominated by the [[Kreenholm Manufacturing Company]], then the world's largest [[cotton mill]].

===Independence===
After declaring independence in 1918, the [[Estonian War of Independence]] and the subsequent signing of the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)|Treaty of Tartu]] in 1920, the new Estonian state inherited a ruined post-war economy and an inflated ruble currency. Despite considerable hardship, dislocation, and unemployment, Estonia spent the first decade of independence entirely transforming its economy. In 1918, The Czarist ruble was replaced by the [[Estonian mark]], which was in circulation until 1927. By 1929, a stable currency, the [[Estonian kroon|kroon]], had been established. It was issued by the [[Bank of Estonia]], the country's [[central bank]]. Compensating the German landowners for their holdings, the government confiscated the estates and divided them into small farms, which subsequently formed the basis of Estonian prosperity. Trade focused on the local market and the West, particularly Germany and the United Kingdom. Only 3% of all commerce was with the [[USSR]].

===Soviet occupation===
The USSR's forcible annexation of Estonia in 1940 and the ensuing [[Nazism|Nazi]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] destruction during [[World War II]] crippled the Estonian economy. Post-war Soviet occupation and Sovietisation of life continued with the integration of Estonia's economy and industry into the USSR's centrally planned structure. More than 56% of Estonian farms were [[collective|collectivised]] in the month of April 1949 alone after mass deportations to Siberia the previous month. Moscow expanded on those Estonian industries which had locally available raw materials, such as [[oil shale]] mining and phosphorites.

===Restoration of independence, modernisation and liberalisation===
{{Update section|date=January 2019}}[[File:Tln1.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Maakri]] has become the [[Central business district]] of Tallinn in the 21st century]]
Since reestablishing independence, Estonia has styled itself as the gateway between East and West and pursued economic reform and integration with the West.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Estonia's market reforms put it among the economic leaders in the former [[COMECON]] area.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} A balanced budget, almost non-existent [[public debt]], flat-rate [[income tax]], [[free trade]] regime, fully convertible currency backed by [[currency board]] and a strong peg to the [[euro]], competitive commercial banking sector, hospitable environment for foreign investment, innovative [[e-Services]] and mobile-based services are all hallmarks of Estonia's free-market-based economy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In June 1992, Estonia replaced the [[Russian ruble|ruble]] with its own freely convertible currency, the [[Estonian kroon|kroon]] (EEK). A [[currency board]] was created and the new currency was pegged to the German Mark at the rate of 8 Estonian kroons for 1 [[Deutsche Mark]]. When Germany introduced the [[euro]] the peg was changed to 15.6466 kroons for 1 euro.

Estonia was set to adopt the euro in 2008, but due to the inflation rate being above the required 3%, the adoption date was delayed to 2011. On 1 January 2011, Estonia adopted the euro and became the 17th [[eurozone]] member state.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters-2011-01-01&quot; /&gt;

The [[privatisation]] of state-owned firms is virtually complete, with only the port and the main power plants remaining in government hands.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}

The constitution requires a balanced budget, and the protection afforded by Estonia's intellectual property laws is on a par of that of Europe's.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In early 1992, both liquidity problems and structural weakness stemming from the communist era precipitated a banking crisis. As a result, effective bankruptcy legislation was enacted and privately owned; well-managed banks emerged as market leaders.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Today, near-ideal conditions for the banking sector exist. Foreigners are not restricted from buying bank shares or acquiring majority holdings.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}

The fully electronic [[Tallinn Stock Exchange]] opened in early 1996, and was purchased by Finland's [[Helsinki Stock Exchange]] in 2001.

Estonia joined the World Trade Organization in 1999.

From the early 2000s to the latter part of that decade, the Estonian economy experienced considerable growth. In the year 2000, Estonian GDP grew by 6.4%.

Upon accession to the [[European Union]] in 2004, double-digit growth was soon after observed.

GDP grew by 7.9% in 2007 alone. Increases in labor costs, the imposition of tax on tobacco, alcohol, electricity, fuel, gas, and other external pressures (growing prices of oil and food on the global market) were expected to inflate price levels by 10% in the first months of 2009.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

===The 2008 financial crisis, response and recovery===
[[File:Real GDP growth in Estonia, 2002-2012.png|thumb|300px|Real GDP growth in Estonia, 2002–2012.]]
The [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]] has had a deep effect on the Estonian economy, primarily as a result of an investment and consumption slump that followed the burst of the real estate market bubble that had been building up during the preceding years.

After a long period of very high growth of GDP, the GDP of Estonia decreased. In the first quarter 2008, GDP grew only 0.1%, and then decreased: negative growth was −1.4% in the 2nd quarter, a little over −3% (on a year-to-year basis) in the 3rd quarter, and −9.4% in the 4th quarter of that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBN_20090609&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Tubalkain-Trell |first=Marge |title=Estonian Economy Fell 15.1 pct in Q1 |publisher=Baltic Business News |date=9 June 2009 |url= http://www.bbn.ee/?PublicationId=5e575e3c-7f5b-40c6-9a06-b3e53fb5d67b |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government made a supplementary negative budget, which was passed by the [[Riigikogu]]. The revenue of the budget was decreased for 2008 by EEK 6.1 billion and the expenditure by EEK 3.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Government approves supplementary budget for 2008 |publisher=[[Ministry of Finance (Estonia)|Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Estonia]] |date=15 May 2008 |url=http://www.fin.ee/?id=80290 |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A current account-deficit was extant, but began to shrink in the last months of 2008, and had been expected to continue to do so in the near future.

In 2009, the Estonian economy further contracted by 15.1% in the first quarter.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBN_20090609&quot; /&gt; Low domestic and foreign demand had depressed the economy's overall output.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters-2009-06-09&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Mardiste |first=David |title=Estonian Economy Contracts Sharply in First Quarter |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=9 June 2009 |url= http://www.forexpros.com/news/forex-news/estonian-economy-contracts-sharply-in-first-quarter-61196 |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Estonian economy's 33.7% industrial production drop was the sharpest decrease in industrial production in the entire [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tubalkain-Trell |first=Marge |title=Estonian Industrial Production Fell Most in EU |publisher=Baltic Business News |date=12 June 2009 |url= http://www.bbn.ee/?PublicationId=3259772f-4391-4a3a-92d7-fa7eb18f6a02 |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Estonia was one of the five worst-performing economies in the world in terms of annual GDP growth rate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Country Comparison – National product real growth rate |work=The World Factbook |publisher=CIA |date=2009 |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2003rank.html?countryName=Estonia&amp;countryCode=en&amp;regionCode=eu&amp;rank=209#en |accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had one of the greatest rates of unemployment in the EU, which rose from 3.9% in May 2008 to 15.6% in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Zumbrun |first=Joshua |title=In Pictures: The World's Hardest-Hit Economies |magazine=[[Forbes]] |url= https://www.forbes.com/2009/07/08/economics-iceland-ireland-business-beltway-countries_slide_4.html |date=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some{{Who|date=August 2009}} international experts and journalists, who like to view the three Baltic states as a single economic identity, had failed to notice that Estonia has constantly performed better than [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] on many fundamental indicators.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The current-account deficit and inflation was lower than in Latvia; GDP per capita was higher than in Latvia and Lithuania; Estonia's public debt was a low 3.8% of GDP, and government reserves were close to 10% of GDP. The difference is exemplified by the fact, that in December 2008, Estonia became one of the donor countries to the [[IMF]] lead rescue package for [[Latvia]].

In response to the crisis, the [[Andrus Ansip's second cabinet|Ansip government]] opted for fiscal consolidation and retrenchment by maintaining fiscal discipline and a balanced budget in combination with austerity packages: The government increased taxes, and reduced public spending by slashing expenditures and public salaries across the board.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kattel_and_Raudla&quot; /&gt;

In July 2009, the [[value-added tax]] was increased from 18% to 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tubalkain-Trell |first=Marge |title=MPs approve plan to increase VAT rate to 20 pct |publisher=Baltic Business News |date=18 June 2009 |url= http://bbn.ee/?PublicationId=87f66124-06d2-4a65-bc7b-49ccc6d69dfc |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recorded budget deficit for 2009 was just 1.7% of GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kattel_and_Raudla&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last=Kattel |first=Rainer |last2=Raudla |first2=Ringa |title=Why Did Estonia Choose Fiscal Retrenchment after the 2008 Crisis? |work=Journal of Public Policy |publisher=Researchgate |date=August 2011 |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231828912_Why_Did_Estonia_Choose_Fiscal_Retrenchment_after_the_2008_Crisis |accessdate=2019-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was, that Estonia was one of only five EU countries in 2009 that had met the Maastricht criteria for debt and deficit, and had the third-lowest deficit after Luxembourg and Sweden. Neither did Estonia need to ask help from the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]. Despite the third-largest drop in GDP, the country had the lowest budget deficit and the lowest public debt among Central and Eastern European countries.

In 2009, the Estonian economy began to rebound, and economic growth resumed in the second half of 2010. The country's unemployment rate has since dropped significantly to pre-recession levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;stat_unemployment&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Töötuse määr |language=Estonian |trans-title=Unemployment rate |publisher=Statistics Estonia |year=2019 |url=https://www.stat.ee/stat-tootuse-maar |accessdate=2019-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; To top it off, Estonia was granted permission in 2010 to join the eurozone in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kattel_and_Raudla&quot; /&gt;

===Joining the euro===
Before joining the eurozone, the [[Estonian kroon]] had been pegged to the euro at a rate of 15.64664 EEK to one euro; before then, the kroon was pegged to the German mark at approximately 8 EEK to 1 DEM.

Plans to join the euro were in place well before 2011. The design of [[Estonian euro coins]] was finalized in late 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tere_euro&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The Estonian euro coin |website=Tere Euro |publisher=[[Bank of Estonia]] |date=2011-07-11 |url= http://euro.eesti.ee/EU/Prod/Euroveeb/application/controllers/handleSessions8cc5.html?lang=en&amp;oid=11258 |accessdate=2019-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estonia's journey towards the euro took longer than originally projected, owing to the inflation rate continually being above the required 3% before 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tarbijahinnaindeksi muutus |language=Estonian |trans-title=Consumer-price index change |publisher=Statistics Estonia |year=2019 |url=https://www.stat.ee/stat-tarbijahinnaindeksi-muutus |accessdate=2019-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which prevented the country from fulfilling the entry criteria. The country originally planned to adopt the euro on 1 January 2007; however, it did not formally apply that year, and officially changed its target date twice: first to 1 January 2008, and later to 1 January 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;HS&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Alcohol and tobacco tax to rise in Estonia next year |location=Finland |newspaper=[[Helsingin Sanomat]] |date=25 May 2007 |url= http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Alcohol+and+tobacco+tax+to+rise+in+Estonia+next+year/1135227499218 |accessdate=1 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 May 2010, the European Commission announced that Estonia had met all criteria to join the eurozone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Estonia ready for euro |url=http://ec.europa.eu/news/economy/100512_1_en.htm |publisher=[[European Commission]] |date=12 May 2010 |accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 June 2010, EU finance ministers agreed that Estonia would be able to join the euro on 1 January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actionforex.com/analysis/daily-forex-fundamentals/estonia-to-join-euro-1-january-2011-20100608115064/ Estonia to Join Euro 1 January 2011] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100611052826/http://www.actionforex.com/analysis/daily-forex-fundamentals/estonia-to-join-euro-1-january-2011-20100608115064/ |date=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 July 2010, Estonia received the final approval from ECOFIN to adopt the euro onwards from 1 January 2011.

The switchover to the euro took place on 1 January 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters-2011-01-01&quot;/&gt;

With that, Estonia became the first ex-Soviet republic to join the [[eurozone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HS&quot; /&gt;

On 9 August 2011, just days after [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] raised Estonia's credit rating from A to {{nowrap begin}}AA-.{{nowrap end}} Among the factors, S&amp;P cited as contributing to its decision was confidence in Estonia's ability to &quot;sustain strong economic growth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ummelas |first=Ott |title=Estonia's Rating Raised to AA- by S&amp;P on Economic Growth, Strong Finances |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=9 August 2011 |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-09/estonia-s-rating-raised-to-aa-by-s-p-on-growth-finances-1-.html |accessdate=11 August 2011 |quote=Estonia's credit rating was raised by Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings to the second-highest level in eastern Europe on the Baltic country's strong economic growth and solid public finances.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estonia's GDP growth rate in 2011 was above 8%, despite having negative population growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Unemployment in Europe (monthly) |format=The chart shows data for the EU, Estonia, and Finland |agency=[[Eurostat]] |work=[[Google Public Data Explorer]] |publisher=Google |url= https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z8o7pt6rd5uqa6_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:sa&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:eu:non-eu&amp;idim=country:fi:ee&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;tstart=948657600000&amp;tend=1366747200000&amp;hl=en&amp;ind=false#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:sa&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:eu:non-eu&amp;idim=country:fi:ee&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;tstart=948664800000&amp;tend=1374613200000&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en_US&amp;ind=false |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GDP Growth Rate |agency=[[World Bank]] |work=Google Public Data |publisher=Google |url= https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_kd_zg&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:EST&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tdim=true&amp;tstart=895950000000&amp;tend=1306180800000&amp;ind=false |accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The economy today==
{{Update|section|date=May 2018}}
In the second quarter of 2013, the average monthly gross wage in Estonia was €976 (15,271 [[Estonian kroon|kroons]], US$1,328).&lt;ref name=&quot;stat.ee&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Most requested statistics |work=Main indicators |publisher=[[Statistics Estonia]] |date=30 September 2013 |url= http://www.stat.ee/main-indicators |accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure has grown consistently to €1310 (20,497 kroons, US$1473)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stat.ee/stat-average-monthly-gross-wages-salaries|title=Average monthly gross wages (salaries) – Statistics Estonia|website=www.stat.ee|access-date=2019-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; as of 2018.

Estonia is nearly energy-independent, supplying over 90% of its electricity needs with [[Oil shale in Estonia|locally mined oil shale]]. Alternative energy sources such as wood, peat, and biomass make up approximately 9% of primary energy production. Estonia imports needed petroleum products from western Europe and Russia. Oil shale energy, telecommunications, textiles, chemical products, banking, services, food and fishing, timber, shipbuilding, electronics, and transportation are key sectors of the economy. The [[ice-free port]] of [[Port of Muuga|Muuga]], near [[Tallinn]], is a modern facility featuring good transshipment capability, a high-capacity grain elevator, chill/frozen storage, and brand-new oil tanker off-loading capabilities. The railroad serves as a conduit between the West, Russia, and other points to the East.

Estonia today is mainly influenced by developments in Finland, Russia, Sweden and Germany – the four main trade partners. The government has significantly increased its spending on innovation since 2016, with €304 million aimed to stimulate research and development in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stat.ee/news-release-2018-125|title=Expenditure on research and development increased last year – Statistics Estonia|website=www.stat.ee|access-date=2019-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future projections===
Long-term prospects for the Estonian economy remain among the most promising in Europe. In 2011, the real GDP growth in Estonia was 8.0%, and according to projections made by [[Centre d'Etudes Prospectives et d'Informations Internationales|CEPII]], the GDP per capita could rise by 2025 to the level of Nordic economies of Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and Norway.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} According to the same projections, by 2050, Estonia could become the most productive country in the EU, after Luxembourg, and thus join the top five most productive nations in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Great Shift: Macroeconomic projections for the world economy at the 2050 horizon |publisher=[[Centre d'Etudes Prospectives et d'Informations Internationales|CEPII]] |location=France |date=February 2012 |url= http://www.cepii.fr/anglaisgraph/workpap/pdf/2012/wp2012-03.pdf |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment participation==
[[File:Estonia Unemployment Rates.png|450px|thumb|Unemployment rate as a percentage of the labor force in [[Estonia]] according to [[Statistics Estonia]].]]

Estonia has around 600,000 employees, yet the country has a shortage of skilled labor, and since skill shortages are experienced everywhere in Europe, the government has increased working visa quota for non-[[European Economic Area|EEA]] citizens, although it has nevertheless been criticized for being inadequate for addressing the shortages.

The [[Late-2000s recession|late-2000s recession in the world]], the near-concurrent local property bust with changes in Estonian legislation to increase [[labour market flexibility]] (making it easier for companies to lay off workers) saw Estonia's unemployment rate shoot up to 18.8% throughout the duration of the crisis, then stabilise to 13.8% by summer 2011, as the economy recovered on the basis of strong exports. Internal consumption, and therefore imports, plummeted; and cuts were made in public finances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Estonian exceptionalism|work=[[The Economist]] |date=14 July 2011 |url= http://www.economist.com/node/18959241 |accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the reduction in unemployment has been attributed to some Estonians' emigrating for employment to Finland, the UK, Australia, and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=8853&amp;langId=en |title=Social Impact of Emigration and Rural-Urban Migration in Central and Eastern Europe |last=Tammaru |first=Tiit |date=April 2012 |website=ec.europa.eu |accessdate=2019-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the recession, the unemployment rate went lower, and throughout 2015 and 2016, the rate stayed near the levels that preceded the economic downturn, staying at just above 6%.&lt;ref name=&quot;stat.ee_main_indicators&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Most requested statistics |publisher=Statistics Estonia |url=http://www.stat.ee/main-indicators}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sectors==
[[Tallinn]] has emerged as the country's financial center. According to Invest in Estonia, advantages of Estonian financial sector are unbureaucratic cooperation between companies and authorities, and relative abundance of educated people although young educated Estonians tend to emigrate to western Europe for greater income. The largest banks are [[Swedbank]], [[SEB Pank]], and [[Nordea]]. Several IPOs have been made recently on the [[Tallinn Stock Exchange]], a member [[OMX]] system.

The Estonian service sector employs over 60% of workforce. Estonia has a strong information technology (IT) sector, partly due to the [[Tiigrihüpe]] project undertaken in mid-1990s, and has been mentioned as the most &quot;wired&quot; and advanced country in Europe in the terms of [[E-government#Estonia|e-government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Hackers Take Down the Most Wired Country in Europe |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=21 August 2007 |url= https://www.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/15-09/ff_estonia |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Government of Estonia homepage |url=http://www.valitsus.ee/ |publisher=[[Government of Estonia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farming, which had been forcibly [[collectivization|collectivized]] for decades until the transition era of 1990–1992, has become privatized and more efficient, and the total farming area has increased in the period following Estonia's restoration of independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Laansalu |first=Ants |title=Crisis in agriculture in the 1990s |work=The rural economy in Estonia until 2001 |publisher=[[Estonica]] |date=9 October 2009 |url= http://www.estonica.org/eng/lugu.html?menyy_id=914&amp;kateg=40&amp;alam=94&amp;leht=3 |accessdate=11 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070610040459/http://www.estonica.org/eng/lugu.html?menyy_id=914&amp;kateg=40&amp;alam=94&amp;leht=3 |archivedate=10 June 2007 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The share of agriculture in the gross domestic product decreased from 15% to 3.3% during 1991–2000, while employment in agriculture decreased from 15% to 5.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

The [[mining industry]] makes up 1% of the GDP. Mined commodities include oil shale, [[peat]], and industrial minerals, such as [[clay]]s, [[limestone]], [[sand]] and [[gravel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kuo |first=Chin S. |title=The Mineral Industries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania |work=U.S. Geological Survey Minerals Yearbook |format=PDF |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey Mineral Resources Program |year=2001 |url= http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/country/2001/enlglhmyb01.pdf |accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soviets created badly polluting industry in the early 1950s, concentrated in the north-east of the country.

Estonian productivity is experiencing rapid growth, and consequently wages are also rising quickly, with a rise in private consumption of about 8% in 2005. According to Estonian Institute of Economic Research, the largest contributors to GDP growth in 2005 were processing industry, financial intermediation, retailing and wholesale trade, transport and communications.&lt;ref name=&quot;companies2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Estonian Institute of Economic Research |title=Top Estonian Enterprises 2006 |format=PDF |publisher=Enterprise Estonia |date=November 2006 |url= http://www.eas.ee/vfs/3282/Edetabel_ENG_2006_trykk_Bh.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070609233211/http://www.eas.ee/vfs/3282/Edetabel_ENG_2006_trykk_Bh.pdf |archivedate=9 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Railway transport dominates the cargo sector, comprising 70% of all carried goods, domestic and international. Road transport is the one that prevails in the passenger sector, accounting for over 90% of all transported passengers. 5 major cargo ports offer easy navigational access, deep waters, and good ice conditions. There are 12 airports and 1 [[heliport]] in Estonia. [[Lennart Meri Tallinn Airport]] is the largest airport in Estonia, with 1,73 million passengers and 22,764 tons of cargo (annual cargo growth 119.7%) in 2007. International flight companies such as [[Scandinavian Airlines System|SAS]], [[Finnair]], [[Lufthansa]], [[EasyJet]], and [[Nordic Aviation Group]] provide direct flights to 27 destinations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investinestonia.com/index.php?option=displaypage&amp;Itemid=111&amp;op=page&amp;SubMenu= TRANSPORTATION '''(dead link)'''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707071918/http://www.investinestonia.com/index.php?option=displaypage&amp;Itemid=111&amp;op=page&amp;SubMenu= |date=7 July 2007 }}, Invest in Estonia&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 7.5% of the country's [[workforce]] is employed in transportation and the sector contributes over 10% of GDP. Estonia is getting much business from traffic between European Union and Russia, especially oil cargo through Estonian ports. Transit trade's share of GDP is disputed, but many agree that Russia's increased hostility is decreasing the share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Purju |first=Alari |title=Transit trade through Estonia: problems and developments |format=PDF |publisher=[[University of Turku]], [[Pan-European Institute]] |location=Finland |date=29 February 2008 |url=http://www.tse.fi/FI/yksikot/erillislaitokset/pei/Documents/bre2008/expert_article172_12008.pdf |accessdate=21 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211234844/http://www.tse.fi/FI/yksikot/erillislaitokset/pei/Documents/bre2008/expert_article172_12008.pdf |archive-date=11 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tubalkain-Trell |first=Marge |title=Estonian businessman: Estonian transit will struggle another 10 years |publisher=Baltic Business News |date=19 June 2008 |url= http://www.bbn.ee/?PublicationId=43ce440f-713d-4469-ae85-5e9d12ddb2e1 |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of coal, electricity is generated by burning oil shale, with [[Narva Power Plants|largest stations in Narva]]. Oil shale supplies around 70% of the country's primary energy. Other energy sources are natural gas imported from Russia, wood, [[motor fuel]]s, and [[fuel oil]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Countries: Estonia |work=Wind energy in the Baltic Sea Region |publisher=Baltic Wind Energy Association |year=2004 |url= http://www.windenergy-in-the-bsr.net/countries_detail_3.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081121195559/http://www.windenergy-in-the-bsr.net/countries_detail_3.html |archivedate =21 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wind power in Estonia]] amounts to 58.1&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt]]s, whilst roughly 399 megawatts worth of projects are currently being developed. Estonian energy liberalization is lagging far behind the [[Nordic energy market]]. During the accession negotiations with the EU, Estonia agreed that at least 35% of the market are opened before 2009 and all of non-household market, which totals around 77% of consumption, before 2013. Estonia is concerned that Russia could use energy markets to bully it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kasekamp |first=Andres |authorlink1=Andres Kasekamp |last2=Mäe |first2=Andres |last3=Soosaar |first3=Sulev |last4=Uustalu |first4=Jaan |last5=Vares |first5=Villu |last6=Wegmarshaus |first6=Gert-Rüdiger |title=Energy Security of Estonia in the Context of the Energy Policy of the European Union |format=PDF |publisher=Estonian Foreign Policy Institute |date=September 2006 |url=http://www.evi.ee/lib/Security.pdf |accessdate=10 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108161835/http://www.evi.ee/lib/Security.pdf |archivedate=8 January 2012 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the government considered granting permits to nuclear power companies, and there were plans for a shared nuclear facility with Latvia and Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Latvia, Estonia push for Baltic nuclear plant |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |publisher=Spacedaily.com |date=18 February 2009 |url= http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Latvia_Estonia_push_for_Baltic_nuclear_plant_999.html |accessdate =10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those plans were shelved after the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] in March 2011.

Estonia has high Internet penetration, and connections are available throughout most of the country.
