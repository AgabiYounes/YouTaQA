== Railways ==
{{seealso|History of rail transport in Equatorial Guinea}}
There are currently no railways in Equatorial Guinea.&lt;ref name = &quot;meoeor&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Equatorial Guinea: Transportation | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ek.html | accessdate = 2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maps ==
* [http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/fullMaps_Af.nsf/luFullMap/7C43B0E43BE341668525711C0063A7F9/$File/govfr_REF_gnq210206.pdf?OpenElement]

== Highways ==
There are 2,880&amp;nbsp;km (1,790&amp;nbsp;mi) of highways in Equatorial Guinea, the majority of which were not paved in 2002.  Equatorial Guinea's roads and highways are underdeveloped, but improving. During the rainy season, roads are frequently impassable without four-wheel drive vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Equatorial Guinea | url = http://www.travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1110.html | accessdate = 2007-05-02 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070421112025/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1110.html | archivedate = 2007-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the country has recently{{When|date=July 2017}} built a 175-km long two-lane [[Limited-access road|expressway]] that runs between [[Bata, Equatorial Guinea|Bata]] and [[President Obiang Nguema International Airport]], and it is expected to soon reach the city of [[Mongomo]], located on the border with [[Gabon]].

== Ports and harbors ==
The chief ports are [[Bata, Equatorial Guinea|Bata]] and [[Mbini]] in [[Río Muni]] and [[Malabo]] and [[Luba, Equatorial Guinea|Luba]] on [[Bioko]]. Bata, modernized in the 1970s, can accommodate up to four vessels of 20,000
tons each. There is regular service between Malabo and Bata.

== Merchant marine ==
In 2005, the country had one merchant ship of over {{GT|1000|link=off}} in service; a cargo vessel of {{GT|6556|link=off}}.

== Airports ==
{{seealso|List of airports in Equatorial Guinea}}
There are seven airports in Equatorial Guinea&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ek.html|website=www.cia.gov|publisher=CIA|accessdate=13 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Its main airport is [[Malabo International Airport]] in Punta Europa, [[Bioko Island]]. International flights operate from Malabo to [[Nigeria]], [[Gabon]], [[Benin]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Spain]], [[Germany]] and [[France]]. Mainland Equatorial Guinea is primarily served by [[Bata Airport]], north of [[Bata, Equatorial Guinea|Bata]], which has domestic air services to [[Malabo]].
