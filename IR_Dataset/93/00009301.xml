'''Erotica''' is any literary or artistic work that deals substantively with subject matter that is [[eroticism|erotically]] [[sexual stimulation|stimulating]] or [[sexual arousal|sexually arousing]] but is not [[pornographic]]. [[Erotic art]] may use any artistic form to depict erotic content, including [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[drama]], [[erotic film|film]] or [[music]]. [[Erotic literature]] and [[erotic photography]] have become genres in their own right.

'''Curiosa''' is erotica and pornography as discrete, [[collectable]] items, usually in published or printed form. In the [[antiquarian]] book trade, pornographic works are often listed under &quot;curiosa&quot;, &quot;erotica&quot; or &quot;[[facetiae]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary Of Library And Information Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0X9CSLFKKC0C|first=V.K.|last=Suraj|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|year=2005|isbn=9788182052536|page=620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Erotica and pornography==
A distinction is often made between erotica and [[pornography]] (as well as the lesser-known genre of sexual entertainment, [[ribaldry]]), although some viewers may not distinguish between them. A key distinction, some have argued, is that pornography's objective is the graphic depiction of sexually explicit scenes, while erotica &quot;seeks to tell a story that involves sexual themes&quot; that include a more plausible depiction of human sexuality than in pornography.&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;[http://tech.mit.edu/V116/N65/erotica.65l.html &quot;Erotica Is Not Pornography&quot;]. William J. Gehrke. ''The Tech''. December 10, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, works considered degrading or exploitative tend to be classified by those who see them as such, as &quot;porn&quot; rather than as &quot;erotica&quot; and consequently, pornography is often described as exploitative or degrading.&lt;ref name=MIT/&gt;&lt;ref name=India&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/815524.cms &quot;Don't confuse erotica with porn&quot;]. Jug Suraiya. ''[[The Times of India]]''. August 15, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries have laws banning or at least regulating what is considered pornographic material, a situation which generally does not apply to erotica.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

Feminist writer [[Gloria Steinem]] distinguishes erotica from pornography, writing: &quot;Erotica is as different from pornography as love is from rape, as dignity is from humiliation, as partnership is from slavery, as pleasure is from pain.&quot; Steinem's argument hinges on the distinction between reciprocity versus domination, as she writes: &quot;Blatant or subtle, pornography involves no equal power or mutuality. In fact, much of the tension and drama comes from the clear idea that one person is dominating the other.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinem|first=Gloria|title=Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions|publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co.|year=1984|location=New York|edition=1|isbn=|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Erotica and Pornography: A Clear and Present Difference|magazine=Ms.|date=November 1978|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Pornography—Not Sex but the Obscene Use of Power|magazine=Ms.|date=August 1977|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
