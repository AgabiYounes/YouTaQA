It also involves participation in the social and [[economic development]] of the country and the provision of assistance in the maintenance of internal order. Tasks include fighting [[organised crime]], anti-narcotic operations and illegal [[immigration]].&lt;ref name=&quot;janes.com&quot;/&gt; One social development programme applies the provision of teachers for rural schools through an accord with the Ministry of Education.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Environmental protection is also a priority, several programmes were implemented: &quot;National Forestation and Ornamentation&quot;, &quot;Lonely Tree&quot;, &quot;Green Surveillance&quot;, &quot;Fire Plan&quot;, &quot;Ecuador Forest&quot; and &quot;Arenillas Military Reserve&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} The Ecuadorian territory is divided into five &quot;Joint Task Force Zones&quot; or ''Fuerzas de Tarea Conjunta'', four on mainland [[Ecuador]], the fifth being the Naval-zone (including the [[Galápagos Islands]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoy.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/noticias-ecuador/se-divide-al-pais-en-cinco-areas-332825.html |title=Se divide al paĂs en cinco ĂĄreas - Diario HOY - Noticias del Ecuador y del Mundo - Hoy Online |publisher=Hoy.com.ec |accessdate=28 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927101451/https://www.hoy.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/noticias-ecuador/se-divide-al-pais-en-cinco-areas-332825.html |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoy.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/ffaa-presentan-nuevo-plan-de-defensa-interna-332767.html |title=FFAA presentan nuevo plan de defensa interna - Diario HOY - Noticias del Ecuador y del Mundo - Hoy Online |publisher=Hoy.com.ec |accessdate=28 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516160310/http://www.hoy.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/ffaa-presentan-nuevo-plan-de-defensa-interna-332767.html |archivedate=16 May 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overseas territories include also the &quot;[[Pedro Vicente Maldonado]]&quot; Naval Biological Research Station in the [[Antarctic]].

==Geopolitical situation==
[[Ecuador]] shares a {{convert|1420|km|0|abbr=on}} border with [[Peru]]. Although marked by many conflicts, relations have improved since the signing of a renewed [[Rio Protocol|Peace Treaty]] in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Ecuador |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ec.html |work=[[The World Factbook]] |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=6 July 2012|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, along the {{convert|590|km|0|abbr=on}}-long border with its neighbour [[Colombia]], relations have been strained mainly due to a cross-border raid by [[Colombian Army|Colombian forces]] on [[FARC]] [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;janes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Sentinel-Security-Assessment-South-America/Armed-forces-Ecuador.html |title=Armed forces (Ecuador) - Sentinel Security Assessment - South America |publisher=Janes |date= |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;time.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;time.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Stephan Küffner |url= http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1732271,00.html |title=South America's Most Troubled Border |work=Time |location= New York |date=18 April 2008 |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Armed Forces]] had logistical shortcomings and were caught off-guard.

It involves the modernisation of [[military]] equipment, improvement of planning and operations within the Ecuadorian territory. &quot;PATRIA I&quot; shall be completed by 2011. In 2009, the spending budget was increased by 25% and totaled $920 million.

== History ==
{{Main|Military history of Ecuador}}

[[File:Ecuador-peru-land-claims-01.png|thumb|Map of the long-lasting territorial dispute between [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]], settled only in 1998. (in Spanish)]]

[[Ecuador]]'s [[military]] history dates far back to its first attempt to secure freedom from [[Spain]] in 1811. In 1822 Ecuadorian troops, alongside other rebel forces, scored a [[decisive victory]] over the [[Spain|Spanish]] royalist [[army]] at the [[Battle of Pichincha]]. Although assisted by Peruvian troops, it would fight these only a few years later in 1828, as a member of the Confederation of [[Gran Colombia]]. The troops of Gran Colombia (Less than half of its troops were Ecuadorians), is defeated in the [[Battle of Punta Malpelo]] and the combat of crosses, where the Peruvian navy blocks Guayaquil. Then the great Colombians in the land field defeat a division of Peruvian outpost, in the battle of Tarqui. This battle does not define war after the signing of the Giron agreement where it is indicated that it remains in a status quo before bellum. Eventually, Civil War would plunge the country and the army into disorder. In 1941 the Ecuadorian Military found itself weak and disorganized; the by now long-lasting territorial dispute with [[Peru]] escalated into a major conflict, the [[Ecuadorian–Peruvian War|Ecuadorian–Peruvian War of 1941]]. A much larger and better equipped Peruvian force quickly overwhelmed the Ecuadorian forces, driving them back and invading the Ecuadorian territory. Ecuador had no choice but to accept Peru's territorial claims and signed [[Rio Protocol|Peace treaty]] in 1942. However, the treaty of 1942 failed to settle the border dispute and occasional clashes occurred in a then still non-demarcated border area between the nations. These clashes flared into another outbreak of serious fighting in January 1981 called the [[Paquisha War]] where Ecuadorian troops infiltrated into Peruvian territory are expelled by the Peruvian army; similar incidents occurred in 1983 and again in 1984. The last [[military]] conflict with Peru occurred in 1995, during the [[Cenepa War]], in which both sides claimed to be fighting inside their own territory until the signing of a ceasefire and the eventual separation of forces. The longest-running source of armed international conflict in the Western Hemisphere had ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyguy.com/hgnews_ecuador-peru.html |title=News:Ecuador-Peru |publisher=The History Guy |date= |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The present day '''Ecuadorian Navy''' or (''Armada del Ecuador'') is a compact, efficient and well-balanced force. However, limited funds hinder any major acquisitions and the chances of maintaining a strong force within the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Since end 2009, the Navy's structure became simplified. The Ecuadorian Naval-Zone became one and measures, {{convert|2237|km|0|abbr=on}} of the [[Pacific Coast]] and {{convert|6,720|km2|abbr=on}} of the [[Pacific Ocean]], (including the [[Galápagos Islands]]). Most sea-going assets are based at [[Guayaquil]]. The Navy focuses mainly on the border-control and illegal immigration. The [[Ecuadorian Navy|Navy]] operates around 20 major vessels (including two submarines) and 25 aircraft. It has a personnel of 7,258.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccmr.org&quot;/&gt; To increase its operational capabilities it recently acquired:

== Equipment sources ==
Historically, Ecuador depended on a wide variety of foreign suppliers for virtually all of its equipment needs. Only in the 1980s did it begin to develop a modest domestic arms industry as the Directorate of Army Industries manufactured rifle ammunition, uniforms, boots, and other items.

In the 1960s and 1970s, [[France]] became a leading supplier and delivered [[AMX-13]] tanks and various aircraft. [[Ecuador]] also purchased [[Type 209 submarine]]s and [[Lürssen]]-Seawolf TNC 45 patrol boats from [[West Germany]]. Various types of [[infantry]] weapons were acquired from [[Belgium]].

Ecuador became a substantial customer for [[Israel]]i arms in the 1970s, purchasing [[IAI Arava|Arava aircraft]], [[Gabriel missile]]s for naval patrol craft, and [[Uzi]] submachine guns. Under technical assistance contracts, Israel serviced Israeli planes in the [[Ecuadorian Air Force]] inventory as well as [[Boeing]] civilian aircraft flown by [[TAME]] and ''Ecuatoriana Airlines''. Ecuador also reportedly employed Israeli security specialists as consultants in the fight against terrorism. In 1976 Ecuador became the first foreign country to order the [[IAI Kfir|Kfir]], an advanced jet fighter equipped with the [[General Electric J-79]] engine produced in Israel under license. The transaction, which required United States government approval because of the engine technology, was rejected by the administration of President [[Jimmy Carter]] in order to discourage the proliferation of sophisticated military equipment in the [[Third World]]. The action caused an uproar in Israel where the sale was regarded as an important breakthrough in Israel's efforts to develop international markets for the Kfir. In 1981, after the inauguration of President [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Federal government of the United States|Washington]] removed its objection to the sale. Although the contract called for the purchase of 12 Kfirs and an option to purchase an additional 12, Ecuador acquired only the original group, at a price estimated at US$196 million.

Ecuador became a relatively heavy importer of arms in the late 1970s and early 1980s, averaging US$150 million annually and reaching a peak of US$280 million in 1982. These imports declined sharply to an average of US$50 million annually between 1985 and 1987, presumably as a result of a dramatic reduction in oil revenues and the precipitous drop in the value of the [[Ecuadorian sucre|sucre]], which made imported arms extremely expensive. Between 1983 and 1987, Ecuador imported an estimated US$460 million of arms, primarily from [[Italy]], France, the United States, and [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In 1995, during the [[Cenepa War]] against [[Peru]], [[Argentina]] gave to Ecuador 6,500 [[ton]]s of [[rifle]]s, cannons, [[anti-tank rockets]], and ammunition in a controversial move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Redacción BBC Mundo |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/latin_america/newsid_7274000/7274638.stm |title=BBC Mundo - América Latina - Así fue la última guerra |work=BBC News |date= 3 March 2008|accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent times saw changes in Ecuador's foreign policy, as it decided to look for alternative weapon suppliers. These included its long-term allies [[Chile]], which since 2008 has provided [[Leopard 1]] tanks and {{sclass-|Leander|frigate|1}}s. Israel delivered its [[unmanned aerial vehicles]] in 2009, and [[Brazil]] supplied additional military vehicles and [[Embraer EMB 314 Super Tucano|Super Tucano]] combat-aircraft. Countries like [[Russia]] and [[China]] have delivered small quantities of military equipment in the past, but have gained importance in recent years. Since then, Chinese radars, anti-aircraft systems, and infantry weapons have been purchased. In 2009 two additional [[Mil Mi-17]] helicopters have been ordered from [[Russia]] with further deals planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=108411&amp;sectionid=351020706 |title=Ecuador seeks arms deal with Russia |publisher=Presstv.ir |date=11 October 2009 |accessdate=28 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930001123/https://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=108411&amp;sectionid=351020706 |archivedate=30 September 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[India]] has delivered [[HAL Dhruv]] helicopters and [[South Africa]] is about to deliver 12 [[Atlas Cheetah]] [[supersonic]] aircraft. Ecuador's political ally, [[Venezuela]], has donated military equipment including six [[Dassault Mirage 5|Mirage 50]] aircraft.

In 2010, the U.S. embassy in Ecuador announced that it had delivered $1.2 million of donated military equipment to the Ecuadorian military. The donations were intended to support operations countering drug smuggling and guerilla activity along the [[Colombia]]n border. Although the U.S. has refused to renew their lease on the [[Manta Air Base|Manta military airbase]], deliveries included trucks, patrol boats, GPS, night vision, and [[M4 carbine]] rifles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sify.com/news/us-gives-military-gear-worth-1-2-mn-to-ecuador-news-international-kflkOcfdhhf.html |title=US gives military gear worth $1.2 mn to Ecuador |publisher=Sify.com |date=11 May 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/blog/5533/leading-indicators-off-the-radar-news-roundup |title=Leading Indicators - Leading Indicators: Off-the-Radar News Roundup |publisher=Worldpoliticsreview.com |date=12 May 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
