===Emigration===
The migration rate accelerated during the period of 1979 to 1981, this marked the beginning of the civil unrest and the spread of political killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Richard C.|title=Causes of Salvadoran Migration to the United States|journal=Geographical Review|date=April 1989|volume=79|issue=2|pages=183–194|doi=10.2307/215525|jstor=215525}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total impact of civil wars, dictatorships and socioeconomics drove over a million Salvadorans (both as immigrants and refugees) into the [[Salvadoran American|United States]]; [[Guatemala]] is the second country that hosts more Salvadorans behind the [[United States]], approximately 110,000 Salvadorans according to the national census of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.gob.gt/index.php/demografia-y-poblacion/42-demografiaypoblacion/207-infodemo2010|title=Institución|first=Super|last=User|website=Ine.gob.gt|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition small Salvadoran communities sprung up in [[Salvadoran Canadian|Canada]], [[Salvadoran Australian|Australia]], [[Belize]], [[Panama]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Italy]], [[Taiwan]]  and [[Sweden]] since the migration trend began in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mapa de las Migraciones Salvadoreñas|url=http://www.pnud.org.sv/2007/content/view/1184/122/|website=PNUD El Salvador|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 U.S. Census counted 1,648,968 Salvadorans in the United States, up from 655,165 in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/ |title=American FactFinder |accessdate=2011-04-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911234518/http://factfinder2.census.gov/ |archivedate=2013-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnic groups==

===Mestizo Salvadorans===
86.3% of the population are [[mestizo]], having mixed indigenous and European ancestry.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; In the mestizo population, Salvadorans who are racially European, especially Mediterranean, as well as [[Afro-Salvadoran]], and the indigenous people in El Salvador who do not speak indigenous languages or have an indigenous culture, all identify themselves as being culturally mestizo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travisa.com/Elsalvador/elsalvadorportal.htm EL SALVADOR Visa Application - Tourist Visas, Business Visas, Expedited Visas - El Salvador Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201052106/http://travisa.com/Elsalvador/elsalvadorportal.htm |date=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native American Indigenous Salvadorans===
[[File:Las Palmas estampa.JPG|thumb|left|Indigenous Salvadoran woman from [[Panchimalco]]]]
[[File:Pedro de Alvarado.JPG|thumb|[[Spaniard]] conquistador [[Pedro de Alvarado]] and his army became the first to settle and establish European colonies in El Salvador in 1524.]]
According to the Salvadoran Government, about 1% of the population are of full or partial indigenous origin. The largest most dominant Native American groups in El Salvador are the [[Lenca people]], [[Maya peoples]]: ([[Poqomam people]]/[[Chorti people]]) and [[Pipil people]] followed by small enclaves of [[Cacaopera people]], [[Xinca people]], [[Alaguilac people]], [[Mixe people]], [[Mangue language]] people, as well as an [[Olmec]] past. ([[Pipil people|Pipil]], located in the west and central part of the country, and [[Lenca people|Lenca]], found east of the [[Lempa River]]). There are small populations of [[Cacaopera people]] in the [[Morazán Department]] and a few [[Ch'orti' people]] live in the department of [[Ahuachapán]], near the border of [[Guatemala]].

The number of indigenous people in El Salvador have been criticized by indigenous organizations and academics as too small and accuse the government of denying the existence of indigenous Salvadorans in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ayala|first1=Edgardo|title=Native People of El Salvador Finally Gain Recognition|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/05/native-people-of-el-salvador-finally-gain-recognition/|website=Ipsnews.net|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the National Salvadoran Indigenous Coordination Council (CCNIS) and CONCULTURA (National Council for Art and Culture at the Ministry of Education ), approximately 70,000 or 1 per cent of Salvadorian peoples are indigenous.&lt;ref name=&quot;El Salvador - Indigenous peoples&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=El Salvador - Indigenous peoples|url=http://minorityrights.org/minorities/indigenous-peoples-2/|website=Minority rights groups international|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, very few Amerindians have retained their customs and traditions, having over time assimilated into the dominant Mestizo/Spanish culture. The low numbers of indigenous people may be partly explained by historically high rates of old-world diseases, absorption into the mestizo population, as well as mass murder during the [[1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising]] (or ''La Matanza'') which saw (estimates of) up to 30,000 [[peasants]] killed in a short period of time. Many authors note that since ''La Matanza'' the indigenous in El Salvador have been very reluctant to describe themselves as such (in census declarations for example) or to wear indigenous dress or be seen to be taking part in any cultural activities or customs that might be understood as indigenous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countriesquest.com/central_america/el_salvador/history/military_rule_1931-1979.htm|title=Jose Napoleon Duarte,Hernandez Martinez,Ungo,Matanza,Central American Common Market,CACM,urban middle class,Christian Democratic Party,powerful families,death squads,Organization of American States,PRUD,International Court Of Justice,urban center,rapid population growth|website=Countriesquest.com|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Departments and cities in the country with notable indigenous populations include [[Sonsonate]] (especially [[Izalco]], [[Nahuizalco]], and [[Santo Domingo, Sonsonate|Santo Domingo]]), [[Cacaopera]], and [[Panchimalco]], in the department of [[San Salvador Department|San Salvador]].&lt;ref name=&quot;El Salvador - Indigenous peoples&quot;/&gt;

===White Salvadorans===
Some 12.7% of Salvadorans are [[White Latin American#El Salvador|white]]. This population is mostly made up of ethnically [[Spanish people]], while there are also Salvadorans of [[French people|French]], [[Germans|German]], [[Swiss people|Swiss]], [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]], and [[Italian people|Italian]] descent. A majority of [[Central Europe]]an settlers in El Salvador arrived during World War II as refugees from the [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], and [[Switzerland]]. In northern departments like the [[Chalatenango Department]], it is well known that residents in the area are of pure Spanish descent;{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} settling in the region that is now Chalatenango in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carondelet|url=http://nescribiente.blogspot.com/2010/08/carondelet.html|website=NCH Historias Multimedia|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The governor of San Salvador, [[Francisco Luis Héctor de Carondelet]], ordered families from northern Spain ([[Galicia, Spain|Galicia]] and [[Asturias]]) to settle the area to compensate for the lack of indigenous people to work the land; it is not uncommon to see people with blond hair, fair skin, and blue or green eyes in municipalities like [[Dulce Nombre de María]], [[La Palma, Chalatenango|La Palma]], and [[Cerro El Pital|El Pital]]. The majority of Salvadorans of Spanish descent possess Mediterranean racial features: olive skin and dark hair and eyes (black or dark brown), and they identify themselves as mestizo, like mentioned above. 

====&lt;big&gt;Arab Salvadorans&lt;/big&gt;====
[[File:Arabelsalvador.png|thumb|''Arab Salvadorans'' include [[Palestinian Salvadoran]], Lebanese Salvadoran, Syrian Salvadoran and Egyptian Salvadoran.]]
[[File:Bukele Conferencia.png|thumb|The [[President of El Salvador]], [[Nayib Bukele]] is a [[Palestinian Salvadoran]]]]
There is a significant Arab population (of about 100,000);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zielger|first1=Matthew|title=El Salvador: Central American Palestine of the West?|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Culture/Art/2004/Apr-27/91857-el-salvador-central-american-palestine-of-the-west.ashx#axzz3EZpwYUKb|website=The Daily Star|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (especially from the area of [[Bethlehem]]), but also from Lebanon. [[Palestinian Salvadoran|Salvadorans of Palestinian descent]] numbered around 70,000 individuals, while Salvadorans of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] descent is around 25,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lebanese Diaspora – Worldwide Geographical Distribution|url=http://theidentitychef.com/2009/09/06/lebanese-diaspora-worldwide-geographical-distribution/|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a small community of [[History of the Jews in El Salvador|Jews]] who came to El Salvador from France, Germany, [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Turkey]].

The history of the [[Arabs]] in El Salvador dates back to the end of the 20th century, because of religious clashes, which induced many [[Palestinians]], [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], [[Egyptians]] and [[Syrians]] to leave the land where they were born, in search of countries where they at least lived in An atmosphere of relative peace. There were also other reasons of a subjective nature, based on the hope of success, of achieving success and fortune and obtaining recognition from others.

Arab immigration in El Salvador began at the end of the 20th century in the wake of the repressive policies applied by the [[Ottoman Empire]] against [[Maronite Catholics]]. Several of the destinations that the Lebanese chose at that time were in countries of the Americas, including El Salvador. This resulted in the Arab diaspora residents being characterized by forging in devoutly Christian families and very attached to their beliefs, because in these countries they can exercise their faith without fear of persecution, which resulted in the rise of Lebanese-Salvadoran, Syrian-Salvadoran and Palestinian-Salvadoran communities in El Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://latinx.com/discover/aj-plus-the-palestinians-of-el-salvador/ |title=AJ Plus: The Palestinians of El Salvador |work=latinx.com |date=May 29, 2019}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Currently the strongest community is the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] (70,000 descendants), followed by the [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] settled in San Salvador with more than 27,000 direct descendants, mostly (95%) [[Catholic]] and [[Orthodox Christians]]. The slaughter of Lebanese and Palestinian Arab Christians at the hands of Muslims, initiated the first Lebanese migration to El Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://newsvideo.su/video/10798241|title=Why So Many Palestinians Live in el Salvador &amp;#124; AJ+}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inter-ethnic marriage in the Lebanese community with Salvadorans, regardless of religious affiliation, is very high; most have only one father with Lebanese nationality and mother of Salvadoran nationality. As a result, some of them speak Arabic fluently. But most, especially among younger generations, speak Spanish as a first language and Arabic as a second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theidentitychef.com/2009/09/06/lebanese-diaspora-worldwide-geographical-distribution|title=Lebanese Diaspora Worldwide Geographical Distribution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war between [[Israel]] and [[Lebanon]] in 1948 and during the [[Six Day War]], thousands of Lebanese left their country and went to El Salvador. First they arrived at La Libertad, were they comprised half of the economic activity of immigrants.

Lebanon had been an iqta of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Although the imperial administration, whose official religion was Islam, guaranteed freedom of worship for non-Muslim communities, and Lebanon in particular had a semi-autonomous status, the situation for practitioners of the [[Maronite Catholic Church]] was complicated, since they had to cancel exaggerated taxes and suffered limitations for their culture. These tensions were expressed in a rebellion in 1821 and a war against the Druze in 1860. The hostile climate caused many Lebanese to sell their property and take ships in the ports of [[Sidon]], [[Beirut]] and [[Tripoli]] heading for the Americas.

Statistically in El Salvador, there are about 120,000 Arabs, of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], [[Syrian]], [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] and [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] ancestry. In the case of these Arab-Salvadorans, although not all the families arrived together, they were the ones that lead the economy in the country.

In 1939, the Arab community based in San Salvador organized and founded the &quot;Arab Youth Union Society&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2004-03-21-0403210538-story,amp.html|title=El Salvador vote divides 2 Arab clans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pardo Salvadoran===
[[Pardo]] is the term that was used in colonial El Salvador to describe a tri-racial Afro-Mestizo person of Indigenous, European, and African descent. [[Afro-Salvadoran]]s are the descendants of the African population that were enslaved and shipped to El Salvador to work in mines in specific regions of El Salvador. They have mixed into and were naturally bred out by the general Mestizo population, which is a combination of a Mestizo majority and the minority of Pardo people, both of whom are racially mixed populations. Thus, there remains no significant extremes of African physiognomy among Salvadorans like there is in the other countries of Central America. A total of only 10,000 African slaves were brought to El Salvador over the span of 75 years, starting around 1548, about 25 years after El Salvador's colonization. El Salvador is the only country in Central America that does not have English Antillean (West Indian) or Garifuna populations of the Caribbean, but instead had older colonial African slaves that came straight from Africa. This is the reason why El Salvador is the only country in Central America not to have a caribbeanized culture, and instead preserved its classical Central America culture.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Demographic profile===
El Salvador is the smallest and most densely populated country in Central America. It is well into its demographic transition, experiencing slower population growth, a decline in its number of youths, and the gradual aging of its population. The increased use of family planning has substantially lowered El Salvador's fertility rate, from approximately 6 children per woman in the 1970s to replacement level today. A 2008 national family planning survey showed that female sterilization remained the most common contraception method in El Salvador - its sterilization rate is among the highest in Latin America and the Caribbean - but that the use of injectable contraceptives is growing. Fertility differences between rich and poor and urban and rural women are narrowing.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;
