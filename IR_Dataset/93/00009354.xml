The '''Egyptian Armed Forces''' are the state military organisation responsible for the defense of [[Egypt]]. They consist of the [[Egyptian Army]], [[Egyptian Navy]], [[Egyptian Air Force]] and [[Egyptian Air Defense Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/02/14/egypt.military.facts/index.html|title=Egypt's military: Key facts|last=Staff|first=By the CNN Wire|access-date=2017-04-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All branches, forces, armies, regions, bodies, organs and departments of the Armed Forces are under the command of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, who is at the same time the [[Ministry of Defence and Military Production|Minister of Defense]]. Only the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, [[President of Egypt|President of the Republic]], [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi|Abdel Fattah El-Sisi]] is currently in the leadership. The [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]] (SCA) is composed of 23 members, chaired by the [[Ministry of Defence and Military Production|Commander-in-Chief and Minister of Defense]], and is represented by the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces. Commanders of military areas ([[Central Military Region (Egypt)|central]], [[Central Military Region (Egypt)|northern]], [[Western Military Region (Egypt)|western]], [[Southern Military Region (Egypt)|southern]]), heads of bodies ([[Military Operations Authority (Egypt)|operations]], [[Armed Forces Arming Authority (Egypt)|armament]], [[Armed Forces Logistics Authority (Egypt)|logistics]], [[Armed Forces Engineering Authority (Egypt)|engineering]], [[Armed Forces Training Authority (Egypt)|training]], [[Armed Forces Finance Authority (Egypt)|finance]], [[Military justice (Egypt)|military justice]], [[Armed Forces Management and Administration (Egypt)|Armed Forces Management and Administration]]), directors of my departments (officers and [[Military Intelligence and Reconnaissance (Egypt)|Military Intelligence and Reconnaissance]]), and assistant secretary of defense for constitutional and legal affairs -The Secretary of the Board He is the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense.

The armament of the Egyptian armed forces varies between eastern and western sources through mutual military cooperation with several countries, led by the United States, Russia, France, China, Italy, Ukraine and Britain. Many of the equipment is manufactured locally at Egyptian factories. The Egyptian armed forces celebrate their anniversary on October 6 each year to commemorate the victories of the October War.

In addition, Egypt maintains 397,000 [[paramilitary]] troops.{{sfn|IISS|2019|p=336}} The [[Central Security Forces]] comes under the control of the [[Ministry of Interior (Egypt)|Ministry of Interior]]. The Border Guard Forces falls under the control of the [[Ministry of Defense (Egypt)|Ministry of Defense]].

The modern Egyptian armed forces have been involved in numerous crises and wars since independence, from the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]], [[Suez Crisis]], [[North Yemen Civil War]], [[Six-Day War]], [[Nigerian Civil War]], [[War of Attrition]], [[Yom Kippur War]], [[1977 Egyptian bread riots|Egyptian bread riots]], [[1986 Egyptian conscripts riot]], [[Libyan–Egyptian War]], [[Gulf War]], [[War on Terror]], [[Egyptian Crisis (2011–present)|Egyptian Crisis]], [[Second Libyan Civil War]], [[Military intervention against ISIL|War on ISIL]] and the [[Sinai insurgency]].

==Overview==
The [[President of Egypt|President of the Republic]] serves as Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. The Minister of Defense and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, the senior uniformed officer, is [[Egyptian Army ranks|Colonel General]] [[Mohamed Ahmed Zaki|Mohamed Zaki]] (since June 2018),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.gov.eg/ModWebSite/MODL.aspx|title=Minister of Defense|author=|date=|website=www.mod.gov.eg}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Chief of Staff is [[Egyptian Army ranks|Lieutenant General]]. {{ill|Mohammed Farid Hegazy|ar|محمد فريد حجازي}} (since October 2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.gov.eg/ModWebSite/COSL.aspx|title=Chief of Staff|author=|date=|website=www.mod.gov.eg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equipment from the [[Soviet Union]] is being progressively replaced by more modern U.S., French, and British equipment, a significant portion of which is built under license in Egypt, such as the [[M1 Abrams]] [[tank]]. Egypt is a participant in NATO's [[Mediterranean Dialogue]] forum. Egypt is one of the few countries in the [[Middle East]], and the only Arab state, with a [[reconnaissance satellite]] and has launched another one,  [[EgyptSat 1]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1167467733037&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title=Egypt to launch first spy satelllite|newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|accessdate=2009-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Armed Forces enjoy considerable power and independence within the Egyptian state.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Cambanis|first=Thanassis|title=Succession Gives Army a Stiff Test in Egypt|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/world/middleeast/12egypt.html?_r=1&amp;ref=global-home&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=11 September 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also influential in business, engaging in road and housing construction, consumer goods, resort management,&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT 2011&quot; /&gt; and own vast tracts of real estate. A significant amount of military information is not made publicly available, including budget information, the names of the general officers and the military’s size (which is considered a state secret).&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT 2011&quot; /&gt; According to journalist Joshua Hammer, &quot;as much as 40% of the Egyptian economy&quot; is controlled by the Egyptian armed forces,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/aug/18/egypt-who-calls-shots/ Egypt: Who Calls the Shots?] Joshua Hammer| nybooks.com| 18 August 2011| (free online article not complete, does not include quoted portion)&lt;/ref&gt; and other authoritative works such as Springborg reinforce this trend.

Senior members of the military can convene the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]], such as during the course of the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]], when President Mubarak resigned and transferred power to this body on February 11, 2011.&lt;ref name=wt&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/feb/11/crowds-rejoice-egypts-mubarak-steps-down/ |author=Murdock, Heather |title=Crowds rejoice as Egypt’s Mubarak steps down, hands power to military| newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]| date=February 11, 2011| accessdate=February 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth century history===
In the early 1950s, politics rather than military competence was the main criterion for promotion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Varble, Derek, p. 17&quot;&gt;Varble, Derek (2003) 'Essential Histories: The Suez Crisis 1956' p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian commander, Field Marshal [[Abdel Hakim Amer]], was a purely political appointee who owed his position to his close friendship with Nasser. He would prove himself grossly incompetent as a general during the [[Suez Crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;Varble 2003, Pollack 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Rigid lines between officers and men in the Egyptian Army led to a mutual &quot;mistrust and contempt&quot; between officers and the men who served under them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Varble, Derek, p. 18&quot;&gt;Varble, Derek (2003) p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Tsouras writes that the Israelis &quot;seized and held the ..initiative throughout the campaign and quickly destroyed the Egyptian defenses.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tsouras, 1994, 127&quot;&gt;Tsouras, 1994, 127.&lt;/ref&gt; In a few instances, such as at the [[Mitla Pass]] and [[Battle of Abu-Ageila (1956)|Abu Aghelia]], Egyptian defenses were well-organised and stubbornly held, but this did not make enough difference overall. Nasser ordered a retreat from the Sinai which allowed the Israelis to wreak havoc and drive on the Canal; on 5 November British and French parachute landings began in the Canal Zone; but by 7 November U.S. pressure had forced an end to the fighting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tsouras, 1994, 127&quot;/&gt;

Before the June 1967 War, the army divided its personnel into four regional commands (Suez, Sinai, Nile Delta, and Nile Valley up to the Sudan).&lt;ref&gt;John Keegan, ''World Armies'', Second Edition, MacMillan, 1983, p.165 {{ISBN|978-0-333-34079-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder of Egypt's territory, over 75%, was the sole responsibility of the Frontier Corps.

In May 1967, [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] closed the [[Straits of Tiran]] to passage of Israeli ships.&lt;ref name=DupuyEV228&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=MacDonald and Jane's|isbn=0-356-08090-0 |last=Dupuy|first=Trevor N.|title=Elusive Victory: The Arab-Israeli Wars, 1947–1974|page=228 |location=London |year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel considered the closure of the straits grounds for war and prepared their armed forces to attack.&lt;ref name=DupuyEV228 /&gt; On June 3, three battalions of Egyptian commandos were flown to Amman to take part in operations from Jordan. But U.S. historian [[Trevor N. Dupuy]], writing in 1978, argues from King Hussein of Jordan's memoirs that Nasser did not intend to start an immediate war, but instead was happy with his rhetorical and political accomplishments of the past weeks.&lt;ref&gt;T.N. Dupuy, 1978, 229–230, citing Hussein, ''My &quot;War&quot; with Israel'', 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Israel felt it needed to take action.

The Egyptian army then comprised two armoured and five infantry divisions, all deployed in the Sinai.&lt;ref name=TsourasE94&gt;Tsouras, 'Changing Orders,' Facts on File, 1994, 191. Dupuy (1978) lists the 2nd, 3rd, 7th Infantry Division, 6th Mechanised, 20th Palestinian, and 4th Armoured, plus an armoured task force. Dupuy, 239–240.&lt;/ref&gt; In the weeks before the [[Six-Day War]] began, Egypt made several significant changes to its military organisation. Field Marshal Amer created a new command interposed between the general staff and the Eastern Military District commander, Lieutenant General [[Salah ad-Din Muhsin]].&lt;ref name=PollackAW60&gt;Pollack, 2002, 60.&lt;/ref&gt; This new Sinai Front Command was placed under General [[Abdel Mohsin Murtagi]], who had returned from Yemen in May 1967. Six of the seven divisions in the Sinai (with the exception of the [[20th Infantry Division (Egypt)|20th Infantry 'Palestinian' Division]]) had their commanders and chiefs of staff replaced. What fragmentary information is available suggests to authors such as Pollack that Amer was trying to improve the competence of the force, replacing political appointees with veterans of the Yemen war.&lt;ref name=PollackAW60 /&gt;

After the war began on 5 June 1967, Israel attacked Egypt, destroyed its air force on the ground, and occupied the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. The forward deployed Egyptian forces were shattered in three places by the attacking Israelis. Field Marshal Amer, overwhelmed by events, and ignoring previous plans, ordered a retreat by the Egyptian Army to the Suez Canal.&lt;ref&gt;Dupuy, 1978, 267–9.&lt;/ref&gt; This developed into a rout as the Israelis harried the retreating troops from the ground and from the air.

Scholars such as [[Kenneth Pollack]], deAtkine, and Robert Springborg have identified a number of reasons why Arab (and Egyptian) armies performed so poorly against Israel from 1948 to 1991 and afterwards. In battle against Israel from 1948–91, junior officers consistently demonstrated an unwillingness to manoeuvre, ‘innovate, improvise, take initiative, or act independently’.&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, ''Arabs at War: Military Effectiveness, 1948–1991'', University of Nebraska Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-8032-3733-2}}, 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Ground forces units suffered from constant manipulation of information and an inattention to intelligence gathering and objective analysis. Units from the two divisions dispatched to Saudi Arabia in 1990–91, accompanied by U.S. personnel during the 1991 Gulf War, consistently reported fierce battles even though they actually encountered little or no resistance. This occurred whether or not they were accompanied by U.S. military personnel or journalists.&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, 2002, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Later researchers such as Springborg have confirmed that the tendencies identified in the 1980s and 1990s persist in the Armed Forces in the twenty-first century.&lt;ref&gt;Springborg, Robert. &quot;Learning from failure: Egypt.&quot; The Routledge Handbook of Civil-Military Relations. London: Routledge (2013): 93–109.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Army==
[[File:Egyptian Mi-8 Hip helicopters after unloading troops.jpg|thumb|Egyptian Mi-8 Hip helicopters after unloading troops]]
The inventory of the Egyptian armed forces includes equipment from the [[United States]], [[France]], [[Brazil]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Soviet Union]], and the [[People's Republic of China]]. Equipment from the Soviet Union is being progressively replaced by more modern U.S., French, and British equipment, a significant portion of which is built under license in Egypt, such as the [[M1 Abrams|M1A1 Abrams]] [[tank]].

Conscripts for the [[Egyptian Army]] and other service branches without a university degree serve three years as enlisted soldiers. Conscripts with a General Secondary School Degree serve two years as enlisted personnel. Conscripts with a university degree serve one year as enlisted personnel or three years as a reserve officer. Officers for the army are trained at the [[Egyptian Military Academy]].

==Air Force==
[[File:Egyptian Mirage 5 at Cairo-West 1985.JPEG|thumb|Egyptian Mirage 5 at Cairo-West 1985]]
The [[Egyptian Air Force]] (EAF) is the aviation branch of the Egyptian Armed Forces. Currently, the backbone of the EAF is the [[F-16]]. The [[Mirage 2000]] is the other modern interceptor used by the EAF. The Egyptian Air Force has 216 F-16s (plus 20 on order).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scramble.nl/military-database|title=Military Database - Scramble|website=www.scramble.nl|access-date=2019-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has about 579 combat aircraft and 149 armed helicopters as it continues to fly extensively upgraded [[MiG-21]]s, [[F-7 Skybolt]]s, [[F-4 Phantom]]s, [[Dassault Mirage V]]s, and the [[C-130 Hercules]] among other planes.
Egypt currently operates 11 Dassault Rafale a French twin-engine fighter aircraft as of July 2017 with another 24 on order.

[[File:Egyptian air force pilot.jpg|thumb|left|An Egyptian F16C Pilot]]

==Air Defense Forces==
The [[Egyptian Air Defense Forces]] or ADF (Quwwat El Diffaa El Gawwi in Arabic) is Egypt's military command responsible for air defense. Egypt patterned its Air Defense Force (ADF) after the [[Soviet Air Defence Force]], which integrated all its air defense capabilities – antiaircraft guns, rocket and missile units, interceptor planes, and radar and warning installations. It appears to comprise five subordinate divisions, 110 surface-to-air missile battalions, and 12 anti-aircraft artillery brigades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forces Armees Africaines 2016–2017|last=Touchard|first=Laurent|publisher=Laurent Touchard|year=2017|isbn=9781545499801|location=Paris|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personnel quality may be 'several notches below' that of the Air Force personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Touchard, 2017, 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its commander is [[Lieutenant General]] [[Abd El Aziz Seif-Eldeen]].

==Navy==
The [[Egyptian Navy]] was established after the [[Second World War]]. Some fleet units are stationed in the [[Red Sea]], but the bulk of the force remains in the Mediterranean. Navy headquarters and the main operational and training base are located at Ras el Tin near Alexandria.
The current commander is [[Vice Admiral]] Ahmed Khaled Hassan Saeed, who relieved [[Vice Admiral]] [[Mohab Mamish]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} The [[Chief of Staff]] of the Navy is Rear Admiral Mohamed Abdel Aziz El Sayed.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The Navy also controls the [[Egyptian Coast Guard]]. The Coast Guard is responsible for the onshore protection of public installations near the coast and the patrol of coastal waters to prevent smuggling. it has an inventory consisting of about thirty five large patrol craft (each between twenty and thirty meters in length) and twenty smaller Bertram-class coastal patrol craft built in the United States.

''See [[list of naval ships of Egypt]] for a list of vessels in service.''

==Arab Organization for Industrialization==
The [[Arab Organization for Industrialization]] supervises nine military factories which produce civilian goods as well as military products. Initially the owners of AOI were the governments of [[Egypt]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]], before the latter governments gave their shares back to Egypt in 1993, valued at $1.8 billion. AOI now is entirely owned by the government of Egypt. AOI has about 19,000 employees out of which are 1250 engineers. AOI fully owns 10 factories and shares in 2 joint ventures, plus the Arab Institute for Advanced Technology

==Military schools==

==Foreign military assistance==
The [[United States of America|U.S.]] provides annual military assistance to the Egyptian Armed Forces. In 2009, the U.S. provided [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal]] $1.3 billion to the Egyptian military (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1.3|2009|r=2}}}} billion in {{CURRENTISOYEAR}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;09CAIRO874&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikileaks.ch/cable/2009/05/09CAIRO874.html|title=Scenesetter: President Mubarak's visit to Washington|date=2009-05-19|publisher=US Department of State|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127035045/http://www.wikileaks.ch/cable/2009/05/09CAIRO874.html|archivedate=2011-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This level is second only to [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/ipad/nation-locked-in-a-deadly-stalemate/story-fn6ck51p-1225997761161|title=Nation locked in a deadly stalemate
