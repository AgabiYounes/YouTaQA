=== Internet censorship and surveillance ===

There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet or credible reports that the government monitors [[e-mail]] or Internet [[chat rooms]] without judicial oversight. Individuals and groups engage in the expression of views via the Internet, including by e-mail. Internet access is available in public places throughout the country.&lt;ref name=USDOS-ElSalvador-2012&gt;[https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2012&amp;dlid=204449 &quot;El Salvador&quot;], ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012'', Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 20 March 2013. Retrieved 12 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitution provides for [[freedom of speech]] and [[Freedom of the press|press]], and the government generally respects these rights. Individuals criticize the government publicly or privately without reprisal, and in most cases the government does not interfere with such criticism. In March 2012, Carlos Dada, the owner of online newspaper [[El Faro (digital newspaper)|El Faro]], received death threats from gang members. The gangs were unhappy with El Faro's reporting on the gang truce. On April 13, the [[International Press Institute]] criticized the government for not taking any actions to guarantee the safety of El Faro journalists. According to the Salvadoran Association of Journalists (APES), the media practices [[self-censorship]], especially in their reporting on gangs and narcotics trafficking. APES stated that many members of the media were afraid to report in detail on these subjects due to fear of retaliation from gangs and narcotics trafficking groups.&lt;ref name=USDOS-ElSalvador-2012/&gt;

The constitution prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence, and the government generally respects these prohibitions.&lt;ref name=USDOS-ElSalvador-2012/&gt;
