'''Dairy products''' or '''milk products''' are a type of [[food]] produced from or containing the [[milk]] of [[mammal]]s. They are primarily produced from mammals such as [[cattle]], [[water buffalo]]es, [[dairy goat|goats]], [[domestic sheep|sheep]], [[camel]]s and [[human]]s. Dairy products include [[food]] items such as [[yogurt]], [[cheese]] and [[butter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/centers-institutes/sullivan/ourservices/patients/nutrition101/Dairy/|title=Dairy {{!}} Clemson University, South Carolina|website=www.clemson.edu|access-date=2016-11-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231075653/http://www.clemson.edu/centers-institutes/sullivan/ourservices/patients/nutrition101/Dairy/|archive-date=31 December 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://authoritynutrition.com/is-butter-dairy/ |title=Is Butter a Dairy Product, and Does it Contain Lactose? |date=2016-07-01 |newspaper=Authority Nutrition |language=en-US |access-date=2016-11-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128171255/https://authoritynutrition.com/is-butter-dairy/ |archive-date=28 January 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A facility that produces dairy products is known as a [[dairy]], or dairy factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dairy |title=Definition of DAIRY |website=www.merriam-webster.com |access-date=2016-10-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030001827/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dairy |archive-date=30 October 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dairy products are consumed worldwide, with the exception of most of East and Southeast Asia and parts of central Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;fao&quot; /&gt;

[[Milk]] is produced after optional [[Homogenization (chemistry)|homogenization]] or [[pasteurization]], in several grades after standardization of the fat level, and possible addition of the bacteria ''Streptococcus lactis'' and ''Leuconostoc citrovorum.'' Milk can be broken down into several different categories based on type of product produced, including cream, butter, cheese, infant formula, and yogurt.

Milk varies in fat content. [[Skim milk]] is milk with zero fat, while [[whole milk]] products contain fat. 
{{div-col|colwidth=20em|content=
* [[Scalded milk]]
* [[Condensed milk]], milk which has been concentrated by evaporation, with sugar added for reduced process time and longer life in an opened can
* [[Evaporated milk]], (less concentrated than condensed) milk without [[added sugar]]
* [[Baked milk]] is milk simmered on low heat for long time which results in mild [[caramelization]]. Particularly popular in [[Eastern Europe]].
* [[Dulce de leche]]
* [[Malai]]
* [[Powdered milk]] (or milk powder), produced by removing the water from (usually skim) milk
* [[Khoa]], milk which has been completely concentrated by evaporation, used in [[Indian cuisine]]
* [[Infant formula]], dried milk powder with specific additives for feeding human infants
* High milk-fat and nutritional products (for infant formulas)
* [[Whey]], the liquid drained from curds and used for further processing or as a livestock feed
* [[Buttermilk]], the liquid left over after producing butter from cream, often dried as [[livestock]] feed
* [[Milk skin]]
Milk is an ingredient in many confectioneries. Milk can be added to chocolate to produce [[Milk Chocolate|Milk chocolate]].

== Health ==
Dairy products can cause problems for individuals who have [[lactose intolerance]] or a [[milk allergy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Lactose intolerance |url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/lactose-intolerance |website=Genetics Home Reference |date=2016-02-08 |access-date=2016-02-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125220304/http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/lactose-intolerance |archive-date=25 January 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Milk Allergy – Food Allergy Research &amp; Education |url=http://www.foodallergy.org/allergens/milk-allergy |website=www.foodallergy.org |access-date=2016-02-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208163510/http://www.foodallergy.org/allergens/milk-allergy |archive-date=8 February 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; People who experience lactose intolerance usually prefer to avoid milk and other lactose-containing dairy products, as they may cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, gas, and nausea. Milk treated to be lactose free offers an alternative.

Excessive consumption of dairy products can contribute significant amounts of [[cholesterol]] and saturated fat to the diet, which can increase the risk of heart disease, and cause other serious health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthyLiving/HealthyEating/Nutrition/Saturated-Fats_UCM_301110_Article.jsp#.V2JJUOxv5dg |title=Saturated Fat |accessdate=16 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616154955/http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthyLiving/HealthyEating/Nutrition/Saturated-Fats_UCM_301110_Article.jsp#.V2JJUOxv5dg |archive-date=16 June 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no excess cardiovascular risk with dietary calcium intake, but calcium supplements are associated with a higher risk of coronary artery [[calcification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson JJ, Kruszka B, Delaney JA, et al. |date=October 2016 |title=Calcium intake from diet and supplements and the risk of coronary artery calcification and its progression among older adults: 10-year follow-up of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) |journal=J Am Heart Assoc |volume=5 |issue=10 |page=e003815 |doi=10.1161/jaha.116.003815 |pmc=5121484 |pmid=27729333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumption of dairy products does not cause mucus production, and will not make cold or asthma symptoms worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pinnock |first1=CB |last2=Graham |first2=NM |last3=Mylvaganam |first3=A |last4=Douglas |first4=RM |title=Relationship between milk intake and mucus production in adult volunteers challenged with rhinovirus-2 |journal=The American Review of Respiratory Disease |volume=141 |issue=2 |pages=352–56 |date=1990 |pmid=2154152 |doi=10.1164/ajrccm/141.2.352}}&lt;/ref&gt; This widely held belief stems from some people mistaking the thin coat of residue left behind after consuming milk or ice cream for mucus.&lt;ref&gt;

== Consumption patterns worldwide ==
Rates of dairy consumption vary widely worldwide. High-consumption countries consume more than 150&amp;nbsp;kg per capita per year. These countries are: Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Costa Rica, most European counties, Israel, Kyrgyzstan, North America and Pakistan. Medium-consumption countries consume 30 to 150&amp;nbsp;kg per capita per year. These countries are: India, Iran, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Mongolia, New Zealand, North and Southern Africa, most of the Middle East, and most of Latin America and the Caribbean. Low-consumption countries consume under 30&amp;nbsp;kg per capita per year. These countries are: Senegal, most of Central Africa, and most of East and Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;fao&quot;&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, &quot;Dairy production and products: Milk and milk products&quot; [http://www.fao.org/agriculture/dairy-gateway/milk-and-milk-products/en/#.WBTleuErLdQ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027154749/http://www.fao.org/agriculture/dairy-gateway/milk-and-milk-products/en/#.WBTleuErLdQ |date=27 October 2016 }}&lt;!--text is almost verbatim from the source, but these are just lists of facts cf.

== Avoidance (non-health-related) ==
Some groups avoid dairy products for non-health-related reasons:

Religious – Some religions restrict or do not allow for the consumption of dairy products. For example, some scholars of [[Jain vegetarianism|Jainism]] advocate not consuming any dairy products because dairy is perceived to involve violence against cows.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiley 2004 p. 78&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Wiley |first=K.L. |title=Historical Dictionary of Jainism |publisher=Scarecrow Press |series=Historical Dictionaries of Religions, Philosophies, and Movements Series |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-8108-6558-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QCT-CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78 |access-date=15 April 2019 |page=78 |quote=In recent times, out of concern for the treatment of cows in commercial dairy farming, some Jains in the diaspora and in India now observe a vegan diet and discourage the use of dairy products in temple rituals.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orthodox [[Kosher|Judaism]] requires that meat and dairy products not be served at the same meal, served or cooked in the same utensils, or stored together, as prescribed in {{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|14:21}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://meat.tamu.edu/ansc-307-honors/kosher-halal/|title=Kosher and Halal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317103210/https://meat.tamu.edu/ansc-307-honors/kosher-halal/|archive-date=17 March 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vegans – [[Veganism]] is the avoidance of all animal products, including dairy products, most often due to the ethics regarding how dairy products are produced. The [[Ethics of eating meat|ethical reasons for avoiding meat]] and dairy products include how dairy is produced, how the animals are handled, and the environmental effect of dairy production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.dummies.com/food-drink/special-diets/dairy-free/ethical-reasons-to-give-up-dairy-products/ |title=Ethical Reasons to Give Up Dairy Products – dummies |newspaper=dummies |language=en-US |access-date=2017-01-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202005842/http://www.dummies.com/food-drink/special-diets/dairy-free/ethical-reasons-to-give-up-dairy-products/ |archive-date=2 February 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/my-year-of-eating-ethically-2013871.html |title=My year of eating ethically |date=2010-06-30 |newspaper=The Independent |language=en-GB |access-date=2017-01-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929000822/https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/my-year-of-eating-ethically-2013871.html |archive-date=29 September 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report of the United Nations’ [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] in 2010 the dairy sector accounted for 4 percent of global man-made greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-dairy-emissions-fao-idUSTRE63J2KG20100420|title=Dairy sector adds 4 percent to man-made emissions: FAO|date=2010-04-20|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-05-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/30/dining/climate-change-food-eating-habits.html|title=Your Questions About Food and Climate Change, Answered|last=Moskin|first=Julia|date=2019-04-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-05-10|last2=Plumer|first2=Brad|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|last3=Lieberman|first3=Rebecca|last4=Weingart|first4=Eden|last5=Popovich|first5=Nadja}}&lt;/ref&gt;
