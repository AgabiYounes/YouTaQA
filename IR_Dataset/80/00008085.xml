'''Delicate Arch''' is a {{convert|52|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} freestanding [[natural arch]] located in [[Arches National Park]], near [[Moab, Utah|Moab]] in [[Grand County, Utah|Grand County]], [[Utah]], United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;gnis&quot;&gt;{{gnis|1427330|Delicate Arch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;report&quot;&gt;{{cite report|url=https://nature.nps.gov/geology/parks/arch/arch_gre_rpt_view.pdf|title=Arches National Park: Geologic Resource Evaluation Report|website=nature.nps.gov|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|page=9|format=[[PDF]]|accessdate=10 Mar 2019|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128135456/https://nature.nps.gov/geology/parks/arch/arch_gre_rpt_view.pdf|archivedate=28 Jan 2017|via=[[Wayback Machine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arch is the most widely recognized [[landmark]] in Arches National Park and is depicted on [[Vehicle registration plates of Utah|Utah license plates]] and a [[postage stamp]] commemorating Utah's [[centennial]] anniversary of [[admission to the Union]] in 1996. The [[2002 Winter Olympics torch relay|Olympic torch relay]] for the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] passed through the arch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Olympic torch makes way into Utah for first time|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2002/news/2002/02/04/torch_utah_ap/|magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=4 Feb 2002|accessdate=4 Jul 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719224500/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2002/news/2002/02/04/torch_utah_ap/|archive-date=19 July 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Cloudy Sunset at Delicate Arch (8520706358).jpg|thumb|Delicate Arch and adjacent large [[panhole]] at sunset, February 2011]]
Because of its distinctive shape, the arch was known as &quot;the [[Chaps]]&quot; and &quot;the Schoolmarm's [[Bloomers (clothing)|Bloomers]]&quot; by local cowboys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Dfw39LEixkC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=delicate+arch+%22the+chaps%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XQxLDjz_Zo&amp;sig=hBC3Bfy7617HeyBvPhHzs1LoQbM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DPOCUsS5LZHdsASdj4DwAw&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=delicate%20arch%20%22the%20chaps%22&amp;f=false|last=Green|first=Stewart M.|title=Best Easy Day Hikes Moab|publisher=[[Globe Pequot Press]]|location=Guilford, Connecticut|page=84|isbn=0762767839|year=2011|accessdate=10 Mar 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other names have been applied to this arch including &quot;Bloomers Arch&quot;, &quot;Marys Bloomers&quot;, &quot;Old Maids Bloomers&quot;, &quot;Pants Crotch&quot;, &quot;Salt Wash Arch&quot;, and &quot;School Marms Pants&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gnis&quot;/&gt; The arch was given its current name by Frank Beckwith, leader of the Arches National Monument Scientific Expedition, who explored the area in the winter of 1933&amp;ndash;1934. Although there is a rumor that the names of Delicate Arch and [[Landscape Arch]] were inadvertently exchanged due to a signage mixup by the [[National Park Service]] (NPS), this is false.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman&quot;&gt;Hoffman, John F., ''Arches National Park''&lt;/ref&gt;

This arch played no part in the original designation of the area as a [[National monument (United States)|national monument]] (Arches National Monument) in 1929, and was not included within the original boundaries; it was added when the monument was enlarged in 1938.

In the 1950s, the NPS investigated the possibility of applying a clear [[plastic]] coating to the arch to protect it from further [[erosion]] and eventual destruction. The idea was ultimately abandoned as impractical and contrary to NPS principles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman&quot;/&gt;

==Geology==
Delicate Arch is formed of [[Entrada Sandstone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://3dparks.wr.usgs.gov:80/arches/html/3d001.html|title=USGS - Delicate Arch\website=usgs.gov|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=10 Mar 2019|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304203929/http://3dparks.wr.usgs.gov/arches/html/3d001.html|archivedate=4 March 2009|via=[[Wayback Machine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original sandstone fin was gradually worn away by weathering and erosion, leaving the arch. Other arches in the park were formed the same way but, due to placement and less dramatic shape, are not as famous.

==Ecology==
During the summer, [[white-throated swift]]s (''Aeronautes saxatalis'') nest in the top of the arch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viamagazine.com/weekenders/rock_art07.asp|title=Arches National Park: Here are six fun facts about Utahâ€™s famed Delicate Arch.|accessdate=10 Mar 2019|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208103015/http://www.viamagazine.com/destinations/arches-national-park|archivedate=8 Feb 2012|via=[[Wayback Machine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Nature photographer Michael Fatali started a fire under the arch in September 2000 to demonstrate nighttime photography techniques to a group of amateur photographers. The fire discolored portions of the sandstone near the arch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://photo.net/nature-photography-forum/001oMT|title=Fatali Pleads Guilty to All Charges|last=Vigh|first=Michael|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|location=Salt Lake City|date=8 Dec 2001|accessdate=10 Mar 2019|via=photo.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/878430/Photographer-admits-fire-role.html|title=Photographer admits fire role|last=Welling|first=Angie|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|publisher=[[Deseret Digital Media]]|location=Salt Lake City|date=7 Dec 2001|accessdate=10 Mar 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatali was placed on probation and fined $10,900 in restitution to the NPS for the cost of cleanup efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/02/us/national-briefing-rockies-utah-sentence-for-burning-arch.html|title=National Briefing: Rockies: Utah: Sentence For Burning Arch|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=New York City|date=2 Feb 2002|accessdate=10 Mar 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, climber [[Dean Potter]] performed as many as six [[Free solo climbing|free solo ascents]] of the arch. Climbing Delicate Arch was not explicitly forbidden under the rules in force at the time which only stated that routes &quot;may be closed&quot; on any named arch; however, most climbers accepted that the named arch formations should not be climbed. The NPS has since closed the loophole by disallowing climbs on any named arch within the park year-round. [[Slacklining]] and the placement of new fixed anchors on new climbs is also prohibited.&lt;ref name=Neville&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/climbing/rock-climbing/How-Delicate-Was-Dean-.html|title=How Delicate Was Dean?|last=Neville|first=Tim|website=outsideonline.com|publisher=Outside Integrated Media, LLC|date=1 Jun 2006|accessdate=10 Mar 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy ensued when photographs taken after Potter's climb appeared to show damage caused by a climbing technique called [[Top rope climbing|top roping]]. Potter stated on several occasions that he never damaged the arch, and no photos exist of Potter using a top rope setup on the arch. Previous climbers may have top-roped the arch, leaving the existing rope scars.&lt;ref name=Neville/&gt; Potter did admit to using a counterweighted rope over the top of the arch, within a natural groove,&lt;ref&gt;[[Patagonia (clothing)|Patagonia]] and Dean Potter (June 8, 2006). [https://www.outsideonline.com/1828261/official-statement-patagonia-and-dean-potter-delicate-arch-climb &quot;Official Statement from Patagonia and Dean Potter on the Delicate Arch Climb&quot;]. ''outsideonline.com''. Retrieved January 2, 2020.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as four [[Spring-loaded camming device|cams]] in a horizontal crack of harder rock at the summit. He used the rope and cams for protection while rehearsing his free solo route, and to rappel back down after the free solos. Two fellow climbers also ascended via fixed ropes, one of whom recorded video of Potter from the top.&lt;ref name=Neville/&gt;
