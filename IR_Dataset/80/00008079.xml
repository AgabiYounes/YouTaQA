After watching the documentary on the making of ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969), he began making films at age eight with an [[8mm film|8mm camera]].&lt;ref name=&quot;playboy2014&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;biography.com&quot; /&gt; He said:{{Quote|text=I was eight years old and I saw a documentary on the making of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. It had never occurred to me that movies didn’t take place in real time. I knew that they were fake, I knew that the people were acting, but it had never occurred to me that it could take, good God, four months to make a movie! It showed the entire company with all these rental horses and moving trailers to shoot a scene on top of a train. They would hire somebody who looked like [[Robert Redford]] to jump onto the train. It never occurred to me that there were hours between each of these shots. The actual circus of it was invisible, as it should be, but in seeing that I became obsessed with the idea of “How?” It was the ultimate magic trick. The notion that 24 still photographs are shown in such quick succession that movement is imparted from it — wow! And I thought that there would never be anything that would be as interesting as that to do with the rest of my life.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot;/&gt;}}In his teens, Fincher moved to [[Ashland, Oregon]], where he attended [[Ashland High School (Oregon)|Ashland High School]]. He directed plays and designed sets and lighting after school, and was a non-union projectionist at a second-run movie theater, as well as a production assistant at the local television news station, [[KOBI]] in [[Medford, Oregon]]. He supported himself by working as a [[Busser|busboy]], dishwasher and fry cook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://guru.bafta.org/david-fincher-a-life-in-pictures |title=David Fincher: A Life in Pictures |publisher=[[BAFTA]] |date=September 19, 2014 |accessdate=August 17, 2015 |archivedate=August 13, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813010645/http://guru.bafta.org/david-fincher-a-life-in-pictures |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1992–2000: Breakthrough===
In 1990, [[20th Century Fox]] hired Fincher to replace [[Vincent Ward (director)|Vincent Ward]] as the director for the [[Science fiction|science-fiction]] horror ''[[Alien 3]]'' (1992), his film directorial debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Pearce | first=Garth | date=1991 | title=Alien3: Set Visit To A Troubled Sequel | magazine=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] | url=http://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1102 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703222946/http://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1102 | archive-date=July 3, 2015 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the third installment in the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' franchise]] starring [[Sigourney Weaver]]; the film was released in May 1992 to a mixed reception from critics and was considered weaker than the preceding films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alien3 (1992)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/alien3/|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=August 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011050729/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/alien3/|archive-date=October 11, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; During production, Fincher was hampered by disagreements from the film studio over the budget and screenplay. [[Peter Travers]] of the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' calls the film, &quot;bold and haunting&quot;, despite the &quot;struggle of nine writers&quot; and &quot;studio interference&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-reviews/alien-3-103327/|title=Alien 3|last=Travers|first=Peter|last2=Travers|first2=Peter|date=1992-09-09|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190506194541/https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-reviews/alien-3-103327/|archive-date=May 6, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the film received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 65th Academy Awards (1993) Nominees and Winners|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1993|publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS)|accessdate=August 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402004418/http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1993|archive-date=April 2, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Fincher publicly expressed his dismay. In the book ''Director's Cut: Picturing Hollywood in the 21st Century'', Fincher blames the producers for their lack of trust in him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Stephan|last=Littger|title=Director's Cut: Picturing Hollywood in the 21st Century |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Academic]] |location=London, England|isbn=978-0826419026 |date=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2009, he stated, &quot;No one hated it more than me; to this day, no one hates it more than me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Salisbury|first1=Mark|last2=Fincher|first2=David|title=Transcript of the Guardian interview with David Fincher at BFI Southbank|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/03/david-fincher-interview-transcript|website=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=August 27, 2016|date=January 18, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160922204519/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/03/david-fincher-interview-transcript|archive-date=September 22, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this critical disappointment, Fincher eschewed from reading film scripts or directing another project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taubin&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Taubin |first=Amy |title=The Allure of Decay |work=[[Sight and Sound]] |page=24 |date=January 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; He briefly retreated back to directing commercials and music videos, including the video for the song &quot;[[Love Is Strong]]&quot; by [[The Rolling Stones]] in 1994, which won the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video|Best Music Video]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trenholm|first1=Richard|title=David Fincher returns to his Vogue-ing video days in new comedy|url=http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/david-fincher-returns-to-his-vogue-ing-video-days-in-new-comedy/|website=[[CNET]]|accessdate=August 27, 2016|date=May 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920125425/http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/david-fincher-returns-to-his-vogue-ing-video-days-in-new-comedy/|archive-date=September 20, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly, Fincher decided to make a foray back into film. He read [[Andrew Kevin Walker]]'s original screenplay for ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' (1995), which had been revised by [[Jeremiah Chechik]], the director attached to the project at one point.

The films were released on the internet in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2016/09/clive-owen-the-driver-bmw-films-neill-blomkamp-short-film-the-escape-1201728682/|title=Clive Owen Returns as 'The Driver' in Neill Blomkamp's Short Film 'The Escape' – Watch Trailer|last=Calvario|first=Liz|last2=Calvario|first2=Liz|date=2016-09-20|website=IndieWire|language=en|access-date=2020-01-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411160407/https://www.indiewire.com/2016/09/clive-owen-the-driver-bmw-films-neill-blomkamp-short-film-the-escape-1201728682/|archive-date=April 11, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next in 2002, Fincher returned to another feature film, a thriller titled ''[[Panic Room]]''. The story follows a single mother ([[Jodie Foster]]) and her daughter ([[Kristen Stewart]]) who hide in a safe room of their new home, during a [[home invasion]] by a trio, played by [[Forest Whitaker]], [[Dwight Yoakam]], and ''Fight Club'' collaborator [[Jared Leto]]). [[Principal photography]] took place between January and November 2001.

Five years after ''Panic Room'', Fincher returned on March 2, 2007 with ''[[Zodiac (film)|Zodiac]]'', a thriller based on [[Robert Graysmith]]'s books about the search for the [[Zodiac Killer|Zodiac]], a real life serial murderer who terrorized communities between the late 1960s and early 1970s. Fincher first learnt of the project after being approached by producer [[Bradley J. Fischer|Brad Fischer]]; he was intrigued by the story due to his childhood personal experience. &quot;The highway patrol had been following our school buses&quot;, he recalled. His father told him, &quot;There’s a serial killer who has killed four or five people... who’s threatened to... shoot the children as they come off the bus.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/18/movies/18halb.html|title=David Fincher - Zodiac - Movies|last=Halbfinger|first=David M.|date=2007-02-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-01-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190611122441/https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/18/movies/18halb.html|archive-date=June 11, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; After extensive research on the case with fellow producers, Fincher formed a principal cast of [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], [[Mark Ruffalo]], [[Robert Downey, Jr.]], [[Anthony Edwards]] and [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]].

In 2008, Fincher was attached to a film adaptation of the science-fiction novel, ''[[Rendezvous with Rama]]'' by [[Arthur C. Clarke]].

In 2011, Fincher followed the success of ''The Social Network'' with ''[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011 film)|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]'', a psychological thriller based on the novel by Swedish writer [[Stieg Larsson]]''.'' Fincher worked closely with screenwriter [[Steven Zaillian]] to analyze the novel and develop the film adaptation. Featuring [[Daniel Craig]] as journalist [[Mikael Blomkvist]] and [[Rooney Mara]] as [[Lisbeth Salander]], it follows Blomkvist's investigation to solve what happened to a woman from a wealthy family who disappeared four decades prior. To maintain the novel's setting, the film was primarily shot in Sweden. The soundtrack, composed by collaborators Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, was described by [[A. O.

}}Fincher's filmmaking process always begin with extensive research and preparation, although he said the process is different every time. &quot;I enjoy reading a script that you can see in your head, and then I enjoy the casting and I enjoy the rehearsal, and I enjoy all the meetings about what it should be, what it could be, what it might be&quot;, he said.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esquire.com/features/ESQ0307fincher|title=The Curious Case of David Fincher|last=Mockenhaupt|first=Brian|date=2007-03-01|website=Esquire|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103063604/http://www.esquire.com/features/ESQ0307fincher|archive-date=November 3, 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fincher admits he has autocratic tendencies and likes to micro-manage every part of the production.&lt;ref name=&quot;:10&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:11&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/apr/24/artsfeatures2|title=Film: Interview with David Fincher|last=Brooks|first=Xan|date=2002-04-24|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-15|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200115142240/https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/apr/24/artsfeatures2|archive-date=January 15, 2020|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; “He was always a rebel... Always challenging the status quo,” colleague [[Sigurjón Sighvatsson|Sigurjon Sighvatsson]] said.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt;

Known for his meticulous eye for detail and perfectionist qualities, Fincher performs thorough research when casting actors to ensure their suitability for the part. &quot;He's really good at finding the one detail that was missed. He knows more than anybody&quot;, said colleague Max Daly. &quot;He's just scary smart, sort of smarter than everyone else in the room&quot;, said producer [[Laura Ziskin]]. In addition, the director approaches editing like &quot;intricate mathematical problems&quot;. ''Zodiac'' editor, [[Angus Wall]], said it was like &quot;putting together a [[Swiss made|Swiss]] watch... All the pieces are so beautifully machined. He's incredibly specific. He never settles. And there's a purity that shows in his work.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt;

When working with actors, Fincher demands a grueling retake after retake to capture a scene perfectly.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:14&quot; /&gt; For instance, the ''Zodiac'' cast-members were required to do an upward of seventy takes for certain scenes, much to the displeasure of Jake Gyllenhaal.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt; Rooney Mara had to endure ninety-nine takes for a scene in ''The Social Network,'' and says that the director enjoys challenging people.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://movieline.com/2010/04/30/rooney-mara-david-fincher-made-me-do-99-takes-of-a-single-social-network-scene/|title=Rooney Mara: David Fincher Made Me Do 99 Takes of a Single Social Network Scene|date=2010-04-30|website=Movieline|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190619234356/http://movieline.com/2010/04/30/rooney-mara-david-fincher-made-me-do-99-takes-of-a-single-social-network-scene/|archive-date=June 19, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gone Girl'' averaged fifty takes per scene.

Some actors appreciate this approach, arguing that the subtle adjustments have a big difference in the way a scene is carried. Others have been critical however, &quot;[Fincher] wants puppets. He doesn't want actors that are creative&quot;, said [[R. Lee Ermey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2013/10/producer-says-david-fincher-is-averaging-50-takes-per-scene-shooting-gone-girl-248969/|title=Producer Says David Fincher Is Averaging 50 Takes Per Scene Shooting 'Gone Girl'|last=Jagernauth|first=Kevin|last2=Jagernauth|first2=Kevin|date=2013-10-24|website=IndieWire|language=en|access-date=2020-01-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191112165238/https://www.indiewire.com/2013/10/producer-says-david-fincher-is-averaging-50-takes-per-scene-shooting-gone-girl-248969/|archive-date=November 12, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt;

Fincher said, &quot;Handheld has a powerful psychological stranglehold. It means something specific and I don’t want to cloud what’s going on with too much meaning.&quot; He has also experimented with the disembodied camera movement, notably in ''Panic Room'', where the camera glides around the house to give the impression of surveillance by an unseen observer.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt;

=== Style and themes ===
One element of Fincher's visual style is the specific way in which he uses [[Tilt (camera)|tilt]], [[Panning (camera)|pan]] and [[Match moving|track]] in the camera movements. When a character is in motion or expressing emotions, the camera moves at the exact same speed and direction as their body. The movements are choreographed precisely between the actors and camera operators. The resulting effect helps the audience connect with the character to understand their feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/10/16634700/david-fincher-camera-movement|title=How the director of The Social Network makes his movies look like games|last=Kuchera|first=Ben|date=2017-11-10|website=Polygon|language=en|access-date=2020-01-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813210322/https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/10/16634700/david-fincher-camera-movement|archive-date=August 13, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/david-fincher-movies-video-essay/|title=Watch: Video Essay Breaks Down How David Fincher's Camera Work Connects You to His Characters|last=Foutch|first=Haleigh|date=2017-10-20|website=Collider|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200108142430/https://collider.com/david-fincher-movies-video-essay/|archive-date=January 8, 2020|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in his music videos, Fincher appreciated that the visuals should enhance the listening experience. He would [[Film editing|cut]] around the vocals, and let the choreography finish before cutting the shot.

Over the course of his career, the director has displayed a sense of loyalty to his performers and production crew. As a music video director, he collaborated with Paula Abdul five times, and Madonna and Rick Springfield four times each. Once he made the transition to feature films, he cast Brad Pitt in three of them. &quot;On-screen and off-screen, Brad's the ultimate guy... He has such a great ease with who he is&quot;, Fincher remarked.&lt;ref name=&quot;:11&quot; /&gt; [[Bob Stephenson (actor)|Bob Stephenson]], [[Christopher John Fields]], Jared Leto and [[Richmond Arquette]] have also appeared in at least two of his films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thefilmexperience.net/blog/2014/10/7/familiar-faces-the-david-fincher-players.html|title=Familiar Faces: The David Fincher Players - Blog - The Film Experience|website=thefilmexperience.net|language=en|access-date=2020-01-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191230220208/http://thefilmexperience.net/blog/2014/10/7/familiar-faces-the-david-fincher-players.html|archive-date=December 30, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fight Club'' was scored by [[Dust Brothers|The Dust Brothers]], who at that point had never scored for a film.
