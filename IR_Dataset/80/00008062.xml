'''''{{lang|de|Deutsches Institut für Normung e.V.}}''''' ('''DIN'''; in [[English language|English]], the '''German Institute for Standardization''') is the [[Germany|German]] national organization for [[standardization]] and is the German [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] member body. DIN is a German [[Civil registry|Registered]] [[Voluntary association|Association]] (''[[Eingetragener Verein|e.V.]]'') headquartered in [[Berlin]]. There are currently around thirty thousand DIN [[Technical standard|Standard]]s, covering nearly every field of technology.

== History ==
Founded in 1917 as the ''{{lang|de|Normenausschuß der deutschen Industrie}}''&lt;!-- szlig is old German spelling --&gt; (NADI, &quot;Standardization Committee of German Industry&quot;), the NADI was renamed ''{{lang|de|Deutscher Normenausschuß}}''&lt;!-- szlig is old German spelling --&gt; (DNA, &quot;German Standardization Committee&quot;) in 1926 to reflect that the organization now dealt with standardization issues in many fields; viz., not just for industrial products. In 1975 it was renamed again to ''{{lang|de|Deutsches Institut für Normung}}'', or 'DIN' and is recognized by the German{{Specify|date=January 2020}} government as the official national-standards body, representing German interests at the international and [[Europe]]an levels.

The [[acronym]], 'DIN' is often incorrectly expanded as ''{{lang|de|Deutsche Industrienorm}}'' (&quot;German Industry Standard&quot;). This is largely due to the historic origin of the DIN as &quot;NADI&quot;. The NADI indeed published their standards as ''{{lang|de|DI-Norm}}'' (''{{lang|de|Deutsche Industrienorm}}''). For example, the first published standard was '{{lang|de|DI-Norm 1}}' (about [[tapered pin]]s) in 1918. Many people still mistakenly associate DIN with the old ''{{lang|de|DI-Norm}}'' naming convention.

One of the earliest, and probably the best known, is [[DIN 476]] &amp;mdash; the standard that introduced the [[ISO 216#A series|A-series]] [[paper size]]s in 1922 &amp;mdash; adopted in 1975 as International Standard [[ISO 216]]. Common examples in modern technology include [[DIN connector|DIN]] and [[mini-DIN]] connectors for electronics, and the [[DIN rail]].

==DIN standard designation==
The designation of a DIN [[Technical standard|standard]] shows its origin (# denotes a number):
* ''DIN #'' is used for German standards with primarily domestic significance or designed as a first step toward international status. ''E DIN #'' is a draft standard and ''DIN V #'' is a preliminary standard.
*''DIN EN #'' is used for the German edition of European standards.
*''DIN ISO #'' is used for the German edition of ISO standards.
*''DIN EN ISO #'' is used if the standard has also been adopted as a European standard.

==Examples of DIN standards==
