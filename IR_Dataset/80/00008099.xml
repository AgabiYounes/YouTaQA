'''David Eric Grohl''' (born on January 14, 1969) is an American musician, singer, songwriter and director. He is best known for being the longest-serving drummer for [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] from late 1990 to early 1994. When Nirvana disbanded following the [[suicide of Kurt Cobain]] he became the founder, lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist and primary songwriter of the rock band [[Foo Fighters]]. Grohl is also the drummer and co-founder of the rock [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Them Crooked Vultures]], and wrote the music and performed all the instruments for his short-lived side projects [[Pocketwatch (album)|Late!]] and [[Probot]]. He has also recorded and toured with [[Queens of the Stone Age]].

Grohl established himself as a highly appreciated drummer with Nirvana and in 2014 was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] alongside bandmates [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Krist Novoselic]] in the group's first year of eligibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rockhall.com/blog/post/2014-rock-hall-induction-ceremony-special-guests/|title=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Announces Special Guests for the 29th Annual Induction Ceremony at Barclays Center &amp;#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|date=|publisher=Rockhall.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413130632/https://rockhall.com/blog/post/2014-rock-hall-induction-ceremony-special-guests/|archivedate=April 13, 2014|url-status=dead|accessdate=May 20, 2014|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Grohl was described by Ken Micallef, co-author of the book ''Classic Rock Drummers'', as one of the most influential rock musicians of the previous 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Micallef|first=Ken|year=2010|title=Dave Grohl|journal=[[Modern Drummer]]|pages=34, 42–46, 48–49, 51, 53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Grohl was seven, his parents divorced,&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/sep/14/popandrock.foofighters|title=Interview: 'I've never gotten off on chaos'|first=Keith|last=Cameron|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location=London, UK|date=September 14, 2007|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he subsequently grew up with his mother. At the age of 12, he began learning to play guitar. He grew tired of lessons and instead taught himself, and he eventually began playing in bands with friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grohl- drummerworld&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=azerrad148&gt;{{cite book|last=Azzerrad|first=Michael|title=Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana|publisher=Doubleday|year=1993|page=148|isbn=0-385-47199-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that age, &quot;I was going in the direction of faster, louder, darker while my sister, Lisa, three years older, was getting seriously into new wave territory.

Tracy introduced them to [[punk rock]] by taking the pair to shows by a variety of punk bands. His first concert was [[Naked Raygun]] at [[The Cubby Bear]] in Chicago in 1982 when he was 13 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ganz|first=Jacob|title=Dave Grohl: How To Make An Arena Feel Like A Punk Club|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2011/04/07/133965436/dave-grohl-how-to-make-an-arena-feel-like-a-punk-club?|work=The Record|publisher=National Public Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grohl recalled, &quot;From then on we were totally punk. We went home and bought ''[[Maximumrocknroll]]'' and tried to figure it all out.&quot;&lt;ref name=azerrad148/&gt;

In Virginia, Grohl attended [[Thomas Jefferson High School (Alexandria, Virginia)|Thomas Jefferson High School]] as a freshman. He was elected vice president of his freshman class and in that capacity would manage to play bits of songs by punk bands like [[Circle Jerks]] and [[Bad Brains]] over the school intercom before his morning announcements. Grohl's mother decided that he should transfer to [[Bishop Ireton High School]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] because his [[cannabis]] use was negatively impacting his grades. He stayed there for two years, beginning with a repeat of his first year. After his second year, he transferred yet again to [[Annandale High School]].&lt;ref name=azerrad148/&gt; While in high school, Grohl played in several local bands, including a stint as guitarist in a band called Freak Baby. It was during this period that Grohl taught himself to play drums.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grohl- drummerworld&quot;/&gt; When Freak Baby kicked out its bass player, Grohl decided to switch to drums. The reconstituted band renamed themselves Mission Impossible.&lt;ref name=azerrad148/&gt;

In a 2013 interview with Sam Jones, Grohl mentioned he didn't take drumming lessons and instead learned from &quot;listening to [[Rush (band)|Rush]] records and Punk Rock.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=theoffcamerashow|title=Dave Grohl Proves You Don't Need Lessons to Rock|date=2013-07-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixo-MQ0u6SA&amp;feature=youtu.be|access-date=2019-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dave mentions drummer [[Neil Peart]] and Rush's 2112 album as early influences: &quot;When I got '2112' when I was eight years old, it f***ing changed the direction of my life. I heard the drums. It made me want to become a drummer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rttnews.com/2103300/dave-grohl-says-he-cried-after-meeting-rush-s-neil-peart.aspx|title=Dave Grohl Says He Cried After Meeting Rush's Neil Peart|website=RTTNews|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his developing years as a drummer, Grohl cited [[John Bonham]] as his greatest influence, and eventually had Bonham's [[Led Zeppelin IV#Cover|three-rings symbol]] tattooed on his wrist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/dave-grohl-reveals-tales-behind-his-trio-of-led-zeppelin-tattoos-20091116|title=Dave Grohl Reveals Tales Behind His Trio of Led Zeppelin Tattoos|journal=Rolling Stone|date=November 16, 2009|accessdate=June 17, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617173202/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/dave-grohl-reveals-tales-behind-his-trio-of-led-zeppelin-tattoos-20091116|archive-date=June 17, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mission Impossible later rebranded themselves Fast before breaking up, after which Grohl joined the [[hardcore punk]] band Dain Bramage in December 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;comcast.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.comcast.net/~gravityboy/bramage/history.html |title=History  |accessdate=2011-07-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116235125/http://home.comcast.net/~gravityboy/bramage/history.html |archivedate=2012-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dain Bramage ended in March 1987 when Grohl quit without any warning to join [[Scream (band)|Scream]].,&lt;ref name=&quot;comcast.net&quot;/&gt; having produced the ''I Scream Not Coming Down'' LP. Many of Grohl's early influences were at the [[9:30 Club]], a live music venue in [[Washington, D.C.]] He said, &quot;I went to the 9:30 Club hundreds of times. I was always so excited to get there, and I was always bummed when it closed. I spent my teenage years at the club and saw some shows that changed my life.&quot;&lt;ref name=freedom&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/16/AR2010041602110.html|title=Welcome to the Club: An oral history of D.C.'s 9:30 club on its 30th anniversary|date=April 18, 2010|work=[[The Washington Post|Washington Post Magazine]]|accessdate=August 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grohl said in an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', &quot;They don't understand that when I was 15 and had ''[[Zen Arcade]]'', that's when I decided that I loved this music. For me to do anything else for the sole reason of doing something different would be so contrived.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/21/foo-fighters-dave-grohl-rocks-backpages-nirvana-1995-everett-true|title=The Guardian: Foo Fighters Dave Grohl: 'The fuck I'm going to become a drummer-for-hire'|date=May 21, 2014|accessdate=February 8, 2015|last=True|first=Everett|website=theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
=== Scream (1986–1990) ===
{{Main|Scream (band)}}
[[File:Dave Grohl 1989.jpg|thumb|left|Grohl with Scream in 1989]]
At age 17, Grohl auditioned with local DC favorites [[Scream (band)|Scream]] to fill the vacancy left by the departure of drummer [[Kent Stax]]. In order to be considered for the position, Grohl lied about his age, claiming he was older.&lt;ref&gt;Lynskey, Dorian. &quot;[http://www.fooarchive.com/features/arena2002.htm The Man Who Fell To Earth] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404004834/http://www.fooarchive.com/features/arena2002.htm |date=April 4, 2007 }}&quot;. ''Arena''. December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; To Grohl's surprise, the band asked him to join and so he dropped out of high school in his junior year. He has been quoted as saying, &quot;I was 17 and extremely anxious to see the world, so I did it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next four years, Grohl toured extensively with the band, recording a couple of live albums (their show of May 4, 1990 in Alzey, Germany being released by Tobby Holzinger as ''[[Your Choice Live Series Vol.10]]'') and two studio albums, ''[[No More Censorship]]'' and ''[[Fumble (album)|Fumble]]'', on which Grohl penned and sang vocals on the song &quot;Gods Look Down&quot;. During a Toronto stop on their 1987 tour, Grohl played drums at the [[Iggy Pop]] show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Now (newspaper)|Now]]|url=https://nowtoronto.com/news/fighters-kick-ass/|title=Fighters kick ass|date=24 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While playing in Scream, Grohl became a fan of the [[Melvins]] and eventually befriended the band. During a 1990 tour stop on the West Coast, Melvins' [[Buzz Osborne]] took a couple of his friends, [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Krist Novoselic]], to see the band.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Hannah [http://www.houstonpress.com/events/the-melvins-1334315/ &quot;The Melvins&quot;]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. houstonpress.com.

===Nirvana (1990–1994)===

[[File:Kurt St Thomas.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Grohl and [[Kurt Cobain|Cobain]] being interviewed by [[Kurt St. Thomas]] (right) in 1991]]
A few months later, Scream unexpectedly disbanded mid-tour following the departure of bassist Skeeter Thompson, who left to join [[The Four Horsemen (band)|The Four Horsemen]]. Grohl called Osborne for advice and Osborne informed him that Nirvana was looking for a drummer and gave Grohl the phone numbers of Cobain and Novoselic, who subsequently invited Grohl to Seattle to audition for Nirvana. Grohl soon joined the band full-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sproul|first=Kris|author2=Ziegler, Mike|title=Nirvana Live Guide – 1990|work=Nirvana Live Guide|url=http://www.nirvanaguide.com/1990.php|accessdate=April 13, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061122204611/http://www.nirvanaguide.com/1990.php|archive-date=November 22, 2006|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time that Grohl joined Nirvana, the band had already recorded several demos for the follow-up to their debut album ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]'', having spent time recording with producer [[Butch Vig]] in [[Wisconsin]]. Initially, the plan was to release the album on [[Sub Pop]], but the band received a great deal of interest based on the demos. Grohl spent the initial months with Nirvana traveling to various labels as the band shopped for a deal, eventually signing with [[DGC Records]]. In the spring of 1991, the band entered [[Sound City Studios]] in Los Angeles to record ''[[Nevermind]]'' (as seen in Grohl's 2013 documentary ''[[Sound City (film)|Sound City]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dave-grohl-butch-vig-grammy-adele-nirvana-289304|title=Grammys 2012: Dave Grohl and Butch Vig Reflect on Nirvana, Adele and the State of the Music Business (Q&amp;A)|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2019-05-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513112143/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dave-grohl-butch-vig-grammy-adele-nirvana-289304|archive-date=May 13, 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon its release, ''Nevermind'' (1991) exceeded all expectations and became a worldwide commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Drummer: 100 Years of Rhythmic Power and Invention|p=253|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4768-5589-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Grohl was compiling and recording his own material, which he released on a cassette called ''[[Pocketwatch (album)|Pocketwatch]]'' in 1992 on indie label Simple Machines. Rather than using his own name, Grohl released the cassette under the pseudonym &quot;Late!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters {{!}} Extended interview – Lollapalooza 2011|url=https://www.timeout.com/chicago/music/dave-grohl-of-foo-fighters-interview-lollapalooza-2011|work=[[Time Out Chicago]]|publisher=Time Out Group|accessdate=April 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424202757/https://www.timeout.com/chicago/music/dave-grohl-of-foo-fighters-interview-lollapalooza-2011|archive-date=April 24, 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later years of Nirvana, Grohl's songwriting contributions increased. In Grohl's initial months in Seattle, Cobain overheard him working on a song called &quot;Color Pictures of a Marigold&quot;, and the two subsequently worked on it together. Grohl would later record the song for the ''Pocketwatch'' cassette. Grohl stated in a 2014 episode of ''[[Foo Fighters: Sonic Highways]]'' that Cobain reacted by kissing him upon first hearing a demo of &quot;[[Alone + Easy Target]]&quot; that Grohl had recently recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/dave-grohl-opens-up-on-why-he-didnt-write-any-nirvana-songs|title=Dave Grohl opens up on why he didn't write any Nirvana songs|last=Louder|first=Briony Edwards2018-07-09T14:30:50Z|website=loudersound|language=en|access-date=2019-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the sessions for ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'', Nirvana decided to re-record &quot;Color Pictures of a Marigold&quot; released this version as a B-side on the &quot;[[Heart-Shaped Box]]&quot; single, titled simply &quot;Marigold&quot;. Grohl also contributed the main guitar riff for &quot;Scentless Apprentice&quot;. Cobain admitted in a late 1993 MTV interview that he initially thought the riff was &quot;kind of boneheaded&quot;, but was gratified at how the song developed (a process captured in part in a demo on the Nirvana box set ''[[With the Lights Out]]''). Cobain noted that he was excited at the possibility of having Novoselic and Grohl contribute more to the band's songwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/qa-dave-grohl-on-kurts-last-days-and-the-making-of-in-utero-2-108580/|title=Dave Grohl on Kurt's Last Days|last=Fricke|first=David|date=2013-09-24|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513113138/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/qa-dave-grohl-on-kurts-last-days-and-the-making-of-in-utero-2-108580/|archive-date=May 13, 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to their 1994 European tour, the band scheduled session time at [[Robert Lang Studios]] in Seattle to work on demos. For most of the three-day session, Cobain was absent, so Novoselic and Grohl worked on demos of their own songs. The duo completed several of Grohl's songs, including future [[Foo Fighters]] songs &quot;Exhausted&quot;, &quot;[[Big Me]]&quot;, &quot;February Stars&quot;, and &quot;Butterflies&quot;. On the third day of the session, Cobain finally arrived, and the band recorded a demo of a song later named &quot;[[You Know You're Right]]&quot;. It was the band's final studio recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6334646/nirvana-kurt-cobain-kissed-dave-grohl-after-hearing-foo-fighters-demo-sonic-highways|title=Nirvana's Kurt Cobain Kissed Dave Grohl After Hearing Foo Fighters Demo|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cobain, Novoselic and Grohl incarnation of Nirvana was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on April 10, 2014, 20 years after the death of Cobain.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

=== Foo Fighters (1994–present) ===
{{Main|Foo Fighters}}
Following Cobain's death in April 1994, Grohl retreated, unsure of where to go and what to do with himself. In October 1994, Grohl scheduled studio time, again at Robert Lang Studios, and quickly recorded a fifteen-track demo. With the exception of a single guitar part on &quot;X-Static&quot; played by [[Greg Dulli]] of [[the Afghan Whigs]], Grohl performed all of the instruments himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirby|first=David|title=Dave Grohl: From Antsy Student to Nirvana to Foo Fighters|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/books/review/this-is-a-call-the-life-and-times-of-dave-grohl-by-paul-brannigan-book-review.html|accessdate=March 26, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Grohl wondered if his future might be in drumming for other bands. In November, Grohl took a brief turn with [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], including a performance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Petty asked him to join permanently, but Grohl declined.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brannigan2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Brannigan|title=This Is a Call: The Life and Times of Dave Grohl|url=https://archive.org/details/thisiscalllifeti00bran_0|url-access=registration|accessdate=March 26, 2013|year=2011|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-81956-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/thisiscalllifeti00bran_0/page/236 236]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dave Grohl's Classic Rock Credentials|url=http://news.radio.com/2013/03/14/dave-grohl-classic-rock-credentials/|work=SnT Radio.com|accessdate=March 26, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317032726/http://news.radio.com/2013/03/14/dave-grohl-classic-rock-credentials/|archive-date=March 17, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also rumored as a possible replacement for [[Pearl Jam]] drummer [[Dave Abbruzzese]] and even performed with the band for a song or two at three shows during Pearl Jam's March 1995 Australian tour. However, by then, Pearl Jam had already settled on ex-[[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] drummer [[Jack Irons]], and Grohl had other solo plans in the works.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jam2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Pearl Jam|title=Pearl Jam Twenty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M89kbBxGK4MC&amp;pg=PA148|accessdate=March 26, 2013|date=September 13, 2011|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-6940-7|pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cross2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Cross|title=Pearl Jam: the secret history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ordeqqbm378C&amp;pg=PT28|accessdate=March 26, 2013|date=June 26, 2012|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-1-927002-19-3|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After passing the demo around, Grohl found himself with considerable major label interest. Nirvana's [[Artists and repertoire|A&amp;R]] rep [[Gary Gersh]] had subsequently taken over as president of [[Capitol Records]] and lured Grohl to sign with the label. Grohl did not want the effort to be considered the start of a solo career, so he recruited other band members: former Germs and touring Nirvana guitarist [[Pat Smear]] and two members of the recently disbanded [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], [[William Goldsmith]] (drums) and [[Nate Mendel]] (bass). Rather than re-record the album, Grohl's demo was given a professional mix by [[Rob Schnapf]] and [[Tom Rothrock]] and was released in July 1995 as Foo Fighters' [[Foo Fighters (album)|debut album]].

During a break between tours, the band entered the studio and recorded a cover of [[Gary Numan]]'s &quot;[[Down in the Park]]&quot;. In February 1996, Grohl and his then-wife Jennifer Youngblood made a brief [[cameo appearance]] on  ''[[The X-Files]]'' third-season episode &quot;[[Pusher (The X-Files)|Pusher]]&quot;.

After touring for the self-titled album for more than a year, Grohl returned home and began work on the soundtrack to the 1997 movie ''[[Touch (1997 film)|Touch]]''. Grohl performed all of the instruments and vocals himself, save for vocals from [[Veruca Salt]] singer [[Louise Post]] on the title track, keyboards by Barrett Jones (who also co-produced the record) on one track, and vocals and guitar by [[X (American band)|X's]] [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]] on &quot;This Loving Thing (Lynn's Song)&quot;. Grohl completed the recording in two weeks, and immediately joined Foo Fighters to work on their follow-up.

In the midst of the initial sessions for Foo Fighters' second album, tension emerged between Grohl and drummer William Goldsmith. According to Goldsmith, &quot;Dave had me do 96 takes of one song, and I had to do thirteen hours' worth of takes on another one. [...] It just seemed that everything I did wasn't good enough for him, or anyone else&quot;. Goldsmith also believed that Capitol and producer Gil Norton wanted Grohl to drum on the album.&lt;ref name=&quot;roberts&quot;&gt;Roberts, Michael. &quot;[http://bestof.miaminewtimes.com/1998-12-03/music/bring-back-that-sunny-day Bring Back that Sunny Day] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20090825182828/http://bestof.miaminewtimes.com/1998-12-03/music/bring-back-that-sunny-day |date=August 25, 2009 }}&quot;. ''Miami New Times''. December 3, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; With the album seemingly complete, Grohl headed home to Virginia with a copy of the rough mixes and found himself unhappy with the results. Grohl penned a few new songs, recording one of them, &quot;[[Walking After You]]&quot;, by himself at a studio in Washington, D.C. Inspired by the session, Grohl opted to move the band, without Goldsmith's knowledge,&lt;ref name=&quot;roberts&quot; /&gt; to Los Angeles to re-record most of the album with Grohl behind the kit. After the sessions were complete, Goldsmith officially announced his departure from the band.

Speaking in 2011 about the tension surrounding the departure of Goldsmith, Grohl explained that &quot;there were a lot of reasons it didn't work out, but there was also a part of [him] that was like, you know, [he doesn't] know if [he's] finished playing the drums yet&quot;. He also stated that he wished he had &quot;handled things differently&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWhsYINKcKM#t=2m56s|title=Oxegen 2011 – Foo Fighters Dave Grohl|publisher=YouTube|date=July 10, 2011|accessdate=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dave Grohl in London.jpg|thumb|upright|Grohl on stage in 2006]]
The effort was released in May 1997 as the band's second album, ''[[The Colour and the Shape]]'', which eventually cemented Foo Fighters as a staple of rock radio. The album spawned several hits, including &quot;[[Everlong]]&quot;, &quot;[[My Hero (song)|My Hero]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Monkey Wrench (song)|Monkey Wrench]]&quot;. Just prior to the album's release, former [[Alanis Morissette]] drummer [[Taylor Hawkins]] joined the band on drums. The following September, Smear (a close friend of Jennifer Youngblood) left the band,&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot; /&gt; citing a need to settle down following a lifetime of touring. Smear was subsequently replaced by Grohl's former [[Scream (band)|Scream]] bandmate [[Franz Stahl]]. Stahl was kicked out of the band prior to recording of Foo Fighters' third album&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot; /&gt; and was replaced by touring guitarist [[Chris Shiflett]], who later became a full-fledged member during the recording of ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]''.

Grohl's life of non-stop touring and travel continued with Foo Fighters' popularity. During his infrequent pauses he lived in [[Seattle]] and Los Angeles before returning to [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. It was there that he turned his basement into a recording studio where the 1999 album ''[[There Is Nothing Left to Lose]]'' was recorded.&lt;ref name=back&gt;{{cite video|author=[[James Moll|Moll, James]] (director)|title=[[Foo Fighters: Back and Forth|Back and Forth]]|year=2011|medium=documentary|publisher=RCA}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was recorded following the departure from Capitol and their former president Gary Gersh. Grohl described the recording experience as &quot;intoxicating at times&quot; because the band members were left completely to their own devices. He added, &quot;One of the advantages of finishing the record before we had a new label was that it was purely our creation. It was complete and not open to outside tampering.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/981242/0|journal=Billboard - The International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment|date=October 16, 1999|access-date=2016-09-25|title=Foo Fighters had 'Nothing To Lose'|

In 2000, the band recruited [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]] to add some guitar flourish to a cover of [[Pink Floyd]]'s &quot;[[Have a Cigar]]&quot;, a song which Foo Fighters previously recorded as a b-side. The friendship between the two bands resulted in Grohl and Taylor Hawkins being asked to induct Queen into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dave Grohl and Taylor Hawkins induct Queen|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/queen/transcript/dave-grohl-and-taylor-hawkins-/|work=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|accessdate=March 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grohl and Hawkins joined May and Queen drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] to perform &quot;[[Tie Your Mother Down]]&quot;, with Grohl&lt;!-- Grohl sang at the 2001 induction&amp;nbsp;– Hawkins did not sing the song until later performances. --&gt; standing in on vocals for [[Freddie Mercury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foo Fighters joined by Queen legends |url=http://www.nme.com/news/nme/23362 |work=[[NME]] |accessdate=March 29, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521043625/http://www.nme.com/news/nme/23362 |archivedate=May 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; May later contributed guitar work for the song &quot;Tired of You&quot; on the ensuing Foo Fighters album, as well as on an unreleased Foo Fighters song called &quot;Knucklehead&quot;.

Near the end of 2001, Foo Fighters returned to the studio to work on their fourth album. After four months in the studio, with the sessions finished, Grohl accepted an invitation to join [[Queens of the Stone Age]] and helped them to record their 2002 album ''[[Songs for the Deaf]]''. (Grohl can be seen drumming for the band in the video for the song &quot;[[No One Knows]]&quot;.) After a brief tour through North America, Britain and Japan with the band&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot; /&gt; and feeling rejuvenated by the effort, Grohl recalled the other band members to completely re-record their album at his studio in Virginia. The effort became their fourth album, ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]''. While initially pleased with the results, in another 2005 ''Rolling Stone'' interview, Grohl admitted to not liking the record: &quot;Four of the songs were good, and the other seven I never played again in my life. We rushed into it, and we rushed out of it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Scaggs, Austin. [https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7281787/foos_reclaim_their_honor &quot;Foos Reclaim Their Honor&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620004823/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7281787/foos_reclaim_their_honor |date=June 20, 2008 }}. Rolling Stone. April 29, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 23, 2002, Grohl achieved a historical milestone by replacing himself on the top of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Modern rock]] chart, when &quot;[[You Know You're Right]]&quot; by Nirvana was replaced by &quot;[[All My Life (Foo Fighters song)|All My Life]]&quot; by Foo Fighters. When &quot;All My Life&quot; ended its run, after a one-week respite, &quot;[[No One Knows]]&quot; by Queens of the Stone Age took the number one spot. Between October 26, 2002 and March 1, 2003 Grohl was in the number one spot on the Modern rock charts for 17 of 18 successive weeks, as a member of three different groups.

Grohl and Foo Fighters released their fifth album ''[[In Your Honor]]'' on June 14, 2005. Prior to starting work on the album, the band spent almost a year relocating Grohl's home-based Virginia studio to a brand new facility, dubbed [[Studio 606]], located in a warehouse near Los Angeles. Featuring collaborations with [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] of [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Josh Homme]] of [[Queens of the Stone Age]] and [[Norah Jones]], the album was a departure from previous efforts, and included one rock and one acoustic disc.

Foo Fighters' sixth studio album ''[[Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace]]'' was released on September 25, 2007. It was recorded during a three-month period between March 2007 and June 2007, and its release was preceded by the first single &quot;[[The Pretender (Foo Fighters song)|The Pretender]]&quot; on September 17. The second single, &quot;[[Long Road to Ruin]]&quot;, was released on December 3, 2007, followed by the third single, &quot;[[Let It Die (song)|Let It Die]]&quot;, on June 24, 2008.

On November 3, 2009, Foo Fighters released their first ''[[Greatest Hits (Foo Fighters album)|Greatest Hits]]'' collection, consisting of 16 tracks including a previously unreleased acoustic version of &quot;Everlong&quot; and two new tracks &quot;[[Wheels (Foo Fighters song)|Wheels]]&quot; and &quot;Word Forward&quot; which were produced by [[Nevermind]]'s producer [[Butch Vig]]. Grohl has been quoted saying the ''Greatest Hits'' is too early and &quot;... can look like an obituary&quot;. He does not feel they have written their best hits yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cochrane|first=Greg|title=Foo Fighters Best Of 'premature'|publisher=BBC|date=November 4, 2009|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/music/newsid_10000000/newsid_10002700/10002731.stm|accessdate=November 18, 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 12, 2015, while playing a show in Gothenburg, Sweden, Grohl fell off the stage, breaking his leg. He left temporarily and returned with a cast to finish the concert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/dave-grohl-breaks-leg-but-continues-to-rock-in-sweden-20150613|title=Dave Grohl Breaks Leg But Continues to Rock in Sweden|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=August 6, 2017|date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803213348/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/dave-grohl-breaks-leg-but-continues-to-rock-in-sweden-20150613|archive-date=August 3, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, the band cancelled the remainder of its European tour.  To avoid having to cancel the band's upcoming North American tour, Grohl designed a large &quot;elevated throne&quot; which would allow him to perform on stage with a broken leg.  The throne was unveiled at a concert on July 4, where Grohl used the stage's video screens to show the crowd video of him falling from the stage in Gothenburg as well as X-rays of his broken leg.&lt;ref name=&quot;USATodayRFK&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Snider |first=Mike |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/07/05/foo-fighters-washington-dc-july-4-festival/29730377/ |title=Foo Fighters finish off a rousing July 4 festival |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=July 5, 2015 |accessdate=July 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the show on July 4, the Foo Fighters began selling new tour merchandise rebranding the band's North American tour as the ''Broken Leg Tour''.&lt;ref name=&quot;USATodayRFK&quot; /&gt; Grohl later lent his throne to [[Axl Rose]] of [[Guns N' Roses]] after Rose suffered a similar injury on April 1, 2016, the band's first show with Slash and [[Duff McKagan]] in nearly 20 years.

== Musical projects and contributions ==
Apart from his main bands, Grohl has been involved in other music projects. In 1992, he played drums on [[Buzz Osborne]]'s [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]-styled solo-EP ''[[King Buzzo (EP)|King Buzzo]]'', where he was credited as ''Dale Nixon'', a pseudonym that [[Greg Ginn]] adopted to play bass on [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag's]] ''[[My War]]''. He also released the music cassette [[Pocketwatch (album)|Pocketwatch]] under the pseudonym ''Late!'' on the now defunct indie label, [[Simple Machines]].

In 1993, Grohl was recruited to help recreate the music of [[The Beatles]]' early years for the movie ''[[Backbeat (film)|Backbeat]];''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Full Cast and Credits for Backbeat (1994)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106339/fullcredits|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=March 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; he played drums in an &quot;all-star&quot; lineup that included [[Greg Dulli]] of [[the Afghan Whigs]], indie producer [[Don Fleming (musician)|Don Fleming]], [[Mike Mills]] of [[R.E.M.]], [[Thurston Moore]] of [[Sonic Youth]], and [[Dave Pirner]] of [[Soul Asylum]]. A music video was filmed for the song &quot;[[Money (That's What I Want)|Money]]&quot; while Grohl was with Nirvana on their 1994 European tour, footage of Grohl was filmed later and included.

Later in 1994, Grohl played drums on two tracks for [[Mike Watt]]'s ''[[Ball-Hog or Tugboat?]]''. In early 1995, Grohl and Foo Fighters played their first US tour, the [[&quot;Ring Spiel&quot; Tour ’95|Ring Spiel Tour]] both opening for Watt and playing with Eddie Vedder as Watt's supporting band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cohan |first=Brad |date=November 17, 2016 |title=The Time Mike Watt, Dave Grohl and Eddie Vedder Jammed Econo |url=https://observer.com/2016/11/the-time-mike-watt-dave-grohl-and-eddie-vedder-jammed-econo/ |work=The Observer |location= London|access-date=February 14, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:DaveGrohlphoto.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Grohl at the Roskilde Festival in 2005]]
During the early 2000s, Grohl spent time in his basement studio writing and recording a number of songs for a [[Heavy metal music|metal]] project. Over the span of several years, he recruited his favorite metal vocalists from the 1980s, including [[Lemmy]] of [[Motörhead]], [[Conrad Lant|Conrad &quot;Cronos&quot; Lant]] from [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[King Diamond]], [[Scott Weinrich]], Snake of [[Voivod (band)|Voivod]] and [[Max Cavalera]] of [[Sepultura]], to perform the vocals for the songs. The project was released in 2004 under the nickname [[Probot]].&lt;ref&gt;D'Angelo, Joe . &quot;[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1438589/20010129/foo_fighters.jhtml &quot;Dave Grohl Preps A 'Death Metal Supernatural' With Probot&quot;]&quot;.

Also in 2003, Grohl stepped behind the kit to perform on [[Killing Joke]]'s second [[Killing Joke (2003 album)|self-titled album]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grohl Gets Behind Killing Joke's 'Axis'|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/71643/grohl-gets-behind-killing-jokes-axis|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=March 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move surprised some Nirvana fans, given that Nirvana had been accused of stealing the opening riff of &quot;[[Come as You Are (Nirvana song)|Come as You Are]]&quot; from Killing Joke's 1984 song &quot;Eighties&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eighties – Killing Joke|last=Janovitz|first=Bill|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/eighties-mt0028575343|work=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|accessdate=March 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the controversy failed to create a lasting rift between the bands. Foo Fighters covered Killing Joke's &quot;Requiem&quot; during the late 1990s, and were even joined by Killing Joke singer [[Jaz Coleman]] for a performance of the song at a show in New Zealand in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vrenna|first=Carrie|title=Nirvana Pay Back Killing Joke|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/nirvana-pay-back-killing-joke-20030410|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=March 26, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608162836/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/nirvana-pay-back-killing-joke-20030410|archive-date=June 8, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2003, at the [[45th Annual Grammy Awards]], Grohl performed in an ad-hoc supergroup with [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Elvis Costello]], and [[Steven Van Zandt]] for a performance in tribute of then-recently deceased singer/guitarist [[Joe Strummer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZRn0dhGz7U |title=Joe Strummer Tribute-London Calling(2003 Grammys)|publisher=YouTube|date=June 14, 2006|accessdate=March 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Grohl and Tyler were there and performed to induct the band Rush to the Rock n Roll hall of fame.

Grohl lent his drumming skills to other artists during the early 2000s. In 2000, he played drums and sang on a track, &quot;Goodbye Lament&quot;, from [[Tony Iommi]]'s album ''[[Iommi (album)|Iommi]]''. In 2001, Grohl performed on [[Tenacious D]]'s debut album, and appeared in the video for lead single &quot;[[Tribute (song)|Tribute]]&quot; as a [[demon]]. He later appeared in the duo's 2006 movie ''[[Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny]]'' as the devil in the song &quot;[[The Pick of Destiny]]&quot;, and performed on its soundtrack. He also performed drums for their 2012 album ''[[Rize of the Fenix]]''.

== Equipment ==
[[File:Foo Fighters - Rock am Ring 2018-5601.jpg|thumb|right|Dave Grohl displaying his signature Gibson DG-335 guitar, a custom model based on the 1964-1971 Gibson Trini Lopez Standard.]]
Dave Grohl plays a large number of guitars, but his two primary guitars are both based on the [[Gibson ES-335]].  His primary recording guitar is an original cherry red Gibson [[Trini Lopez]] Standard that he bought in the early 1990s because he liked the look of the diamond-shaped holes.  His primary stage guitar is his signature model Pelham Blue Gibson DG-335, which was designed by Gibson based on the Trini Lopez Standard specs, but in a different color and with a stop tailpiece instead of the Trini Lopez's trapeze tailpiece.  He also has another signature guitar called the &quot;Memphis Dave Grohl ES-335&quot; in silver finish that is otherwise similar to the DG-335.  His primary acoustic guitar is a black Elvis Presley model [[Gibson Dove]].

Dave's drum kit, as designed by [[Drum Workshop]], features five different sized [[Tom-tom drum|toms]] ranging from 5x8 inches to 16x18 inches, a 19-inch crash [[cymbal]], two 20-inch crash cymbals, an 18-inch China cymbal, a 24-inch ride cymbal, and a standard [[bass drum|kick drum]], [[snare drum]], and [[hi-hat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DW Artist: Dave Grohl |url=http://www.dwdrums.com/grohl/ |website=Drum Workshop |accessdate=7 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
[[File:Dave Grohl - july 2008 2.jpg|thumb|Grohl in July 2008]]
Grohl married Jennifer Leigh Youngblood (born November 6, 1971), a photographer from [[Grosse Pointe, Michigan]], in 1994 and later divorced in 1997, after separating in December 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/sep/14/popandrock.foofighters|title='I've never gotten off on chaos'|first=Keith|last=Cameron|date=September 14, 2007|accessdate=August 6, 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 2, 2003, he married Jordyn Blum and they have three daughters: Violet Maye (born April 15, 2006), Harper Willow (born April 17, 2009) and Ophelia Saint (born August 1, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tan|first=Michelle|title=Rocker Dave Grohl: New Daughter is 'Loud as Hell'|work=People|date=April 21, 2009|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20273874,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Grohl was estimated to be the third wealthiest drummer in the world, behind [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Phil Collins]], with a fortune of $260&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Breihan|first=Tom|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1137282/the-30-richest-drummers-in-the-world/list/ |title=The 30 Richest Drummers in the World|publisher=Stereogum|date=August 28, 2012|accessdate=June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grohl doesn't read music and plays only by ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/nme-video/dave-grohl-talks-us-through-his-career---part-one/761332796001|title=Dave Grohl Talks Us Through His Career – Part One|work=[[NME]]|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advocacy, philanthropy and views ===
Grohl has been vocal in his views on drug misuse, contributing to a 2009 anti-drug video for the [[BBC]]. &quot;I have never done [[cocaine]], ever in my life. I have never done [[heroin]], I have never done [[speed (drug)|speed]],&quot; he said in a 2008 interview, adding that he stopped smoking [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and taking [[LSD]] at the age of 20. In the BBC video, he said, &quot;I've seen people die. It ain't easy being young, but that stuff doesn't make it any easier&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/8634675/Foo-Fighters-Dave-Grohl-kicks-brawler-out-of-Roundhouse-concert.html|title=Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl kicks brawler out of Roundhouse concert|accessdate=July 29, 2011|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=July 13, 2011|location=London|first=James|last=Lachno}}&lt;/ref&gt; However he is a well known coffee addict, and drinks on average 6 cups of coffee every morning. In 2009 he was admitted to a hospital with chest pains he experienced as a result of a [[caffeine]] overdose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/06/dave-grohl-neil-peart-coffee-addiction/|title=Dave Grohl on replacing Neil Peart and being addicted to coffee|date=June 29, 2018|website=Consequenceofsound.net|accessdate=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, Grohl sent a note of support to the two trapped miners in the [[Beaconsfield mine collapse]] in [[Tasmania]], Australia. In the initial days following the collapse one of the men requested an [[iPod]] with the Foo Fighters album ''[[In Your Honor]]'' to be sent down to them through a small hole. Grohl's note read, in part, &quot;Though I'm halfway around the world right now, my heart is with you both, and I want you to know that when you come home, there's two tickets to any Foos show, anywhere, and two cold beers waiting for yous&lt;!-- Grohl's written statement is an exact quote and should not be altered --&gt;. Deal?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereoboard.com/content/view/181/46/|last=Daniel|first=Troy|title=Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl Helps Trapped Miners|work=Stereoboard.com|date=May 9, 2006|access-date=June 25, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719195758/http://www.stereoboard.com/content/view/181/46/|archive-date=July 19, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006, one of the miners took up his offer, joining Grohl for a drink after a Foo Fighters acoustic concert at the [[Sydney Opera House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCabe|first=Kathy|url=https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/rocker-has-a-miner-problem/news-story/4bc6d99a40fb0d0789f5ae660a331b8d|title=Rocker has a miner problem|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)]]|date=October 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grohl wrote an instrumental piece for the meeting, which he pledged to include on the band's next album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1051091/foo-fighters-let-it-rip-on-sixth-album|title=Foo Fighters Let It Rip on Sixth Album|newspaper=Billboard|date=July 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song, titled &quot;Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners&quot;, appears on Foo Fighters' 2007 release ''[[Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace]]'', and features [[Kaki King]].

Grohl is an advocate for [[LGBT rights]]. He has worn a [[White Knot]] ribbon to various events to promote whiteknot.org. When questioned about the knot, he responded, &quot;You know what that's about? I believe in love and I believe in equality and I believe in marriage equality&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl: White Knot for Gay Marriage|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/98982/foo-fighters-dave-grohl-white-knot-for-gay-marriage|publisher=eonline|accessdate=February 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grohl's gay rights activism dates back to the early 1990s, when he and the other members of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] performed at a benefit to raise money to fight [[Oregon Ballot Measure 9 (1992)|Oregon Ballot Measure 9]]. &quot;Measure 9 goes against American traditions of mutual respect and freedom, and Nirvana wants to do their part to end bigotry and narrow-mindedness everywhere,&quot; the group stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nirvana sets benefit show in Portland for gay rights|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19920808&amp;id=LUVWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=h-oDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6669,1568864 |journal=[[The Register-Guard]] |date=August 8, 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ballot measure was ultimately defeated on November 3, 1992. Grohl has also participated in two counter-protests against the [[Westboro Baptist Church]] for their anti-gay stance, once by performing &quot;Keep It Clean&quot; on the back of a flatbed truck&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keepin it Clean in KC|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e5hRLbCaCs|website=YouTube|accessdate=November 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently by [[Rickrolling]] them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kreps|first1=Daniel|title=Watch Foo Fighters Rickroll Westboro Baptist Church|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/watch-foo-fighters-rickroll-westboro-baptist-church-20150823|accessdate=November 10, 2015|work=Rolling Stone|date=August 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824072141/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/watch-foo-fighters-rickroll-westboro-baptist-church-20150823|archive-date=August 24, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grohl is a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. He supported [[Barack Obama|President Barack Obama]], and performed &quot;[[My Hero (song)|My Hero]]&quot; in September at the [[2012 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gicas|first=Peter|url=http://uk.eonline.com/news/343756/dnc-preview-scarlett-johansson-foo-fighters-and-natalie-portman-expected-to-attend-tonight|title=DNC Preview: Scarlett Johansson, Foo Fighters and Natalie Portman Expected to Attend Tonight|work=eonline.com|date=September 6, 2012}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Honors ===
In August 2009, Grohl was given the [[Freedom of the City#Key to the City|key to the city]] of [[Warren, Ohio]] and performed the songs &quot;Everlong&quot;, &quot;Times Like These&quot;, and &quot;My Hero&quot;.

Dave Grohl's hometown of Warren, Ohio unveiled gigantic {{convert|409|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}} drumsticks in 2012 to honor him. According to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', the massive pair broke the [[Guinness Book of World Records|Guinness World Record]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Guinness World Record – Largest drumsticks|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/dave-grohls-massive-drumsticks-break-world-record-20120709|magazine=Rolling Stone Magazine|accessdate=July 22, 2015|date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150728054850/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/dave-grohls-massive-drumsticks-break-world-record-20120709|archive-date=July 28, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record-breaking drumsticks were shown to the public for the first time on July 7 during a concert at the Warren Amphitheater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Unveiling of the record-breaking drum sticks|url=http://rollingstone.co.za/musicrev/item/1114-dave-grohl-honoured-with-900-pound-drumsticks-by-hometown|magazine=Rolling Stone Magazine|accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 11, 2014, Grohl joined [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Zac Brown]] on stage at the Concert for Valor in Washington, D.C. to support U.S. troops and veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.spin.com/articles/bruce-springsteen-dace-grohl-fortunate-son-concert-of-valor-veteran%E2%80%99s-day/ |title=Bruce Springsteen and Dave Grohl Play Anti-War 'Fortunate Son' at Veterans Day Concert |date=November 12, 2014 |accessdate=February 8, 2015 |journal=Spin Magazine |last=Grebey |first=James |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150126061519/https://www.spin.com/articles/bruce-springsteen-dace-grohl-fortunate-son-concert-of-valor-veteran%E2%80%99s-day/ |archivedate=January 26, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grohl's first solo ''Rolling Stone'' cover story appeared on December 4, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-passion-of-dave-grohl-inside-rolling-stones-new-issue-20141119|title=The Passion of Dave Grohl: Inside Rolling Stone's New Issue|journal=Rolling Stone|accessdate=June 17, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624011746/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-passion-of-dave-grohl-inside-rolling-stones-new-issue-20141119|archive-date=June 24, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal issues ===
In 2000, while on tour with Foo Fighters in Australia, Grohl was arrested by Australian police while driving a scooter under the influence following a concert on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in Queensland. He was fined $400 and had his Australian driving permit revoked for three months. Following the incident, Grohl stated, &quot;So, people, I guess if there's anything to learn here, it's: don't drive after a few beers, even if you feel entirely capable like I did.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=January 31, 2000|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429030/20000131/foo_fighters.jhtml|title=Dave Grohl Nabbed For Down Under DUI|work=MTV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=February 3, 2000 |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429029/20000203/foo_fighters.jhtml|title=Dave Grohl Responds To DUI Charge|work=MTV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
