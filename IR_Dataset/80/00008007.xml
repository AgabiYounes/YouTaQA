[[File:Circle-withsegments.svg|thumb|200px|right|Circle with [[circumference]] (C) in black, diameter (D) in cyan, radius (R) in red, and centre or origin (O) in magenta.]]

In [[geometry]], a '''diameter''' of a [[circle]] is any straight [[line segment]] that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle. It can also be defined as the longest [[chord (geometry)|chord]] of the circle. Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a [[sphere]].

In more modern usage, the length of a diameter is also called the diameter. In this sense one speaks of ''the'' diameter rather than ''a'' diameter (which refers to the line segment itself), because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length, this being twice the [[radius]] '''r'''.

: &lt;math&gt;d = 2r \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = \frac{d}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

For a [[convex set|convex shape]] in the plane, the diameter is defined to be the largest distance that can be formed between two opposite [[parallel lines]] tangent to its boundary, and the ''width'' is often defined to be the smallest such distance. Both quantities can be calculated efficiently using [[rotating calipers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a [[curve of constant width]] such as the [[Reuleaux triangle]], the width and diameter are the same because all such pairs of parallel tangent lines have the same distance.

{{Anchor|Ellipse}}

For an [[ellipse]], the standard terminology is different. A diameter of an ellipse is any [[Chord (geometry)|chord]] passing through the center of the ellipse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Geometry/ConjugateDiameters.shtml|title=Conjugate Diameters in Ellipse|first=Alexander|last=Bogomolny|website=www.cut-the-knot.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[conjugate diameters]] have the property that a tangent line to the ellipse at the endpoint of one of them is parallel to the other one. The longest diameter is called the [[major axis]].

The word &quot;diameter&quot; is derived from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] διάμετρος (''diametros''), &quot;diameter of a circle&quot;, from διά (''dia''), &quot;across, through&quot; and μέτρον (''metron''), &quot;measure&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=diameter|title=diameter - Origin and meaning of diameter by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often abbreviated '''DIA''', '''dia''', '''d''', or '''⌀'''.

==Generalizations==
The definitions given above are only valid for circles, spheres and convex shapes. However, they are special cases of a more general definition that is valid for any kind of ''n''-dimensional convex or non-convex object, such as a [[hypercube]] or a set of scattered points. The '''diameter''' of a [[subset]] of a [[metric space]] is the [[supremum|least upper bound]] of the set of all distances between pairs of points in the subset. So, if ''A'' is the subset, the diameter is
:[[supremum|sup]] { d(''x'', ''y'') | ''x'', ''y'' ∈ ''A'' } .
If the [[distance function]] d is viewed here as having [[codomain]] '''R''' (the set of all [[real number]]s), this implies that the diameter of the [[empty set]] (the case {{nowrap|1=''A'' = ∅}}) equals −∞ ([[negative infinity]]). Some authors prefer to treat the empty set as a special case, assigning it a diameter equal to 0,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://at.yorku.ca/cgi-bin/bbqa?forum=ask_a_topologist_2004;task=show_msg;msg=0860.0002|title=Re: diameter of an empty set|website=at.yorku.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; which corresponds to taking the codomain of d to be the set of nonnegative reals.

For any solid object or set of scattered points in n-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], the diameter of the object or set is the same as the diameter of its [[convex hull]]. In medical [[Idiom#Parlance|parlance]] concerning a lesion or in geology concerning a rock, the diameter of an object is the supremum of the set of all distances between pairs of points in the object.

In [[differential geometry]], the diameter is an important global [[Riemannian geometry|Riemannian]] [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]].

In plane geometry, a diameter of a [[conic section]] is typically defined as any chord which passes through the conic's centre; such diameters are not necessarily of uniform length, except in the case of the circle, which has [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]]&amp;nbsp;''e''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

==Symbol==

The [[symbol]] or [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] for diameter, ⌀, is sometimes used in technical drawings or specifications as a prefix or suffix for a number (e.g. &quot;⌀ 55 mm&quot;, indicating that it represents diameter. For example, photographic [[filter thread]] sizes are often denoted in this way.

In [[German (language)|German]], the diameter symbol (German ''[[:de:Durchmesserzeichen|Durchmesserzeichen]]'') is also used as an [[average]] symbol (''Durchschnittszeichen'').

===Similar symbols===
It is [[Homoglyph|similar in size and design]] to [[ø]], the Latin small letter o with stroke. The diameter symbol ⌀ is distinct from the [[empty set]] symbol ∅, from an ([[italic script|italic]]) uppercase [[Phi (letter)|phi]] ''Φ'', and from the Nordic vowel [[Ø]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Unicode Explained|first=Jukka K.|last=Korpela|publisher=[[O'Reilly Media, Inc.]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-596-10121-3|pages=23–24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lxndiWaFMvMC&amp;pg=PA23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[slashed zero]]. 

===Encodings===
In [[Unicode]] it is defined as {{unichar|2300|Diameter sign|nlink=Miscellaneous Technical|html=}}. On an [[Apple, Inc.|Apple]] [[Macintosh]], the diameter symbol can be entered via the character palette (this is opened by pressing {{key press|Opt}}{{key press|Cmd}}{{key press|T}} in most applications), where it can be found in the Technical Symbols category.

The character will sometimes not display correctly, however, since many [[Typeface|font]]s do not include it. In many situations the letter ø (the Latin small letter o with stroke) is an [[typographic approximation|acceptable substitute]], which in Unicode is {{unichar|00F8|html=}}. It can be obtained in UNIX-like operating systems using a [[Compose key]] by pressing, in sequence, {{key press|[[Compose key|Compose]]}}{{key press|d}}{{key press|i}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libX11/plain/nls/en_US.UTF-8/Compose.pre |title=UTF-8 (Unicode) compose sequence |last=Monniaux |first=David |access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on a Macintosh by pressing {{key press|Opt}} {{key press|O}} (the letter [[o]], not the number [[0 (number)|0]]).

In [[Microsoft Word]] the diameter symbol can be acquired by typing 2300 and then pressing Alt+X.

In [[LaTeX]] the diameter symbol can be obtained with the command &lt;code&gt;\diameter&lt;/code&gt; from the wasysym package.
