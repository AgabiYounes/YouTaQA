Radio is the dominant medium; a handful of stations, including state-run [[Radio-Télévision nationale congolaise|Radio-Télévision Nationale Congolaise]] (RTNC), broadcast across the country. The [[United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|United Nations Mission]] (MONUSCO) and a Swiss-based NGO, Fondation Hirondelle, operate one of country's leading stations, [[Radio Okapi]]. The network employs mostly-Congolese staff and aims to bridge political divisions. [[Radio France Internationale]] (RFI), which is widely available on FM, is the most popular news station. The [[BBC]] broadcasts on FM in [[Kinshasa]] (92.7), [[Lubumbashi]] (92.0), [[Kisangani]] (92.0), [[Goma]] (93.3) and [[Bukavu]] (102.2).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13285760 &quot;Country profile: Democratic Republic of the Congo&quot;], ''BBC News'', 22 February 2012.
