'''Danish Defence''' ({{lang-da|Forsvaret}}, {{lang-fo|Danska verjan}}, {{lang-kl|Illersuisut}}) is the unified [[armed forces]] of the [[Denmark|Kingdom of Denmark]], charged with the defence of Denmark and its constituent, self-governing nations [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]. The Defence also promote Denmark's wider interests, support international [[peacekeeping]] efforts and provide [[humanitarian aid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mission&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author1=Defence Command Denmark|title=Mission and Objectives|url=https://www2.forsvaret.dk/eng/About/mission/Pages/Mission.aspx|website=Forsvaret.dk|accessdate=14 May 2018|date=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the creation of a standing military in 1510, the armed forces have seen action in many wars, most involving [[Sweden]], but also involving the world's [[great power]]s, including the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Great Northern War]], and the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

Today, Danish Defence consists of: the [[Royal Danish Army]], Denmark's principal [[land warfare]] branch; the [[Royal Danish Navy]], a [[blue-water navy]] with a fleet of 20 commissioned ships; and the [[Royal Danish Air Force]], an [[air force]] with an operational fleet consisting of both fixed-wing and rotary aircraft. The Defence also include the [[Danish Home Guard|Home Guard]]. Under the Danish Defence Law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=6294 | title = LOV nr 122 af 27/02/2001 om forsvarets formål, opgaver og organisation m.v. | accessdate = 2012-07-30 | language = Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Ministry of Defence (Denmark)|Minister of Defence]] serves as the commander of Danish Defence (through the [[Chief of Defence (Denmark)|Chief of Defence]] and the [[Defence Command (Denmark)|Defence Command]]) and the [[Danish Home Guard]] (through the [[Home Guard Command (Denmark)|Home Guard Command]]). [[De facto]] the Danish Cabinet is the commanding authority of the Defence, though it cannot mobilize the armed forces, for purposes that are not strictly defence oriented, without the consent of [[Parliament of Denmark|parliament]].

==History==
{{Expand section|date=October 2017}}
{{Main|Military history of Denmark}}
[[File:Chr 4 ved højen mast crop.jpg|thumb|left|Christian IV of Denmark on the ship ''Trefoldigheden'' during the Battle of Kolberger-Heide in 1644]]

===Origins===
The modern Danish military can be traced back to 1510, with the creation of the Royal Danish Navy. During this time, the Danish Kingdom held considerable territories, including [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Norway]], and [[Danish colonial empire|colonies in Africa and the Americas]].&lt;ref name=FVHis&gt;{{cite web|author1=Danish Defence|title=Danish Defence's History|url=http://www2.forsvaret.dk/viden-om/historie/forsvarets/Pages/Forsvarsministerietshistorie2.aspx|website=forsvaret.dk|accessdate=21 December 2016|date=3 February 2014|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the defeat in the [[Second Schleswig War]], the military became a political hot-button issue, with many wanting the disarm the military. 
Denmark managed to maintain its neutrality during the [[First World War]], with a relative strong military force. However, following the [[Interwar period]], a more pacifistic government came to power, decreasing the size of the military. This resulted in Denmark having a limited military, when Denmark was [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|invaded in 1940]].&lt;ref name=FVHis /&gt;
After [[World War II]], the different branches were reorganized, and collected under ''Danish Defence''. This was to ensure a [[Unity of command|unified command]] when conducting [[Joint warfare|joint operations]], as learned from the War.&lt;ref name=FVHis /&gt;

===Cold War and international engagements===
{{see also|Structure of the Danish Armed Forces in 1989|Scandinavian defence union}}
With the defeat in 1864, Denmark had adopted a policy of neutrality. This was however abandoned after World War Two, when Denmark decided to support the [[United Nations peacekeeping|UN peacekeeping forces]] and become a member of [[NATO]].&lt;ref name=FVHis /&gt; During the Cold War, Denmark began to rebuild its military and to prepare for possible attacks by the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Warsaw Pact]] allies. During this time Denmark participated in a number of UN peacekeeping missions including [[United Nations Emergency Force|UNEF]] and [[United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus|UNFICYP]].

Following the end of the Cold War, Denmark began a more active foreign policy, deciding to participate in international operations. This began with the participation in the [[Bosnian War]], where the [[Royal Danish Army]] served as part of the [[United Nations Protection Force]] and were in two skirmishes. This was the first time the Danish Army was a part of a combat operation since World War 2.&lt;ref name=nordbat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milhist.dk/post45/boellebank/boellebank_uk.htm |title=Operation ''Hooligan-bashing'' – Danish Tanks at War |first=Ole Kjeld |last=Hansen |year=1997 |accessdate=29 January 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523143221/http://www.milhist.dk/post45/boellebank/boellebank_uk.htm |archivedate=May 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.uta.edu/cpsees/yec-394.txt#prof |publisher= [[University of Texas at Arlington]] |title= Yugoslav events chronology |date= 17 March 2000 |accessdate= 29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 29, 1994, the [[Royal Danish Army]], while on an operation to relieve an observation post as part of the [[United Nations Protection Force]], the [[Jutland Dragoon Regiment]] came under artillery fire from the town of [[Kalesija]]. The [[United Nations Protection Force]] quickly returned fire and eliminated the artillery positions. On October 24, 1994, the [[Royal Danish Army]], while on an operation to reinforce an observation post in the town of [[Gradačac]], were fired upon by a [[T-54/T-55|T-55]] [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serb]] tank. One of the three Danish [[Leopard 1]] tanks experienced slight damage, but all returned fired and put the [[T-55]] tank out of action.

With the [[September 11 attacks]], Denmark joined US forces in the [[War on terror]], participating in both the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] and the [[Iraq War]]. In Afghanistan, 37 soldiers have been killed in various hostile engagements or as a result of friendly fire, and 6 have been killed in non-combat related incidents, bringing the number of Danish fatalities to 43,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icasualties.org/oef/Nationality.aspx?hndQry=Denmark |title=Operation Iraqi Freedom &amp;#124; Iraq &amp;#124; Fatalities By Nationality |publisher=iCasualties |date=2010-05-28 |accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Indland/2011/07/10/095336.htm |title=Dansk soldat er dræbt i Afghanistan |publisher=DR |date=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; being the highest loss [[per capita]] within the [[International Security Assistance Force|coalition forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Staff|title=Denmark Lost the Most Troops in Afghanistan|url=http://politiken.dk/udland/ECE649991/danmark-mister-flest-soldater-i-afghanistan/|website=politiken.dk|publisher=Politiken|accessdate=22 November 2016|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark has since participated in [[Operation Ocean Shield]], the [[2011 military intervention in Libya]] and the [[American-led intervention in the Syrian Civil War]].

==Purpose and task==
[[File:Combined Resolve III 141103-A-SG416-011.jpg|thumb|right|A Danish soldier at Combined Resolve III, 2014]]
The purpose and task of the armed forces of Denmark is defined in Law no. 122 of February 27, 2001 and in force since March 1, 2001. It defines three purposes and six tasks.

Its primary purpose is to prevent conflicts and war, preserve the [[sovereignty]] of Denmark, secure the continuing existence and integrity of the independent Kingdom of Denmark and further a peaceful development in the world with respect to human rights.

Its primary tasks are: [[NATO]] participation in accordance with the strategy of the alliance, detect and repel any sovereignty violation of Danish territory (including [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]), defence cooperation with non-NATO members, especially [[Central Europe|Central]] and East European countries, international missions in the area of conflict prevention, crises-control, humanitarian, peacemaking, peacekeeping, participation in ''Total Defence'' in cooperation with civilian resources and finally maintenance of a sizable force to execute these tasks at all times.

===Total defence===
Total Defence ({{lang-da|Totalforsvaret}}) is &quot;the use of all resources in order to maintain an organized and functional society, and to protect the population and values of society&quot;.&lt;ref name=Grundbog&gt;{{cite book |author1=Chief of the Army |authorlink1=Chief of the Royal Danish Army |title=Grundbog for hærens meninge |date=1972 |publisher=S. L. Møllers Bogtrykkeri |location=Copenhagen |url=http://fliphtml5.com/kyqx/wxtp/basic/ |accessdate=1 October 2018 |language=Danish |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved by combining the military, [[Home Guard (Denmark)|Home Guard]], [[Danish Emergency Management Agency]] and elements of the [[Police of Denmark|police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Friis |first1=Niels |title=Forsvarsforligets betydning for totalforsvaret |trans-title=The Defence Agreement's Effect on the Total Defence|url=https://krigsvidenskab.dk/forsvarsforligets-betydning-totalforsvaret |website=krigsvidenskab.dk |accessdate=19 June 2018 |language=Danish |date=1 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of total defence was created following Word War 2, where it was clear that the defence of the country could not only rely on the military, but there also need to be other measures to ensure a continuation of society.&lt;ref name=Grundbog/&gt; As a part of the Total Defence, all former conscripts can be recalled to duty, in order to serve in cases of emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Jydske Dragonregiment |title=Hærens Basis Uddnnelse |url=http://forsvaret.dk/JDR/Uddannelsesbataljonen/Forsvarets%20uddannelser/H%C3%A6rens%20Basis%20Uddannelse/Pages/default.aspx |website=forsvaret.dk |accessdate=1 October 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defence budget==
Since 1988, Danish defence budgets and security policy have been set by multi-year [[white paper]] agreements supported by a wide parliamentary majority including government and opposition parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Ministry of Defence |authorlink1=Ministry of Defence (Denmark) |title=Forsvarsforlig |url=http://www.fmn.dk/videnom/Pages/forsvarsforlig.aspx |website=fmn.dk |accessdate=9 November 2018 |language=Danish |date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, public opposition to increases in defence spending—during periods of economic constraints require reduced spending for social welfare — has created differences among the political parties regarding a broadly acceptable level of new defence expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nielsen |first1=Holger K. |authorlink1=Holger K. Nielsen |title=Nødvendigt at spare på forsvar |url=https://www.information.dk/debat/2011/12/noedvendigt-spare-paa-forsvar |website=information.dk |publisher=Dagbladet Information |accessdate=9 November 2018 |language=Danish |date=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest Defence agreement (&quot;[[Danish Defence Agreement 2018–23|Defence Agreement 2018–23]]&quot;) was signed 28 January 2018, and calls for an increase in spending, [[cyber security]] and capabilities to act in international operations and international stabilization efforts.&lt;ref name=2018-23&gt;{{cite web |author1=Ministry of Defence |authorlink1=Ministry of Defence (Denmark) |title=Agreement for Danish Defence 2018 - 2023 |url=http://www.fmn.dk/eng/allabout/Pages/danish-defence-agreement.aspx |website=fmn.dk |publisher=Ministry of Defence |accessdate=9 November 2018 |date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction speed is increased, with an entire [[brigade]] on standby readiness; the military retains the capability to continually deploy 2,000 soldiers in international service or 5,000 over a short time span. The standard mandatory [[Conscription in Denmark|conscription]] is expanded to include 500 more, with some of these having a longer service time, with more focus on national challenges.&lt;ref name=2018-23/&gt;

===Expenditures===
{{update|section|date=March 2016}}
In 2006 the Danish military budget was the fifth largest single portion of the Danish Government's total budget, significantly less than that of the [[Ministry of Social Affairs (Denmark)|Ministry of Social Affairs]] (≈110 billion [[Danish krone|DKK]]), [[Ministry of Economic and Business Affairs (Denmark)|Ministry of Employment]] (≈67 billion DKK), [[Ministry of the Interior and Health of Denmark|Ministry of the Interior and Health]] (≈66 billion DKK) and [[Ministry of Education of Denmark|Ministry of Education]] (≈30 billion DKK) and only slightly larger than that of the [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Denmark|Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation]] (≈14 billion DKK). This list lists the complete expenditures for the Danish [[Ministry of Defence of Denmark|Ministry of Defence]].

The Danish Defence Force, counting all branches and all departments, itself has an income equal to about 1&amp;ndash;5% of its expenditures, depending on the year. They are not deducted in this listing.

Approximately 95% of the budget goes directly to running the Danish military including the Home guard. Depending on year, 50&amp;ndash;53% accounts for payment to personnel, roughly 14&amp;ndash;21% on acquiring new material, 2&amp;ndash;8% for larger ships, building projects or infrastructure and about 24&amp;ndash;27% on other items, including purchasing of goods, renting, maintenance, services and taxes.

The remaining 5% is special expenditures to NATO, branch shared expenditures, special services and civil structures, here in including running the [[Danish Maritime Safety Administration]], [[Danish National Rescue Preparedness|Danish national rescue preparedness]] and the Administration of Conscientious Objectors ([http://militaernaegter.dk Militærnægteradministrationen]).

Because Denmark has a small and highly specialized military industry, the vast majority of Danish Defence's equipment is imported from NATO and the [[Nordic countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cms.polsci.ku.dk/pdf/dk_nato_omdoemme.pdf|title=Danmarks NATO omdømme|author=Jens Ringsmose|website=cms.polsci.ku.dk|date=November 2007|publisher=Dansk Institut for Militære Studier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women in the military==
[[File:First Danish Female Fighter Pilot Lt. Line Bonde with her T-38 Talon at Sheppard AFB, Texas.jpg|thumb|Lt. Line Bonde, the first female fighter pilot in the Royal Danish Air Force]]

Women in the military can be traced back to 1946, with the creation of ''Lottekorpset''. This corps allowed women to serve, however, without entering with the normal armed forces, and they were not allowed to carry weapons. In 1962, women were allowed in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Historisk tidslinje for ligebehandlings- og mangfoldighedstiltag i forsvaret |url=https://www2.forsvaret.dk/temaer/mangfoldighed/Documents/Historisk%20tidslinje%20for%20ligebehandlings%20og%20mangfoldighedstiltag%20i%20forsvaret.pdf |accessdate=1 October 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently 1,122 or 7.3% of all personnel in the armed forces are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Forsvarsministeriets Personalestyrelse |title=Kvinder i Forsvaret og Beredskabsstyrelsen |url=http://forpers.dk/hr/Pages/KvinderiForsvaret.aspx |website=forpers.dk |publisher=Danish Ministry of Defence |accessdate=1 October 2018 |language=Danish |date=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women do not have to serve conscription in Denmark, since 1998, it is however possible to serve under conscription-like circumstances; 17% of those serving conscription or conscription-like are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Forsvarsministeriets Personalestyrelse |title=Værnepligtige i Forsvaret og Beredskabsstyrelsen |url=http://forpers.dk/hr/Pages/Vaernepligtige.aspx |website=forpers.dk |publisher=Danish Ministry of Defence |accessdate=1 October 2018 |language=Danish |date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1991 and 31 December 2017, 1,965 women have been deployed to different international missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Forsvarsministeriets Personalestyrelse |title=Udsendte |url=http://forpers.dk/hr/Pages/Udsendte.aspx |website=forpers.dk |publisher=Danish Ministry of Defence |accessdate=1 October 2018 |language=Danish |date=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those 3 women have lost their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Danske militære tab i international tjeneste |url=http://www.fns-naestved.dk/Danske%20tab.htm |website=fns-naestved.dk |accessdate=1 October 2018 |language=Danish |date=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Police Constable Gitte Larsen, was killed in [[Hebron]] on the [[West Bank]]. In 2003, ''Overkonstabel'' Susanne Lauritzen was killed in a traffic accident in [[Kosovo]].

In 2005, [[Line Bonde]], became the first fighter pilot in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brøndum|first1=Christian|title=First Female Fighter Pilot|url=https://www.b.dk/nationalt/foerste-kvindelige-jagerpilot-fedt-at-det-blev-mig|website=Berlingske|publisher=Berlingske Media|accessdate=8 March 2018|date=6 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, [[Lone Træholt]] became the first female general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johansen|first1=Michelle Birch|title=Denmark Gets its First Female General|url=http://nyheder.tv2.dk/samfund/2016-09-30-historisk-danmark-har-faaet-sin-foerste-kvindelige-general|website=TV2.dk|publisher=TV2|accessdate=7 October 2016|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the only female general in the Danish armed forces until the army promoted [[Jette Albinus]] to the rank of brigadier general on 11 September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nyheder.tv2.dk/lokalt/2017-09-11-haeren-har-faaet-sin-foerste-kvindelige-general|title=Hæren har fået sin første kvindelige general|publisher=TV2|date=11 September 2017|accessdate=16 April 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 2018, the [[Royal Life Guards (Denmark)|Royal Life Guards]] was forced to lower the height requirements for women, as the Danish Institute of Human Rights decided it was discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=/ritzau/ |authorlink1=Ritzau |title=Livgarden sænker højdekrav for kvindelige gardere |url=https://www.berlingske.dk/samfund/livgarden-saenker-hoejdekrav-for-kvindelige-gardere |website=berlingske.dk |publisher=Berlingske Media |accessdate=1 October 2018 |language=Danish |date=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
