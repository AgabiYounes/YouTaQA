[[Denmark]] is a [[Nordic country]] located in [[Northern Europe]]. It consists of the [[Jutland]] peninsula and several islands in the [[Baltic sea]], referred to as the [[List of islands of Denmark|Danish Archipelago]]. Denmark is located southwest of Sweden and due south of Norway and is bordered by the German state (and former possession) [[Schleswig-Holstein]] to the south, on Denmark's only land border, 68 kilometers (42 miles) long.

Denmark borders both the Baltic and [[North Sea]]s along its {{convert|8,750|km|mi|abbr=on}} tidal shoreline. Denmark's general coastline is much shorter, at {{convert|1,701|km|mi|abbr=on}}, as it would not include most of the 1,419 offshore islands (each defined as exceeding 100 square meters in area) and the 180&amp;nbsp;km long [[Limfjorden]], which separates Denmark's second largest island, [[North Jutlandic Island]], 4,686&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in size, from the rest of Jutland.  No location in Denmark is further from the coast than {{convert|52|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. The land area of Denmark is estimated to be {{convert|43094|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}. However, it cannot be stated exactly since the ocean constantly erodes and adds material to the coastline, and there are human [[land reclamation]] projects. On the southwest coast of Jutland, the tide is between {{convert|1|and|2|m|ft|2|abbr=on}}, and the tideline moves outward and inward on a {{convert|10|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} stretch.&lt;ref&gt;Nationalencyklopedin, (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark has an Exclusive Economic Zone of {{convert|105,989|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}. When including [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]] the EEZ is the 15th largest in the world with {{convert|2,220,093|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.

A circle enclosing the same total area as Denmark would have a [[circumference]] of 736&amp;nbsp;km (457 miles), only land area 730&amp;nbsp;km (454 miles). Denmark has 443 named islands (1,419 islands above 100&amp;nbsp;m²),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.kms.dk/C1256AED004EA666/(AllDocsByDocId)/1D7EE8822587E667C1256AEF0030ABF6?open&amp;page=strste&amp;omr=KORT_DK_I_TAL Islands in total and named islands]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; of which 72 are inhabited ({{as of|2007|01|01|lc=on}}, Statistics Denmark). The largest islands are [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] ''(Sjælland)'' and [[Funen]] ''(Fyn)''. The island of [[Bornholm]] is located east of the rest of the country, in the [[Baltic Sea]]. Many of the larger islands are connected by bridges; the [[Øresund Bridge]] connects Zealand with Sweden; the [[Great Belt Fixed Link|Great Belt Bridge]] connects Funen with Zealand; and the [[Little Belt Bridge (1970)|Little Belt Bridge]] connects Jutland with Funen. [[Ferry|Ferries]] or [[small aircraft]] connect to the smaller islands. Main cities are the capital [[Copenhagen]] on Zealand; [[Aarhus|Århus]], [[Aalborg]] and [[Esbjerg]] in Jutland; and [[Odense]] on Funen.

Denmark experiences a temperate climate. This means that the winters are mild and windy and the summers are cool. The local terrain is generally flat with a few gently rolling [[plain]]s. The territory of Denmark includes the island of [[Bornholm]] in the Baltic Sea and the rest of metropolitan Denmark, but excludes the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Greenland]]. Its position gives Denmark complete control of the [[Danish Straits]] ([[Skagerrak]] and [[Kattegat]]) linking the Baltic and North Seas. The country's natural resources include [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]], [[fish]], [[salt]], [[limestone]], [[chalk]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], [[gravel]] and [[sand]].

=== Agriculture ===

* Denmark has plenty of rain, flat landscape, and moderate climate. With 55.99% of its land considered as arable, Denmark has model characteristics for agriculture. 61% of the country's total area is cultivated &lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://agricultureandfood.dk/|title=FACTS AND FIGURES: Danish Agriculture and Food|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farms in Denmark are remarkably large, averaging 172.9 acres per farm. Additionally, homesteads exceeding 247 acres make up more than 20% in Denmark. Many of these large farms harvest fruits and vegetables, the leading exports from Denmark are meat, fur, and dairy products.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; The animal's diets in Denmark consist of mainly cereals since they are the dominant field crop. 75% of all cereal produced in Denmark is feed to the four most produced animals which are pigs, cattle, chicken and mink.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Denmark overproduces about 66% of food production compared to their own population size (5.7 million) being that they are able to feed 15 million people. This is a byproduct of being highly productive within the Danish agricultural production.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
* In 1961, Denmark's Agricultural land represented 74.5% of land area. Fifty-six years later to 2015, Denmark has decreased its amount of Agricultural land down to 62.1%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.AGRI.ZS?locations=DK|title=Agricultural land (% of land area) {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; then to 61% one year later in reference to &quot;Facts and Figures - Danish Agriculture and Food&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;/&gt; The decrease in agricultural land comes as farmers are being well educated and the intensive amount of research and development is being implemented. It begins with advancements in agro-technology. The results have improved fertilization and nutrient use on arable land. Digestibility and nutrient uptake are developing from the improvements of new methods that are being implemented. Examples of these new methods are the addition of enzymes and microbial cultures.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

*Denmark's urban population accounts for 87.9% of its total population, with a 0.51% rate of change in urbanization.&lt;ref name=&quot;:03&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/da.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copenhagen remains the largest city in Denmark with a population of 1.2 million people and a metro population of 1.99 million. Copenhagen became Denmark's Capital in 1443 and now currently sits with a population density of 6,800 people per square kilometer.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/denmark-population/|title=Denmark Population 2018 (Demographics, Maps, Graphs)|website=worldpopulationreview.com|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:52&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.visitdenmark.com/copenhagen/culture/brief-history-copenhagen|title=A brief history of Copenhagen|work=VisitDenmark|access-date=2018-10-31|language=ln-int}}&lt;/ref&gt;
