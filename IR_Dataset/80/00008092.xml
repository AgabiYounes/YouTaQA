}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The popularity of drum and bass at its commercial peak ran parallel to several other homegrown dance styles in the UK. A major influence was the original Jamaican [[dub music|dub]] and [[reggae]] sound. Another feature of the style is the complex [[syncopation]] of the drum tracks' [[break (music)|breakbeat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Amen Break video on youtube.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SaFTm2bcac|title=Video explains the world's most important 6-sec drum loop|last=Proctor|first=Landon|date=21 February 2006|website=|accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drum and bass subgenres include [[breakcore]], [[ragga jungle]], [[hardstep]], [[darkstep]], [[techstep]], [[neurofunk]], ambient drum and bass, [[liquid funk]] (aka liquid drum and bass), jump up, drumfunk, [[funkstep]], [[sambass]], and [[drill 'n' bass]]. From its roots in the UK, the style has established itself around the world. Drum and bass has influenced many other genres like [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[big beat]], [[dubstep]], [[house music|house]], [[trip hop]], [[ambient music]], [[techno]], [[jazz]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]]. Drum and bass is dominated by a relatively small group of record labels. Major international music labels had shown very little interest in the drum and bass scene until [[BMG Rights Management]] acquired [[Ram Records (UK)|RAM]] in February 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;bmg.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www.bmg.com/uk/news/bmg-invests-ram-records.html| title=BMG Invests In Drum &amp; Bass Powerhouse RAM | work=BMG | number= | date=3 February 2016 | accessdate= 18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drum and bass remains most popular in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], although it has developed scenes all around the world in countries such as the [[United States]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[South Africa]], [[Belgium]], [[New Zealand]], [[Greece]], [[Canada]], [[Austria]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], Slovenia and [[Australia]].

==History==
{{Main|History of drum and bass}}
{{See also|Breakbeat hardcore|hardcore jungle}}

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a growing [[nightclub]] and overnight outdoor event culture gave birth to new genres in the [[rave]] scene including [[breakbeat hardcore]], [[darkcore]], and [[hardcore jungle]], which combined sampled [[syncopated]] beats, or breakbeats, and other samples from a wide range of different musical genres and, occasionally, samples of music, dialogue and effects from films and television programmes. From as early as 1991, tracks were beginning to strip away some of the heavier sampling and &quot;hardcore noises&quot; and create more bassline and breakbeat led tracks. Some tracks increasingly took their influence from reggae and this style would become known as [[hardcore jungle]] (later to become simply [[Jungle (music)|jungle]]), whilst [[darkcore]] (with producers such as [[Goldie]], [[Doc Scott]], Jack Smooth, Foul Play, [[4hero]], and [[2 Bad Mice]]) were experimenting with sounds and creating a blueprint for drum and bass, especially noticeable by late 1993.

By 1994, [[Jungle (music)|jungle]] had begun to gain mainstream popularity, and fans of the music (often referred to as [[junglist]]s) became a more recognisable part of youth subculture. The genre further developed, incorporating and fusing elements from a wide range of existing musical genres, including the [[raggamuffin music|raggamuffin]] sound, [[dancehall]], [[Rapping|MC]] chants, dub basslines, and increasingly complex, heavily edited breakbeat percussion. Despite the affiliation with the [[MDMA|ecstasy]]-fuelled rave scene, jungle also inherited associations with violence and criminal activity, both from the gang culture that had affected the UK's hip-hop scene and as a consequence of jungle's often aggressive or menacing sound and themes of violence (usually reflected in the choice of samples). However, this developed in tandem with the often positive reputation of the music as part of the wider rave scene and dancehall-based Jamaican music culture prevalent in London. By 1995, whether as a reaction to, or independently of this cultural schism, some jungle producers began to move away from the ragga-influenced style and create what would become collectively labelled, for convenience, as drum and bass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

|quote = So when I talk about the vibe disappearing from drum and bass, I'm talking about the blackness going as the ragga samples get phased out, the bass loses its reggae feels and becomes more linear and propulsive rather than moving around the beat with a syncopated relation with the drum.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the genre became generally more polished and sophisticated technically, it began to expand its reach from pirate radio to commercial stations and gain widespread acceptance (circa 1995–1997). It also began to split into recognisable subgenres such as jump-up and [[Hardstep]]. As a lighter and often jazz-influenced style of drum and bass called &quot;intelligent drum and bass&quot; gained mainstream appeal, additional subgenres emerged including [[techstep]] (circa 1996–1997), which drew greater influence from [[techno]] music and the [[soundscape]]s of science fiction and [[anime]] films.

The popularity of drum and bass at its commercial peak ran parallel to several other genres native to the UK, including [[big beat]] and [[hard house]]. Towards the turn of the millennium, however, its popularity was deemed to have dwindled, as the [[UK garage]] offshoot known as [[speed garage]] yielded several hit singles. Speed garage shared high tempos and heavy basslines with drum and bass, but otherwise followed the established conventions of &quot;house music&quot;, with this and its freshness giving it an advantage commercially. di Vogli says, &quot;It is often forgotten by my students that a type of music called &quot;[[garage house]]&quot; existed in the late 1980s alongside [[hip house]], [[acid house]] and other forms of house music.&quot; He continues, &quot;This new garage of the mid-90s was not a form of house or a progression of garage house. The beats and tempo that define house are entirely different. This did cause further confusion in the presence of new house music of the mid-1990s being played alongside what was now being called garage.&quot;

Despite this, the emergence of further subgenres and related styles such as [[liquid funk]] brought a wave of new artists incorporating new ideas and techniques, supporting continual evolution of the genre. To this day, drum and bass makes frequent appearances in mainstream media and popular culture including in [[television]], as well as being a major reference point for subsequent genres such as [[Grime (music)|grime]] and [[dubstep]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Global Bass landscape&quot;&gt;[http://rhythmtravels.com/music/global-bass Global Bass on the music landscape]&lt;/ref&gt; and producing successful artists including [[Chase &amp; Status]], [[Netsky (musician)|Netsky]], [[Metrik]], and [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]].

==Musical features==
Drum and bass incorporates a number of scenes and styles, from the highly electronic, [[industrial music|industrial]] sounds of techstep to the use of conventional, acoustic instrumentation that characterize the more jazz-influenced end of the spectrum.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SimonReynoldsOnTechstep&quot;/&gt; The sounds of drum and bass are extremely varied due to the range of influences behind the music. Drum and bass could at one time be defined as a strictly electronic musical genre, with the only &quot;live&quot; element being the DJ's selection and mixing of records during a set. &quot;Live&quot; drum and bass using electric, electronic and acoustic instruments played by musicians on stage emerged over the ensuing years of the genre's development.&lt;ref&gt;New Dawn – City Clubs Take Back The Night article, ''Village Voice'', 27 February 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?SectionID=1031&amp;uid=&amp;MagID=1059&amp;ReviewID=1696&amp;PageNumber=1| title = Knowledge Magazine Article mentioning rise of live drum and bass in 2004| accessdate = 18 October 2006| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070312231643/http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?SectionID=1031&amp;uid=&amp;MagID=1059&amp;ReviewID=1696&amp;PageNumber=1| archive-date = 12 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1655&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;SectionID=1031| title = Knowledge Magazine Article on live drum and bass bands| accessdate = 18 October 2006| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061019135516/http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1655&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;SectionID=1031| archive-date = 19 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===
A very obvious and strong influence on jungle and drum and bass, thanks to the [[British African-Caribbean community|British African-Caribbean]] [[sound system (DJ)|sound system]] scene, is the original Jamaican [[dub music|dub]] and [[reggae]] sound, with pioneers like [[King Tubby]], [[Peter Tosh]], [[Sly &amp; Robbie]], [[Bill Laswell]], [[Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry|Lee Perry]], [[Mad Professor]], [[Roots Radics]], [[Bob Marley]] and [[Buju Banton]] heavily influencing the music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.planetdnb.com/dnb_interviews921.php |title=NJC–Sativa Records interview by Dhanu Le Noury at planetdnb.com |accessdate=6 September 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510074142/http://www.planetdnb.com/dnb_interviews921.php |archivedate=10 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.tranzfusion.net/articles/shownews.asp?newsid=4873 | title = A Guy Called Gerald's Silent Drum &amp; Bass Protest by Benedetta Skrufff at tranzfusion.net | accessdate = 6 September 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060917100056/http://www.tranzfusion.net/articles/shownews.asp?newsid=4873 | archivedate = 17 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This influence has lessened with time, but is still evident, with many tracks containing ragga vocals.

Even modern avant-garde composers such as [[Henryk Gorecki]] have received mention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.techno.de/mixmag/97.09/Goldie.a.html | title = Goldie | first = Matthew | last = Collin | publisher = techno.de | accessdate = 6 September 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120315014917/http://www.techno.de/mixmag/97.09/Goldie.a.html | archive-date = 15 March 2012 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most influential tracks in drum and bass history was &quot;Amen Brother&quot; by [[The Winstons]], which contains a drum solo that has since become known as the &quot;[[Amen break]]&quot;, which, after being extensively used in early hip hop music, went on to become the basis for the rhythms used in drum and bass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amen Break video on youtube.com&quot; /&gt;

[[Kevin Saunderson]] released a series of bass-heavy, minimal techno cuts as Reese/The Reese Project in the late '80s, which were hugely influential in drum and bass. One of his more famous basslines (Reese – &quot;Just Want Another Chance&quot;, Incognito Records, 1988) was indeed sampled on Renegade's ''Terrorist'' and countless others since, being known simply as the 'Reese' bassline. He followed these up with equally influential (and bassline-heavy) tracks in the UK hardcore style as Tronik House in 1991–1992. Another Detroit artist who was important to the scene was [[Carl Craig]]. The sampled-up jazz break on Craig's ''Bug in the Bassbin'' was also influential on the newly emerging sound. DJs at the [[Heaven (nightclub)|Heaven]] nightclub on &quot;Rage&quot; nights used to play it as fast as their [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] record decks would go, pitching it up in the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fabio2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/TUTORS.9.0.html?act_session=273 | publisher=Red Bull Academy | title = Fabio interview – The Root To The Shoot| accessdate = 4 September 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217174942/http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/TUTORS.9.0.html?act_session=273|archivedate=17 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1980s and early 1990s, the tradition of breakbeat use in hip hop production had influenced the sound of [[breakbeat hardcore]], which in turn led to the emergence of jungle, drum and bass, and other genres that shared the same use of broken beats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.native-instruments.com/index.php?id=photek2_us |title=Photek interview |publisher=native-instruments.com |accessdate=6 September 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320042140/http://www.native-instruments.com/index.php?id=photek2_us |archivedate=20 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.planetdnb.com/dnb_interviews1196.php |title=MC XYZ interview at planetdnb.com |accessdate=6 September 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510074154/http://www.planetdnb.com/dnb_interviews1196.php |archivedate=10 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drum and bass shares many musical characteristics with hip-hop, though it is nowadays mostly stripped of lyrics. [[Grandmaster Flash]], [[Roger Troutman]], [[Afrika Bambaata]], [[Run DMC]], [[Mac Dre]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[Schooly D]], [[N.W.A]], [[Kid Frost]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[Mos Def]], [[Beastie Boys]] and the [[Pharcyde]] are very often directly sampled, regardless of their general influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zinc&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/TUTORS.9.0.html?act_session=242 | title = Zinc interview – Hardware Bingo| publisher= Red Bull Academy | accessdate = 4 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clearly, drum and bass has been influenced by other music genres, though influences from sources external to the [[electronic dance music]] scene perhaps lessened following the shifts from jungle to drum and bass, and through to so-called &quot;intelligent drum and bass&quot; and techstep.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url= http://www.nigelberman.co.uk/feature1_nov2002.htm | title= Goldie article | work= Insight | first= Nigel | last= Berman | year= 2002 | publisher= Nigel Berman | accessdate= 6 September 2006 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130123145756/http://www.nigelberman.co.uk/feature1_nov2002.htm | archivedate= 23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1343&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;SectionID=1031 | title = LTJ Bukem | publisher = knowledgemag.co.uk | accessdate = 6 September 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927043116/http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1343&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;SectionID=1031 | archive-date = 27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.020.com/webs/02006/london/showArticle_london.cfm?id=384 |title=History of drum &amp; bass on London News |accessdate=18 January 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206161209/http://www.020.com/webs/02006/london/showArticle_london.cfm?id=384 |archivedate=6 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1691&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;SectionID=1031 | title = Klute | publisher = knowledgemag.co.uk | accessdate = 6 September 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070313005729/http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1691&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;SectionID=1031 | archive-date = 13 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It still remains a fusion music style.

Some tracks are illegally remixed and released on [[white label]] (technically bootleg), often to acclaim. For example, DJ Zinc's remix of [[The Fugees]]' &quot;[[Ready or Not (Fugees song)|Ready or Not]]&quot;, also known as &quot;Fugee Or Not&quot;, was eventually released with the Fugees' permission after talk of legal action, though ironically, the Fugees' version infringed [[Enya]]'s copyright to an earlier song.&lt;ref name = &quot;Zinc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.discogs.com/release/219368 | title = Discogs.com entry on Ready Or Not remixes| accessdate = 9 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; White labels, along with [[dubplate]]s, played an important part in drum and bass musical culture.

The [[Amen break]] was synonymous with early drum and bass productions but other samples have had a significant impact, including the [[Apache (single)|Apache]], [[Funky Drummer]], &quot;Soul Pride&quot;, &quot;Scorpio&quot; and &quot;[[Think (About It)]]&quot; breaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?SectionID=1031&amp;uid=&amp;MagID=1062&amp;ReviewID=1684&amp;PageNumber=1| title = Forever And Ever Amen article on knowledgemag.co.uk| accessdate = 6 September 2006 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070309101109/http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?SectionID=1031&amp;uid=&amp;MagID=1062&amp;ReviewID=1684&amp;PageNumber=1| archivedate = 9 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.junglebreaks.co.uk/breaks.html | title = The Breaks | website = Jungle Breaks | accessdate = 15 August 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100804172201/http://www.junglebreaks.co.uk/breaks.html | archive-date = 4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early pioneers often used [[Akai]] [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]] and [[Music sequencer|sequencers]] on the [[Atari ST]] to create their tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?SectionID=1031&amp;uid=&amp;MagID=1062&amp;ReviewID=1684&amp;PageNumber=1 |title=Forever And Ever Amen article on knowledgemag.co.uk |accessdate=September 6, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309101109/http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?SectionID=1031&amp;uid=&amp;MagID=1062&amp;ReviewID=1684&amp;PageNumber=1 |archivedate=2007-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Synthesis====
[[File:Roland TR-808 drum machine.jpg|thumb|The [[Roland TR-808|Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer]], produced 1980–1984, had a bass drum sound which became very important in drum and bass.]]
Of equal importance is the TR-808 kick drum, an artificially pitch-downed or elongated [[bass drum]] sound sampled from [[Roland Corporation|Roland]]'s classic [[Roland TR-808|TR-808]] drum machine, and a sound which has been subject to an enormous amount of experimentation over the years.&lt;ref name=&quot;TR-808&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.synthmuseum.com/roland/roltr80801.html | title = TR-808| accessdate = 24 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rhythm composition====
Many drum and bass tracks have featured more than one sampled breakbeat in them and a technique of switching between two breaks after each bar developed. Examples of this can be heard on mid-90s releases such as [[J Majik]]'s &quot;Your Sound&quot;. A more recent commonly used break is the &quot;Tramen&quot;, which combines the [[Amen break]], a [[James Brown]] funk breakbeat (&quot;[[Tighten Up (Archie Bell &amp; the Drells song)|Tighten Up]]&quot; or &quot;Samurai&quot; break) and an [[Alex Reece]] drum and bass breakbeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1610&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;SectionID=1031| title = Dom &amp; Roland interview by Ben Willmott at knowledgemag.co.uk| accessdate = 6 September 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110724011252/http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1610&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;SectionID=1031| archivedate = 24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relatively fast drum beat forms a canvas on which a producer can create tracks to appeal to almost any taste and often will form only a background to the other elements of the music. [[Syncopated]] breakbeats remain the most distinctive element as without these a high-tempo [[Time signature|4/4]] dance track could be classified as [[techno]] or [[gabber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://store.drumbum.com/drums/drum-n-bass-drum-and-bass.htm| title = Life in The Fast Lane: An Overview of Drum and Bass by George Broyer at drumbum.com| accessdate = 6 September 2006| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110807102130/http://store.drumbum.com/drums/drum-n-bass-drum-and-bass.htm| archive-date = 7 August 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex [[syncopation]] of the drum tracks' [[break (music)|breakbeat]] is another facet of production on which producers can spend a very large amount of time. The [[Amen break]] is generally acknowledged to have been the most-used (and often considered the most powerful) break in drum and bass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amen Break video on youtube.com&quot; /&gt;

===Bass elements===
The genre places great importance on the [[bassline]], in this case a deep [[sub-bass]] musical pattern which can be felt physically through powerful sound systems due to the low-range frequencies favoured. There has been considerable exploration of different [[timbre]]s in the bass line region, particularly within [[techstep]]. The bass lines most notably originate from [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] sources or [[synthesizer]]s. Bass lines performed with a bass instrument, whether it is electric, acoustic or a [[double bass]], are less common, but examples can be found in the work of artists such as [[Shapeshifter (band)|Shapeshifter]], [[Squarepusher]], [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]], [[Roni Size]] and [[STS9]].

===Atmospheric elements===
Atmospheric pads and samples may be added over the fundamental drum and bass to provide different feels.   These have included &quot;light&quot; elements such as ambient pads as found in ambient electronica and samples of jazz and world musics, or &quot;dark&quot; elements such as [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] pads and sci-fi samples to induce anxiety in the dancer.

===Vocal and Melody elements===
Old-school DnB usually included an MC providing vocals.   Some styles (such as jazz influenced DnB) also include melodic instruments soloing over the music.

===Tempo===
Drum and bass is usually between 160–180 BPM, in contrast to other [[breakbeat]]-based dance styles such as [[nu skool breaks]], which maintain a slower pace at around 130–140 BPM. A general upward trend in tempo has been observed during the evolution of drum and bass. The earliest forms of drum and bass clocked in at around 130 bpm in 1990/1991, speeding up to around 155–165 BPM by 1993. Since around 1996, drum and bass tempos have predominantly stayed in the 170–180 range. Recently, some producers have started to once again produce tracks with slower tempos (that is, in the 150-170 bpm range), but the mid-170s tempo is still a hallmark of the drum and bass sound.&lt;ref name = &quot;Zinc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Fabio3&quot;/&gt;

A track combining the same elements (broken beat, bass, production techniques) as a drum and bass track, but with a slower tempo (say 140 BPM), might not be drum and bass, but  instead may qualify as a drum and bass-influenced breakbeat track.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_drumnbasspioneer_rob_playford/| title = Remix Mag Interview with Rob Playford, drum and bass pioneer at remixmag.com| accessdate = 5 October 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070207105625/http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_drumnbasspioneer_rob_playford/| archivedate = 7 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drop===
Many mixing points begin or end with a &quot;[[drop (music)|drop]]&quot;. The drop is the point in a track where a switch of rhythm or bassline occurs and usually follows a recognisable build section and [[breakdown (music)|breakdown]]. Sometimes, the drop is used to switch between tracks, layering components of different tracks, as the two records may be simply ambient breakdowns at this point. Some DJs prefer to combine breakbeats, a more difficult exercise. Some drops are so popular that the DJ will &quot;rewind&quot; or &quot;reload&quot; or &quot;lift up&quot; the record by spinning it back and restarting it at the build. The drop is often a key point from the point of view of the dance floor, since the drum breaks often fade out to leave an ambient intro playing. When the beats re-commence they are often more complex and accompanied by a heavier bassline, encouraging the crowd to begin dancing.

==Live performance==

[[File:Pendulumsamuelnordstrom.JPG|thumb|left|[[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]] performing live in 2010]]

Drum and bass exhibits a full frequency response which can sometimes only be fully appreciated on sound systems which can handle very low frequencies, including [[sub-bass]] frequencies that are often felt more than heard. As befits its name, the bass element of the music is particularly pronounced, with the comparatively sparse arrangements of drum and bass tracks allowing room for basslines that are deeper than most other forms of dance music. Consequently, drum and bass parties are often advertised as featuring uncommonly loud and bass-heavy sound systems.

There are however many albums specifically designed for personal listening. The DJ mix is a particularly popular form of release, with a popular DJ or producer mixing live, or on a computer, a variety of tracks for personal listening. Additionally, there are many albums containing unmixed tracks, suited for home or car listening.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Good Life, No Such Thing As Society&quot;, ''The Independent'', 23 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Many musicians have adapted drum and bass to live performances, which feature instruments such as [[Drum kit|drums]] (acoustic or electronic), [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]], [[synthesizer]]s, [[turntables]], [[bass (instrument)|bass]] (either [[upright bass|upright]] or electric) and [[guitar]]s (acoustic or electric). [[Sampler (musical instrument)|Samplers]] have also been used live by assigning samples to a specific drum pad or key on [[Roland V-Drums|drum pads]] or synthesizers. [[MC]]s are frequently featured in live performances.

===Genres influenced by drum and bass===

Born around the same time as jungle, [[breakcore]] and [[digital hardcore]] share many of the elements of drum and bass and to the uninitiated, tracks from the extreme end of drum and bass may sound identical to breakcore thanks to speed, complexity, impact and maximum sonic density combined with musical experimentation. German drum and bass DJ [[The Panacea]] is also one of the leading digital hardcore artists. [[Raggacore]] resembles a faster version of the ragga-influenced jungle music of the 1990s, similar to breakcore but with more friendly [[dancehall]] beats (dancehall itself being a very important influence on drum and bass).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lfodemon.com/raggacorearticle/index.htm |title=Raggacore article on lfodemon.com |accessdate=6 September 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217064746/http://www.lfodemon.com/raggacorearticle/index.htm |archivedate=17 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Darkcore]], a direct influence on drum and bass, was combined with influences of drum and bass itself leading to the creation of [[darkstep]]. There is considerable crossover from the extreme edges of drum and bass, breakcore, darkcore, digital hardcore and raggacore with fluid boundaries.

[[Dubstep]] originated from DnB slowed down to half speed and mixed with [[dub reggae]], as experimental mixes on B-sides of garage records.

[[Intelligent dance music]] (IDM) is a form of [[art music]] based on DnB and other electronic dance musics, exploring their boundaries using ideas from science, technology, contemporary classical music and progressive rock, often creating un-danceable, art gallery style music.  Pioneered by [[Aphex Twin]], [[Squarepusher]] and other artists on [[Warp Records]].

The genre has influenced many other genres like [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[big beat]], [[house music]], [[trip hop]], [[ambient music]], [[techno]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]], with artists such as [[Bill Laswell]], [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], [[Pitchshifter (band)|Pitchshifter]], [[Linkin Park]], [[The Roots]], [[Talvin Singh]], [[MIDIval Punditz]], [[Missy Elliott]], [[The Freestylers]], [[Bowery Electric]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[David Bowie]] (the last two both using elements of Goldie's &quot;Timeless&quot;){{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} and others quoting drum and bass and using drum and bass techniques and elements. Recently created in the United States is a genre called [[ghettotech]] which contains synth and basslines similar to drum and bass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fabio3&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/TUTORS.9.0.html?act_session=290 | title = Red Bull Academy Interview Fabio – The Root To The Shoot| accessdate = 4 September 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420135102/http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/TUTORS.9.0.html?act_session=290|archivedate=20 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1278&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;SectionID=1031 | title = A Guy Called Gerald feature at knowledgemag.co.uk | accessdate = 6 September 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110809015311/http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1278&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;SectionID=1031 | archivedate = 9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Playford&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_drumnbasspioneer_rob_playford/ | title = Remix Mag Interview with Rob Playford, drum and bass pioneer at remixmag.com | accessdate = 5 October 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070207105625/http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_drumnbasspioneer_rob_playford/ | archivedate = 7 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Popular&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.popular-musicology-online.com/issues/02/missingham.html| title = &quot;Popular Musicology On Line Article &quot;Big Tings Ah Gwan&quot;: Junglist Music Takes Centre Stage, An Introduction to Jungle Music And An Enquiry Into Its Impact On The London Jazz Scene&quot;| accessdate = 4 September 2007| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120216142603/http://www.popular-musicology-online.com/issues/02/missingham.html| archive-date = 16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p24040/biography|pure_url=yes}} | title = Pitchshifter biography| accessdate = 16 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Record labels===
{{See also|Category:Drum and bass record labels}}

Drum and bass is dominated by a small group of record labels. These are run mainly by DJ–producers, such as [[London Elektricity]]'s [[Hospital Records]], [[Andy C]] and Scott Bourne's [[Ram Records (UK)|RAM]],&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ramrecords.com/info#label-history|title=RAM Records|last=|first=|date=|website=RAM Records|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Goldie]]'s [[Metalheadz]], Kasra's [[Critical Music]], [[DJ Friction (UK)|DJ Friction]]'s Shogun Audio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shogunaudio.co.uk/about-us.php|title=About Us|website=Shogun Audio|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716040539/http://www.shogunaudio.co.uk/about-us.php|archivedate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DJ Fresh]]'s [[Breakbeat Kaos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.redbull.com/gb-en/drum-and-bass-still-on-top|title=Eternal evolution: why drum'n'bass refuses to die|last=|first=|date=|website=www.redbull.com|language=en|access-date=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ed Rush]] &amp; [[Optical (musician)|Optical]]'s [https://www.discogs.com/label/275-Virus-Recordings Virus Recordings], [[Futurebound]]'s Viper Recordings and [[DJ Hype]], Pascal, [[NoCopyrightSounds]] and formerly [[DJ Zinc]]'s [[True Playaz]] (now known as Real Playaz as of 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/playazrecordings?sk=info|title=Playaz Recordings - About|website=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 2016, the major international music labels such as [[Sony Music]] and [[Universal Music Group|Universal]] had shown very little interest in the drum and bass scene, with the exception of some notable signings, including [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]]'s ''[[In Silico (Pendulum album)|In Silico]]'' LP to Warner. Roni Size's label played a big, if not the biggest, part in the creation of drum and bass with their dark, baseline sounds. V Recordings also played a large part of the development of drum and bass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nesthq.com/premiere-bryan-gee-interview|title=V Recordings' Bryan Gee Discusses History and Future of Drum &amp; Bass + Premieres Intelligent Manners' &quot;How Sweet It Is&quot;|date=12 August 2016|publisher=NEST HQ|first=Nathan|last=Beer|access-date=23 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123204136/http://nesthq.com/premiere-bryan-gee-interview|archive-date=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roni Size, Krust and DJ Die produced some of the first tracks to be considered{{who|date=March 2015}} mainstream drum and bass tracks.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[BMG Rights Management]] acquired [[Ram Records (UK)|Ram Records]] in February 2016,&lt;ref name=&quot;bmg.com&quot;/&gt; making a strategic investment to help RAM Records (a London-based drum and bass record company co-owned by [[Andy C]] and his business partner Scott Bourne). RAM Records has been pushing the boundaries of drum and bass further into the mainstream with artists such as [[Chase and Status]] and [[Sub Focus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Bringing back UK [[Oldschool jungle|jungle music]] artists from [[LTJ Bukem]]'s label [[Good Looking]] artists Bay B Kane, [[breakbeat hardcore]] heavyweight Nebula II and original [[junglist]] Gappa G.

Now defunct labels, include [[Rob Playford]]'s [[Moving Shadow]], running from 1990 until 2007, which played a pivotal role in the nineties drum and bass scene, releasing records by artists such as [[Omni Trio]].

===Formats and distribution===
====Purchasing====
Originally drum and bass was mostly sold in 12-inch [[vinyl record|vinyl]] single format. With the emergence of drum and bass into mainstream music markets, more albums, compilations and [[DJ mixes]] started to be sold on CDs. As digital music became more popular, websites focused on electronic music, such as [[Beatport]], began to sell drum and bass in digital format.

====Distributors (wholesale)====
The bulk of drum and bass vinyl records and CDs are distributed globally and regionally by a relatively small number of companies such as SRD (Southern Record Distributors), ST Holdings, &amp; Nu Urban Music Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1574&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;SectionID=1031| title = Distribution feature at knowledgemag.co.uk| accessdate = 6 September 2006| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070309024815/http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1574&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;SectionID=1031| archive-date = 9 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 11 September 2012, Nu Urban ceased trading and RSM Tenon were instructed to assist in convening statutory meetings of members and creditors to appoint a liquidator. This left many labels short on sales, as Nu Urban were one of the main distributors for the vinyl market in the drum and bass scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |website=www.nu-urbanmusic.co.uk| url = http://www.nu-urbanmusic.co.uk | title = Announcement of bankruptcy on nu-urbanmusic.co.uk |accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional scenes===

====Anglosphere====
Despite its roots in the UK (with [[Fabric (club)|Fabric]] being the epicentre of DnB), still treated as the &quot;home&quot; of drum and bass, the style has firmly established itself around the world.  There are strong scenes in other English-speaking countries including Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Drum &amp; Bass Keeps The Beat&quot;, ''Boston Globe'', 6 February 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Continental Europe====
DnB is popular in continental [[Europe]]. The [[Czech Republic]] currently hosts the largest drum and bass festival in the world, LET IT ROLL, with an annual attendance of approximately 30,000. The genre is also encountered in [[Slovakia]], and local producers in both countries such as A-Cray, Rido, Forbidden Society, L Plus, B-Complex, Changing Faces, Lixx, Dephzac, and Gabanna are becoming well known worldwide. There are several other drum and bass festivals being held each year in these countries, including Trident Festival, Exploration Festival, or Hoofbeats Open Air in the summer, or one-night events such as LET IT ROLL Winter, Imagination Festival, and LET IT ROLL Winter [[Slovakia]] in the colder months. During club season, promoters race between each other to organize better events, often resulting in up to ten parties being held during one weekend, with no more than a two-hour travel between them.

Austria has a large emerging DnB scene with many artists such as [[Camo &amp; Krooked]], Mefjus, Fourward, Body &amp; Soul, [[Ill.Skillz]] and mainly the Mainframe record label being all based in or around [[Vienna]]. Notable venues and events include &quot;The Hive&quot; and &quot;Beat It&quot; held at [[Flex (club)|Flex]] almost every Thursday and Saturday, &quot;Vollkontakt&quot; at Fluc, &quot;Switch&quot; at Flex, and the monthly Mainframe Recordings Label Night hosted at Arena by label head Disaszt.

In Ireland, the biggest scene by far is in Dublin, with a night every Sunday by the Initial Kru mostly showcasing local DJ's but occasionally bringing over international guests such as Spirit and Seba. Record label Boey Audio also run events showcasing local, national and international acts, as well as promoters such as Sól Fúd, Ragga Jungle Dublin and Springfield Crew Massive. There are much smaller regional scenes in areas such as Limerick, Cork and Galway which usually have monthly nights.

====South America====
Brazilian drum and bass is sometimes referred to as &quot;[[sambass]]&quot;, with a specific [[samba]]-influenced style and sound made popular by artists like [[DJ Marky]] and [[Xerxes de Oliveira|XRS]].

In Venezuela and Mexico, artists have created their own forms of drum and bass, combining it with experimental musical forms.

In Colombia, there is a large underground scene. RE.set and Bogotá Project are two collectives that organize drum and bass events in the city, as well as a bi-annual event called Radikal Styles that brings together local talent and international big names.

===Media presence===
Today, drum and bass is widely promoted using different methods such as [[video sharing service]]s like [[YouTube]] and [[Dailymotion]], [[blog]]s, [[radio]], and [[television]], the latter being the most uncommon method. More recently, music networking websites such as [[SoundCloud]] and [[Mixcloud]] have become powerful tools for artist recognition, providing a vast platform that enables quick responses to new tracks. Record labels have adopted the use of [[podcast]]s. Prior to the rise of the internet, drum and bass was commonly broadcast over [[pirate radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fantazia.org.uk/radio/pirateradio_timeline.htm|title=Pirate Radio Stations - A Brief Timeline of the UK scene|website=www.fantazia.org.uk|access-date=15 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006104728/http://www.fantazia.org.uk/radio/pirateradio_timeline.htm|archive-date=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Radio====
The three highest-profile radio stations playing drum and bass shows are [[BBC Radio 1]] with The Drum and Bass Show - formerly with [[DJ Friction (UK)|Friction]], who was replaced with [[René LaVice]] in 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ukf.com/news/friction-announces-departure-from-radio-1-1xtra-rene-lavice-to-takeover-from-november/20518|title=Friction announces departure from Radio 1 &amp; 1Xtra, Rene LaVice to takeover from November|website=www.ukf.com|access-date=8 January 2018|date=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; simulcast in the US and Canada on Sirius XM, and [[DJ Hype]] on [[Kiss 100 London|Kiss 100]] in London. [[Fabio (DJ)|Fabio]] and [[Grooverider]] previously held a long-standing drum and bass show on Radio 1. Radio 1 also had a 'One in the Jungle' show.

The BBC's &quot;urban&quot; station [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]] used to feature the genre heavily, with DJ Bailey (show axed as of 29 August 2012) and Crissy Criss (show axed as of August 2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04f8m00|title=27/08/2014, D&amp;B with Crissy Criss - BBC Radio 1Xtra|website=BBC|access-date=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as its advocates. The network also organizes a week-long tour of the UK each year called [[Xtra Bass]]. London pirate radio stations have been instrumental in the development of drum and bass, with stations such as [[Kool FM]] (which continues to broadcast today having done so since 1991), Origin FM, [[Don FM]] (the only drum and bass pirate to have gained a temporary legal license), [http://www.renegaderadio.co.uk Renegade Radio 107.2FM], Rude FM, Wax FM and Eruption among the most influential.

As of 2014, despite higher profile stations such as 1Xtra scaling back their drum and bass specialist coverage, the genre has made its way into UK top 10 charts with drum and bass inspired tracks from artists such as Rudimental and Sigma. Earlier in August 2014, before Crissy Criss' show was axed, the BBC held a whole prime time evening event dedicated to showcasing drum and bass by allowing four major labels to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04dm0p1|title=D&amp;B Soundclash Special, MistaJam - BBC Radio 1Xtra|website=BBC|access-date=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2014, there have been 6 drum &amp; bass songs reaching the no.1 spot on the UK's top 40 chart, since the genre was first being played on the radio, around 1993. The first of these was in 2012. The fact that all 6 of these songs have reached number 1 in only two years shows the increase in popularity and commercialisation of the genre in recent years. The artists that produced these songs are [[Sigma (group)|Sigma]], [[Rudimental]] and [[DJ Fresh]] (all have had two No.1 hits).

=====Internet radio=====
Internet radio stations, acting in the same light as pirate stations, have also been an instrumental part in promoting drum and bass music; the majority of them funded by listener and artist donations.

Drum and bass was supported by [[Ministry of Sound]] radio from the early 2000s until 2014 and later featuring Tuesday shows from labels such as [[Metalheadz]], [[Fabio]] &amp; [[Grooverider]], DJ Marky, Viper Recordings, [[Shogun Audio]] and [[Hospital Records]]. From September 2014, Ministry abruptly dropped all non-mainstream genres to focus on mainstream EDM, causing disappointment amongst the fans of the D&amp;B community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kmag.co.uk/ministry-of-sound-radio-drops-drum-bass/|title=Ministry Of Sound Radio Drops Drum &amp; Bass|last1=Steven|first1=Colin|date=26 September 2014|website=K Mag|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leading Drum &amp; Bass radio Station is now Denver's [https://dnbradio.com DnB Radio], established in 2003 by M.

In Columbus, Ohio WCBE 90.5 has a two-hour electronic only showcase, &quot;All Mixed Up,&quot; Saturday nights at 10 pm. At the same time WUFM 88.7 plays its &quot;Electronic Playground.&quot;

Also, [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]'s rock station, 104.5 The Edge, has a two-hour show starting at 10 pm Saturday nights called Edge Essential Mix mixed by DJ Demko showcasing electronic and drum and bass style. While the aforementioned shows in Ohio rarely play drum and bass, the latter plays the genre with some frequency.

In [[Tucson, Arizona]], 91.3 FM [[KXCI]] has a two-hour electronic show known as &quot;Digital Empire&quot;, Friday nights at 10 pm (MST). Resident DJ Trinidad showcases various styles of electronica, with the main focus being drum and bass, jungle &amp; [[dubstep]].

====Magazines====
The best-known drum and bass publication was [https://www.kmag.co.uk/ ''Kmag''] magazine (formerly called ''Knowledge Magazine'') before it went completely online in August 2009. Although it's still live, after 20 years Kmag ceased updating their site at the end of 2014. Kmag has announced a book to celebrate their 25th anniversary to be published in December 2019. Kmag's publishing arm, Vision, published Brian Belle-Fortune's ''All Crews Journeys Through Jungle Drum &amp; Bass Culture'' in 2004.

Other publications include the longest running drum and bass magazine worldwide, ''ATM Magazine'', and Austrian-based ''[[Resident (magazine)|Resident]]''. London-based ''DJ'' magazine has also been running a widely respected drum and bass reviews page since 1994, written by Alex Constantinides, which many followers refer to when seeking out new releases to investigate. In 2012 Alex stopped writing the reviews, and they are now contributed by Whisky Kicks.
