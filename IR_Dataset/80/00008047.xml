'''Transport in Djibouti''' includes [[highways]], [[airports]], [[railways]] and [[seaports]].

==Railways==
{{main|Rail transport in Djibouti}}
The country's first railway, [[Ethio-Djibouti Railway]], was a [[metre gauge railway]] that connected [[Ethiopia]] to Djibouti. It was built between 1894 and 1917 by the French who ruled the country at the time as [[French Somaliland]]. The railway is no longer operational.

Currently (2018), Djibouti has 93 km of railways. The new [[Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway]], an electrified [[standard gauge]] railway built by two Chinese government firms, began regular operations in January 2018. Its main purpose is to facilitate freight services between the Ethiopian hinterland and the Djiboutian [[Port of Doraleh]]. Railway services are provided by the ''Ethio-Djibouti Standard Gauge Rail Transport Share Company'', a bi-national company between Ethiopia and Djibouti, which operates all commuter and freight railway services in the country. Djibouti has a total of four railway stations, of which three ([[Nagad railway station|Nagad]], [[Holhol]] and [[Ali Sabieh]]) can handle passenger traffic.

==Roads==
[[File:Djibouti National Highway.png|thumb|right|Map of Djibouti national highway]]
The Djiboutian highway system is named according to the road classification. Roads that are considered primary roads are those that are fully asphalted (throughout their entire length) and in general they connect all the major towns in Djibouti.  There is a total of {{convert|3,065|km}} of roads, with {{convert|1,379|km}} paved and {{convert|1,686|km}} unpaved, according to a 2000 estimate.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

==Ports and harbors==

Djibouti has an improved [[natural harbor]] that consists of a roadstead, outer harbor, and inner harbor, known as the [[Port of Djibouti]]. The roadstead is well protected by reefs and by the configuration of the land. 95% of [[Ethiopia]]’s imports and exports move through Djiboutian ports. Car ferries pass the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]] from [[Djibouti City]] to [[Tadjoura]].

For decades, the Port of Djibouti was Djibouti's only freight port. It is now in the process of being replaced by the [[Port of Doraleh]] west of Djibouti City. In addition to the Port of Doraleh, which handles general cargo and oil imports, Djibouti currently (2018) has three other major ports for the import and export of bulk goods and livestock, the [[Tadjoura|Port of Tadjourah]] (potash), the [[Damerjog|Damerjog Port]] (livestock) and the [[Port of Goubet]] (salt).

==Merchant marine==
Djibouti had one ship of over 1,000 GT: 1,369 GT/{{DWT|3,030|metric|disp=long}} according to a 1999 estimate.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

==Airports==

In 2004, there were an estimated 13 airports, only 3 of which had paved runways as of 2005. [[Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport]], which is situated about 6&amp;nbsp;km from the city of Djibouti, is the country's international air terminal. There are also local airports at [[Tadjoura]] and [[Obock]]. Beginning in 1963, the state-owned [[Air Djibouti]] also provided domestic service to various domestic centers and flew to many overseas destinations. The national carrier discontinued operations in 2002. [[Daallo Airlines]], a [[Somalia|Somali]]-owned private carrier, has also offered air transportation since its foundation in 1991. With its hub at the Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport, the airline provides flights to a number of domestic and overseas destinations.
