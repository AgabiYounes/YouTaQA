He is the founder and CEO of [[Aftermath Entertainment]] and [[Beats Electronics]], and was previously co-owner of [[Death Row Records]]. Dr. Dre began his career as a member of the [[World Class Wreckin' Cru]] in 1985, but found fame with the influential [[gangsta rap]] group [[N.W.A]], which popularized explicit lyrics in rap to detail the violence of street life. He is credited as a key figure in the crafting and popularization of [[West Coast hip hop|West Coast]] [[G-funk]], a subgenre of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] characterized by a synthesizer foundation and slow, heavy beats. He was the second-richest figure in hip hop as of 2018 with an estimated net worth of US$800 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;ForbesNetWorth2019&quot; /&gt;

Dr. Dre's solo debut studio album ''[[The Chronic]]'' (1992), released under Death Row Records, made him one of the best-selling American music artists of 1993. It earned him a [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance]] for the single &quot;[[Let Me Ride]]&quot;, as well as several accolades for the single &quot;[[Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang]]&quot;. That year, he produced Death Row labelmate [[Snoop Dogg|Snoop Doggy Dogg]]'s quadruple platinum debut ''[[Doggystyle]]'', and mentored producers such as his step-brother [[Warren G]] (leading to the multi-platinum debut ''[[Regulate...G Funk Era]]'' in 1994) and Snoop Dogg's cousin [[Daz Dillinger]] (leading to the double-platinum debut ''[[Dogg Food]]'' by [[Tha Dogg Pound]] in 1995). In 1996, Dr. Dre left Death Row Records to establish his own label, Aftermath Entertainment. He produced a compilation album, ''[[Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath]],'' in 1996, and released a solo album, ''[[2001 (Dr. Dre album)|2001]],'' in 1999. During the 2000s, Dr. Dre focused on producing other artists, occasionally contributing vocals. Dr. Dre signed Eminem in 1998 and 50 Cent in 2002, and co-produced their albums.

Dr. Dre has won six [[Grammy Awards]], including [[Grammy Award for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical|Producer of the Year; Non-Classical]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Dre number 56 on the list of [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]]. He has produced albums for and overseen the careers of many rappers, including [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]], [[Eminem]], [[The D.O.C.]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Xzibit]], [[Knoc-turn'al]], [[50 Cent]], [[Game (rapper)|The Game]], [[Kendrick Lamar]] and [[Anderson .Paak]]. He has also had acting roles in movies such as ''[[Set It Off (film)|Set It Off]]'', ''[[The Wash (2001 film)|The Wash]]'' and ''[[Training Day]]''.

== Early life ==
Dr. Dre was born Andre Romelle Young in [[Compton, California]] on February 18, 1965, the first child of Theodore and Verna Young. His middle name, Romelle, is derived from his father's amateur [[rhythm and blues]] singing group, The Romells. His parents married in 1964, separated in 1968, and divorced in 1972.&lt;ref name=&quot;DrDreBio-Ro-2007&quot; /&gt;{{rp|7–8}} His mother later remarried to Curtis Crayon and had three children: sons Jerome and Tyree (both deceased)&lt;ref name=&quot;DrDreBio-Ro-2007&quot; /&gt;{{rp|7,25}} and daughter Shameka.&lt;ref name=&quot;DrDreBio-Ro-2007&quot; /&gt;{{rp|6–8}} In 1976, Dr. Dre began attending Vanguard Junior High School in Compton, but due to [[gang violence]], he transferred to the safer suburban Roosevelt Junior High School.&lt;ref name=&quot;DrDreBio-Ro-2007&quot; /&gt;{{rp|9}} The family moved often, and they lived in apartments and houses in Compton, [[Carson, California|Carson]], [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and in the [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] and [[South Los Angeles|South Central]] neighborhoods in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Westhoff2016&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Westhoff |first=Ben |title=Original Gangstas: Tupac Shakur, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, Ice Cube, and the Birth of West Coast Rap |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Original_Gangstas/0T5UCwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0 |date=September 13, 2016 |ISBN= 9780316344869 |publisher=Hachette Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Dre has said that he was mostly raised by his grandmother in New Wilmington Arms housing project in Compton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Ro |first=Ronin |title=Moving Target |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/paxtonholley/26241328270/in/album-72157667164486172/ |magazine=The Source |number=38 |pages=38–44 |date=November 1992 |accessdate=January 13, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother later married Warren Griffin,&lt;ref name=&quot;DrDreBio-Ro-2007&quot; /&gt;{{rp|10}} which added three stepsisters and one stepbrother to the family; the stepbrother would eventually become rapper [[Warren G]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DrDreBio-Kenyatta-2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kenyatta|first1=Kelly|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dCFq7jRrhFsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22dr.+dre%22|title=You Forgot About Dre!: The Unauthorized Biography of Dr. Dre and Eminem: from NWA to Slim Shady: a Tale of Gangsta Rap, Violence, and Hit Records|location=Los Angeles|publisher=Busta Books|date=2001|ISBN=978-0-970-22249-7|OCLC=45162196}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}}

Dr. Dre is the cousin of producer [[Sir Jinx]]. He attended [[Centennial High School (Compton, California)|Centennial High School]] in Compton during his freshman year in 1979, but transferred to [[John C. Fremont High School|Fremont High School]] in [[South Central Los Angeles]] due to poor grades. He attempted to enroll in an apprenticeship program at [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop Aviation Company]], but poor grades at school made him ineligible. Thereafter, he focused on his social life and entertainment for the remainder of his high school years.&lt;ref name=&quot;DrDreBio-Ro-2007&quot; /&gt;{{rp|2}} Dr. Dre fathered a son with Cassandra Joy Greene named Curtis (born December 15, 1981). Curtis was brought up by his mother and first met his father 20 years later, when Curtis became rapper Hood Surgeon.&lt;ref name=&quot;DrDreBio-Ro-2007&quot; /&gt;{{rp|11}}

==Music career==

===1984–1985: World Class Wreckin' Cru===
Inspired by the [[Grandmaster Flash]] song &quot;[[The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel]]&quot;, Dr. Dre often attended a club called Eve After Dark to watch many DJs and rappers performing live. He subsequently became a DJ in the club, initially under the name &quot;Dr. J&quot;, based on the nickname of [[Julius Erving]], his favorite basketball player. At the club, he met aspiring rapper Antoine Carraby, later to become member [[DJ Yella]] of [[N.W.A]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DrDreBio-Kenyatta-2001&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|15}} Soon afterwards he adopted the moniker Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre, a mix of previous alias Dr. J and his first name, referring to himself as the &quot;Master of Mixology&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DrDreBio-Ro-2007&quot; /&gt;{{rp|14}} Eve After Dark had a back room with a small four-track studio. In this studio, Dre and Yella recorded several demos. In their first recording session, they recorded a song entitled &quot;Surgery&quot;, with the lyrics &quot;calling Dr. Dre to surgery&quot; serving as the chorus to the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Williams |first=Justin A. |encyclopedia=Grove Music Online |title=Dr. Dre [Young, Andre Romelle] |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/grovemusic/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-1002224243#omo-9781561592630-e-1002224243 |doi=10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.A2224243 |date=July 10, 2012 |accessdate=January 13, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{tertiary source inline|date=January 2020}} He later joined the musical group [[World Class Wreckin' Cru]] under Kru-Cut in 1984. The group would become stars of the electro-hop scene that dominated early 1980s [[West Coast hip hop]]. &quot;Surgery&quot;, which was officially released after being recorded prior to the group's official formation, would prominently feature Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre on the turntable. The record would become the group's first hit, selling 50,000&amp;nbsp;copies within the Compton area.&lt;ref name=&quot;DrDreBio-Kenyatta-2001&quot; /&gt;{{rp|14–15}}

Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre and DJ Yella also performed mixes for local radio station [[KDAY]], boosting ratings for its afternoon rush-hour show ''The Traffic Jam''.&lt;ref name=&quot;DrDreBio-Ro-2007&quot; /&gt;{{rp|17}} Dr. Dre's earliest recordings were released in 1994 on a compilation titled ''[[Concrete Roots]]''. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of the website AllMusic described the compiled music, released &quot;several years before Dre developed a distinctive style&quot;, as &quot;surprisingly generic and unengaging&quot; and &quot;for dedicated fans only&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|title=&quot;Concrete Roots&quot; &gt; Overview|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r204338|pure_url=yes}}|website=AllMusic|accessdate=June 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His frequent absences from school jeopardized his position as a diver on his school's swim team. After high school, he attended Chester Adult School in Compton following his mother's demands for him to get a job or continue his education. After brief attendance at a radio broadcasting school, he relocated to the residence of his father and residence of his grandparents before returning to his mother's house.&lt;ref name=&quot;DrDreBio-Ro-2007&quot; /&gt;{{rp|18–19}} He later dropped out of Chester to focus on performing at the Eve's After Dark nightclub.

=== 1986–1991: N.W.A and Ruthless Records ===
{{listen|pos=left|filename=N.W.A - Fuck Tha Police.ogg|title=&quot;Fuck Tha Police&quot;|description=from ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]''|format=[[Ogg]]}}
[[File:Uncle Jam's Army - Eazy-E and N.W.A. 1988 Skateland Concert Poster.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Poster for one of N.W.A's first concerts at a Compton skating rink, 1988]]

In 1986, Dr. Dre met rapper O'Shea Jackson—known as [[Ice Cube]]—who collaborated with him to record songs for [[Ruthless Records]], a hip hop record label run by local rapper [[Eazy-E]]. [[N.W.A]] and fellow West Coast rapper [[Ice-T]] are widely credited as seminal artists of the gangsta rap genre, a profanity-heavy subgenre of hip hop, replete with gritty depictions of urban crime and gang lifestyle. Not feeling constricted to racially charged political issues pioneered by rap artists such as [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] or [[Boogie Down Productions]], N.W.A favored themes and uncompromising lyrics, offering stark descriptions of violent, inner-city streets. Propelled by the hit &quot;[[Fuck tha Police]]&quot;, the group's first full album ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'' became a major success, despite an almost complete absence of radio airplay or major concert tours. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] sent Ruthless Records a warning letter in response to the song's content.&lt;ref name=&quot;AllMusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=Dr. Dre – Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dr-dre-mn0000805274/biography|website=AllMusic|year=2000|accessdate=September 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Ice Cube left N.W.A in 1989 over financial disputes, Dr. Dre produced and performed for much of the group's second album ''[[Efil4zaggin]]''. He also produced tracks for a number of other acts on Ruthless Records, including Eazy-E's 1988 solo debut ''[[Eazy-Duz-It]]'', [[Above the Law (group)|Above the Law]]'s 1990 debut ''[[Livin' Like Hustlers]]'', [[Michel'le]]'s 1989 [[Michel'le (album)|self-titled debut]], [[The D.O.C.]]'s 1989 debut ''[[No One Can Do It Better]]'', [[J.J. Fad]]'s 1988 debut ''[[Supersonic (J. J.

===1992–1996: ''The Chronic'' and Death Row Records===

After a dispute with Eazy-E, Dre left the group at the peak of its popularity in 1991 under the advice of friend, and N.W.A lyricist, The D.O.C. and his bodyguard at the time, [[Suge Knight]]. Knight, a notorious strongman and intimidator, was able to have Eazy-E release Young from his contract and, using Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre as his flagship artist, founded [[Death Row Records]]. In 1992 Young released his first single, the [[Deep Cover (song)|title track]] to the film ''[[Deep Cover]]'', a collaboration with rapper [[Snoop Dogg]], whom he met through Warren G.&lt;ref name=&quot;AllMusic&quot;/&gt; Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre's debut solo album was ''[[The Chronic]]'', released under Death Row Records with Suge Knight as executive producer. Young ushered in a new style of rap, both in terms of musical style and lyrical content, including introducing a number of artists to the industry including Snoop Dogg, [[Kurupt]], [[Daz Dillinger]], [[RBX]], [[The Lady of Rage]], [[Nate Dogg]] and [[Jewell (singer)|Jewell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Huey|first= Steve|title=&quot;The Chronic&quot; – Overview|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r70573|pure_url=yes}}|website=AllMusic|accessdate=September 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the strength of singles such as &quot;[[Nuthin' but a &quot;G&quot; Thang|Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang]]&quot;, &quot;[[Let Me Ride]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Fuck wit Dre Day (and Everybody's Celebratin')]]&quot; (known as &quot;Dre Day&quot; for radio and television play), all of which featured Snoop Dogg as guest vocalist, ''The Chronic'' became a cultural phenomenon, its [[G-funk]] sound dominating much of hip hop music for the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;AllMusic&quot;/&gt; In 1993 the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) certified the album triple platinum,&lt;ref name=&quot;RIAA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?artist=%22Dr.+Dre%22 |title=Gold &amp; Platinum Dr. Dre |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |accessdate=April 4, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231231917/http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?artist=%22Dr.+Dre%22 |archivedate=December 31, 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre also won the [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance]] for his performance on &quot;Let Me Ride&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;grammy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Dre – Grammy Awards|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p26119|pure_url=yes}}|website=AllMusic|accessdate=February 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For that year, ''Billboard'' magazine also ranked Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre as the eighth best-selling musical artist, ''The Chronic'' as the sixth best-selling album, and &quot;Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang&quot; as the 11th best-selling single.&lt;ref name=&quot;pop life&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Holden|first=Stephen|title=The Pop Life|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/12/movies/the-pop-life-849405.html|work=The New York Times|date=January 14, 1994|accessdate=March 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:California Love (1995), by Tupac Shakur.png|thumb|left|150px|&quot;California Love&quot; earned Dr. Dre his first number one spot on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and two [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations]]

Besides working on his own material, Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre produced Snoop Dogg's debut album ''[[Doggystyle]]'', which became the first debut album for an artist to enter the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album charts at number one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=&quot;Doggystyle&quot; – Overview|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r185654|pure_url=yes}}|website=AllMusic|accessdate=February 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre produced some songs on the soundtracks to the films ''[[Above the Rim]]'' and ''[[Murder Was the Case]]''. He collaborated with fellow N.W.A member Ice Cube for the song &quot;[[Natural Born Killaz]]&quot; in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;AllMusic&quot;/&gt; For the film ''[[Friday (1995 film)|Friday]]'', Dre recorded &quot;[[Keep Their Heads Ringin']]&quot;, which reached number ten on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and number 1 on the Hot Rap Singles (now Hot Rap Tracks) charts.&lt;ref name=&quot;dr-dre-sin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p26119|pure_url=yes}}|title=Dr. Dre – Awards|website=AllMusic|accessdate=January 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Death Row Records signed rapper [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]], and began to position him as their major star: he collaborated with Dr. Dre on the commercially successful single &quot;[[California Love]]&quot;, which became both artists' first song to top the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.&lt;ref name=&quot;AllMusic&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA118#v=onepage | title=Bone Broken: 2Pac Takes Over At No. 1 | journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |date=July 1996 | volume=108 | issue=28 | page=118 | issn=0006-2510 | accessdate=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in March 1996 Young left the label amidst a contract dispute and growing concerns that label boss Suge Knight was corrupt, financially dishonest and out of control. Later that year, he formed his own label, Aftermath Entertainment, under the distribution label for Death Row Records, [[Interscope Records]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AllMusic&quot;/&gt; Subsequently, Death Row Records suffered poor sales by 1997, especially following the death of 2Pac and the [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]] charges brought against Knight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|title=Suge Knight – Biography|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p279843|pure_url=yes}}|website=AllMusic|year=2003|accessdate=February 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Dre also appeared on the single &quot;[[No Diggity]]&quot; by [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] group [[Blackstreet]] in 1996: it too was a sales success, topping the Hot 100 for four consecutive weeks, and later won the award for Best R&amp;B Vocal by a Duo or Group at the [[1997 Grammy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/blackstreet-mn0000049774 | title=Blackstreet – Biography | website=AllMusic | accessdate=April 11, 2013 | author=Huey, Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; After hearing it for the first time, several of Dr. Dre's former Death Row colleagues, including 2Pac, recorded and attempted to release a song titled &quot;[[Toss It Up]]&quot;, containing numerous insults aimed at Dr. Dre and using a deliberately similar instrumental to &quot;No Diggity&quot;, but were forced to replace the production after Blackstreet issued the label with a [[cease and desist]] order stopping them from distributing the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.11343/title.danny-boy-tells-all-about-death-row-years-part-two | title=Danny Boy Tells All About Death Row Years, Part Two | publisher=Cheri Media Group | work=HipHopDX | date=May 27, 2010 | accessdate=April 11, 2013 | author=Arnold, Paul W. | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714231636/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.11343/title.danny-boy-tells-all-about-death-row-years-part-two | archive-date=July 14, 2014 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1996–1998: Move to Aftermath Entertainment ===
The ''[[Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath]]'' album, released on November 26, 1996, featured songs by Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre himself, as well as by newly signed [[Aftermath Entertainment]] artists, and a solo track &quot;[[Been There, Done That (Dr. Dre song)|Been There, Done That]]&quot;, intended as a symbolic farewell to [[gangsta rap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=&quot;Dr. Dre Presents...The Aftermath&quot; – Overview|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r243986|pure_url=yes}}|website=AllMusic|accessdate=February 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being classified platinum by the RIAA,&lt;ref name=&quot;RIAA&quot;/&gt; the album was not very popular among music fans.&lt;ref name=&quot;AllMusic&quot;/&gt; In October 1996, Dre performed &quot;Been There, Done That&quot; on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Dana Carvey/Dr. Dre |url=http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/episodes/Show_963.shtml |series=[[Saturday Night Live]] |number=22-4 |airdate=October 26, 1996 |network=[[NBC]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329123040/http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/episodes/Show_963.shtml |archivedate=March 29, 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Dr. Dre produced several tracks on [[The Firm (hip hop group)|The Firm]]'s ''[[The Album (The Firm album)|The Album]]''; it was met with largely negative reviews from critics.

The turning point for Aftermath came in 1998, when [[Jimmy Iovine]], the head of Aftermath's parent label Interscope, suggested that Dr. Dre sign [[Eminem]], a white rapper from [[Detroit]].

Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre's second solo album, ''[[2001 (Dr. Dre album)|2001]]'', released on November 16, 1999, was considered an ostentatious return to his gangsta rap roots.&lt;ref name=&quot;2001 amg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=&quot;2001&quot; – Overview|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r441973|pure_url=yes}}|website=AllMusic|year=1999|accessdate=February 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially titled ''The Chronic 2000'' to imply being a sequel to his debut solo effort ''The Chronic'' but was re-titled ''2001'' after Death Row Records released an unrelated compilation album with the title ''[[Suge Knight Represents: Chronic 2000]]'' in May 1999.

=== Dr. Dre started Burning Man rumors ===
An urban legend surfaced in 2011 when a tumblr blog titled Dr. Dre Started Burning Man&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Dre Started Burning Man|url=http://drdrestartedburningman.tumblr.com/|website=Dr. Dre Started Burning Man|accessdate=April 19, 2015|ref=dre burning man tumblr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stern|first1=Marlow|title=Did Dr. Dre Discover Burning Man?|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/02/did-dr-dre-discover-burning-man.html|work=The Daily Beast|date=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; began promulgating the notion that the producer, rapper and entrepreneur had discovered [[Burning Man]] in 1995 during a music video shoot and offered to cover the cost of the event's permit from the Nevada Bureau of Land Management under an agreement with the festival's organizers that he could institute an entrance fee system, which had not existed before his participation.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grant|first1=Drew|title=Dr. Dre not actually responsible for Burning Man sucking|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/02/25/dr_dre_burning_man_letter/ |website=Salon.com|accessdate=April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cooper|first1=Duncan |title=Dr. Dre Definitely Started Burning Man|url=http://www.thefader.com/2011/02/10/dr-dre-definitely-started-burning-man|website=Fader|accessdate=April 19, 2015|ref=fader dre burning man}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim was supported by an alleged letter from Dre to Nicole Threatt Young that indicated that Dre had shared his experience witnessing the Burning Man festival with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parkman|first1=Dave|title=Dr. Dre vs. The Hippies: Did Dre Try to Make Money Out of Burning Man?|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/dr-dre-vs-the-hippies-did-dre-try-to-make-money-out-of-burning-man-2410483|website=LA Weekly|publisher=LA Weekly|accessdate=April 19, 2015|ref=LA Weekly Burning Man}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pescovitz|first1=David|title=Burning Man: Dr. Dre considered how to &quot;make some loot off these fools&quot;?|url=http://boingboing.net/2011/02/11/burning-man-dr-dre-c.html|website=Boing Boing|accessdate=April 19, 2015|ref=Boing Boing Burning Man}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Business Insider]]'' mentions the portion of the letter where Dr. Dre purportedly states &quot;someone should get behind this...and make some money off these fools&quot; and compares Dr. Dre's potential entrepreneurial engagement with Burning Man as a parallel to [[Steve Jobs]]' efforts to centralize and profit from the otherwise unorganized online music industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Business Insider Burning Man&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Van Buskirk|first1=Eliot|title=Steve Jobs is the Real Dr. Dre|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-is-the-real-dr-dre-2011-2|accessdate=April 19, 2015|agency=Business Insider|issue=Feb 23, 2011|date=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Salon (website)|''Salon'']], Dr. Dre's ethos seems to be aligned with seven of the ten principles of the Burning Man community: &quot;radical self-reliance, radical self-expression, communal effort, civic responsibility, leaving no trace, participation and immediacy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;salon.com&quot;/&gt;

===Production style===
Dr. Dre is renowned for constantly evolving his production style through the years, while always keeping in touch with his roots and re-shaping elements from previous work. In the start of his career as a producer for the [[World Class Wreckin Cru]] with DJ Alonzo Williams in the mid-1980s, his beats were in the [[electro-hop]] style pioneered by [[The Unknown DJ]], and that of early hip-hop groups like the [[Beastie Boys]] and [[Whodini]]. These influences are evident in [[Eazy-E]]'s 1986 song &quot;[[Boyz-n-the-Hood]],&quot; which Dre produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whosampled.com/sample/23193/Eazy-E-Boyz-N-The-Hood-Original-Concept-Pump-That-Bass/|title=Eazy-E's Boyz-N-The-Hood sample of Original Concept's Pump That Bass – WhoSampled|work=WhoSampled}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sampling was at the time a key element of Dre's production, the [[E-mu SP-1200]] being his primary instrument in the N.W.A days.

In 1987, Dr. Dre sampled the [[Ohio Players]]' [[ARP Pro Soloist|ARP]] synth riffs from their 1973 funk hit &quot;[[Funky Worm]]&quot; in the N.W.A song &quot;Dopeman&quot;. Being the first hip-hop producer to sample the song,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whosampled.com/Ohio-Players/Funky-Worm/|title=Funky Worm|work=WhoSampled}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dre both paved the way for the future popularization of the [[G-funk]] style within hip-hop, and established heavy synthesizer solos as an integral part of his production style. Dr. Dre was also one of the very first producers to interpolate the then little-known [[Amen break|drum break]] from [[The Winstons]]' &quot;[[Amen, Brother]]&quot; in the N.W.A song &quot;[[Straight Outta Compton (song)|Straight Outta Compton]]&quot;. This break has since becοme a staple in not only hip-hop, but all popular music, having been used in over 1700 songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whosampled.com/The-Winstons/Amen,-Brother/|title=Amen, Brother|work=WhoSampled}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'' on, Dre uses live musicians to replay old melodies rather than sampling them. With [[Ruthless Records]], collaborators included guitarist Mike &quot;Crazy Neck&quot; Sims, multi-instrumentalist Colin Wolfe, [[DJ Yella]] and sound engineer Donovan &quot;The Dirt Biker&quot; Sound. Dre is receptive of new ideas from other producers, one example being his fruitful collaboration with [[Above the Law (group)|Above the Law]]'s producer [[Cold 187um]] while at Ruthless. Cold 187&amp;nbsp;um was at the time experimenting with 1970s [[P-Funk]] samples ([[Parliament (band)|Parliament]], [[Funkadelic]], [[Bootsy Collins]], [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] etc.), that Dre also utilized. Dre has since been accused of &quot;stealing&quot; the concept of [[G-funk]] from Cold 187&amp;nbsp;um.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/2012/12/01/on-the-record-and-above-the-law-with-cold187um/|title=AllHipHop &quot;  On the Record and Above the Law With Cold187um|work=AllHipHop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon leaving Ruthless and forming [[Death Row Records]] in 1991, Dre called on veteran West Coast DJ [[Chris &quot;The Glove&quot; Taylor]] and sound engineer Greg &quot;Gregski&quot; Royal, along with Colin Wolfe, to help him on future projects. His 1992 album ''[[The Chronic]]'' is thought to be one of the most well-produced hip-hop albums of all time.&lt;ref name=RapCentral&gt;[http://www.rapcentral.co.uk/drdreLyricsCHRON.html Dr. Dre The Chronic Album Info] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408060315/http://www.rapcentral.co.uk/drdreLyricsCHRON.html |date=April 8, 2014 }}.

Accessed April 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Musical themes included hard-hitting synthesizer solos played by Wolfe, bass-heavy compositions, background female vocals and Dre fully embracing 1970s funk samples. Dre used a [[minimoog]] synth to replay the melody from [[Leon Haywood]]'s 1972 song &quot;I Wanna Do Somethin' Freaky to You&quot; for the Chronic's first single &quot;[[Nuthin' but a &quot;G&quot; Thang]]&quot; which became a global hit. For his new protégé [[Snoop Doggy Dogg]]'s album ''[[Doggystyle]]'', Dre collaborated with then 19-year-old producer [[Daz Dillinger]], who received co-production credits on songs &quot;Serial Killa&quot; and &quot;For all My Niggaz &amp; Bitches&quot;, [[The Dramatics]] bass player [[Edward Tony Green|Tony &quot;T.

The influence of ''The Chronic'' and ''Doggystyle'' on the popular music of the 1990s went not only far beyond the West Coast, but beyond hip-hop as a genre. Artists as diverse as [[Master P]] (&quot;Bout It, Bout It&quot;), [[George Michael]] (&quot;[[Fastlove]]&quot;), [[Mariah Carey]] (&quot;[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy]]&quot;), [[Luis Miguel]] (&quot;Dame&quot;), and [[The Spice Girls]] (&quot;[[Say You'll Be There]]&quot;) used G-funk instrumentation in their songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mariah-carey-daydream/|title=Mariah Carey: Daydream Album Review - Pitchfork|author=|date=|website=pitchfork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160416122950/http://www.myetymology.com/.../G-funk.html] {{dead link|date=October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-03-09/news/9703090194_1_girl-power-dance-floor-fluff|title=Fluffed Up|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bad Boy Records]] producer [[Chucky Thompson]] stated in the April 2004 issue of ''[[XXL magazine|XXL]]'' magazine that the sound of ''Doggystyle'' and ''The Chronic'' was the basis for the [[Notorious B.I.G.]]'s 1995 hit single &quot;[[Big Poppa]]&quot;:

In 1994, starting with the [[Murder was the Case]] soundtrack, Dre attempted to push the boundaries of G-funk further into a darker sound. In songs such as &quot;Murder was the Case&quot; and &quot;[[Natural Born Killaz]]&quot;, the synthesizer pitch is higher and the drum tempo is slowed down to 91 BPM&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.audiokeychain.com/track/PUM/snoop-dogg-murder-was-the-case|title=Key and BPM of Snoop Dogg – Murder Was The Case – AudioKeychain|work=AudioKeychain}}&lt;/ref&gt; (87 BPM in the remix) to create a dark and gritty atmosphere. [[Percussion]] instruments, particularly [[sleigh bells]], are also present. Dre's frequent collaborators from this period included [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] natives Stuart &quot;Stu-B-Doo&quot; Bullard, a multi-instrumentalist from the Ozanam Strings Orchestra,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://harlemworld.wordpress.com/2010/01/29/the-men-behind-the-man-ii-part-2-stu-b-doo/|title=The Men Behind The Man (ii): Part 2: Stu-B-Doo|work=H World}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Sneed]], Stephen &quot;[[Bud'da]]&quot; Anderson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://harlemworld.wordpress.com/2009/11/03/the-men-behind-the-man-part-1-budda-no-homo/|title=The men behind the man. Part 1.Bud'da (no homo) – H World|work=H World}}&lt;/ref&gt; and percussionist Carl &quot;Butch&quot; Small. This style of production has been influential far beyond the West Coast. The beat for the [[Houston]]-based group [[Geto Boys]] 1996 song &quot;Still&quot; follows the same drum pattern as &quot;Natural Born Killaz&quot; and Eazy E's &quot;Wut Would U Do&quot; (a diss to Dre) is similar to the original &quot;Murder was the Case&quot; instrumental. This style of production is usually accompanied by [[Horror fiction|horror]] and [[occult]]-themed lyrics and imagery, being crucial to the creation of [[horrorcore]].

By 1996, Dre was again looking to innovate his sound. He recruited keyboardist Camara Kambon to play the keys on &quot;[[Been There, Done That (Dr. Dre song)|Been There, Done That]]&quot;, and through Bud'da and Sam Sneed he was introduced to fellow Pittsburgh native Melvin &quot;[[Melvin &quot;Mel-Man&quot; Bradford|Mel-Man]]&quot; Bradford. At this time, he also switched from using the E-mu SP-1200 to the Akai MPC3000 drum kit and sampler, which he still uses today. Beginning with his 1996 compilation [[Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath]], Dre's production has taken a less sample-based approach, with loud, layered [[snare drum]]s dominating the mix, while synthesizers are still omnipresent. In his critically acclaimed second album, [[2001 (Dr. Dre album)|2001]], live instrumentation takes the place of sampling, a famous example being &quot;[[The Next Episode]]&quot;, in which keyboardist Camara Kambon re-played live the main melody from [[David McCallum]]'s 1967 jazz-funk work &quot;The Edge&quot;. For every song on ''2001'', Dre had a [[keyboardist]], [[guitarist]] and [[bassist]] create the basic parts of the beat, while he himself programmed the [[drums]], did the [[music sequencer|sequencing]] and [[overdubbing]] and added sound effects, and later mixed the songs. During this period, Dre's signature &quot;west coast whistle&quot; riffs are still present albeit in a lower pitch, as in &quot;Light Speed&quot;, &quot;Housewife&quot;, &quot;Some L.A. Niggaz&quot; and Eminem's &quot;[[Guilty Conscience (song)|Guilty Conscience]]&quot; hook. The sound of &quot;2001&quot; had tremendous influence on hip-hop production, redefining the West Coast's sound and expanding the G-funk of the early 1990s. To produce the album, Dre and Mel-Man relied on the talents of [[Scott Storch]] and Camara Kambon on the keys, [[Mike Elizondo]] and Colin Wolfe on bass guitar, Sean Cruse on lead guitar and sound engineers Richard &quot;Segal&quot; Huredia and Mauricio &quot;Veto&quot; Iragorri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Dr-Dre-2001-/release/6149535|title=Dr. Dre - 2001: Credits|work=Discogs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-2000s, Dr. Dre has taken on a more soulful production style, using more of a classical piano instead of a keyboard, and having [[clapping|claps]] replace snares, as evidenced in songs such as Snoop Dogg's &quot;Imagine&quot; and &quot;[[Boss' Life]]&quot;, [[Busta Rhymes]]' &quot;Get You Some&quot; and &quot;Been Through the Storm&quot;, [[Stat Quo]]'s &quot;Get Low&quot; and &quot;The Way It Be&quot;, Jay-Z's &quot;[[Lost One]]&quot;, Nas' &quot;Hustlers&quot;, and several beats on Eminem's Relapse album. Soul and R&amp;B pianist [[Mark Batson]], having previously worked with [[The Dave Matthews Band]], [[Seal (musician)|Seal]] and [[Maroon 5]] has been credited as the architect of this sound. Besides Batson, Aftermath producer and understudy of Dre's, [[Dawaun Parker]], who has named [[Q-Tip]] and [[J Dilla]] as his primary influences, is thought to be responsible for giving Dre's newest beats an East Coast feel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2kmusic.com/fr/topic/interview-de-dawaun-parker/31490|title=Interview de Dawaun Parker|work=2KMUSIC.COM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production equipment===
Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre has said that his primary instrument in the studio is the [[Music Production Center|Akai MPC3000]], a drum machine and sampler, and that he often uses as many as four or five to produce a single recording. He cites 1970s [[funk]] musicians such as [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], [[Isaac Hayes]] and [[Curtis Mayfield]] as his primary musical influences. Unlike most rap producers, he tries to avoid samples as much as possible, preferring to have studio musicians re-play pieces of music he wants to use, because it allows him more flexibility to change the pieces in rhythm and tempo.&lt;ref name=&quot;scratch 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Dre Interview|url=http://www.dr-dre.com/info/interview_scratch_dr_dre.php|work=[[Scratch (magazine)|Scratch]]|date=May 2004|accessdate=December 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 he told ''Time'' magazine, &quot;I may hear something I like on an old record that may inspire me, but I'd rather use musicians to re-create the sound or elaborate on it. I can control it better.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;in the doctor's house&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Tyrangiel|first=Josh|authorlink=Josh Tyrangiel|title=In the Doctor's House|url=http://www.time.com/time/musicgoesglobal/na/mdre.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831152555/http://www.time.com/time/musicgoesglobal/na/mdre.html|archivedate=August 31, 2010|periodical=TIME|volume=158|issue=14|date=September 15, 2001|accessdate=January 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other equipment he uses includes the [[E-mu SP-1200]] drum machine and other keyboards from such manufacturers as Korg, Rhodes, Wurlitzer, Moog, and Roland.&lt;ref name=&quot;DrDreBio-Ro-2007&quot; /&gt;{{rp|234}} Dr. Dre also stresses the importance of [[Equalization (audio)|equalizing]] drums properly, telling Scratch magazine in 2004 that he &quot;used the same drum sounds on a couple of different songs on one album before but you'd never be able to tell the difference because of the EQ.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dr Dre.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dr-dre.com/info/interview_scratch_dr_dre.php | title=DR. DRE INTERVIEW FROM SCRATCH MAGAZINE | publisher=Dr Dre.com | accessdate=November 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Dre also uses the digital audio workstation [[Pro Tools]] and uses the software to combine hardware drum machines and vintage analog keyboards and synthesizers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dr Dre.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://protoolstutorial.org/blog/top-10-producers-that-use-pro-tools/ | title=Top 10 Producers That Use Pro Tools | publisher=Pro Tools | date=October 20, 2013 | accessdate=November 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After founding Aftermath Entertainment in 1996, Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre took on producer [[Melvin &quot;Mel-Man&quot; Bradford|Mel-Man]] as a co-producer, and his music took on a more synthesizer-based sound, using fewer vocal samples (as he had used on &quot;Lil' Ghetto Boy&quot; and &quot;Let Me Ride&quot; on ''The Chronic'', for example). Mel-Man has not shared co-production credits with Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre since approximately 2002, but fellow Aftermath producer Focus has credited Mel-Man as a key architect of the signature Aftermath sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Focus|url=http://www.aftermathmusic.com/_interviews/focus_may_2004.html|publisher=[[Aftermath Music]]|date=March 14, 2004|accessdate=December 8, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070210083642/http://www.aftermathmusic.com/_interviews/focus_may_2004.html |archivedate = February 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre started working with [[Mike Elizondo]], a bassist, guitarist, and keyboardist who has also produced, written and played on records for female singers such as [[Ann Danielewski|Poe]], [[Fiona Apple]] and [[Alanis Morissette]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Mike Elizondo – Credits|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p240514|pure_url=yes}}|website=AllMusic|accessdate=March 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past few years Elizondo has since worked for many of Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre's productions.&lt;ref name=&quot;shock&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|title=Dr. Dre Hoping To 'Shock' On Next Album|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/61651/dr-dre-hoping-to-shock-on-next-album|work=Billboard|date=August 25, 2005|accessdate=March 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;songwriter universe&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Kawashima|first=Dale|title=Superhot Mike Elizondo Co-Writes/Produces &quot;Just Lose It&quot; for Eminem, &quot;In Da Club&quot; for 50 Cent|url=http://www.songwriteruniverse.com/elizondo.htm|work=Songwriter Universe|year=2005|accessdate=December 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre also told ''[[Scratch (magazine)|Scratch]]'' magazine in a 2004 interview that he has been studying piano and music theory formally, and that a major goal is to accumulate enough musical theory to score movies. In the same interview he stated that he has collaborated with famed 1960s songwriter [[Burt Bacharach]] by sending him hip hop beats to play over, and hopes to have an in-person collaboration with him in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;scratch 2004&quot;/&gt;

=== Work ethic ===
Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre has stated that he is a perfectionist and is known to pressure the artists with whom he records to give flawless performances.&lt;ref name=&quot;scratch 2004&quot;/&gt; In 2006, Snoop Dogg told the website Dubcnn.com that Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre had made new artist [[Bishop Lamont]] re-record a single bar of vocals 107&amp;nbsp;times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snoop Dogg Interview, Part 1|url=http://www.dubcnn.com/interviews/snoopdogg06/part1/|publisher=West Coast News Network|date=July 2006|accessdate=October 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre has also stated that Eminem is a fellow perfectionist, and attributes his success on Aftermath to his similar work ethic.&lt;ref name=&quot;scratch 2004&quot;/&gt; He gives a lot of input into the delivery of the vocals and will stop an [[MC]] during a take if it is not to his liking.&lt;ref name=&quot;HowToRap-MC-2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first=Paul|title=[[How to Rap|How to Rap: The Art and Science of the Hip-Hop MC.]]|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|date=2009|ISBN=978-1-569-76375-9|OCLC=527853431}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|285–286}} However, he gives MCs that he works with room to write lyrics without too much instruction unless it is a specifically conceptual record, as noted by [[Bishop Lamont]] in the book ''[[How to Rap]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;HowToRap-MC-2009&quot; /&gt;{{rp|234–235}}

A consequence of his perfectionism is that some artists who initially sign deals with Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre's Aftermath label never release albums. In 2001, Aftermath released the soundtrack to the movie ''The Wash'', featuring a number of Aftermath acts such as Shaunta, Daks, Joe Beast and Toi. To date, none have released full-length albums on Aftermath and have apparently ended their relationships with the label and Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre. Other noteworthy acts to leave Aftermath without releasing albums include [[King Tee]], ''2001'' vocalist Hittman, [[Joell Ortiz]], [[Raekwon]] and [[Rakim]].&lt;ref name=&quot;source 2003&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Before &amp; Aftermath|newspaper=[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]|pages=100–102|issue=168|date=September 2003|url=http://www.hiphopgame.com/index2.php3?page=dresource|access-date=February 16, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401101228/http://www.hiphopgame.com/index2.php3?page=dresource|archive-date=April 1, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collaborators and co-producers ===
[[File:Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre.jpg|thumb|left|Dr. Dre performing with Snoop Dogg, 2012]]
Over the years, word of other collaborators who have contributed to Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre's work has surfaced. During his tenure at Death Row Records, it was alleged that Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre's stepbrother Warren G and [[Tha Dogg Pound]] member [[Daz Dillinger|Daz]] made many uncredited contributions to songs on his solo album ''The Chronic'' and Snoop Doggy Dogg's album ''[[Doggystyle]]'' (Daz received production credits on Snoop's similar-sounding, albeit less successful album ''Tha Doggfather'' after Young left Death Row Records).&lt;ref name=&quot;DPG-Eulogy&quot;&gt;Tha Dogg Pound. (2005). ''[[DPG Eulogy]]'' [DVD]. Innovative Distribution Network. Retrieved April 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is known that [[Scott Storch]], who has since gone on to become a successful producer in his own right, contributed to Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre's second album ''2001''; Storch is credited as a songwriter on several songs and played keyboards on several tracks. In 2006 he told ''Rolling Stone'':

{{quote|At the time, I saw Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre desperately needed something,&quot; Storch says. &quot;He needed a fuel injection, and Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre utilized me as the nitrous oxide. He threw me into the mix, and I sort of tapped on a new flavor with my whole piano sound and the strings and orchestration. So I'd be on the keyboards, and Mike [Elizondo] was on the bass guitar, and Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre was on the drum machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scott Storch's Outrageous Fortune|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10699242/scott_storchs_outrageous_fortune/print|work=Rolling Stone|date=June 29, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419055040/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10699242/scott_storchs_outrageous_fortune/print|archivedate=April 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Current collaborator [[Mike Elizondo]], when speaking about his work with Young, describes their recording process as a collaborative effort involving several musicians. In 2004 he claimed to ''Songwriter Universe'' magazine that he had written the foundations of the hit Eminem song &quot;[[The Real Slim Shady]]&quot;, stating, &quot;I initially played a bass line on the song, and Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre, Tommy Coster Jr. and I built the track from there. [[Eminem]] then heard the track, and he wrote the rap to it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;songwriter universe&quot;/&gt; This account is essentially confirmed by Eminem in his book ''Angry Blonde'', stating that the tune for the song was composed by a studio bassist and keyboardist while Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre was out of the studio but Young later programmed the song's beat after returning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eminem|authorlink=Eminem|title=Angry Blonde|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dmIJ1crh9DwC|year=2000|place=New York City|publisher=[[Regan Books]]|isbn=0-06-620922-6 |page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of disgruntled former associates of Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre complained that they had not received their full due for work on the label in the September 2003 issue of ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]''. A producer named Neff-U claimed to have produced the songs &quot;Say What You Say&quot; and &quot;My Dad's Gone Crazy&quot; on ''[[The Eminem Show]]'', the songs &quot;If I Can't&quot; and &quot;Back Down&quot; on 50 Cent's ''[[Get Rich or Die Tryin' (album)|Get Rich or Die Tryin']]'', and the beat featured on Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre's commercial for [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors beer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;source 2003&quot;/&gt;

Although Young studies piano and musical theory, he serves as more of a [[conductor (music)|conductor]] than a musician himself, as Josh Tyrangiel of ''TIME'' magazine has noted:

{{quote|Every Dre track begins the same way, with Dre behind a drum machine in a room full of trusted musicians. (They carry beepers. When he wants to work, they work.) He'll program a beat, then ask the musicians to play along; when Dre hears something he likes, he isolates the player and tells him how to refine the sound. &quot;My greatest talent,&quot; Dre says, &quot;is knowing exactly what I want to hear.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;in the doctor's house&quot;/&gt;}}

Although Snoop Dogg retains working relationships with Warren G and Daz, who are alleged to be uncredited contributors on the hit albums ''The Chronic'' and ''Doggystyle'', he states that Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre is capable of making beats without the help of collaborators, and that he is responsible for the success of his numerous albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snoop Dogg Interview Part 4|url=http://www.dubcnn.com/interviews/snoopdogg06/part4/|publisher=West Coast News Network|date=July 2006|accessdate=October 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre's prominent studio collaborators, including [[Scott Storch]], Elizondo, [[Mark Batson]] and [[Dawaun Parker]], have shared co-writing, instrumental, and more recently co-production credits on the songs where he is credited as the producer.

[[Anderson Paak]] also praised Dr. Dre in a 2016 interview with ''Music Times,'' telling the publication that it was a dream come true to work with Dre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Anderson .Paak Talks 'Malibu,' Working with Dr. Dre, Growth and More [Q&amp;A]|url = http://www.musictimes.com/articles/61870/20160115/anderson-paak-talks-malibu-working-dr-dre-growth-more-q.htm|website = Music Times|date = January 15, 2016|access-date = February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ghostwriters ===
It is acknowledged that most of Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre's raps are written for him by others, though he retains ultimate control over his lyrics and the themes of his songs.&lt;ref name=&quot;HowToRap-MC-2009&quot; /&gt;{{rp|229}} As Aftermath producer Mahogany told ''Scratch'': &quot;It's like a class room in [the booth]. He'll have three writers in there. They'll bring in something, he'll recite it, then he'll say, 'Change this line, change this word,' like he's grading papers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;scratch 2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Barrow|first=Jerry L.|last2=Basch|first2=Josephine|last3=Blanco|first3=Alvin|last4=Golianopolous|first4=Thomas|title=The Legend of Detox|periodical=[[Scratch (magazine)|Scratch]]|date=September–October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As seen in the credits for tracks Young has appeared on, there are often multiple people who contribute to his songs (although often in hip hop many people are officially credited as a writer for a song, even the producer).

In the book ''[[How to Rap]]'', [[RBX]] explains that writing ''[[The Chronic]]'' was a &quot;team effort&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HowToRap-MC-2009&quot; /&gt;{{rp|MC}} and details how he [[ghostwriter|ghostwrote]] &quot;[[Let Me Ride]]&quot; for Dre.&lt;ref name=&quot;HowToRap-MC-2009&quot; /&gt;{{rp|MC}} In regard to ghostwriting lyrics he says, &quot;Dre doesn't profess to be no super-duper rap dude – Dre is a super-duper producer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HowToRap-MC-2009&quot; /&gt;{{rp|MC}} As a member of N.W.A, The D.O.C. wrote lyrics for him while he stuck with producing.&lt;ref name=&quot;doc formula&quot;/&gt; New York City rapper [[Jay-Z]] ghostwrote lyrics for the single &quot;Still D.R.E.&quot; from Dr.&amp;nbsp;Dre's album ''2001''.&lt;ref name=&quot;changes 2001&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Gill|first=John|title=Dr. Dre Changes Album Title...

During press for the 2015 film ''Straight Outta Compton,'' questions about the portrayal and behavior of Dr. Dre and other prominent figures in the rap community about violence against women – and the question about its absence in the film – were raised.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes-Apologizes-2015&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Coscarelli|first1=Joe|title=Dr. Dre Apologizes to the 'Women I've Hurt'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/22/arts/music/dr-dre-apologizes-to-the-women-ive-hurt.html|accessdate=August 22, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion about the film led to Dre addressing his past behavior in the press.

I was young, fucking stupid. I would say all the allegations aren't true—some of them are. Those are some of the things that I would like to take back. It was really fucked up.

In a statement to ''[[The New York Times]]'' on August 21, 2015, Dre again addressed his abusive past, stating, &quot;Twenty-five years ago I was a young man drinking too much and in over my head with no real structure in my life. However, none of this is an excuse for what I did. I've been married for 19 years and every day I'm working to be a better man for my family, seeking guidance along the way. I'm doing everything I can so I never resemble that man again.&quot; He went on to apologize to all the women he abused, saying, &quot;I apologize to the women I've hurt. I deeply regret what I did and know that it has forever impacted all of our lives.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes-Apologizes-2015&quot;/&gt;
