The body of water on the left is the [[Aegean Sea]], while the one on the upper right is the [[Sea of Marmara]]. The Dardanelles is the tapered waterway running diagonally between the two seas, from the northeast to the southwest. The long, narrow upper peninsula on the northern shores of the strait is [[Gallipoli]] ({{lang-tr|Gelibolu}}), and constitutes the banks of the continent of Europe, while the lower peninsula is [[Troad]] ({{lang-tr|Biga}}) and constitutes the banks of the continent of [[Asia]]. The city of [[Çanakkale]] is visible along the shores of the lower peninsula, centered at the only point where a sharp outcropping juts into the otherwise-linear Dardanelles.]]

The '''Dardanelles''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ɑːr|d|ə|ˈ|n|ɛ|l|z}}; {{lang-tr|Çanakkale Boğazı|lit=Strait of [[Çanakkale]]}}, {{lang-el|Δαρδανέλλια|translit=Dardanéllia}}), also known from [[Classical Antiquity]] as the '''Hellespont'''
({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|l|ᵻ|s|p|ɒ|n|t}}; {{lang-grc-x-classical|Ἑλλήσποντος|translit=Hellēspontos|lit=Sea of [[Helle (mythology)|Helle]]}}), is a narrow, natural [[strait]] and internationally significant waterway in northwestern [[Turkey]] that forms part of the continental boundary between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]], and separates [[Anatolia|Asian Turkey]] from [[East Thrace|European Turkey]]. One of the world's narrowest straits used for [[International waterway|international navigation]], the Dardanelles connects the [[Sea of Marmara]] with the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and  [[Mediterranean Sea]]s, while also allowing passage to the [[Black Sea]] by extension via the [[Bosphorus]]. The Dardanelles is {{convert|61|km|mi}} long, and {{convert|1.2|to|6|km|mi}} wide, averaging {{convert|55|m|ft}} deep with a maximum depth of {{convert|103|m|ft}} at its narrowest point abreast the city of [[Çanakkale]].

Most of the northern shores of the strait along the [[Gallipoli]] Peninsula ({{lang-tr|Gelibolu}}) are sparsely settled, while the southern shores along the [[Troad]] Peninsula ({{lang-tr|Biga}}) are inhabited by the city of Çanakkale's urban population of 110,000.

Together with the [[Bosphorus]], the Dardanelles forms the [[Turkish Straits]].

==Name==
The contemporary Turkish name {{lang|tr|Çanakkale Boğazı}}, meaning '{{lang|tr|Çanakkale|italic=no}} Strait', is derived from the [[Çanakkale|eponymous midsize city]] that adjoins the strait, itself meaning 'pottery fort'—from {{wikt-lang|ota|چاناق}} ({{lang|ota-Latn|çanak}}, 'pottery') + {{wikt-lang|ota|قلعه}} ({{wikt-lang|tr|kale}}, 'fortress')—in reference to the area's famous pottery and ceramic wares, and the landmark Ottoman fortress of Sultaniye.

The English name ''Dardanelles'' is an abbreviation of ''Strait of the Dardanelles''. During Ottoman times there was a castle on each side of the strait. These castles together were called the ''Dardanelles'',&lt;ref&gt;David van Hoogstraten and Matthaeus Brouërius van Nidek, ''Groot algemeen historisch, geografisch, genealogisch, en oordeelkundig woordenboek'', Volume 5, Amsterdam/Utrecht/The Hague 1729, p. 25, s.v. '[https://books.google.nl/books?id=gM-Ioe4CVgYC&amp;pg=PA25 Dardanellen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024131728/https://books.google.nl/books?id=gM-Ioe4CVgYC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=roumeli+iski-issar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hmSzTovLCV&amp;sig=xxcHuj-Bjp4xaKd0NjcNi1W6I_4&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjroKyBovfTAhXsCsAKHVOqCPEQ6AEIPDAH |date=24 October 2017 }}'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Crabb (writer)|George Crabb]], ''Universal Historical Dictionary'', Volume 1, London 1825, s.v.

The ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] name {{lang|grc|Ἑλλήσποντος}} ({{lang|grc|Hellēspontos}}) means &quot;Sea of Helle&quot;, and was the ancient name of the narrow strait. It was variously named in classical literature {{lang|la|Hellespontium Pelagus}}, {{lang|la|Rectum Hellesponticum}}, and {{lang|la|Fretum Hellesponticum}}. It was so called from [[Helle (mythology)|Helle]], the daughter of Athamas, who was drowned here in the mythology of the [[Golden Fleece]].

==Geography==

As a [[wikt:maritime|maritime]] [[waterway]], the Dardanelles connects various seas along the [[Eastern Mediterranean]], the [[Balkans]], the [[Near East]], and [[Western Eurasia]], and specifically connects the [[Aegean Sea]] to the [[Sea of Marmara]]. The Marmara further connects to the [[Black Sea]] via the [[Bosphorus]], while the Aegean further links to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Thus, the Dardanelles allows maritime connections from the Black Sea all the way to the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean via Gibraltar, and the Indian Ocean through the [[Suez Canal]], making it a crucial international waterway, in particular for the passage of goods coming in from [[Russia]].

The strait is located at approximately {{coord|40|13|N|26|26|E|}}.

===Present morphology===

The strait is {{convert|61|km|mi}} long, and {{convert|1.2|to|6|km|mi}} wide, averaging {{convert|55|m|ft}} deep with a maximum depth of {{convert|103|m|ft}} at its narrowest point at [[Nara Burnu]], abreast [[Çanakkale]].&lt;ref&gt;Nautical Chart at GeoHack-Dardanelles, Map Tech&lt;/ref&gt; There are two major currents through the strait: a [[surface current]] flows from the Black Sea towards the Aegean Sea, and a more saline [[subsurface current|undercurrent]] flows in the opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rozakēs|first1=Chrēstos L.|title=The Turkish Straits|date=1987|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=9024734649|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yJc7HWhF-K8C|accessdate=1 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dardanelles is unique in many respects. The very narrow and winding shape of the strait is more akin to that of a river. It is considered one of the most hazardous, crowded, difficult and potentially dangerous waterways in the world. The currents produced by the tidal action in the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara are such that ships under sail must await at anchorage for the right conditions before entering the Dardanelles.

==History==

As part of the only passage between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, the Dardanelles has always been of great importance from a commercial and military point of view, and remains strategically important today. It is a major sea access route for numerous countries, including [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]. Control over it has been an objective of a number of hostilities in modern history, notably the attack of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] on the Dardanelles during the 1915 [[Battle of Gallipoli]] in the course of [[World War I]].

===Ancient Greek, Persian, Roman, and Byzantine eras (pre-1454)===

====Greek and Persian history====
The ancient city of [[Troy]] was located near the western entrance of the strait, and the strait's Asiatic shore was the focus of the [[Trojan War]]. Troy was able to control the marine traffic entering this vital waterway. The [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] army of [[Xerxes I of Persia]] and later the Macedonian army of [[Alexander the Great]] crossed the Dardanelles in opposite directions to invade each other's lands, in 480 BC and 334 BC respectively.

[[Herodotus]] says that, circa 482 BC, Xerxes I (the son of [[Darius the Great|Darius]]) had two [[pontoon bridge]]s built across the width of the Hellespont at [[Abydos, Hellespont|Abydos]], in order that his huge army could cross from Persia into [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. This crossing was named by [[Aeschylus]] in his tragedy ''[[The Persians]]'' as the cause of divine intervention against Xerxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aeschylus/persians.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2003-09-26 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031119043049/http://classics.mit.edu/Aeschylus/persians.html |archivedate=19 November 2003 |df=dmy-all }}; the play.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Herodotus (vv.34), both bridges were destroyed by a storm and [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] had those responsible for building the bridges beheaded and the strait itself whipped. [[The Histories of Herodotus]] vii.33–37 and vii.54–58 give details of building and crossing of [[Xerxes' Pontoon Bridges]]. Xerxes is then said to have thrown [[fetters]] into the strait, given it three hundred lashes and branded it with red-hot irons as the soldiers shouted at the water.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Peter ''The Greco-Persian Wars'' (London 1996) 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herodotus commented that this was a &quot;highly presumptuous way to address the Hellespont&quot; but in no way atypical of Xerxes. (vii.35)

[[Harpalus (engineer)|Harpalus the engineer]] eventually helped the invading armies to cross by lashing the ships together with their bows facing the current and, so it is said, two additional anchors.

From the perspective of [[ancient Greek mythology]], it was said that [[Helle (mythology)|Helle]], the daughter of Athamas, was drowned at the Dardanelles in the legend of the [[Golden Fleece]]. Likewise, the strait was the scene of the legend of [[Hero and Leander]], wherein the lovesick Leander swam the strait nightly in order to tryst with his beloved, the priestess Hero, and was drowned in a storm.

====Byzantine history====

The Dardanelles were vital to the defence of [[Constantinople]] during the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period.

Also, the Dardanelles was an important source of income for the ruler of the region. At the [[Istanbul]] Archaeological Museum a marble plate contains a law by the [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Byzantine Emperor Anastasius I]] (491–518 AD), that regulated fees for passage through the customs office of the Dardanelles. Translation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... Whoever dares to violate these regulations shall no longer be regarded as a friend, and he shall be punished. Besides, the administrator of the Dardanelles must have the right to receive 50 golden Litrons, so that these rules, which we make out of piety, shall never ever be violated... ... The distinguished governor and major of the capital, who already has both hands full of things to do, has turned to our lofty piety in order to reorganize the entry and exit of all ships through the Dardanelles... ... Starting from our day and also in the future, anybody who wants to pass through the Dardanelles must pay the following: &lt;br /&gt;
– All wine merchants who bring wine to the capital (Constantinopolis), except [[Cilicia]]ns, have to pay the Dardanelles officials 6 [[follis]] and 2 [[sextarius]] of wine. &lt;br /&gt;
– In the same manner, all merchants of olive-oil, vegetables and lard must pay the Dardanelles officials 6 follis. Cilician sea-merchants have to pay 3 follis and in addition to that, 1 keration (12 follis) to enter, and 2 keration to exit.&lt;br /&gt;
– All wheat merchants have to pay the officials 3 follis per modius, and a further sum of 3 follis when leaving.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since the 14th century the Dardanelles have almost continuously been controlled by the Turks.

===Ottoman era (1354–1922)===

The Dardanelles continued to constitute an important waterway during the period of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which [[Fall of Gallipoli|conquered Gallipoli]] in 1354.

Ottoman control of the strait continued largely without interruption or challenges until the 19th century, when the Empire started [[Decline of the Ottoman Empire | its decline]].

====Nineteenth century====
Gaining control of or guaranteed access to the strait became a key foreign-policy goal of the [[Russian Empire]] during the 19th century. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Russia—supported by [[United Kingdom |Great Britain]] in the [[Dardanelles Operation]]—[[Battle of the Dardanelles (1807)| blockaded the straits]] in 1807. Following the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s defeat in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)| Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829]], in 1833 Russia pressured the Ottomans to sign the [[Treaty of Hunkiar Iskelesi]]—which required the closing of the straits to warships of non-Black Sea powers at Russia's request. That would have effectively given Russia a free hand in the Black Sea.

That treaty alarmed the losers,{{clarify|date=April 2012}}&lt;!--it is unclear who the losers are. The Ottomans?--&gt; who were concerned that the consequences of potential Russian expansionism in the Black Sea and Mediterranean regions could conflict with their own possessions and economic interest in the region. At the [[London Straits Convention]] in July 1841, the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Austria]], and [[Prussia]] pressured Russia to agree that only Turkish warships could traverse the Dardanelles in peacetime. The United Kingdom and France subsequently sent their fleets through the straits to defend the Danube front and to attack the [[Crimean Peninsula]] during the [[Crimean War]] of 1853-1856 —but they did so as allies of the Ottoman Empire. Following the defeat of Russia in the Crimean War, the [[Congress of Paris]] in 1856 formally reaffirmed the London Straits Convention. It remained technically in force into the 20th and 21st centuries.

====World War I====
{{Main|Occupation of Constantinople|Chanak Crisis}}
{{Main|Gallipoli Campaign}}

In 1915 the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] sent a substantial invasion force of British, Indian, Australian, New Zealand, French and Newfoundland troops to attempt to open up the straits. In the [[Gallipoli campaign]], Turkish troops trapped the Allies on the coasts of the Gallipoli peninsula. The campaign did damage to the career of [[Winston Churchill]], then the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] (in office 1911-1915), who had eagerly promoted the unsuccessful use of [[Royal Navy]] [[sea-power]] to force open the straits. [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], later founder of the [[Republic of Turkey#Republic era| Republic of Turkey]], served as a commander for the Ottomans during the land campaign.

The Turks mined the straits to prevent Allied ships from penetrating them, but in minor actions, two submarines, one British and one Australian, did succeed in penetrating the minefields. The British submarine sank an obsolete Turkish [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] off the [[Golden Horn]] of Istanbul. [[Ian Hamilton (British Army officer) |Sir Ian Hamilton]]'s [[Mediterranean Expeditionary Force]] failed in its attempt to capture the Gallipoli peninsula, and the British cabinet ordered its withdrawal in December 1915, after eight months' fighting. Total Allied deaths included 43,000 British and Irish, 15,000 French, 8,700 Australians, 2,700 New Zealanders, 1,370 Indians and 49 Newfoundlanders.{{cn|date=September 2019}} Total Turkish deaths were around 60,000.

Following the war, the 1920 [[Treaty of Sèvres]] demilitarized the strait and made it an international territory under the control of the [[League of Nations]]. The Ottoman Empire's non-ethnically Turkish territories were broken up and partitioned among the Allied Powers, and Turkish jurisdiction over the [[Turkish Straits|straits]] curbed.

===Turkish republican and modern eras (1923–present)===
After the dissolution of the [[Ottoman Empire]] following a lengthy campaign by Turks as part of the [[Turkish War of Independence]] against both the Allied Powers and the Ottoman court, the [[Republic of Turkey]] was created in 1923 by the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]], which established most of the modern sovereign territory of Turkey and restored the [[Turkish Straits|straits]] to Turkish territory, with the condition that Turkey keep them demilitarized and allow all foreign warships and commercial shipping to traverse the straits freely.

As part of its national security strategy, Turkey eventually rejected the terms of the treaty, and subsequently remilitarized [[Turkish Straits|the straits]] area over the following decade. Following extensive diplomatic negotiations, the reversion was formalized under the [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits]] in July 20, 1936. That convention, which is still in force today, treats the straits as an international shipping lane while allowing Turkey to retain the right to restrict the naval traffic of non-Black Sea states.

During [[World War II]], through February 1945, when Turkey was neutral for most of the length of the conflict, the Dardanelles were closed to the ships of the belligerent nations. Turkey declared war on Germany in February 1945, but it did not employ any offensive forces during the war.

In July 1946, the [[Soviet Union]] sent a note to Turkey proposing a new régime for the Dardanelles that would have excluded all nations except the Black Sea powers. The second proposal was that the straits should be put under joint Turkish-Soviet defence. This meant that Turkey, the Soviet Union, Bulgaria and Romania would be the only states having access to the Black Sea through the Dardanelles. The Turkish government however, under pressure from the United States, rejected these proposals.&lt;ref&gt;Cabell, Phillips, The Truman presidency : the history of a triumphant succession (New York 1966), 102 - 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey joined [[NATO]] in 1952, thus affording its straits even more strategic importance as a commercial and military waterway.

In more recent years,{{when|date=March 2019}} the [[Turkish Straits]] have become particularly important for the oil industry. Russian oil, from ports such as [[Novorossyisk]], is exported by tankers primarily to western Europe and the U.S. via the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles straits.

== Crossings ==

=== Maritime ===

The waters of the Dardanelles are traversed by numerous passenger and vehicular ferries daily, as well as recreational and fishing boats ranging from dinghies to yachts owned by both public and private entities.

The strait also experiences significant amounts of international commercial shipping traffic by [[Cargo ship|freighters]] and [[Tanker (ship)|tankers]].

=== Land ===

At present, there are no vehicular crossings across the strait. However, as part of planned expansions to the Turkish National Highway Network, the Turkish Government is considering the construction of [[Çanakkale Suspension Bridge|a suspension bridge]] between [[Sarıçay]] (a district of [[Çanakkale Province]]) on the Asian side, to [[Kilitbahir]] on the European side, at the narrowest part of the strait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bosphorus Technical Consulting Corporation |url=http://www.botek.info/detay_motor_12.html |archivedate=2013-11-06 |website=www.botek.info |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106053434/http://www.botek.info/detay_motor_12.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, construction of the [[Çanakkale 1915 Bridge]] between the cities of [[Gelibolu]] and [[Lapseki]] started.

=== Subsea ===

2 [[submarine cable]] systems transmitting electric power at 400 kV voltage bridge the Dardanelles to feed west and east of Istanbul. They have their own landing stations in Lapseki and Sütlüce. The first, situated in the northeast quarter portion of the strait, has been energised in April 2015 and leads 2 [[Gigawatt|GW]] via 6 phases 400 kV AC 3.9&amp;nbsp;km far thru the sea. The second, somewhat in the middle of the strait, has been still under construction in June 2016 and has quite similar data.

Both subsea power lines cross 4 optical fibre data lines laid earlier along the strait.&lt;ref&gt;Gülnazi Yüce: [http://hro-cigre.hr/downloads/SEERC_CD/papers/topic_2/2-03_presentation.pdf Submarine Cable Projects (2-03)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409043054/http://hro-cigre.hr/downloads/SEERC_CD/papers/topic_2/2-03_presentation.pdf |date=9 April 2018 }} presented at First South East European

== In popular culture ==
English [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poet [[Lord Byron]] (1788–1824) swam across the Dardanelles on 3 May 1810, and recorded it in his poem ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' (1821).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/lord-byron-swims-the-hellespont |website=www.history.com |series=THIS DAY IN HISTORY |title=Lord Byron swims the Hellespont - May 03, 1810 - HISTORY.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307192340/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/lord-byron-swims-the-hellespont |archivedate=7 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/sep/30/escape.turkey|title=The day I swam all the way to Asia|first=Matt|last=Barr|date=29 September 2007|website=the Guardian|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230200248/https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/sep/30/escape.turkey|archivedate=30 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Çanakkale]], located along the southern shores of the strait, is the finishing point every year for an organised swim across the Dardanelles, which kicks off from [[Eceabat]]. This event emulates the swim in 1810 by Lord Byron, who was himself emulating the legendary swim by Leander in the story of [[Hero and Leander]].

The shores of the strait are also the site of ancient [[Troy]]. The &quot;wooden horse&quot; from the 2004 movie ''[[Troy (movie)|Troy]]'' is exhibited on the seafront.

The Dardanelles is also the site of two notable maritime accidents in Turkish naval history, when two generations of the submarine '''TCG Dumlupinar''' were struck by tankers on their way back from naval missions. The [[TCG Dumlupınar (1950)|first incident]] resulted in the deaths of 96 sailors, while the [[TCG Dumlupınar (S339)|second incident]] had no fatalities.

Due to the importance of the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] in many countries' histories, the Dardanelles also features prominently in many documentaries and films about [[World War I]].
