{{History of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
{{more citations needed|date=May 2014}}

Discovered in the 1990s, the earliest discovered human remains in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] have been dated to approximately 90,000 years ago. The first real states, such as the Kongo, the Lunda, the Luba and Kuba, appeared south of the [[Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests|equatorial forest]] on the savannah from the 14th century onwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Congo : the epic history of a people|last=Van Reybrouck|first=David|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2015|isbn=9780062200129|edition=|location=New York, NY|pages=Chapters 1 and 2|oclc=881042212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kingdom of Congo|Kingdom of Kongo]] controlled much of western and central Africa including what is now the western portion of the DR Congo between the 14th and the early 19th centuries. At its peak it had many as 500,000 people, and its capital was known as [[Mbanza-Kongo]] (south of [[Matadi]], in modern day [[Angola]]). In the late 15th century, Portuguese sailors arrived in the Kingdom of Kongo, and this led to a period of great prosperity and consolidation, with the king's power being founded on Portuguese trade. [[Afonso I of Kongo|King Afonso I]] (1506–1543) had raids carried out on neighbouring districts in response to Portuguese requests for slaves. After his death, the kingdom underwent a deep crisis.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The [[Atlantic slave trade]] occurred from approximately 1500 to 1850, with the entire west coast of Africa targeted, but the region around the mouth of the [[Congo River|Congo]] suffered the most intensive enslavement. Over a strip of coastline about {{convert|400|km|mi}} long, about 4 million people were enslaved and sent across the Atlantic to sugar plantations in Brazil, the US and the Caribbean. From 1780 onwards, there was higher demand for slaves in the US which led to more people being enslaved. By 1780, more than 15,000 people were shipped annually from the Loango Coast, north of the Congo.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

In 1870, explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]] arrived in and explored what is now the DC congo [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgian colonization]] of the DR Congo began in 1885 when [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]] founded and ruled the [[Congo Free State]]. However, de facto control of such as huge area took decades to achieve. Many outposts were built to extend the power of the state over such a vast territory. In 1885, the [[Force Publique]] was set up, a colonial army with white officers and black soldiers. In 1886, Leopold made Camille Jansen the first Belgian governor-general of Congo. Over the late 19th century, various Christian (including Catholic and Protestant) missionaries arrived intending to convert the local population. A railway between Matadi and [[Stanley Pool]] was built in the 1890s.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Reports of widespread murder, torture and other abuses in the rubber plantations led to international and Belgian outrage and the Belgian government transferred control of the region from Leopold II and established the [[Belgian Congo]] in 1908. 

After an uprising by the Congolese people, Belgium surrendered and this led to the [[Congo Crisis|independence of the Congo]] in 1960. However, the Congo remained unstable because regional leaders had more power than the central government, with [[State of Katanga|Katanga]] attempting to gain independence with Belgian support. [[Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Prime Minister]] [[Patrice Lumumba]] tried to restore order with the aid of the [[Soviet Union]] as part of the [[Cold War]], causing the [[United States]] to support a coup led by Colonel [[Mobuto Sese Seko|Joseph Mobutu]] in 1965. Mobutu quickly seized complete power of the Congo and renamed the country [[Zaire]]. He sought to [[Africanization|Africanize]] the country, changing his own name to Mobutu Sese Seko, and demanded that African citizens change their Western names to traditional African names. Mobutu sought to repress any opposition to his rule, which he successfully did throughout the 1980s. However, with his regime weakened in the 1990s, Mobutu was forced to agree to a power-sharing government with the opposition party. Mobutu remained the [[List of Presidents of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|head of state]] and promised elections within the next two years that never took place. 

During the [[First Congo War]], [[Rwanda]] invaded Zaire, in which Mobutu lost his power during this process. In 1997, [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]] took power and renamed the country the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Afterwards, the [[Second Congo War]] broke out, resulting in a regional war in which many different African nations took part and in which millions of people were killed or displaced. Kabila was assassinated by his bodyguard in 2001, and his son, [[Joseph Kabila|Joseph]], succeeded him and was later [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2006|elected president by the Congolese government]] in 2006. Joseph Kabila quickly sought peace. Foreign soldiers remained in the Congo for a few years and a power-sharing government between Joseph Kabila and the opposition party was set up. Joseph Kabila later resumed complete control over the Congo and was [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2011|re-elected in a disputed election]] in 2011. In 2018, [[Félix Tshisekedi]] was elected President; in the first peaceful transfer of power since independence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/felix-tshisekedi-sworn-dr-congo-president-190124132340652.html Opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi sworn in as DR Congo president].

[[File:Mercator Congo map.jpg|thumb|200px|Map of the Kingdom of Kongo]]
The area now known as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] was populated as early as 80,000 years ago, as shown by the 1988 discovery of the [[Semliki harpoon]] at [[Katanda Territory|Katanda]], one of the oldest barbed harpoons ever found, which is believed to have been used to catch giant river catfish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/behavior/katanda-bone-harpoon-point |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302062128/http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/behavior/katanda-bone-harpoon-point |archivedate=2 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Barbed Bone Points: Tradition and Continuity in Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africa | doi=10.1023/A:1021659928822 | volume=15 |issue = 3| year=1998 | journal=African Archaeological Review | pages=173–198 | last1 = Yellen | first1 = John E. }}&lt;/ref&gt; During its recorded history, the area has also been known as ''Congo'', ''Congo Free State'', ''Belgian Congo'', and ''Zaire''. 

The [[Kingdom of Kongo]] existed from the 14th to the early 19th century. Until the arrival of the Portuguese it was the dominant force in the region along with the [[Kingdom of Luba]], the [[Kingdom of Lunda]], the [[Mongo people]] and the [[Anziku Kingdom]].

===Congo Free State (1869–1908)===
{{Main|Congo Free State}}
[[File:MutilatedChildrenFromCongo.jpg|thumb|200px|Children mutilated during King Leopold II's rule]]
The Congo Free State was a [[corporate state]] privately controlled by [[Leopold II of Belgium]] through the ''[[International African Association|Association internationale africaine]]'', a non-governmental organization. Leopold was the sole shareholder and chairman. The state included the entire area of the present [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Under Leopold II, the Congo Free State became one of the most infamous international scandals of the turn of the twentieth century. The report of the British Consul [[Roger Casement]] led to the arrest and punishment of white officials who had been responsible for cold-blooded killings during a rubber-collecting expedition in 1900, including a Belgian national who caused the shooting of at least 122 Congolese natives. Estimates of the total death toll vary considerably. The first census was only done in 1924, so it is even more difficult to quantify the population loss of the period. Roger Casement's famous 1904 report estimated ten million people. According to Casement's report, indiscriminate &quot;war&quot;, starvation, reduction of births and [[tropical diseases]] caused the country's depopulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urome.be/fr2/reflexions/casemrepo.pdf Report of the British Consul, Roger Casement, on the Administration of the Congo Free State]&lt;/ref&gt; European and U.S. press agencies exposed the conditions in the Congo Free State to the public in 1900. By 1908 public and diplomatic pressure had led Leopold II to annex the Congo as the [[Belgian Congo]] colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ewans|first1=Sir Martin|title=European atrocity, African catastrophe : Leopold II, the Congo Free State and its aftermath|date=2001|publisher=Curzon|location=Richmond|isbn=978-0700715893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgian Congo (1908–60)===
{{Main|Belgian Congo}}
On 15 November 1908 [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II of Belgium]] formally relinquished personal control of the Congo Free State. The renamed Belgian Congo was put under the direct administration of the [[Belgium|Belgian]] government and its Ministry of Colonies.

Belgian rule in the Congo was based around the &quot;colonial trinity&quot; (''trinité coloniale'') of [[Forms of government|state]], [[Christianity|missionary]] and [[Privately held company|private company]] interests.{{sfn|Turner|2007|p=28}} The privileging of Belgian commercial interests meant that large amounts of  [[Capital (economics)|capital]] flowed into the Congo and that individual regions became [[economic specialization|specialised]]. The interests of the government and private enterprise became closely tied; the state helped companies break strikes and remove other barriers imposed by the indigenous population.{{sfn|Turner|2007|p=28}} The country was split into nesting, hierarchically organised administrative subdivisions, and run uniformly according to a set &quot;native policy&quot; (''politique indigène'')—in contrast to the British and the French, who generally favoured the system of [[indirect rule]] whereby traditional leaders were retained in positions of authority under colonial oversight. There was also a high degree of [[racial segregation]]. Large numbers of white immigrants who moved to the Congo after the end of [[World War II]] came from across the social spectrum, but were nonetheless always treated as superior to blacks.{{sfn|Turner|2007|p=29}}

During the 1940s and 1950s, the Congo experienced an unprecedented level of [[urbanisation]] and the colonial administration began various [[International development|development]] programmes aimed at making the territory into a &quot;model colony&quot;.{{sfn|Freund|1998|pp=198–9}} Notable advances were made in treating diseases such as [[African trypanosomiasis]]. One of the results of these measures was the development of a new middle class of Europeanised African ''[[évolué]]s'' in the cities.{{sfn|Freund|1998|pp=198–9}} By the 1950s the Congo had a [[wage labour]] force twice as large as that in any other African colony.{{sfn|Freund|1998|p=198}} The Congo's rich natural resources, including uranium—[[Belgian Congo in World War II#Uranium|much of the uranium]] used by the U.S. nuclear programme during World War II was Congolese—led to substantial interest in the region from both the [[Soviet Union]] and the United States as the [[Cold War]] developed.{{sfn|Borstelmann|1993|pp=92–3}}

=== Rise in Congolese political activity ===
{{see also|Belgian Congo in World War II}}
During the latter stages of World War II a new social stratum emerged in the Congo, known as the ''[[évolué]]''s. Forming an African middle class in the colony, they held skilled positions (such as clerks and nurses) made available by the economic boom. While there were no universal criteria for determining ''évolué status'', it was generally accepted that one would have &quot;a good knowledge of French, adhere to Christianity, and have some form of post-primary education.&quot;{{sfn|Gibbs|1991|p=70}} Early on in their history, most ''évolué''s sought to use their unique status to earn special privileges in the Congo.{{sfn|Willame|1972|p=24}} Since opportunities for upward mobility through the colonial structure were limited, the ''évolué'' class institutionally manifested itself in elite clubs through which they could enjoy trivial privileges that made them feel distinct from the Congolese &quot;masses&quot;.{{sfn|Willame|1972|p=25}} Additional groups, such as labour unions, alumni associations, and ethnic syndicates, provided other Congolese the means of organisation.{{sfn|Young|1965|p=291}} Among the most important of these was the [[Alliance des Bakongo]] (ABAKO), representing the [[Kongo people]] of the Lower Congo.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=22}} However, they were restricted in their actions by the administration. While white settlers were consulted in the appointment of certain officials, the Congolese had no means of expressing their beliefs through the governing structures.{{sfn|Young|1965|p=29}} Though native chiefs held legal authority in some jurisdictions, in practice they were used by the administration to further its own policies.{{sfn|Gibbs|1991|p=51}}

Up into the 1950s most ''évolué''s were concerned only with social inequalities and their treatment by the Belgians. Questions of self-government were not considered until 1954, when ABAKO requested that the administration consider a list of suggested candidates for a Léopoldville municipal post.{{sfn|Young|1965|pp=274–275}} That year the association was taken over by [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]], and under his leadership it became increasingly hostile to the colonial authority and sought autonomy for the Kongo regions in the Lower Congo.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=22–23}} In 1956 a group of Congolese intellectuals under the tutelage of several European academics issued a manifesto calling for a transition to independence over the course of 30 years. The ABAKO quickly responded with a demand for &quot;immediate independence&quot;.{{sfn|Young|1965|p=276}} The Belgian government was not prepared to grant the Congo independence and even when it started realising the necessity of a plan for decolonisation in 1957, it was assumed that such a process would be solidly controlled by Belgium.{{sfn|Young|1965|pp=36–37}} In December 1957 the colonial administration instituted reforms that permitted municipal elections and the formation of political parties. Some Belgian parties attempted to establish branches in the colony, but these were largely ignored by the population in favour of Congolese-initiated groups.{{sfn|Young|1965|pp=296–297}} [[Nationalism]] fermented in 1958 as more ''évolué''s began interacting with others outside of their own locales and started discussing the future structures of a post-colonial Congolese state.{{sfn|Young|1965|p=277}} Nevertheless, most political mobilisation occurred along tribal and regional divisions.{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2002|p=84}} In Katanga, various tribal groups came together to form the [[CONAKAT|Confédération des associations tribales du Katanga]] (CONAKAT) under the leadership of [[Godefroid Munongo]] and [[Moïse Tshombe]]. Hostile to immigrant peoples, it advocated provincial autonomy and close ties with Belgium. Most of its support was rooted in individual chiefs, businessmen, and European settlers of southern Katanga.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=25–27}} It was opposed by [[Jason Sendwe]]'s Association Générale des Baluba du Katanga (BALUBAKAT).{{sfn|Lemarchand|1964|p=241}}

[[File:Patrice Lumumba in 1958.jpg|thumb|[[Patrice Lumumba]], founding member and leader of the MNC]]
In October 1958 a group of Léopoldville ''évolués'' including [[Patrice Lumumba]], [[Cyrille Adoula]] and [[Joseph Iléo]] established the [[Mouvement National Congolais]] (MNC). Diverse in membership, the party sought to peacefully achieve Congolese independence, promote the political education of the populace, and eliminate regionalism.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=27}} The MNC drew most of its membership from the residents of the eastern city of [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]], where Lumumba was well known, and from the population of the [[Kasai region|Kasai Province]], where efforts were directed by a [[Luba people|Muluba]] businessman, [[Albert Kalonji]].{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=29}} Belgian officials appreciated its moderate and anti-separatist stance and allowed Lumumba to attend the [[All-African Peoples' Conference]] in [[Accra]], Ghana, in December 1958 (Kasa-Vubu was informed that the documents necessary for his travel to the event were not in order and was not permitted to go{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=23}}). Lumumba was deeply impressed by the [[Pan-Africanist]] ideals of Ghanaian President [[Kwame Nkrumah]] and returned to the Congo with a more radical party programme.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=28}} He reported on his trip during a widely attended rally in Léopoldville and demanded the country's &quot;genuine&quot; independence.{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2002|p=84}}

Fearing that they were being overshadowed by Lumumba and the MNC, Kasa-Vubu and the ABAKO leadership announced that they would be hosting their own rally in the capital on 4 January 1959.{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2002|p=84}} The municipal government (under Belgian domination) was given short notice, and communicated that only a &quot;private meeting&quot; would be authorised. On the scheduled day of the rally the ABAKO leadership told the crowd that had gathered that the event was postponed and that they should disperse. The mass was infuriated and instead began hurling stones at the police and pillaging European property, initiating three days of [[Léopoldville riots|violent and destructive riots]].{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2002|p=85}} The [[Force Publique]], the colonial army, was called into service and suppressed the revolt with considerable brutality.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=10}} In wake of the riots Kasa-Vubu and his lieutenants were arrested. Unlike earlier expressions of discontent, the grievances were conveyed primarily by uneducated urban residents, not ''évolué''s.{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2002|p=86}} Popular opinion in Belgium was one of extreme shock and surprise. An investigative commission found the riots to be the culmination of racial discrimination, overcrowding, unemployment, and wishes for more political self-determination. On 13 January the administration announced several reforms, and the Belgian King, [[Baudouin of Belgium|Baudouin]], declared that independence would be granted to the Congo in the future.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=10}}

Meanwhile, discontent surfaced among the MNC leadership, who were bothered by Lumumba's domination over the party's politics. Relations between Lumumba and Kalonji also grew tense, as the former was upset with how the latter was transforming the Kasai branch into an exclusively Luba group and antagonising other tribes. This culminated into the split of the party into the MNC-Lumumba/MNC-L under Lumumba and the MNC-Kalonji/MNC-K under Kalonji and Iléo. The latter began advocating federalism. Adoula left the organisation.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=29}} Alone to lead his own faction and facing competition from ABAKO, Lumumba became increasingly strident in his demands for independence. Following an October riot in Stanleyville he was arrested. Nevertheless, the influence of himself and the MNC-L continued to grow rapidly. The party advocated for a strong unitary state, nationalism, and the termination of Belgian rule and began forming alliances with regional groups, such as the Kivu-based Centre du Regroupement Africain (CEREA).{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=30}} Though the Belgians supported a unitary system over the federal models suggested by ABAKO and CONAKAT, they and more moderate Congolese were unnerved by Lumumba's increasingly extremist attitudes. With the implicit support of the colonial administration, the moderates formed the Parti National du Progrès (PNP) under the leadership of [[Paul Bolya]] and [[Albert Delvaux]]. It advocated centralisation, respect for traditional elements, and close ties with Belgium.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=31}} In southern Léopoldville Province, a socialist-federalist party, the [[Parti Solidaire Africain]] (PSA) was founded. [[Antoine Gizenga]] served as its president, and [[Cléophas Kamitatu]] was in charge of the Léopoldville Province chapter.{{sfn|Merriam|1961|pp=131–132}}

==Independence and the Congo Crisis (1960–65)==
{{Main|Congo Crisis}}
Following the riots in Leopoldville 4–7 January 1959, and in Stanleyville on 31 October 1959, the Belgians realised they could not maintain control of such a vast country in the face of rising demands for independence. Belgian and Congolese political leaders held a [[Round Table Conference]] in Brussels beginning on 18 January 1960. 

At the end of the conference, on 27 January 1960, it was announced that [[Belgian Congo general election, 1960|elections would be held in the Congo on 22 May 1960]], and full independence granted on 30 June 1960. The elections produced the nationalist [[Patrice Lumumba]] as prime minister, and [[Joseph Kasavubu]] as president.
On independence the country adopted the name &quot;[[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Republic of Congo]]&quot; (République du Congo). The French colony of [[French Congo|Middle Congo]] (Moyen Congo) also chose the name Republic of Congo upon its independence, so the two countries are more commonly known as [[Congo-Léopoldville]] and [[Congo-Brazzaville]], after their capital cities. 

In 1960, the country was very unstable—regional tribal leaders held far more power than the central government—and with the departure of the Belgian administrators, almost no skilled bureaucrats remained in the country. The first Congolese graduated from university only in 1956, and very few in the new nation had any idea how to manage a country of such size.

On 5 July 1960, [[Mutiny of the Force Publique|a military mutiny by Congolese soldiers against their European officers]] broke out in the capital and rampant looting began. On 11 July 1960 the richest province of the country, [[State of Katanga|Katanga]], seceded under [[Moise Tshombe]]. The [[United Nations]] sent 20,000 peacekeepers to protect Europeans in the country and try to restore order. Western paramilitaries and mercenaries, often hired by mining companies to protect their interests, also began to pour into the country. In this period Congo's second richest province, [[South Kasai|Kasai]], also announced its independence on 8 August 1960.

After trying to get help from the United States and the United Nations, Prime Minister Lumumba turned to the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] for assistance. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] agreed to help, offering advanced weaponry and technical advisors.  The [[United States]] viewed the Soviet presence as an attempt to take advantage of the situation and gain a proxy state in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. UN forces were ordered to block any shipments of arms into the country. The United States also looked for a way to replace Lumumba as leader. President Kasavubu had clashed with Prime Minister Lumumba and advocated an alliance with the West rather than the Soviets. The U.S. sent weapons and CIA personnel to aid forces allied with Kasavubu and combat the Soviet presence. On 14 September 1960, with U.S. and [[CIA]] support, Colonel Joseph Mobutu [[1960 Republic of the Congo coup d'état|overthrew the government]] and arrested Lumumba. A technocratic government, the [[College of Commissioners-General]], was established.

On 17 January 1961 Mobutu sent Lumumba to Élisabethville (now [[Lubumbashi]]), capital of Katanga. In full view of the press he was beaten and forced to eat copies of his own speeches. For three weeks afterward, he was not seen or heard from. Then Katangan radio announced implausibly that he had escaped and been killed by  villagers. It was soon clear that in fact he had been tortured and killed along with two others shortly after his arrival. In 2001, a Belgian inquiry established that he had been shot by Katangan gendarmes in the presence of Belgian officers, under Katangan command. Lumumba was beaten, placed in front of a firing squad with two allies, cut up, buried, dug up and what remained was dissolved in acid.&lt;ref&gt;De Witte, Ludo: ''The Assassination of Lumumba'', Verso, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]], those loyal to the deposed Lumumba set up a rival government under [[Antoine Gizenga]] which lasted from 31 March 1961 until it was reintegrated on 5 August 1961. After some reverses, UN and Congolese government forces succeeded in recapturing the breakaway provinces of [[South Kasai]] on 30 December 1961, and [[State of Katanga|Katanga]] on 15 January 1963.

A new crisis erupted in the [[Simba Rebellion]] of 1964-1965 which saw half the country taken by the rebels. European mercenaries, US, and Belgian troops were called in by the Congolese government to defeat the rebellion.

==Zaire (1965–97)==
[[File:Mobutu.jpg|thumb|200px|Mobutu Sese Seko]]
Unrest and rebellion plagued the government until November 1965, when [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Lieutenant General Joseph-Désiré Mobutu]], by then commander in chief of the national army, [[1965 Democratic Republic of the Congo coup d'état|seized control of the country]] and declared himself president for the next five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/world/africa/651125kasavubu.html|title=Kasavubu Regime Ousted By Army Coup in Congo|website=archive.nytimes.com|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mobutu quickly consolidated his power, despite the [[Stanleyville mutinies]] of 1966 and 1967,&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Mockler, 'The New Mercenaries,' Corgi Books, 1985, {{ISBN|0-552-12558-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was [[Democratic Republic of the Congo presidential election, 1970|elected unopposed as president]] in 1970 for a seven-year term. 

Embarking on a campaign of [[Zairianization|cultural awareness]], President Mobutu renamed the country the &quot;[[Republic of Zaire]]&quot; in 1971 and required citizens to adopt African names and drop their French-language ones. The name comes from Portuguese, adapted from the Kongo word ''nzere'' or ''nzadi'' (&quot;river that swallows all rivers&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Forbath, Peter (1977).

Harper &amp; Row. p. 19. {{ISBN|0-06-122490-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Former place names in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Among other changes]], Leopoldville became Kinshasa and Katanga Shaba.

Relative peace and stability prevailed until 1977 and 1978 when Katangan [[Front for Congolese National Liberation]] rebels, based in the [[Angolan People's Republic]], launched the [[Shaba I]] and [[Shaba II|II]] invasions into the southeast Shaba region. These rebels were driven out with the aid of French and Belgian paratroopers plus Moroccan troops. An [[Inter-African Force]] remained in the region for some time afterwards.

Zaire remained a [[one-party state]] in the 1980s. Although Mobutu successfully maintained control during this period, opposition parties, most notably the [[Union for Democracy and Social Progress (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social]] (UDPS), were active. Mobutu's attempts to quell these groups drew significant international criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zeilig|first1=Leo|last2=Dwyer|first2=Peter|title=African Struggles Today: Social Movements Since Independence|date=2012|publisher=Haymarket Books|isbn=978-1608461202|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Cold War]] came to a close, internal and external pressures on Mobutu increased. In late 1989 and early 1990, Mobutu was weakened by a series of domestic protests, by heightened international criticism of his regime's human rights practices, by a [[Economy of Zaire|faltering economy]], and by [[Corruption in Zaire|government corruption]], most notably his own massive [[embezzlement]] of government funds for personal use.

In April 1990, Mobutu declared the Third Republic, agreeing to a limited [[multi-party system]] with free elections and a constitution. As details of the reforms were delayed, soldiers in September 1991 began looting [[Kinshasa]] to protest their unpaid wages. Two thousand French and Belgian troops, some of whom were flown in on [[U.S. Air Force]] planes, arrived to evacuate the 20,000 endangered foreign nationals in Kinshasa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/1991/10/23/world/new-riots-in-zaire-300-are-evacuated.html|title=New Riots in Zaire: 300 Are Evacuated |date=October 23, 1991 |agency=Reuters |newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, after previous similar attempts, the long-promised Sovereign National Conference was staged, encompassing over 2,000 representatives from various political parties. The conference gave itself a legislative mandate and elected Archbishop [[Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya]] as its chairman, along with [[Étienne Tshisekedi wa Mulumba]], leader of the UDPS, as prime minister. By the end of the year Mobutu had created a rival government with its own prime minister. The ensuing stalemate produced a compromise merger of the two governments into the [[High Council of Republic-Parliament of Transition]] (HCR-PT) in 1994, with Mobutu as head of state and [[Kengo Wa Dondo]] as prime minister. Although presidential and legislative elections were scheduled repeatedly over the next two years, they never took place.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

==Civil Wars (1996-2003)==
===First Congo War (1996–97)===
{{Main|First Congo War|Great Lakes refugee crisis}}
By 1996, tensions from the war and [[genocide]] in neighboring [[Rwanda]] had spilled over into [[Zaire]]. Rwandan [[Hutu]] militia forces ([[Interahamwe]]) who had fled Rwanda following the ascension of a [[Tutsi]]-led government had been using Hutu refugee camps in eastern Zaire as bases for incursions into Rwanda. In October 1996
Rwandan forces attacked refugee camps in the [[Rusizi River]] plain near the intersection of the Congolese, Rwandan and Burundi borders meet, scattering refugees. They took [[Uvira]], then [[Bukavu]], [[Goma]] and Mugunga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|via=Google Books

Hutu militia forces soon allied with the Zairian armed forces (FAZ) to launch a campaign against Congolese ethnic Tutsis in eastern Zaire. In turn, these Tutsis formed a militia to defend themselves against attacks. When the Zairian government began to escalate the massacres in November 1996, Tutsi militias erupted in rebellion against Mobutu.

The Tutsi militia was soon joined by various opposition groups and supported by several countries, including Rwanda and Uganda. This coalition, led by [[Laurent-Desire Kabila]], became known as the [[Alliance des Forces Démocratiques pour la Libération du Congo-Zaïre]] (AFDL). The AFDL, now seeking the broader goal of ousting Mobutu, made significant military gains in early 1997. Various Zairean politicians who had unsuccessfully opposed the dictatorship of Mobutu for many years now saw an opportunity for them in the invasion of Zaire by two of the region's strongest military forces. Following failed peace talks between Mobutu and Kabila in May 1997, Mobutu left the country on 16 May. The AFDL entered Kinshasa unopposed a day later, and Kabila named himself president, reverting the name of the country to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He marched into Kinshasa on 20 May and consolidated power around himself and the AFDL.

===Second Congo War (1998–2003)===
{{Main|Second Congo War|International Criminal Court investigation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
Kabila demonstrated little ability to manage the problems of his country, and lost his allies. To counterbalance the power and influence of Rwanda in DRC, Ugandan troops created another rebel movement called the [[Movement for the Liberation of Congo]] (MLC), led by the Congolese warlord [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]]. They attacked in August 1998, backed by Rwandan and Ugandan troops. Soon afterwards, Angola, Namibia, and Zimbabwe became involved militarily in the Congo, with Angola and Zimbabwe supporting the government. While the six African governments involved in the war signed a ceasefire accord in [[Lusaka]] in July 1999, the Congolese rebels did not and the ceasefire broke down within months. 

Kabila was assassinated in 2001 by  a bodyguard called Rashidi Kasereka, 18, who was then shot dead, according to Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo. Another account of the assassination says that the real killer escaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Revealed: how Africa's dictator died at the hands of his boy soldiers: President Laurent Kabila's blind faith in his teenage warriors was a fatal error |author=Stuart Jeffries | date=10 February 2001 |newspaper=Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/11/theobserver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kabila was succeeded by his son, [[Joseph Kabila|Joseph]]. Upon taking office, Kabila called for multilateral peace talks to end the war. Kabila partly succeeded when a further peace deal was brokered between him, Uganda, and Rwanda leading to the apparent withdrawal of foreign troops.

Currently,{{when|date=June 2018}} the Ugandans and the MLC still hold a {{convert|200|mi|km|adj=on}} wide section of the north of the country; Rwandan forces and its front, the [[Rassemblement Congolais pour la Démocratie]] (RCD) control a large section of the east; and government forces or their allies hold the west and south of the country. There were reports that the conflict is being prolonged as a cover for extensive looting of the substantial natural resources in the country, including [[diamond]]s, [[copper]], [[zinc]], and [[coltan]]. The conflict was reignited in January 2002 by ethnic clashes in the northeast and both Uganda and Rwanda then halted their withdrawal and sent in more troops. Talks between Kabila and the rebel leaders, held in [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]], lasted a full six weeks, beginning in April 2002. In June, they signed a peace accord under which Kabila would share power with former rebels. By June 2003, all foreign armies except those of Rwanda had pulled out of Congo. 

Few people in the Congo  have been unaffected by the conflict. A survey conducted in 2009 by the ICRC and Ipsos shows that three quarters (76%) of the people interviewed have been affected in some way–either personally or due to the wider consequences of armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/views-from-field-report-240609/$File/Our-World-Views-from-DRC-I-ICRC.pdf DRC, Opinion survey 2009], by ICRC and Ipsos&lt;/ref&gt;

The response of the international community has been incommensurate with the scale of the disaster resulting from the war in the Congo. Its support for political and diplomatic efforts to end the war has been relatively consistent, but it has taken no effective steps to abide by repeated pledges to demand accountability for the war crimes and crimes against humanity that were routinely committed in Congo. 
The [[United Nations Security Council]] and the U.N. Secretary-General have frequently denounced human rights abuses and the humanitarian disaster that the war unleashed on the local population, but have shown little will to tackle the responsibility of occupying powers for the atrocities taking place in areas under their control, areas where the worst violence in the country took place. In particular Rwanda and Uganda have escaped any significant sanction for their role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2002/08/20/war-crimes-kisangani-0 |title=Human Rights Watch: War Crimes in Kisangani |publisher=Hrw.org |date=20 August 2002 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joseph Kabila period==
===Transitional government (2003–06)===
{{Main|Transitional Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2006}}
DR Congo had a [[Transitional Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|transitional government]] in July 2003 until the election was over. A constitution was approved by voters and on 30 July 2006 the Congo held its [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2006|first multi-party elections]] since independence in 1960. [[Joseph Kabila]] took 45% of the votes and his opponent Jean-Pierre Bemba 20%. That was the origin of a fight between the two parties from  20–22 August 2006 in the streets of the capital, [[Kinshasa]]. Sixteen people died before policemen and  MONUC took control of the city. A new election was held on 29 October 2006, which Kabila won with 70% of the vote. Bemba has decried election &quot;irregularities.&quot;  On 6 December 2006 Joseph Kabila was sworn in as President.

===Kabila overstays his term===
In December 2011, [[Joseph Kabila]] was re-elected for a second term as president. After the results were announced on 9 December, there was violent unrest in Kinshasa and [[Mbuji-Mayi]], where official tallies showed that a strong majority had voted for the opposition candidate [[Etienne Tshisekedi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DR Congo election: Questions hang over Kabila's victory|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16128729|newspaper=BBC News|date=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official observers from the [[Carter Center]] reported that returns from almost 2,000 polling stations in areas where support for Tshisekedi was strong had been lost and not included in the official results. They described the election as lacking credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Carter Center: DRC Presidential Election Results Lack Credibility (press release)|url=http://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/drc-121011.html|newspaper=Carter Center|date=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 20 December, Kabila was sworn in for a second term, promising to invest in infrastructure and public services. However, Tshisekedi maintained that the result of the election was illegitimate and said that he intended also to &quot;swear himself in&quot; as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DR Congo President Joseph Kabila begins second term|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16261907|newspaper=BBC News|date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 January 2015 [[2015 Congolese protests|protests led by students at the University of Kinshasa broke out]]. The protests began following the announcement of a proposed law that would allow Kabila to remain in power until a national census can be conducted (elections had been planned for [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2016|2016]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Ross|first=Aaron|date=21 January 2015|title=UPDATE 2-Congo protests enter third day, rights group says 42 dead|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/drcNews/idAFL6N0V01NX20150121?sp=true|work=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Jullien|first=Maud|date=21 January 2015|title=DR Congo unrest: Catholic church backs protests|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-30913739|work=[[BBC]]|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By Wednesday 21 January clashes between police and protesters had claimed at least 42 lives (although the government claimed only 15 people had been killed).&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters1&quot; /&gt;

Similarly, in September 2016, violent protests were met with brutal force by the police and Republican Guard soldiers. Opposition groups claim 80 dead, including the Students' Union leader. From Monday 19 September Kinshasa residents, as well as residents elsewhere in Congo, where mostly confined to their homes. Police arrested anyone remotely connected to the opposition as well as innocent onlookers. Government propaganda, on television, and actions of covert government groups in the streets, acted against opposition as well as foreigners. The president's mandate was due to end on 19 December 2016, but no plans were made to elect a replacement at that time and this [[December 2016 Congolese protests|caused further protests]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/19/democratic-republic-congo-demonstrations-banned-police-killed-joseph-kabila-etienne-tshisekedi  Guardian - Demonstrations banned Police killed (20 September 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On December 30, 2018 the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2018|presidential election to determine the successor to Kabila was held]]. On January 10, 2019, the electoral commission announced opposition candidate [[Félix Tshisekedi]] as the winner of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/01/09/683830171/surprise-winner-of-congolese-election-is-an-opposition-leader|title=Surprise Winner Of Congolese Election Is An Opposition Leader|author=|date=|website=NPR.org|accessdate=11 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was officially sworn in as President on January 24, 2019.&lt;ref name=inaug&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://af.reuters.com/article/drcNews/idAFL8N1ZN4X9 | title=REFILE-Opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi sworn in as Congo president| newspaper=Reuters| date=2019-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the ceremony of taking of the office &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.afroamerica.net/index.php/world/19-africa/1315-dr-congo-felix-tshisekedi-appoints-vital-kamerhe-chief-of-staff.html |title = DR Congo: Felix Tshisekedi Appoints Vital Kamerhe Chief of Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Félix Tshisekedi]] appointed [[Vital Kamerhe]] as his chief of staff.

==Continued conflicts==
The inability of the state and the world's largest United Nations peacekeeping force to provide security throughout the vast country has led to the emergence of up to 70 armed groups around 2016,&lt;ref name=bloomberg0217&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-03/congo-warns-return-of-m23-rebels-in-east-could-block-elections|title=Congo Warns Return of M23 Rebels in East Could Block Vote|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=11 March 2017|date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps the largest number in the world.&lt;ref name=nytimes0416&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/01/world/africa/in-congo-wars-are-small-and-chaos-is-endless.html?_r=0|title=In Congo, Wars Are Small and Chaos Is Endless|newspaper=nytimes.com|accessdate=7 March 2017|date=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2018, the number of armed groups had increased to about 120.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/thousands-flee-across-congo-s-borders-as-violence-in-east-rages|title=Thousands Flee Across Congo's Borders After Violence in East Rages|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=5 March 2018|date=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Armed groups are often accused of being proxies or being supported by regional governments interested in Eastern Congo's vast mineral wealth. Some argue that much of the lack of security by the national army is strategic on the part of the government, who let the army profit from illegal logging and mining operations in return for loyalty.&lt;ref name=economist0516/&gt; Different rebel groups often target civilians by ethnicity and militias often become oriented around ethnic local militias known as &quot;[[Mai-Mai]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/thousands-flee-atrocities-south-eastern-drc-180220143919759.html|title=DRC: Thousands flee amid surge in 'horrific violence'|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=5 March 2018|date=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict in Kivu (2004-present)===
[[File:Flag of CNDP.svg|thumb|150px|Flag of CNDP]]
{{Main|Kivu conflict}}
{{Seealso|M23 rebellion}}
[[Laurent Nkunda]] with other soldiers from [[RCD-Goma]] who were integrated into the army defected and called themselves the [[National Congress for the Defence of the People]] (CNDP). Starting in 2004, CNDP, believed to be backed by Rwanda as a way to tackle the [[Hutu]] group [[Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda]] (FDLR), rebelled against the government, claiming to protect the [[Banyamulenge]] (Congolese Tutsis). In 2009, after a deal between the DRC and Rwanda, Rwandan troops entered the DRC and arrested Nkunda and were allowed to pursue FDLR militants. The CNDP signed a peace treaty with the government where its soldiers would be integrated into the national army.

In April 2012, the leader of the CNDP, [[Bosco Ntaganda]] and troops loyal to him mutinied, claiming a violation of the peace treaty and formed a rebel group, the [[March 23 Movement]] (M23), which was believed to be backed by Rwanda. On 20 November 2012, M23 [[2012 East D.R. Congo conflict|took control]] of [[Goma]], a provincial capital with a population of one million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20405739 |title=Goma: M23 rebels capture DR Congo city |date=20 November 2012 |work=BBC News |accessdate=18 November 2012 |archivedate=20 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120103234/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20405739 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN authorized the [[Force Intervention Brigade]] (FIB), which was the first UN peacekeeping force with a mandate to neutralize opposition rather than a defensive mandate, and the FIB quickly defeated M23.

====Allied Democratic Forces insurgency====
{{Main|Allied Democratic Forces insurgency}}
The [[Allied Democratic Forces]] has been waging an insurgency in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is blamed for the [[Beni massacre]] in 2016. While the Congolese army maintains that the ADF is an Islamist insurgency, most observers feel that they are only a criminal group interested in gold mining and logging.&lt;ref name=economist0516/&gt;

====Ethnic Mai Mai factions====
Ethnic conflict in Kivu has often involved the Congolese Tutsis known as [[Banyamulenge]], a cattle herding group of Rwandan origin derided as outsiders, and other ethnic groups who consider themselves indigenous. Additionally, neighboring Burundi and Rwanda, who have a thorny relationship, are accused of being involved, with Rwanda accused of training Burundi rebels who have joined with Mai Mai against the Banyamulenge and the Banyamulenge is accused of harboring the RNC, a Rwandan opposition group supported by Burundi.&lt;ref name=newhumanitarian1019&gt;{{cite news|title=In eastern Congo, a local conflict flares as regional tensions rise|url=https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news/2019/10/28/eastern-Congo-Kivu-conflict-regional-tensions|newspaper=The New Humanitarian|date=28 October 2019|accessdate=12 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017, the group, mostly based in [[South Kivu]], called the National People's Coalition for the Sovereignty of Congo (CNPSC) led by William Yakutumba was formed and became the strongest rebel group in the east, even briefly capturing a few strategic towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eastern Congo rebels aim to march on Kinshasa: spokesman|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-congo-rebels/eastern-congo-rebels-aim-to-march-on-kinshasa-spokesman-idUSKCN1C42R3|newspaper=Reuters|date=29 September 2017|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebel group is one of three alliances of various [[Mai-Mai]] militias&lt;ref name=irin1217&gt;{{cite news|title=Inside the Congolese army's campaign of rape and looting in South Kivu|url=http://www.irinnews.org/special-report/2017/12/18/exclusive-inside-congolese-army-s-campaign-rape-and-looting-south-kivu|newspaper=Irinnews|date=18 December 2017|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been referred to as the Alliance of Article 64, a reference to Article 64 of the constitution, which says the people have an obligation to fight the efforts of those who seek to take power by force, in reference to President Kabila.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heavy Fighting in Eastern DR Congo, Threats to Civilians Increase|url=https://www.hrw.org/blog-feed/democratic-republic-congo-crisis#blog-309854|newspaper=Human Rights Watch|date=4 October 2017|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bembe people|Bembe]] warlord Yakutumba's Mai-Mai Yakutumba is the largest component of the CNPSC and has had friction with the [[Banyamulenge|Congolese Tutsis]] who often make up commanders in army units.&lt;ref name=irin1217/&gt; In May 2019, Banyamulenge fighters killed a Banyindu traditional chief, Kawaza Nyakwana.

About 200,000 people fled their homes.&lt;ref name=newhumanitarian1019/&gt;

Clashes between Hutu militias and militias of other ethnic groups has also been prominent. In 2012, the Congolese army in its attempt to crush the Rwandan backed and Tutsi-dominated CNDP and M23 rebels, empowered and used Hutu groups such as the FDLR and a Hutu dominated Mai-Mai group called Nyatura as proxies in its fight. The Nyatura and FDLR even arbitrarily executed up to 264 mostly Tembo civilians in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/battle-control-drc-who-are-nyatura-rebels-1526277|title=Who are the Nyatura rebels?|publisher=IBT|accessdate=29 December 2017|date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the army then launched an offensive against the FDLR militia.&lt;ref name=reuters0216&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-congodemocratic-violence-idUSKCN0VH1VL|title=At least 21 Hutus killed in 'alarming' east Congo violence:UN|work=Reuters|accessdate=7 March 2017|date=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDLR are accused of killing at least 14 [[Nande language|Nande people]] in January 2016&lt;ref name=reuters0216/&gt; and of killing 10 Nandes and burning houses in July 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/07/drc-rebels-kill-10-troubled-eastern-region-160719201058544.html|title=DRC: Rebels kill at least 10 in troubled eastern region|publisher=Al jazeera|accessdate=7 March 2017|date=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while an FDLR allied group Maï Maï Nyatura are also accused of killing Nandes.&lt;ref name=irin1013&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/99037/briefing-armed-groups-eastern-drc|title=Armed groups in eastern DRC|publisher=Irin news|accessdate=7 March 2017|date=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nande-dominate UPDI militia, a Nande militia called Mai-Mai Mazembe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-congo-violence-idUKKCN10J121|title=Congo rebels kill at least 8 civilians in mounting ethnic violence|publisher=Reuter|accessdate=7 March 2017|date=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a militia dominated by [[Nyanga people]], the &quot;[[Nduma Defense of Congo]]&quot; (NDC), also called Maï-Maï Sheka and led by [[Gédéon Kyungu Mutanga]],&lt;ref name=ibtimes0217&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/27-killed-drc-after-mai-mai-rebels-target-hutu-civilians-north-kivu-1607577|title=27 killed in DRC after Maï-Maï fighters target Hutu civilians in North Kivu|website=International Business Times|accessdate=7 March 2017|date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; are accused of attacking Hutus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/dr-congo-militia-attack-kills-dozens-eastern-region-161128041438749.html|title=DR Congo militia attack kills dozens in eastern region|publisher=Aljazeera|accessdate=7 March 2017|date=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North Kivu, in 2017, an alliance of Mai-Mai groups called the National Movement of Revolutionaries (MNR) began attacks in June 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rebellion fears grow in eastern Congo|url=http://www.irinnews.org/analysis/2017/10/31/rebellion-fears-grow-eastern-congo|newspaper=Irinnews|date=31 October 2017|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes [[Nande language|Nande]] Mai-Mai leaders from groups such as Corps du Christ and Mai-Mai Mazembe.&lt;ref name=irin1217/&gt; Another alliance of Mai-Mai groups is CMC which brings together Hutu militia Nyatura&lt;ref name=irin1217/&gt; and are active along the border between North Kivu and South Kivu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sud-Kivu : Les miliciens envahissent les localités abandonnées par l'armée à Kalehe|url=https://actualite.cd/2017/10/02/sud-kivu-miliciens-envahissent-localites-abandonnees-larmee-a-kalehe/|newspaper=Actualite|date=2 October 2017|accessdate=28 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229052344/https://actualite.cd/2017/10/02/sud-kivu-miliciens-envahissent-localites-abandonnees-larmee-a-kalehe/|archive-date=29 December 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern [[Katanga Province]] starting in 2013, the [[Pygmy]] [[Twa#Congo|Batwa people]],{{efn|name=fn1|The two major divisions of Pygmies in the DRC are the Bambuti, or [[Mbuti people|Mbuti]], who largely live in the [[Ituri forest]] in the northeast, and the [[Twa#Congo|Batwa]], but many Batwa in certain areas of the country also refer to themselves as Bambuti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minorityrights.org/minorities/batwa-and-bambuti/|title=Democratic Republic of the Congo - Batwa and Bambuti|publisher=Minority Rights Group International}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} whom the [[Luba people]] often exploit and allegedly [[Pygmy peoples#slavery|enslave]],&lt;ref name=hrw1115/&gt; rose up into militias, such as the &quot;Perci&quot; militia, and attacked Luba villages.&lt;ref name=nytimes0416/&gt; A Luba militia known as &quot;Elements&quot; or &quot;Elema&quot; attacked back, notably killing at least 30 people in the &quot;Vumilia 1&quot; displaced people camp in April 2015. Since the start of the conflict, hundreds have been killed and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes.&lt;ref name=hrw1115&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/08/11/dr-congo-ethnic-militias-attack-civilians-katanga|title=DR Congo: Ethnic Militias Attack Civilians in Katanga|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=11 August 2015|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weapons used in the conflict are often arrows and axes, rather than guns.&lt;ref name=nytimes0416/&gt;

Elema also began fighting the government mainly with machetes, bows and arrows in Congo's Haut Katanga and Tanganyika provinces. The government forces fought alongside a tribe known as the Abatembo and targeting civilians of the Luba and the [[Lungu people|Tabwa]] tribes who were believed to be sympathetic to the Elema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKCN1BY08M-OZATP|title=Refugees reaching Zambia accuse DRC troops of killing civilians -U.N|work=Reuters|date=23 September 2017|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ituri conflict involved fighting between the agriculturalist [[Lendu]] and pastoralist [[Hema (ethnicity)|Hema]] ethnic groups in the [[Ituri Province|Ituri]] region of the north-eastern DRC. While &quot;Ituri conflict&quot; often refers to the major fighting from 1999 to 2003, fighting has existed before and continues since that time. In 2018, with the deterioration in security over Kabila's extending his stay in power, more than 100 people were killed, hundreds of homes burnt and 200,000 people were forced to flee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/un-warns-situation-in-dr-congo-reaching-breaking-point/a-42808193|title=UN warns situation in DR Congo reaching 'breaking point'|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=5 March 2018|date=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2019, 240 people were killed in a wave of violence that lead to more than 300,000 people fleeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL8N23P68Y|title=Survivors recall horror of Congo ethnic attacks|work=Reuters|accessdate=23 June 2019|date=18 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
