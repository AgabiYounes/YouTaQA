'''Dentistry''', also known as '''dental medicine''' and '''oral medicine''', is a branch of [[medicine]] that consists of the study, [[diagnosis]], prevention, and treatment of [[diseases]], disorders, and conditions of the [[mouth|oral cavity]], commonly in the [[dentition]]  but also the [[oral mucosa]], and of adjacent and related structures and tissues, particularly in the maxillofacial (jaw and facial) area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ada.org/glossaryforprofessionals.aspx |title = Glossary of Dental Clinical and Administrative Terms |publisher = [[American Dental Association]] |accessdate = 1 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although primarily associated with [[teeth]] among the general public, the field of dentistry or dental medicine is not limited to teeth but includes other aspects of the [[craniofacial]] complex including the [[temporomandibular joint]] and other supporting, muscular, lymphatic, nervous, vascular, and anatomical structures.

Dentistry is often also understood to subsume the now largely defunct [[medical specialty]] of [[stomatology]] (the study of the mouth and its disorders and diseases) for which reason the two terms are used interchangeably in certain regions.{{where|date=May 2018}}

Dental treatments are carried out by a dental team, which often consists of a [[dentist]] and [[Dental auxiliary|dental auxiliaries]] ([[dental assistant]]s, [[dental hygienist]]s, [[dental technician]]s, as well as [[dental therapist]]s). Most dentists either work in private practices ([[primary care]]), dental hospitals or ([[secondary care]]) institutions (prisons, armed forces bases, etc.).

The history of dentistry is almost as ancient as the history of humanity and civilization with the earliest evidence dating from 7000 BC. Remains from the early Harappan periods of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] ({{circa|3300}} BC) show evidence of teeth having been drilled dating back 9,000 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4882968.stm |work = BBC News |title = Stone age man used dentist drill |date = 6 April 2006 |accessdate = 24 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that dental surgery was the first specialization from [[medicine]].&lt;ref name=Suddick1990&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suddick |first1=RP | last2=Harris |first2=NO |title =Historical perspectives of oral biology: a series |journal=Critical Reviews in Oral Biology and Medicine |date=1990 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=135–51 |doi =10.1177/10454411900010020301 |pmid = 2129621 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern movement of [[evidence-based dentistry]] calls for the use of high-quality scientific evidence to guide decision-making.

==Terminology==
The term dentistry comes from ''dentist'', which comes from French ''dentiste'', which comes from the French and Latin words for tooth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=dentistry|title=dentistry |website=Etymonline.com|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term for the associated scientific study of teeth is '''odontology''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] ὀδούς (odoús, &quot;tooth&quot;)) – the study of the structure, development, and abnormalities of the teeth.

==Dental treatment==
Dentistry usually encompasses practices related to the oral cavity.&lt;ref name=Gambhir2015&gt;{{cite journal| author=Gambhir RS| title=Primary care in dentistry – an untapped potential | journal= Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care| year= 2015 | volume= 4 | issue= 1 | pages= 13–18 | pmid=25810982 | doi=10.4103/2249-4863.152239 | pmc=4366984 | type=Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[World Health Organization]], oral diseases are major public health problems due to their high incidence and prevalence across the globe, with the disadvantaged affected more than other socio-economic groups.&lt;ref name=WHOoraldisease&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/oral_health/disease_burden/global/en/|title=What is the burden of oral disease?|publisher=[[World Health Organization|WHO]]|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of dental treatments are carried out to prevent or treat the two most common [[Dental disease|oral diseases]] which are [[dental caries]] (tooth decay) and [[periodontal disease]] (gum disease or pyorrhea). Common treatments involve the [[dental restoration|restoration of teeth]], [[dental extraction|extraction]] or surgical removal of teeth, [[scaling and root planing]], endodontic [[endodontic therapy|root canal]] treatment and cosmetic dentistry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aacd.com/|title=American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry {{!}} Dental CE Courses|website=aacd.com|access-date=2019-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All dentists in the United States undergo at least three years of undergraduate studies, but nearly all complete a bachelor's degree. This schooling is followed by four years of dental school to qualify as a &quot;[[Doctor of Dental Surgery]]&quot; (DDS) or &quot;[[Doctor of Dental Medicine]]&quot; (DMD). Specialization in dentistry is available in the fields of Dental Public Health, Endodontics, Oral Radiology, Oral Maxillofacial Surgery, Oral Medicine and Pathology, Orthodontics, Pediatric Dentistry, Periodontics, and Prosthodontics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cda-adc.ca/en/oral_health/specialties/|title=Canadian Dental Association|website=www.cda-adc.ca|access-date=2019-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By nature of their general training they can carry out the majority of dental treatments such as restorative (fillings, [[crown (dentistry)|crowns]], [[bridge (dentistry)|bridges]]), prosthetic ([[dentures]]), endodontic (root canal) therapy, periodontal (gum) therapy, and extraction of teeth, as well as performing examinations, radiographs (x-rays), and diagnosis. Dentists can also prescribe medications such as [[antibiotic]]s, [[sedative]]s, and any other drugs used in patient management. Depending on their licensing boards, general dentists may be required to complete additional training to perform sedation, dental implants, etc.

Dentists also encourage prevention of oral diseases through proper [[hygiene]] and regular, twice or more yearly, checkups for professional cleaning and evaluation. Oral infections and inflammations may affect overall health and conditions in the oral cavity may be indicative of systemic diseases, such as [[osteoporosis]], [[diabetes]], [[celiac disease]] or [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=Gambhir2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NIHCDdiagnosis /&gt;&lt;ref name=EstrellaBoynton2010&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Estrella MR, Boynton JR| title=General dentistry's role in the care for children with special needs: a review | journal=Gen Dent | year= 2010 | volume= 58 | issue= 3 | pages= 222–29 | pmid=20478802 | type=Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=daFonseca2010&gt;{{cite journal| author=da Fonseca MA| title=Dental and oral care for chronically ill children and adolescents | journal=Gen Dent | year= 2010 | volume= 58 | issue= 3 | pages= 204–09; quiz 210–11 | pmid=20478800 | type=Review  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies have also shown that [[gum disease]] is associated with an increased risk of diabetes, [[heart disease]], and [[preterm birth]]. The concept that oral health can affect systemic health and disease is referred to as &quot;oral-systemic health&quot;.

Dr. John M. Harris started the world's first dental school in [[Bainbridge, Ross County, Ohio|Bainbridge, Ohio]], and helped to establish dentistry as a health profession. It opened on 21 February 1828, and today is a [[Harris Dental Museum|dental museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1217–1218.&lt;/ref&gt; The first dental college, [[Baltimore College of Dental Surgery]], opened in Baltimore, Maryland, US in 1840. The second in the United States was the [[Ohio College of Dental Surgery]], established in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teeth: the story of beauty, inequality, and the struggle for oral health in America|last=Mary|first=Otto|publisher=The New Press|year=2017|isbn=978-1-62097-144-4|location=New York|pages=70|oclc=958458166}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine|Philadelphia College of Dental Surgery]] followed in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = History |url = http://www.dental.upenn.edu/about_us/history |website = Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine |accessdate = 13 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, [[Temple University]] accepted a bid to incorporate the school.

Studies show that dentists that graduated from different countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Zadik Yehuda |author2 = Levin Liran |title = Clinical decision making in restorative dentistry, endodontics, and antibiotic prescription |journal = J Dent Educ |volume = 72 |issue = 1 |pages = 81–86 |date = January 2008 |pmid = 18172239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or even from different dental schools in one country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Zadik Yehuda |author2 = Levin Liran |title = Decision making of Hebrew University and Tel Aviv University Dental Schools graduates in every day dentistry—is there a difference? |journal = J Isr Dent Assoc |volume = 23 |issue = 2 |pages = 19–23 |date = April 2006 |pmid = 16886872 }}&lt;/ref&gt; may make different clinical decisions for the same clinical condition. For example, dentists that graduated from [[Israel]]i dental schools may recommend the removal of asymptomatic [[Tooth impaction|impacted]] [[third molar]] (wisdom teeth) more often than dentists that graduated from Latin American or Eastern European dental schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Zadik Yehuda |author2 = Levin Liran |title = Decision making of Israeli, East European, and South American dental school graduates in third molar surgery: is there a difference? |journal = J Oral Maxillofac Surg |volume = 65 |issue = 4 |pages = 658–62 |date = April 2007 |pmid = 17368360 |doi = 10.1016/j.joms.2006.09.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the 1878 British Dentists Act and 1879 Dentists Register limited the title of &quot;dentist&quot; and &quot;dental surgeon&quot; to qualified and registered practitioners.&lt;ref name=&quot;125years&quot;&gt;Gelbier, Stanley. [http://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v199/n7/full/4812875a.html 125 Years of Developments in Dentistry]. British Dental Journal (2005); 199, 470–73. The 1879 register is referred to as the &quot;Dental Register&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bdatimeline&quot; /&gt; However, others could legally describe themselves as &quot;dental experts&quot; or &quot;dental consultants&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BEdAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bFkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2752%2C3609354 |title = Banning Clerks, Colliers and other Charlatans |author=J Menzies Campbell |work = [[The Glasgow Herald]] |date = 8 February 1955 |page=3 |accessdate = 5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of dentistry in the United Kingdom became fully regulated with the 1921 Dentists Act, which required the registration of anyone practising dentistry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.rcsed.ac.uk/media/4014/dentistry_history.pdf History of Dental Surgery in Edinburgh (PDF)], hosted on the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh website. Page accessed 11 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Dental Association]], formed in 1880 with Sir [[John Tomes]] as president, played a major role in prosecuting dentists practising illegally.&lt;ref name=&quot;125years&quot; /&gt; Dentists in the United Kingdom are now regulated by the [[General Dental Council]].

In Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Finland, Sweden, Brazil, Chile, the United States, and Canada, a dentist is a healthcare professional qualified to practice dentistry after graduating with a degree of either Doctor of Dental Surgery ([[Doctor of Dental Surgery|DDS]]) or Doctor of Dental Medicine ([[Doctor of Dental Medicine|DMD]]). This is equivalent to the Bachelor of Dental Surgery/Baccalaureus Dentalis Chirurgiae ([[Bachelor of Dental Surgery|BDS, BDent, BChD, BDSc]]) that is awarded in the UK and British Commonwealth countries. In most western countries, to become a qualified dentist one must usually complete at least four years of postgraduate study;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.purdue.edu/preprofessional/documents/Dentist.pdf|title=Dentistry (D.D.S. or D.M.D.)|website=Purdue.edu|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; within the [[European Union]] the education has to be at least five years. Dentists usually complete between five and eight years of post-secondary education before practising. Though not mandatory, many dentists choose to complete an internship or residency focusing on specific aspects of dental care after they have received their dental degree.

==Specialties {{anchor|Specialities&lt;!--alt spelling--&gt;}}==
{{Main|Specialty (dentistry)}}
Some dentists undertake further training after their initial degree in order to specialize. Exactly which subjects are recognized by dental registration bodies varies according to location. Examples include:

* [[Dental anesthesiology|Anesthesiology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ada.org/en/publications/ada-news/2019-archive/march/anesthesiology-recognized-as-a-dental-specialty|title=Anesthesiology recognized as a dental specialty|website=www.ada.org|access-date=2019-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; – The study of how to relieve pain through advanced use of local and general anesthetic techniques.
* [[Dental public health]] – The study of [[epidemiology]] and social health policies relevant to oral health.
* [[Endodontics]] (also called endodontology) – [[Root canal therapy]] and study of diseases of the [[dental pulp]] and periapical tissues.
* [[Forensic odontology]] – The gathering and use of dental evidence in law. This may be performed by any [[dentist]] with experience or training in this field. The function of the forensic dentist is primarily documentation and verification of identity.
* [[Geriatric dentistry]] or Geriodontics – The delivery of dental care to older adults involving the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of problems associated with normal aging and age-related diseases as part of an interdisciplinary team with other health care professionals.
* [[Oral and maxillofacial pathology]] – The study, diagnosis, and sometimes the treatment of oral and maxillofacial related diseases.
* [[Oral and maxillofacial radiology]] – The study and radiologic interpretation of oral and maxillofacial diseases.
* [[Oral and maxillofacial surgery]] (also called oral surgery) – [[Extraction (dental)|Extractions]], [[Dental implant|implants]], and surgery of the jaws, mouth and face.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;The scope of Oral and maxillofacial surgery is variable. In some countries, both a medical and dental degree is required for training, and the scope includes head and neck oncology and craniofacial deformity.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Oral biology]] – Research in dental and craniofacial biology
* [[Oral Implantology]] – The art and science of replacing extracted teeth with dental implants.
* [[Oral medicine]] – The clinical evaluation and [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of [[oral cavity|oral]] [[oral mucosa|mucosal]] [[oral pathology|diseases]]
* [[Orthodontics]] and [[dentofacial orthopedics]]  – The straightening of teeth and modification of midface and mandibular growth.
* [[Pediatric dentistry]] (also called pedodontics) – Dentistry for children
* [[Periodontology]] (also called periodontics) – The study and treatment of diseases of the [[periodontium]] (non-surgical and surgical) as well as placement and maintenance of dental implants
* [[Prosthodontics]] (also called prosthetic dentistry) – [[Denture]]s, [[Bridge (dentistry)|bridges]] and the restoration of implants. 
** Some prosthodontists super-specialize in [[Maxillofacial Prosthetics]], which is the discipline originally concerned with the rehabilitation of patients with congenital facial and oral defects such as [[cleft lip and palate]] or patients born with an underdeveloped ear ([[microtia]]). Today, most Maxillofacial Prosthodontists return function and esthetics to patients with acquired defects secondary to surgical removal of head and neck tumors, or secondary to trauma from war or motor vehicle accidents. 
* [[Special needs dentistry]] (also called special care dentistry) – Dentistry for those with developmental and acquired disabilities.
* [[Veterinary dentistry]], a speciality of [[veterinary medicine]] – The field of dentistry applied to the care of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.avdc.org/ |title = AVDC Home |publisher = Avdc.org |date = 29 November 2009 |accessdate = 18 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.evdc.info/ |title = EVDC web site |publisher = Evdc.info |accessdate = 18 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Islamic Golden Age]] Dentistry was discussed in several famous books of medicine such as [[The Canon of Medicine|The Canon in medicine]] written by [[Avicenna]] and Al-Tasreef by [[Al-Zahrawi]] who is considered the greatest [[surgeon]] of the [[Middle ages]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia (Routledge Encyclopedias of the Middle Ages)|last=Meri|first=Josef|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-415-96690-0|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avicenna said that jaw fracture should be reduced according to the occlusal guidance of the teeth; this principle is still valid in modern times. while Al-Zahrawi made a lot of surgical tools that resemble the modern tools.

Historically, dental extractions have been used to treat a variety of illnesses. During the [[Middle Ages]] and throughout the 19th century, dentistry was not a profession in itself, and often dental procedures were performed by barbers or general [[physician]]s. [[Barber]]s usually limited their practice to extracting teeth which alleviated [[pain]] and associated chronic tooth [[infection]]. Instruments used for dental extractions date back several centuries. In the 14th century, [[Guy de Chauliac]] most probably invented the dental pelican&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://en.dmd.co.il/antique-dental-instruments/antique-dental-pelican/|title = Pelican|author=Gregory Ribitzky|accessdate = 23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (resembling a [[pelican]]'s beak) which was used to perform [[dental extraction]]s up until the late 18th century. The pelican was replaced by the [[dental key]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://en.dmd.co.il/antique-dental-instruments/antique-dental-toothkey-2/|title = Toothkey|author=Gregory Ribitzky|accessdate = 23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, in turn, was replaced by modern forceps in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://en.dmd.co.il/antique-dental-instruments/antique-dental-forceps/|title = Forceps|author=Gregory Ribitzky|accessdate = 23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book focused solely on dentistry was the &quot;Artzney Buchlein&quot; in 1530,&lt;ref name=&quot;History Of Dentistry&quot; /&gt; and the first dental textbook written in English was called &quot;Operator for the Teeth&quot; by Charles Allen in 1685.&lt;ref name=&quot;bdatimeline&quot;&gt;[http://www.bda.org/museum/the-story-of-dentistry/timeline.aspx The story of dentistry: Dental History Timeline] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309235717/http://www.bda.org/museum/the-story-of-dentistry/timeline.aspx |date=9 March 2012 }}, hosted on the British Dental Association website.

In the United Kingdom there was no formal qualification for the providers of dental treatment until 1859 and it was only in 1921 that the practice of dentistry was limited to those who were professionally qualified. The [[Royal Commission on the National Health Service]] in 1979 reported that there were then more than twice as many registered dentists per 10,000 population in the UK than there were in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Royal Commission on the NHS Chapter 9 |date = July 1979 |publisher = HMSO |isbn = 978-0-10-176150-5 |url = http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/royal-commission-on-the-national-health-service-contents/royal-commission-on-the-nhs-chapter-9/ |accessdate = 19 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern dentistry===

[[File:Microscope,The Dental cosmos (1907).jpg|thumb|right|A microscopic device used in dental analysis, {{circa|1907}}]]

It was between 1650 and 1800 that the science of modern dentistry developed. The English physician [[Thomas Browne]] in his ''[[A Letter to a Friend]]'' ({{circa|1656}} pub. 1690) made an early dental observation with characteristic humour:

{{Quote|quote=The Egyptian Mummies that I have seen, have had their Mouths open, and somewhat gaping, which affordeth a good opportunity to view and observe their Teeth, wherein 'tis not easie to find any wanting or decayed: and therefore in Egypt, where one Man practised but one Operation, or the Diseases but of single Parts, it must needs be a barren Profession to confine unto that of drawing of Teeth, and little better than to have been Tooth-drawer unto King Pyrrhus, who had but two in his Head.}}

The French surgeon [[Pierre Fauchard]] became known as the &quot;father of modern dentistry&quot;. Despite the limitations of the primitive surgical instruments during the late 17th and early 18th century, Fauchard was a highly skilled [[surgeon]] who made remarkable improvisations of dental instruments, often adapting tools from [[watchmaker]]s, [[jeweler]]s and even [[barber]]s, that he thought could be used in dentistry. He introduced [[dental filling]]s as treatment for [[dental cavities]]. He asserted that [[sugar]] derivate acids like [[tartaric acid]] were responsible for [[caries|dental decay]], and also suggested that tumors surrounding the teeth and in the [[Gingiva|gums]] could appear in the later stages of tooth decay.&lt;ref name=&quot;Besombes&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2RRqAAAAMAAJ |title = Pierre Fauchard (1678–1761): The First Dental Surgeon, His Work, His Actuality |author = André Besombes |author2 = Phillipe de Gaillande |publisher = Pierre Fauchard Academy |date = 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weinberger&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2wtqAAAAMAAJ |title = Pierre Fauchard, Surgeon-dentist: A Brief Account of the Beginning of Modern Dentistry, the First Dental Textbook, and Professional Life Two Hundred Years Ago |author = Bernhard Wolf Weinberger |date = 1941 |publisher = Pierre Fauchard Academy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Panoramic radiograph of historic dental implants.jpg|thumb|Panoramic radiograph of historic dental implants, made 1978]]

Fauchard was the pioneer of [[Prosthodontics|dental prosthesis]], and he discovered many methods to replace lost teeth. He suggested that substitutes could be made from carved blocks of [[ivory]] or [[bone]]. He also introduced [[dental braces]], although they were initially made of gold, he discovered that the teeth position could be corrected as the teeth would follow the pattern of the wires. Waxed [[linen]] or [[silk]] threads were usually employed to fasten the braces. His contributions to the world of dental science consist primarily of his 1728 publication Le chirurgien dentiste or The Surgeon Dentist.  The French text included &quot;basic oral anatomy and function, dental construction, and various operative and restorative techniques, and effectively separated dentistry from the wider category of surgery&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Besombes&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weinberger&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Dental office.jpg|thumb|left|A modern dentist's chair]]

After Fauchard, the study of dentistry rapidly expanded. Two important books, ''Natural History of Human Teeth'' (1771) and ''Practical Treatise on the Diseases of the Teeth'' (1778), were published by British surgeon [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]]. In 1763 he entered into a period of collaboration with the London-based dentist James Spence. He began to theorise about the possibility of [[tooth transplant]]s from one person to another. He realised that the chances of an (initially, at least) successful tooth transplant would be improved if the donor tooth was as fresh as possible and was matched for size with the recipient.  These principles are still used in the transplantation of [[internal organ]]s. Hunter conducted a series of pioneering operations, in which he attempted a tooth transplant. Although the donated teeth never properly bonded with the recipients' gums, one of Hunter's patients stated that he had three which lasted for six years, a remarkable achievement for the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Moore, Wendy |authorlink = Wendy Moore |title = The Knife Man |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DKInoTPFrBoC |accessdate = 8 March 2012 |date = 30 September 2010 |publisher = Transworld |pages = 223–24 |isbn = 978-1-4090-4462-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major advances were made in the 19th century, and dentistry evolved from a trade to a profession. The profession came under government regulation by the end of the 19th century. In the UK the Dentist Act was passed in 1878 and the British Dental Association formed in 1879. In the same year, [[Francis Brodie Imlach]] was the first ever dentist to be elected President of the Royal College of Surgeons (Edinburgh), raising dentistry onto a par with clinical surgery for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://historyofdentistry.co.uk/index_htm_files/2004Apr2.pdf |title=A pioneering history: dentistry and the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh |first=Helen |last=Dingwall |date=April 2004 |work=History of Dentistry Newsletter |issue=14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201191323/http://historyofdentistry.co.uk/index_htm_files/2004Apr2.pdf |archivedate=1 February 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hazards in modern dentistry===
{{main|Occupational hazards in dentistry}}
Long term occupational noise exposure can contribute to permanent hearing loss, which is referred to as [[noise-induced hearing loss]] (NIHL) and [[tinnitus]]. Noise exposure can cause excessive stimulation of the hearing mechanism, which damages the delicate structures of the inner ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Noise-Induced Hearing Loss|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/noise-induced-hearing-loss|website=NIDCD|date=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; NIHL can occur when an individual is exposed to sound levels above 90 dBA according to the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA). Regulations state that the permissible noise exposure levels for individuals is 90 dBA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Occupational Safety and Health Standards {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owastand.display_standard_group?p_toc_level=1&amp;p_part_number=1910|website=Osha.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ([[NIOSH]]), exposure limits are set to 85 dBA. Exposures below 85 dBA are not considered to be hazardous. Time limits are placed on how long an individual can stay in an environment above 85 dBA before it causes hearing loss. OSHA places that limitation at 8 hours for 85 dBA. The exposure time becomes shorter as the dBA level increases.

Within the field of dentistry, a variety of cleaning tools are used including piezoelectric and sonic scalers, and ultrasonic scalers and cleaners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevens|first1=M|title=Is someone listening to the din of occupational noise exposure in dentistry|journal=RDH|date=1999|issue=19|pages=34–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a majority of the tools do not exceed 75 dBA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merrel|first1=HB|title=Noise pollution and hearing loss in the dental office|journal=Dental Assisting Journal|date=1992|volume=61|issue=3|pages=6–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; prolonged exposure over many years can lead to hearing loss or complaints of tinnitus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=J.D.|title=Effects of occupational ultrasonic noise exposure on hearing of dental hygienists: A pilot study|journal=Journal of Dental Hygiene|date=2002|volume=76|issue=4|pages=262–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few dentists have reported using personal hearing protective devices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leggat|first1=P.A.|title=Occupational Health Problems in Modern Dentistry: A Review|journal=Industrial Health|date=2007|volume=45|issue=5|pages=611–21|doi=10.2486/indhealth.45.611|pmid=18057804|url=https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/2690/1/2690_Leggat_et_al...2007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leggat|first1=P.A.|title=Occupational hygiene practices of dentists in southern Thailand|journal=International Dentistry Journal|date=2001|issue=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could offset any potential hearing loss or tinnitus.

===Evidence-based dentistry===
{{Main|Evidence-based dentistry}}
There is a movement in modern dentistry to place a greater emphasis on high-quality scientific evidence in decision-making. [[Evidence-based dentistry]] (EBD) uses current scientific evidence to guide decisions. It is an approach to oral health that requires the application and examination of relevant scientific data related to the patient's oral and medical health. Along with the dentist's professional skill and expertise, EBD allows dentists to stay up to date on the latest procedures and patients to receive improved treatment. A new paradigm for medical education designed to incorporate current research into education and practice was developed to help practitioners provide the best care for their patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evidence-based medicine. A new approach to teaching the practice of medicine|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|year=1992|volume=268|issue=17|pages=2420–2425|pmid=1404801|author1=Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group|doi=10.1001/jama.1992.03490170092032}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first introduced by [[Gordon Guyatt]] and the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group at [[McMaster University]] in [[Ontario, Canada]] in the 1990s. It is part of the larger movement toward [[evidence-based medicine]] and other [[evidence-based practices]].

== Ethical and medicolegal issues ==
