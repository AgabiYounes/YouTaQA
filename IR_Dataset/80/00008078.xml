'''Dynamite''' is an [[explosive material|explosive]] made of [[nitroglycerin]], [[sorbent]]s (such as powdered shells or clay) and stabilizers. It was invented by the [[Swedish people|Swedish]] chemist and engineer [[Alfred Nobel]] in [[Geesthacht]] and [[patented]] in 1867. It rapidly gained wide-scale use as a more powerful alternative to [[gun powder|black powder]]. 

Today, dynamite is mainly used in the [[mining]], [[quarrying]], [[construction]], and [[demolition]] industries. Dynamite is still the product of choice for trenching applications, and as a cost-effective alternative to [[cast booster]]s. Dynamite is occasionally used as an initiator or booster for [[ANFO|AN and ANFO explosive charges]].

==History==
[[File:Nobels Extradynamit label.jpg|thumb|&quot;Nobels extradynamit&quot; manufactured by Nobel's old company, Nitroglycerin Aktiebolaget]]

Dynamite was invented by Swedish chemist [[Alfred Nobel]] in the 1860s and was the first safely manageable explosive stronger than [[black powder]], which had been invented in China in the 9th century.

Alfred Nobel's father, [[Immanuel Nobel]], was an industrialist, engineer, and inventor. He built bridges and buildings in Stockholm and founded Sweden's first rubber factory. His construction work inspired him to research new methods of blasting rock that were more effective than black powder. After some bad business deals in Sweden, in 1838 Immanuel moved [[Nobel family|his family]] to [[Saint Petersburg]], where Alfred and his brothers were educated privately under Swedish and Russian tutors. At age 17, Alfred was [[grand tour|sent abroad for two years]]; in the United States he met Swedish engineer [[John Ericsson]] and in France studied under famed chemist [[Théophile-Jules Pelouze]] and his pupil [[Ascanio Sobrero]] who had first synthesized [[nitroglycerin]] in 1847. It was in France that Nobel first encountered nitroglycerin, which Pelouze cautioned against using as a commercial explosive because of its great sensitivity to shock.&lt;ref name=&quot;tekniskamuseet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Alfred Nobel – Dynamit|url=https://www.tekniskamuseet.se/lar-dig-mer/svenska-uppfinnare-och-innovatorer/alfred-nobel-dynamit/|publisher=[[Swedish National Museum of Science and Technology]] |accessdate=1 October 2017|language=sv-SE}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1857, Nobel filed the first of several hundred patents, mostly concerning air pressure, gas and fluid gauges, but remained fascinated with nitroglycerin's potential as an explosive. Nobel, along with his father and brother [[Emil Oskar Nobel|Emil]], experimented with various combinations of nitroglycerin and black powder. Nobel came up with a solution of how to safely detonate nitroglycerin by inventing the [[detonator]], or blasting cap, that allowed a controlled explosion set off from a distance using a [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]]. In the summer of 1863, Nobel performed his first successful detonation of pure nitroglycerin, using a blasting cap made of a copper [[percussion cap]] and [[Mercury(II) fulminate|mercury fulminate]]. In 1864, Alfred Nobel filed patents for both the blasting cap and his method of synthesizing nitroglycerin, using sulfuric acid, nitric acid and glycerin. On 3 September 1864, while experimenting with nitroglycerin, Emil and several others were killed in an explosion at the factory at Immanuel Nobel's estate at [[Heleneborg]]. After this, Alfred founded the company Nitroglycerin Aktiebolaget AB in [[Vinterviken]] to continue work in a more isolated area and the following year moved to Germany, where he founded another company, [[Dynamit Nobel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tekniskamuseet&quot;/&gt; 

Despite the invention of the blasting cap, the volatility of nitroglycerin rendered it useless as a commercial explosive. To solve this problem, Nobel sought to combine it with another substance that would make it safe for transport and handling but yet would not reduce its effectiveness as an explosive. He tried combinations of cement, coal, and sawdust, but was unsuccessful. Finally, he tried [[diatomaceous earth]], fossilized algae, that he brought from the [[Elbe River]] near his factory in [[Hamburg]], which successfully stabilized the nitroglycerin into a portable explosive.&lt;ref name=&quot;tekniskamuseet&quot;/&gt; 

Nobel obtained [[patent]]s for his inventions in England on 7 May 1867 and in Sweden on 19 October 1867.&lt;ref name=&quot;s&amp;s-101&quot;&gt;Schück &amp; Sohlman (1929), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; After its introduction, dynamite rapidly gained wide-scale use as a safe alternative to [[black powder]] and [[nitroglycerin]]. Nobel tightly controlled the patents, and unlicensed duplicating companies were quickly shut down. However, a few American businessmen got around the patent by using a slightly different formula.&lt;ref name=&quot;USPat 234489&quot;&gt;US Patent 234489 issued to Morse 16 November 1880&lt;/ref&gt;

Nobel originally sold dynamite as &quot;Nobel's Blasting Powder&quot; but decided to change the name to dynamite, from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ''dýnamis'' ({{lang|grc|δύναμις}}), meaning &quot;power&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;dynamite.&quot; The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. 2003. Houghton Mifflin Company 19 March 2013 http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dynamite&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;dynamite.&quot; Collins English Dictionary – Complete and Unabridged. 1991, 1994, 1998, 2000, 2003.

==Manufacture==

===Form===
Dynamite is usually sold in the form of cardboard cylinders about {{convert|8|in|cm|abbr=on|0|order=flip}} long and about {{convert|1+1/4|in|cm|abbr=on|1|order=flip}} in diameter, with a weight of about {{convert|1/2|lbt|g|order=flip}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Austin Blaster Guide&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austinpowder.com/BlastersGuide/docs/pib/Dynamite%20Series.PDF |title=Austin Powder Guide, Dynamite series page 2 |accessdate=9 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321201205/http://www.austinpowder.com/BlastersGuide/docs/pib/Dynamite%20Series.PDF |archivedate=21 March 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A stick of dynamite thus produced contains roughly 1&amp;nbsp;MJ ([[megajoule]]) of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ChemViews|title=145 Years of Dynamite|url=http://www.chemistryviews.org/details/ezine/3622371/145_Years_of_Dynamite.html|website=Chemistry Views|publisher=ChemViews Magazine|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sizes also exist, rated by either portion (Quarter-Stick or Half-Stick) or by weight.

Dynamite is usually rated by &quot;weight strength&quot; (the amount of nitroglycerin it contains), usually from 20% to 60%. For example, ''40% dynamite'' is composed of 40% nitroglycerin and 60% &quot;dope&quot; (the absorbent storage medium mixed with the stabilizer and any additives).

===Storage considerations===
The maximum [[shelf life]] of nitroglycerin-based dynamite is recommended as one year from the date of manufacture under good storage conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Austin Blaster Guide&quot; /&gt;

Over time, regardless of the sorbent used, sticks of dynamite will &quot;weep&quot; or &quot;sweat&quot; nitroglycerin, which can then pool in the bottom of the box or storage area. For that reason, explosive manuals recommend the repeated turning over of boxes of dynamite in storage. Crystals will form on the outside of the sticks, causing them to be even more sensitive to shock, friction, and temperature. Therefore, while the risk of an explosion without the use of a [[blasting cap]] is minimal for fresh dynamite, old dynamite is dangerous. Modern packaging helps eliminate this by placing the dynamite into sealed plastic bags, and using wax-coated cardboard.

Dynamite is moderately sensitive to shock. Shock resistance tests are usually carried out with a drop-hammer: about 100&amp;nbsp;mg of explosive is placed on an anvil, upon which a weight of between {{convert|0.5|and|10|kg|lb}} is dropped from different heights until detonation is achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos López Jimeno, Emilio López Jimeno, Francisco Javier Ayala-Carcedo, ''Drilling and Blasting of Rocks'', translated by Yvonne Visser de Ramiro from ''Manual de perforación y voladura de rocas'' (1987), Geomining Technological Institute of Spain (Instituto Tecnológico Geominero de Espan~a), Taylor &amp; Francis, London and New York, 1995, {{ISBN|90-5410-199-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a hammer of 2&amp;nbsp;kg, [[mercury fulminate]] detonates with a drop distance of 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;cm, nitroglycerin with 4 to 5&amp;nbsp;cm, dynamite with 15 to 30&amp;nbsp;cm, and ammoniacal explosives with 40 to 50&amp;nbsp;cm.

===Major manufacturers===
[[File:Aetna dynamite.jpg|thumb|upright|Advertisement for the Aetna Explosives Company of New York.]]

====South Africa====
For several decades beginning in the 1940s, the largest producer of dynamite in the world was the [[Union of South Africa]]. There the [[De Beers]] company established a factory in 1902 at [[Somerset West]]. The explosives factory was later operated by [[AECI]] (African Explosives and Chemical Industries). The demand for the product came mainly from the country's vast gold mines, centered on the [[Witwatersrand]]. The factory at Somerset West was in operation in 1903 and by 1907 it was already producing 340,000 cases, {{convert|50|lb|kg|order=flip}} each, annually. A rival factory at Modderfontein was producing another 200,000 cases per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caia.co.za/index.php?pg=18 AECI: South Africa – History of the Chemical Industry]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two large explosions at the Somerset West plant during the 1960s. Some workers died, but the loss of life was limited by the modular design of the factory and its earth works, and the planting of trees that directed the blasts upward. There were several other explosions at the Modderfontein factory. After 1985, pressure from trade unions forced AECI to phase out the production of dynamite. The factory then went on to produce ammonium nitrate emulsion-based explosives that are safer to manufacture and handle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeci.co.za/New/History/1980.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630050905/http://www.aeci.co.za/New/History/1980.htm |archivedate=30 June 2006 |title=Historical Highlights 1980's |date=30 June 2006 |accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
Dynamite was first manufactured in the U.S. by the [[Giant Powder Company]] of [[San Francisco, California]], whose founder had obtained the exclusive rights from Nobel in 1867.  Giant was eventually acquired by [[DuPont]], which produced dynamite under the Giant name until Giant was dissolved by DuPont in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;[https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc38234/m1/147/ ''US v. Du Pont'' 188 Fed 127, 147]&lt;/ref&gt;
Thereafter, DuPont produced dynamite under its own name until 1911–12 when its explosives monopoly was broken up by the U.S. Circuit Court in the &quot;Powder Case&quot;. 
Two new companies were formed upon the breakup, the [[Hercules Powder Company]] and the Atlas Powder Company, which took up the manufacture of dynamite (in different formulations) thereafter.

Currently only [[Dyno Nobel]] manufactures dynamite in the US. The only facility producing it is located in [[Carthage, Missouri]], but the material is purchased from Dyno Nobel by other manufacturers, who put their labels on the dynamite and boxes.

==Non-dynamite explosives==
Other explosives are often referred to or confused with dynamite:

===TNT===
[[TNT]] is most commonly assumed to be the same as (or confused for) dynamite, largely due to the ubiquity of both explosives during the 20th century and the civilian practice of preparing dynamite charges in 8x1&quot; &quot;sticks&quot; wrapped in red waxed paper and shaped to fit the cylindrical [[borehole]]s drilled in the rock face. This incorrect connection between TNT and dynamite was enhanced by [[Bugs Bunny]] cartoons where animators started labeling ''any'' kind of cartoon bomb (ranging from sticks of dynamite to kegs of [[black powder]]) as &quot;TNT&quot; because the acronym was shorter, more memorable and didn't require [[literacy]] to recognize &quot;TNT&quot; meant &quot;bomb&quot; (similar to the use of XXX markings on [[whiskey]] bottles and barrels in cartoons). This eventually led to the general perception that TNT and dynamite were one and the same.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

In actuality, aside from both being high explosives, TNT and dynamite have very little in common: TNT is a 2nd generation [[Use_forms_of_explosives#Castings|castable explosive]] adopted by the military. The German armed forces adopted it as a filling for artillery shells in 1902, some 40 years after the invention of dynamite, which is a 1st generation [[phlegmatized explosive]] primarily intended for civilian earthmoving. TNT has never been popular or widespread in civilian earthmoving, as it is considerably more expensive and less powerful by weight than dynamite,&lt;ref name=Meyer2008&gt;J. Köhler, R. Meyer, A. Homburg: ''Explosivstoffe.'' Zehnte, vollständig überarbeitete Auflage. Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-527-32009-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being slower to mix and pack into cylindrical boreholes; for its part, dynamite has never been popular in warfare because it degenerates quickly under severe conditions and can be detonated by either fire or a wayward bullet. TNT's primary asset is its remarkable insensitivity and stability: it is waterproof and incapable of detonating without the extreme shock and heat provided by a [[blasting cap]] (or a [[sympathetic detonation]]); this conveniently also allows it to be melted at {{convert|178|F|C}}, poured into [[shell (projectile)|high explosive shells]] and allowed to re-solidify with no extra danger or change in the TNT's characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, T.R. &amp; Popolato, A. ''LASL Explosive Property Data''. [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], New Mexico. [[USDOE]], 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, more than 90% of the TNT produced in America was always for the military market, with most filling shells, [[hand grenades]] and [[aerial bombs]] and the remainder being packaged in brown &quot;bricks&quot; (not red cylinders) for use as [[satchel charge|demolition charges]] by [[combat engineers]].

===&quot;Extra&quot; dynamite===
In the United States, in 1885, the chemist Russell S. Penniman invented &quot;ammonium dynamite&quot;, a form of explosive that used [[ammonium nitrate]] as a substitute for the more costly nitroglycerin. Ammonium nitrate has only 85% of the [[chemical energy]] of nitroglycerin.

It is rated by either &quot;weight strength&quot; (the amount of ammonium nitrate in the medium) or &quot;cartridge strength&quot; (the [[Strength (explosive)|potential explosive strength]] generated by an amount of explosive of a certain density and grain size used in comparison to the explosive strength generated by an equivalent density and grain size of a standard explosive). For example, high-explosive ''65% Extra Dynamite'' has a weight strength of 65% ammonium nitrate and 35% &quot;dope&quot; (the absorbent medium mixed with the stabilizers and additives). Its &quot;cartridge strength&quot; would be its weight in pounds times its strength in relation to an equal amount of [[ANFO]] (the civilian baseline standard) or [[TNT]] (the military baseline standard). For example, 65% ammonium dynamite with a 20% cartridge strength would mean the stick was equal to an equivalent weight strength of 20% ANFO.

===&quot;Military dynamite&quot;===
&quot;Military dynamite&quot; is a dynamite substitute, formulated without nitroglycerin. It contains 75% [[RDX]], 15% TNT, 5% SAE 10 motor oil, and 5% cornstarch, but is much safer to store and handle for long periods than Nobel's dynamite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uxoinfo.com/uxoinfo/ordfillers.cfm |title=Unexploded Ordnance Information: Ordnance Fillers |publisher=Uxoinfo.com |accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military dynamite substitutes much more stable chemicals for nitroglycerin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ledgard |first=Jared |title=A Soldiers Handbook, Volume 1: Explosives Operations |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=U6f-Qlmm6zIC&amp;pg=PA498|year=2007 |isbn=978-0-615-14794-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
