'''Douglas Carl Engelbart''' (January 30, 1925&amp;nbsp;– July 2, 2013) was an American [[engineer]] and [[inventor]], and an early computer and [[List of Internet pioneers|Internet pioneer]]. He is best known for his work on founding the field of [[human–computer interaction]], particularly while at his [[Augmentation Research Center]] Lab in [[SRI International]], which resulted in creation of the [[computer mouse]], and the development of [[hypertext]], networked computers, and precursors to [[graphical user interface]]s. These were demonstrated at [[The Mother of All Demos]] in 1968. [[Engelbart's law]], the observation that the intrinsic rate of human performance is exponential, is named after him.

In the early 1950s, he decided that instead of &quot;having a steady job&quot; – such as his position at [[Ames Research Center]] – he would focus on making the world a better place. He reasoned that because the complexity of the world's problems was increasing, and because any effort to improve the world would require the coordination of groups of people, the most effective way to solve problems was to augment human intelligence and develop ways of building collective intelligence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview with Doug Engelbart&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Markoff|first1=John|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeSgaJt27PM|title=Interview with Doug Engelbart|access-date=March 31, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403045938/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeSgaJt27PM|archive-date=April 3, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the computer, which was at the time thought of only as a tool for automation, would be an essential tool for future knowledge workers to solve such problems. He was a committed, vocal proponent of the development and use of computers and [[computer network]]s to help cope with the world's increasingly urgent and complex problems. Engelbart embedded a set of organizing principles in his lab, which he termed &quot;bootstrapping&quot;. His belief was that when human systems and tool systems were aligned, such that workers spent time &quot;improving their tools for improving their tools&quot; it would lead to an accelerating rate of progress.

[[NLS (computer system) | NLS]], the &quot;oN-Line System,&quot; developed by the Augmentation Research Center under Engelbart's guidance with funding primarily from ARPA (as [[DARPA]] was then known), demonstrated numerous technologies, most of which are now in widespread use; it included the computer mouse, bitmapped screens, hypertext; all of which were displayed at &quot;The Mother of All Demos&quot; in 1968. The lab was transferred from SRI to [[Tymshare]] in the late 1970s, which was acquired by [[McDonnell Douglas]] in 1984, and NLS was renamed Augment (now the Doug Engelbart Institute).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/155/87/ |title=the Doug Engelbart Institute website |access-date=December 9, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181209165419/http://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/155/87/ |archive-date=December 9, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; At both Tymshare and McDonnell Douglas, Engelbart was limited by a lack of interest in his ideas and funding to pursue them, and retired in 1986.

In 1988, Engelbart and his daughter Christina launched the Bootstrap Institute – later known as [[The Doug Engelbart Institute]] – to promote his vision, especially at Stanford University; this effort did result in some DARPA funding to modernize the user interface of Augment. In December 2000, [[United States President]] [[Bill Clinton]] awarded Engelbart the National Medal of Technology, the U.S.'s highest technology award. In December 2008, Engelbart was honored by SRI at the 40th anniversary of the &quot;Mother of All Demos&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Engelbart was born in [[Portland, Oregon]], on January 30, 1925, to Carl Louis Engelbart and Gladys Charlotte Amelia Munson Engelbart. His ancestors were of [[Germans|German]], [[Swedes|Swedish]] and [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] descent.&lt;ref name=&quot;interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowood|first=Henry|url=http://www-sul.stanford.edu/depts/hasrg/histsci/ssvoral/engelbart/main1-ntb.html|title=Douglas Engelbart Interview 1, Stanford and the Silicon Valley: Oral History Interviews|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|date=December 19, 1986|accessdate=June 17, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218234744/http://www-sul.stanford.edu/depts/hasrg/histsci/ssvoral/engelbart/main1-ntb.html|archive-date=February 18, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the middle of three children, with a sister Dorianne (three years older), and a brother David (14 months younger). The family lived in Portland, Oregon, in his early years, and moved to the surrounding countryside along Johnson Creek when he was 8. His father died one year later. He graduated from Portland's [[Franklin High School (Portland, Oregon)|Franklin High School]] in 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-computer.com/People/EngelbartBio.html|title=Biography of Douglas Engelbart|first=Georgi|last=Dalakov|publisher=History of Computers|accessdate=July 29, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711002513/http://history-computer.com/People/EngelbartBio.html|archive-date=July 11, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Midway through his undergraduate years at [[Oregon State University]], he served two years in the [[United States Navy]] as a radio and [[radar]] technician in the [[Philippines]]. It was there on a small island, in a tiny hut on stilts, he read [[Vannevar Bush]]'s article &quot;[[As We May Think]]&quot;, which greatly inspired him.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot; /&gt; He returned to Oregon State and completed his bachelor's degree in [[electrical engineering]] in 1948. While at Oregon State, he was a member of [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]] social fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sigep.org/resourcedocs/about-resources/Citation-Recipients.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224110442/http://www.sigep.org/resourcedocs/about-resources/Citation-Recipients.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 24, 2013|title=Citation Recipients|publisher=[[Sigma Phi Epsilon]]|page=5|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sigep.org/about/who-we-are/history-and-facts/prominentalumni/business/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130814140912/http://www.sigep.org/about/who-we-are/history-and-facts/prominentalumni/business/|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 14, 2013|title=Prominent Alumni: Business|publisher=[[Sigma Phi Epsilon]]|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was hired by the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] at the [[Ames Research Center]], where he worked in wind tunnel maintenance. In his off hours he enjoyed hiking, camping, and folk dancing. It was there he met Ballard Fish (August 18, 1928 – June 18, 1997),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://engelbart85.wordpress.com/2010/01/23/happy-birthday-memories/|title=Happy Birthday Memories|work=Happy Birthday Doug Engelbart!|access-date=September 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117033444/https://engelbart85.wordpress.com/2010/01/23/happy-birthday-memories/|archive-date=November 17, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was just completing her training to become an occupational therapist. They were married in [[Portola State Park]] on May 5, 1951. Soon after, Engelbart left Ames to pursue graduate studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. There, he received an [[M.S.]] in electrical engineering in 1953 and a [[Ph.D.]] in the discipline in 1955.&lt;ref name=&quot;cv&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Curriculum Vitae|first=Douglas|last=Engelbart|publisher=[[The Doug Engelbart Institute]]|url=http://dougengelbart.org/about/cv.html|accessdate=April 14, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512082050/http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/cv.html|archive-date=May 12, 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career and accomplishments ==
[[File:SRI Computer Mouse.jpg|thumb|right|Engelbart's [[Mouse (computing)#Early mice|prototype of a computer mouse]], as designed by [[William English (computer engineer)|Bill English]] from Engelbart's sketches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1137400/mouse40.html|title=The computer mouse turns 40|first=Benj|last=Edwards|publisher=[[Macworld]]|date=December 9, 2008|accessdate=April 16, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102191941/http://www.macworld.com/article/1137400/mouse40.html|archive-date=January 2, 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Guiding philosophy ===
Engelbart's career was inspired in December 1950 when he was engaged to be married and realized he had no career goals other than &quot;a steady job, getting married and living happily ever after&quot;.&lt;ref name=OBrien1999&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.siliconvalley.com/ci_23592605 |title=Douglas Engelbart's lasting legacy |date=February 9, 1999 |author=Tia O'Brien |work=San Jose Mercury News |accessdate=July 4, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707130924/http://www.siliconvalley.com/ci_23592605 |archivedate=July 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over several months he reasoned that:
# he would focus his career on making the world a better place&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dougengelbart.org/colloquium/colloquium.html|title=The Unfinished Revolution II: Strategy and Means for Coping with Complex Problems|work=Colloquium at Stanford University|publisher=[[The Doug Engelbart Institute]]|date=April 2000|accessdate=June 17, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007003536/http://dougengelbart.org/colloquium/colloquium.html|archive-date=October 7, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# any serious effort to make the world better would require some kind of organized effort that harnessed the collective human intellect of all people to contribute to effective solutions.
# if you could dramatically improve how we do that, you'd be boosting every effort on the planet to solve important problems – the sooner the better
# computers could be the vehicle for dramatically improving this capability.&lt;ref name=OBrien1999 /&gt;

In 1945, Engelbart had read with interest [[Vannevar Bush]]'s article &quot;As We May Think&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dougengelbart.org/events/vannevar-bush-symposium.html#2|title=The MIT/Brown Vannevar Bush Symposium: Influence on Doug Engelbart|publisher=[[The Doug Engelbart Institute]]|accessdate=June 17, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914061144/http://www.dougengelbart.org/events/vannevar-bush-symposium.html#2|archive-date=September 14, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; a call to action for making knowledge widely available as a national peacetime grand challenge. He had also read something about the recent phenomenon of computers, and from his experience as a radar technician, he knew that information could be analyzed and displayed on a screen. He envisioned intellectual workers sitting at display &quot;working stations&quot;, flying through information space, harnessing their collective intellectual capacity to solve important problems together in much more powerful ways. Harnessing collective intellect, facilitated by interactive computers, became his life's mission at a time when computers were viewed as number crunching tools.&lt;ref name=&quot;aughum&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework|first=Douglas C|last=Engelbart|work=SRI Summary Report AFOSR-3223, Prepared for: Director of Information Sciences, Air Force Office of Scientific Research|publisher=SRI International, hosted by [[The Doug Engelbart Institute]]|url=http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html|date=October 1962|accessdate=August 11, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504035147/http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html|archive-date=May 4, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a graduate student at Berkeley, he assisted in the construction of [[CALDIC]]. His graduate work led to eight patents.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Doug Engelbart Institute&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/patents.html|title=U.S. Patents held by Douglas C. Engelbart|publisher=[[The Doug Engelbart Institute]]|accessdate=August 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824011812/http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/patents.html|archive-date=August 24, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his doctorate, Engelbart stayed on at Berkeley as an [[assistant professor]] for a year before departing when it became clear that he could not pursue his vision there. Engelbart then formed a startup company, Digital Techniques, to commercialize some of his doctoral research on storage devices, but after a year decided instead to pursue the research he had been dreaming of since 1951.&lt;ref name=&quot;pursuit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dougengelbart.org/history/engelbart.html|title=A Lifetime Pursuit|publisher=[[The Doug Engelbart Institute]]|accessdate=August 11, 2013}}&lt;!--|quote=Within a year, however, he was tipped off by a colleague that if he kept talking about his &quot;wild ideas&quot; he'd be an acting assistant professor forever. So he ventured back down into what is now Silicon Valley, in search of more suitable employment.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SRI and the Augmentation Research Center ===
Engelbart took a position at [[SRI International]] (known then as Stanford Research Institute) in [[Menlo Park, California]] in 1957. He worked for [[Hewitt Crane]] on magnetic devices and miniaturization of electronics; Engelbart and Crane became close friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=What the Dormouse Said|author=Markoff, John|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cTyfxP-g2IIC&amp;pg=PT70&amp;lpg=PT70|publisher=Penguin|year=2005|page=70|isbn=1-101-20108-8|access-date=June 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501124226/http://books.google.com/books?id=cTyfxP-g2IIC&amp;pg=PT70&amp;lpg=PT70|archive-date=May 1, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; At SRI, Engelbart soon obtained a dozen patents,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Doug Engelbart Institute&quot;/&gt; and by 1962 produced a report about his vision and proposed research agenda titled ''Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework''.&lt;ref name=&quot;aughum&quot; /&gt; Among other highlights, this paper introduced &quot;[[Building Information Modelling]]&quot;, which architectural and engineering practice eventually adopted (first as &quot;[[parametric design]]&quot;) in the 1990s and after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineering.com/BIM/ArticleID/11436/BIM-101-What-is-Building-Information-Modeling.aspx|title=What is Building Information Modeling|publisher=[[Engineering.com]]|accessdate=February 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304224947/http://www.engineering.com/BIM/ArticleID/11436/BIM-101-What-is-Building-Information-Modeling.aspx|archive-date=March 4, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This led to funding from ARPA to launch his work. Engelbart recruited a research team in his new [[Augmentation Research Center]] (ARC, the lab he founded at SRI). Engelbart embedded a set of organizing principles in his lab, which he termed &quot;[[bootstrapping]] strategy&quot;. He designed the strategy to accelerate the rate of innovation of his lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/bootstrapping-strategy.html|title=About an Accelerative Bootstrapping Strategy|publisher=[[The Doug Engelbart Institute]]|accessdate=June 17, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712033921/http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/bootstrapping-strategy.html|archive-date=July 12, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;scopus&quot;&gt;{{Scopus|id=6701716173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dblp&quot;&gt;{{DBLP|name=Douglas C. Engelbart}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;microsoft&quot;&gt;{{AcademicSearch|1367057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ARC became the driving force behind the design and development of the [[NLS (computer system)|oN-Line System]] (NLS). He and his team developed computer interface elements such as [[bitmap]]ped screens, the mouse, [[hypertext]], collaborative tools, and precursors to the [[graphical user interface]].&lt;ref name=&quot;acm&quot;&gt;{{ACMPortal|id=81100342853}}&lt;/ref&gt; He conceived and developed many of his user interface ideas in the mid-1960s, long before the personal computer revolution, at a time when most computers were inaccessible to individuals who could only use computers through intermediaries (see [[batch processing]]), and when software tended to be written for [[vertical application]]s in proprietary systems.

Engelbart applied for a [[patent]] in 1967 and received it in 1970, for the wooden shell with two metal wheels ([[Mouse (computing)|computer mouse]] – {{US patent |3541541}}), which he had developed with [[William English (computer engineer)|Bill English]], his lead engineer, sometime before 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19660020914 Computer-aided Display Control] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104104354/https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19660020914 |date=January 4, 2018 }} English &amp; Englebart, July 1965&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1633972.stm|title=Mouse inventor strives for more|first=Alfred|last=Hermida|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=November 5, 2001|accessdate=June 17, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030054344/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1633972.stm|archive-date=October 30, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the patent application it is described as an &quot;X-Y position indicator for a display system&quot;.

He never received any royalties for the invention of the mouse. During an interview, he said &quot;[[SRI International|SRI]] patented the mouse, but they really had no idea of its value. Some years later it was learned that they had licensed it to [[Apple Computer]] for something like $40,000.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.superkids.com/aweb/pages/features/mouse/mouse.html| title= Doug Engelbart: Father of the Mouse| publisher= SuperKids| first= Andrew| last= Maisel| accessdate= June 17, 2012| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120702162333/http://www.superkids.com/aweb/pages/features/mouse/mouse.html| archive-date= July 2, 2012| url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engelbart showcased the [[chorded keyboard]] and many more of his and ARC's inventions in 1968 at [[The Mother of All Demos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Engelbart|first= Douglas C.|title = SRI-ARC.

=== Tymshare and McDonnell Douglas ===

Engelbart slipped into relative obscurity by the mid-1970s. As early as 1970, several of his researchers became alienated from him and left his organization for [[Xerox PARC]], in part due to frustration, and in part due to differing views of the future of computing.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACMTuring1997&quot; /&gt; Engelbart saw the future in collaborative, networked, [[timesharing|timeshare]] (client-server) computers, which younger programmers rejected in favor of the [[personal computer]]. The conflict was both technical and ideological: the younger programmers came from an era where centralized power was highly suspect, and personal computing was just barely on the horizon.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACMTuring1997&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=OBrien1999 /&gt;

Beginning in 1972, several key ARC personnel were involved in [[Erhard Seminars Training]] (EST), with Engelbart ultimately serving on the corporation's board of directors for many years. Although EST had been recommended by other researchers, the controversial nature of EST and other social experiments reduced the morale and social cohesion of the ARC community.&lt;ref name=&quot;bard&quot; /&gt; The 1969 [[Mike Mansfield#Mansfield Amendments|Mansfield Amendment]], which ended military funding of non-military research, the end of the [[Vietnam War]], and the end of the [[Apollo program]] gradually reduced ARC's funding from ARPA and [[NASA]] throughout the early 1970s.

SRI's management, which disapproved of Engelbart's approach to running the center, placed the remains of ARC under the control of [[artificial intelligence]] researcher [[Bertram Raphael]], who negotiated the transfer of the laboratory to a company called [[Tymshare]] in 1976. Engelbart's house in [[Atherton, California]] burned down during this period, causing him and his family further problems. Tymshare took over [[NLS (computer system)|NLS]] and the lab that Engelbart had founded, hired most of the lab's staff (including its creator as a Senior Scientist), renamed the software ''Augment'', and offered it as a commercial service via its new Office Automation Division. Tymshare was already somewhat familiar with NLS; when ARC was still operational, it had experimented with its own local copy of the NLS software on a minicomputer called OFFICE-1, as part of a joint project with ARC.&lt;ref name=OBrien1999 /&gt;

At Tymshare, Engelbart soon found himself further marginalized. Operational concerns at Tymshare overrode Engelbart's desire to conduct ongoing research. Various executives, first at Tymshare and later at [[McDonnell Douglas]], which acquired Tymshare in 1984, expressed interest in his ideas, but never committed the funds or the people to further develop them. His interest inside of McDonnell Douglas was focused on the enormous knowledge management and IT requirements involved in the life cycle of an aerospace program, which served to strengthen Engelbart's resolve to motivate the information technology arena toward global interoperability and an open hyperdocument system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dougengelbart.org/about/ohs.html|title=About An Open Hyperdocument System (OHS)|publisher=[[The Doug Engelbart Institute]]|accessdate=June 17, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712033937/http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/ohs.html|archive-date=July 12, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engelbart retired from McDonnell Douglas in 1986, determined to pursue his work free from commercial pressure.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACMTuring1997&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=OBrien1999 /&gt;

=== Bootstrap and the Doug Engelbart Institute ===
Teaming with his daughter, Christina Engelbart, he founded the Bootstrap Institute in 1988 to coalesce his ideas into a series of three-day and half-day management seminars offered at Stanford University from 1989 to 2000.&lt;ref name=OBrien1999 /&gt; By the early 1990s there was sufficient interest among his seminar graduates to launch a collaborative implementation of his work, and the [[The Doug Engelbart Institute|Bootstrap Alliance]] was formed as a non-profit home base for this effort. Although the invasion of Iraq and subsequent recession spawned a rash of belt-tightening reorganizations which drastically redirected the efforts of their alliance partners, they continued with the management seminars, consulting, and small-scale collaborations. In the mid-1990s they were awarded some DARPA funding to develop a modern user interface to Augment, called Visual AugTerm (VAT),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About NLS/Augment |publisher=Doug Engelbart Institute |url=http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/augment.html |accessdate=July 4, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704150436/http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/augment.html |archive-date=July 4, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; while participating in a larger program addressing the IT requirements of the Joint Task Force.

Engelbart was Founder Emeritus of the Doug Engelbart Institute, which he founded in 1988 with his daughter Christina Engelbart, who is Executive Director. The Institute promotes Engelbart's philosophy for boosting Collective IQ—the concept of dramatically improving how we can solve important problems together—using a strategic ''bootstrapping'' approach for accelerating our progress toward that goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Doug Engelbart Institute | url = http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/vision-highlights.html | title = Doug's Vision Highlights | access-date = January 26, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081221231428/http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/vision-highlights.html | archive-date = December 21, 2008 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Engelbart received a [[National Science Foundation]] grant to fund the open source HyperScope project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/hyperscope.html|title=HyperScope Basics|publisher=[[The Doug Engelbart Institute]]|accessdate=August 11, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809041605/http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/hyperscope.html|archive-date=August 9, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hyperscope team built a browser component using [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] and [[Dynamic HTML]] designed to replicate Augment's multiple viewing and jumping capabilities (linking within and across various documents).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/euos2006/view/e_sess/9626|title=Douglas Engelbart's HyperScope: Taking Web Collaboration to the Next Level Using Ajax and Dojo|publisher=O'Reilly Media|accessdate=July 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222023413/http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/euos2006/view/e_sess/9626|archive-date=December 22, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The Doug Engelbart Institute is now based at [[SRI International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/about-us.html#3|title=Contact Info|publisher=The Doug Engelbart Institute|accessdate=July 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704150345/http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/about-us.html#3|archive-date=July 4, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; I don't think this is accurate – based on the ref I think they are simply leasing space there. --&gt;

=== Later years and death ===
Engelbart attended the Program for the Future 2010 Conference where hundreds of people convened at The Tech Museum in San Jose and online to engage in dialog about how to pursue his vision to augment [[collective intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.corporationtocommunity.com/douglas-engelbart/|title= Douglas Engelbart|publisher= Corporation to Community|date= February 16, 2011|accessdate= July 29, 2012|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130405225218/http://www.corporationtocommunity.com/douglas-engelbart/|archivedate= April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most complete coverage of Engelbart's bootstrapping ideas can be found in ''Boosting Our Collective IQ'', by Douglas C. Engelbart, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dougengelbart.org/library/books.html|title=Engelbart Books|publisher=Doug Engelbart institute|access-date=March 14, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307040334/http://www.dougengelbart.org/library/books.html|archive-date=March 7, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes three of Engelbart's key papers, edited into book form by [[Yuri Rubinsky]] and Christina Engelbart to commemorate the presentation of the 1995 SoftQuad Web Award to Doug Engelbart at the World Wide Web conference in Boston in December 1995. Only 2,000 softcover copies were printed, and 100 hardcover, numbered and signed by Engelbart and [[Tim Berners-Lee]]. Engelbart's book is now being republished by the Doug Engelbart Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Since 2008, available online at https://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/books/augment-133150.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Two comprehensive histories of Engelbart's laboratory and work are in ''What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry'' by [[John Markoff]] and ''A Heritage of Innovation: SRI's First Half Century'' by Donald Neilson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Heritage of Innovation: SRI's First Half Century|author=Donald Neilson|publisher=[[SRI International]]|year=2005|isbn=0-9745208-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other books on Engelbart and his laboratory include ''Bootstrapping: Douglas Engelbart, Coevolution, and the Origins of Personal Computing'' by [[Thierry Bardini]] and ''The Engelbart Hypothesis: Dialogs with Douglas Engelbart'', by [[Valerie Landau]] and [[Eileen Clegg]] in conversation with Douglas Engelbart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Engelbart Hypothesis: Dialogs with Douglas Engelbart | first = Valerie | last = Landau | authorlink = Valerie Landau | date=November 17, 2009 | isbn=978-0-615-30890-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; All four of these books are based on interviews with Engelbart as well as other contributors in his laboratory.

Engelbart served on the Advisory Boards of the [[University of Santa Clara Center for Science, Technology, and Society]], [[Foresight Institute]],&lt;ref name=&quot;fore&quot; /&gt; [[Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility]], The Technology Center of Silicon Valley, and The Liquid Information Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.liquid.info/company.html |work = About Us |title = Advisory Board |publisher = The Liquid Information Co |accessdate = July 29, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120920042009/http://liquid.info/company.html |archive-date = September 20, 2012 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engelbart had four children, Gerda, Diana, Christina and Norman with his first wife Ballard, who died in 1997 after 47 years of marriage.

=== Anecdotal notes ===
Historian of science [[Thierry Bardini]] argues that Engelbart's complex personal philosophy (which drove all his research) foreshadowed the modern application of the concept of [[coevolution]] to the philosophy and use of technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;bard&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author1-link = Thierry Bardini | first1 = Thierry | last1 = Bardini | first2 = Michael | last2 = Friedewald | title = Chronicle of the Death of a Laboratory: Douglas Engelbart and the Failure of the Knowledge Workshop | journal = [[History of Technology (magazine)|History of Technology]] | year = 2002 | volume = 23 | pages = 192–212 | url = http://www.friedewald-family.de/Publikationen/hot2002.pdf | access-date = August 14, 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120316202505/http://www.friedewald-family.de/Publikationen/hot2002.pdf | archive-date = March 16, 2012 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis|principle of linguistic relativity]] developed by [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]]. Where Whorf reasoned that the sophistication of a language controls the sophistication of the thoughts that can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that the state of our current technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work.&lt;ref name=&quot;bard&quot; /&gt;

== Honors ==
Since the late 1980s, prominent individuals and organizations have recognized the seminal importance of Engelbart's contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/honors.html|title=Honors Awarded to Doug Engelbart|publisher=[[The Doug Engelbart Institute]]|accessdate=June 17, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712033645/http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/honors.html|archive-date=July 12, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1995, at the Fourth WWW Conference in Boston, he was the first recipient of what would later become the [[Yuri Rubinsky Memorial Award]].
