      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Democratic Republic of the Congo''' forms part of the [[Congo Basin|Congo River Basin]], which covers an area of almost {{convert|1000000|km2}}. The country's only outlet to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] is a narrow strip of land on the north bank of the [[Congo River]].

The vast, low-lying central area is a plateau-shaped basin sloping toward the west, covered by [[tropical rainforest]] and criss-crossed by rivers, a large area of this has been categorized by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] as the [[Central Congolian lowland forests]] [[ecoregion]]. The forest center is surrounded by mountainous terraces in the west, plateaus merging into savannas in the south and southwest. 

Dense grasslands extend beyond the Congo River in the north. High mountains of the [[Ruwenzori Range]] (some above {{convert|5000|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) are found on the eastern borders with [[Rwanda]] and [[Uganda]] (see [[Albertine Rift montane forests]] for a description of this area).

== Climate ==
[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map COD present.svg|thumb|300px|Democratic Republic of the Congo map of KÃ¶ppen climate classification zones]]
The Democratic Republic of the Congo lies on the [[equator]], with one-third of the country to the north and two-thirds to the south. The climate is hot and humid in the river basin and cool and dry in the southern highlands, with a cold, alpine climate in the [[Rwenzori Mountains]].

South of the equator, the rainy season lasts from October to May and north of the Equator, from April to November. Along the Equator, rainfall is fairly regular throughout the year. During the wet season, thunderstorms often are violent but seldom last more than a few hours. The average rainfall for the entire country is about {{convert|1070|mm|in|abbr=on}}. 

The Democratic Republic of Congo has a hot and wet climate because it lies in the equatorial region. It is hot because it receives direct sunlight and the seas evaporate faster because of the heat and that is the reason for humidity and rainfall. The hot and wet climate of DRC is known as the equatorial climate.

Very narrow strip of land that controls the lower [[Congo River]] and is the only outlet to South [[Atlantic Ocean]]; dense tropical [[rainforest]] in the central river basin and eastern highlands.
