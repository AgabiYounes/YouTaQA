[[File:Aalborg Lufthavn indgang.JPG|thumb|right|Aalborg airport in the north of Jutland]] 
In 2011, a total of appr. 28 million passengers used Danish airports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/SelectVarVal/define.asp?MainTable=FLYV91&amp;PLanguage=1&amp;Tabstrip=&amp;PXSId=0&amp;SessID=52464960&amp;FF=2&amp;grouping4=AAR&amp;tfrequency=4 Departing passengers from major manned, public airports by airport, type of transport and flight.] Statistics Denmark.

[[Copenhagen Airport]] is the largest airport in [[Scandinavia]], handling approximately 29m passengers per year (2016).  It is located at [[Kastrup]], 8&amp;nbsp;km south-east of central [[Copenhagen]]. It is connected by train to [[Copenhagen Central Station]] and beyond as well as to [[Malmö]] and other towns in [[Sweden]].

For the west of the country, the major airport is [[Billund Airport|Billund]] (3m passengers in 2016) although both  [[Aalborg Airport|Aalborg]] (1.4m passengers in 2011) and [[Aarhus Airport|Aarhus]] (591.000 passengers in 2011) have smaller airports with regular connections to Copenhagen.

=== List of airports ===
{{Further|List of the largest airports in the Nordic countries }}

==Sea==
Being an island state with a long coastline and always close to the sea, maritime transport has always been important in Denmark. From the primitive [[Dugout (boat)|dugouts]] of the [[Nordic Stone Age|Stone Age]] to the complex designs of the [[Viking ship]]s in the [[Viking Age]], often built to exactly facilitate large scale cargo and passenger transportation. Denmark also engaged in the large scale cargo freights and [[Atlantic slave trade|slave transports]] of the [[History of colonialism|European colonization]] endeavours in the Middle Ages and operated several smaller [[Danish colonial empire|colonies of its own]] across the globe by the means of seafaring.

Today Denmark's ports handle some 48 million passengers and 109 million tonnes of cargo per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?MainTable=SKIB101&amp;PLanguage=1&amp;PXSId=0 Call of vessels, passengers and throughput of goods in traffic ports by seaport and unit.] Statistics Denmark.

===Passenger traffic===
[[File:Rødbyhavn - færgehavnen.JPG|thumb|right|Rødbyhavn ferry terminal on [[Lolland]]]] 
Passenger traffic is made up partly of ferry crossings within Denmark, partly of international ferry crossings and partly of cruise ship passengers. [[HH Ferry route|Some short ferry routes]] are being [[Electric boat|electrified]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cruiseandferry.net/articles/214resund-dry-docks-to-modernise-hh-ferries-vessels |title=Öresund Dry Docks to modernise HH Ferries' vessels|work=CruiseandFerry.net|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several more  may be eligible,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.siemens.dk/home/dk/dk/core_topics/intelligent-infrastructure/Documents/MOB_eferrystudy_1016UK_FINAL.pdf|format=PDF|title=Electrification of Denmark’s ferry fleet|website=W3.siemens.dk|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transport in Norway#Ferries|as in Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tu.no/artikler/batterifergen-har-mattet-sta-over-avganger-na-er-losningen-klar/364633 |title=Batterifergen har måttet stå over avganger.

* [[Fredericia]] 15,327
* [[Aarhus]] 12,189
* [[Port of Copenhagen|Copenhagen]] 7,379

===Waterways===
Waterways have historically and traditionally been crucial to local transportation in Denmark proper. Especially the [[Gudenå]] river-system in central Jutland, has played an important role. The waterways were navigated by wooden [[barge]]s and later on [[steamboat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/1001fortaellinger/en_GB/the-towpath-along-the-gudenaaen-river|title=The towpath along the Gudenåen River|publisher=The Heritage Agency of Denmark (Danish agency for Culture)|website=1001 stories of Denmark|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few historical steamboats are still in operation, like the [[SS Hjejlen]] from 1861 at [[Silkeborg]].

There is a 160&amp;nbsp;km natural canal through the shallow [[Limfjorden]] in northern Jutland, linking the [[North Sea]] to the [[Kattegat]].

Many waterways has formerly been redirected and led through manmade canals in the 1900s, but mainly for agricultural purposes and not to facilitate transportation on any major scale. Several cities have manmade canals used for transportation and traffic purposes. Of special mention are the [[:Category:Canals in Copenhagen|canals of Copenhagen]] and the [[Odense Canal]], ferrying large numbers of both tourists and local citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcanals.com/english/denmark.html World Canals - Denmark.] Retrieved 26 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
Denmark has a large merchant fleet relative to its size. In 2018, the fleet surpassed 20 million [[Gross tonnage|gt]] as the government sought to repatriate Danish-owned tonnage registered abroad, with measures including removal of the registration fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Historic growth in Danish shipping registries continues |url=https://eng.em.dk/news/2018/juni/historic-growth-in-danish-shipping-registries-continues |website=Ministry of Industry, Business and Financial Affairs |accessdate=10 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Denmark has created its own international register, called the [[Danish Maritime Authority|Danish International Ship register (DIS)]], open to commercial vessels only. DIS ships do not have to meet Danish manning regulations.

== Railways ==

{{Main|Rail transport in Denmark}}
The largest railway operator in [[Denmark]] is [[Danske Statsbaner]] (DSB) &amp;mdash; Danish State Railways. [[Arriva]] operates some routes in [[Jutland]], and several other smaller operators provide local services.

The total length of operational track is 2,667&amp;nbsp;km, 640&amp;nbsp;km electrified at 25 kV AC, 946&amp;nbsp;km double track (2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?Maintable=BANE41&amp;PLanguage=1 Railway network 1 January by railway system and unit (2008).] Statistics Denmark. Retrieved 24 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 508&amp;nbsp;km is privately owned and operated. Track is [[standard gauge]].

The railway system is connected to Sweden by bridge in Copenhagen and ferry in Helsingør and Frederikshavn, by land to Germany in Padborg and ferry in Rødby and to Norway by ferry in Hirtshals.

== Roads ==

== Cycling ==
{{Main|Cycling in Denmark}}
Bicycling in Denmark is a common and popular [[utility cycling|utilitarian]] and [[recreation]]al activity. [[Bicycle-friendly#Cycling infrastructure|Bicycling infrastructure]] is a dominant feature of both city and countryside infrastructure, with [[bicycle path]]s and [[segregated cycle facilities|bicycle ways]] in many places and an extensive network of [[national and regional bicycle routes throughout Denmark|bicycle routes]], extending more than {{convert|12000|km|mi}} nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.visitdenmark.dk/danmark/da-dk/menu/turist/inspiration/aktivferie/cykel/cykel-ruter-og-regioner.htm | title = Cykelruter og regioner | accessdate = 16 August 2011 | publisher = [[VisitDenmark]] | language = Danish | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120315171238/http://www.visitdenmark.dk/danmark/da-dk/menu/turist/inspiration/aktivferie/cykel/cykel-ruter-og-regioner.htm | archivedate = 15 March 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, [[Denmark#Geography|Denmark's coastline]] is {{convert|7314|km|mi}}. As a unique feature, Denmark has a [[Danish bicycle VIN-system|VIN-system for bicycles]] which is mandatory by law. Often bicycling and [[bicycle culture]] in [[Denmark]] is compared to the [[cycling in the Netherlands|Netherlands as a bicycle-nation]].
