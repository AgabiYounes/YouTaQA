'''Djibouti''' is a city in the [[Horn of Africa]]. It is bordered by [[Eritrea]] in the north, [[Ethiopia]] in the west and south, and [[Somalia]] in the southeast. To the east is its coastline on the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Aden]]. Rainfall is sparse, and most of the territory has a semi-arid to arid environment. [[Lake Assal (Djibouti)|Lake Assal]] is a saline lake which lies 155&amp;nbsp;m (509&amp;nbsp;ft) below sea level, making it the lowest point on land in [[Africa]] and the third-lowest point on Earth after the [[Sea of Galilee]] and the [[Dead Sea]]. Djibouti has the fifth smallest population in [[Africa]]. [[Djibouti]]'s major settlements include the capital [[Djibouti City]], the port towns of [[Tadjoura]] and [[Obock]], and the southern cities of [[Ali Sabieh]] and [[Dikhil]]. It is the 147st largest country in the world by land area, covering a total of {{cvt|23,200|km2}}, of which {{cvt|23,180|km2}} is land and {{cvt|20|km2}} is water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cwfbdj&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Djibouti|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/dj.html|work=The World Factbook|publisher=CIA|accessdate=April 15, 2015|date=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Djibouti shares {{Convert|125|km|mi}} of border with Eritrea, {{Convert|390|km|mi}} with Ethiopia, and {{Convert|60|km|mi}} with Somalia (total {{Convert|575|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=or}}). It has a strategic location on the [[Horn of Africa]] and the [[Bab el Mandeb]], along a route through the [[Red Sea]] and [[Suez Canal]]. Djibouti's coastline serves as a commercial gateway between the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and the Horn region's interior. The country is also the terminus of [[Ethio-Djibouti Railways|rail traffic into Ethiopia]].

==Physiographic regions==
Djibouti can be divided into three [[Physiographic regions of the world|physiographic regions]]
#The Northern Mountains
#Grand Bara
#The Southern Mountains
[[File:Goda Mountains - National Park of Forêt du Day.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Goda Mountains]]

=== Mountains===
A great arc of mountains, consisting of the [[Mousa Ali]], [[Goda Mountains]], and [[Arrei Mountains]] surrounds [[Djibouti]].

Djibouti has eight mountain ranges with peaks of over 1,000 m (3,281&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hmid&quot;&gt;[http://www.geonames.org/DJ/highest-mountains-in-djibouti.html Highest Mountains in Djibouti]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Mousa Ali]] range is considered the country's highest mountain range, with the tallest peak on the border with [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]]. It has an elevation of 2,063 m.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hmid&quot;/&gt;
* The [[Goda Mountains]] lie northwest of the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]] in [[Tadjoura Region]]. They rise to 1,783 m (5,740&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level and are the nation's largest heavily vegetated area.
* [[Garbi (mountain)|Garbi]] is a mountain in the west of Tadjourah Region. It has an elevation of 1,680 metres (5,512&amp;nbsp;ft).
* The [[Arrei Mountains]] are in the southern [[Ali Sabieh Region]]. The mountain range has an elevation of 1,301 metres (4,268&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level, and is situated near the border with Ethiopia.
* The [[Mabla Mountains]] are located in [[Obock Region]]. At 1,780&amp;nbsp;m (5,850&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level, the mountains are situated behind the coastal plain where the Red Sea meets the Gulf of Aden, on the northern side of the Gulf of Tadjoura.
* The [[Dagouein Mountain]] sit at an elevation of 1,124 m (3,688&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level.
* Hemed is a mountain in the western part of the [[Arta Region]] in south-central Djibouti. The summit is 1,103 metres (3,619&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level.
* The [[Boura Mountains]]' highest peak has an elevation of 1,003 m (3,291&amp;nbsp;ft. The ecology of this landform is [[semi-desert]]. The altitude and size of the range affects its weather, with precipitation levels varying greatly and climatic conditions consisting of distinct zones.

===Grand Bara===
[[File:Baadha Wayn (Grand Bara).jpg|230px|thumbnail|right|The Grand Bara Desert]]
The [[Grand Bara]] Desert covers parts of southern Djibouti in the Arta Region, Ali Sabieh Region and [[Dikhil Region]]. The majority of the Grand Bara Desert lies at a relatively low elevation, below 1,700 feet (560 m). Home of the popular Grand Bara footrace.

===Coasts===
Most of Djibouti has been described as part of the [[Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands]] [[ecoregion]]. The exception is a strip along the [[Red Sea]] coast, which is part of the [[Eritrean coastal desert]]; it is noted as an important migration route for birds of prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Eritrean coastal desert|id=at1304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
There is not much seasonal variation in Djibouti's [[climate]]. Hot conditions prevail year-round along with winter rainfall. Mean daily maximum temperatures range from 32 to 41&amp;nbsp;°C (90 to 106&amp;nbsp;°F), except at high elevations. In [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti City]], for instance, afternoon highs in April typically range from 28&amp;nbsp;°C (82&amp;nbsp;°F) to 34&amp;nbsp;°C (93&amp;nbsp;°F) in April. Nationally, mean daily minima generally vary between sites from about 15 to 30&amp;nbsp;°C (59 to 86&amp;nbsp;°F). The greatest range in climate occurs in eastern Djibouti, where temperatures sometimes surpass 41&amp;nbsp;°C (106&amp;nbsp;°F) in July on the littoral plains and fall below freezing point during December in the highlands. In this region, relative humidity ranges from about 40% in the mid-afternoon to 85% at night, changing somewhat according to the season.[[File:Djibouti's map of Köppen climate classification.png|thumb|200px|Köppen climate types of Djibouti]]
Djibouti has 988,000 people live there.
Djibouti has either a [[hot semi-arid climate]] (''BSh'') or a [[hot desert climate]] (''BWh''), although [[temperature]]s are much moderated at the high [[elevation]]s. On the [[Coast|coastal seaboard]], annual [[rainfall]] is less than 5 inches (131&amp;nbsp;mm); in the [[highland]]s, it is about 8 to 16 inches (200 to 400&amp;nbsp;mm). Although the coastal regions are hot and humid throughout the year, the hinterland is typically hot and dry. The climate conditions are highly variable within the country and vary locally by altitude. Summers are very humid along the coast but dry in the [[highland]]s. Heat waves are frequent. Annual precipitation amounts vary greatly from one year to another. In general, rain falls more frequently and extensively in the mountains. Sudden and brutal storms are also known to occur. Wadis turn for a few hours into raging torrents tearing everything in their path, and their course is regularized{{clarify|date=September 2013}}. Rainwater serves as an additional water supply for livestock and plants alongside seasonal watercourses. The highlands have temperate climate throughout out the year. The climate of most lowland zones is arid and semiarid.

The climate of the interior shows notable differences from the coastline. Especially in the mornings, the temperature is pleasant: it is so in [[Arta, Djibouti|Arta]], [[Randa, Djibouti|Randa]] and Day (where temperatures of 10 degrees Celsius have been recorded).

===Water in Djibouti===
[[Water]] is becoming a scarce resource in Djibouti due to [[climate change]], which leads to different rainfall patterns as well as to inefficient methods of distribution within the country. Most of Djibouti's rainfall is in the four months, but over the last 25 years, the Djibouti's Ministry of Environment estimates that rainfall has decreased overall between 5 and 20 percent. It is predicted that in future years, there will be higher temperatures, lower rainfall, and longer [[drought]]s, leading to even less access to water. Moreover, seawater intrusion or fossil saltwater contamination of the limited freshwater aquifers due to [[overdrafting|groundwater overexploitation]] affect those who live close to the coastline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018|title=Geochemical, multi-isotopic studies and geothermal potential evaluation of the complex Djibouti volcanic aquifer (Republic of Djibouti)|journal=Applied Geochemistry|volume=97|pages=301–321|doi=10.1016/j.apgeochem.2018.07.019|last1=Awaleh|first1=Mohamed Osman|last2=Boschetti|first2=Tiziano|last3=Soubaneh|first3=Youssouf Djibril|last4=Kim|first4=Yongje|last5=Baudron|first5=Paul|last6=Kawalieh|first6=Ali Dirir|last7=Ahmed|first7=Moussa Mahdi|last8=Daoud|first8=Mohamed Ahmed|last9=Dabar|first9=Omar Assowe|last10=Kadieh|first10=Ibrahim Houssein|last11=Adiyaman|first11=Özlem|last12=Elmi|first12=Sikie Abdillahi|last13=Chirdon|first13=Mahamoud Ali}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, population growth has increased rapidly with the addition of many refugees.

===Natural resources===
Unlike much of the [[Horn of Africa]] and [[Middle East]] which is rich in lucrative crude oil, [[Djibouti]] has limited natural resources. These include potential geothermal power, [[gold]], clay, granite, [[limestone]], marble, [[salt]], diatomite, gypsum, pumice, petroleum.

==Environment==
