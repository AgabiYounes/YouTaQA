'''''Ardipithecus''''' is a genus of an extinct [[hominine]] that lived during the [[Late Miocene]] and [[Early Pliocene]] epochs in the [[Afar Depression]], [[Ethiopia]]. Originally described as one of the earliest ancestors of humans after they diverged from the chimpanzees, the relation of this [[genus]] to human ancestors and whether it is a [[hominin]] is now a matter of debate.&lt;ref name=cbs&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev-anthro-092611-145724 |ssrn=2158257 |title=Chimpanzees and the Behavior of Ardipithecus ramidus |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=41 |pages=139–49 |year=2012 |last1=Stanford |first1=Craig B. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two fossil [[species]] are described in the literature: ''[[A.&amp;nbsp;ramidus]]'', which lived about 4.4 million years ago&lt;ref name=&quot;NatGeo-News&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/07/0712_ethiopianbones.html |title=Fossils From Ethiopia May Be Earliest Human Ancestor |first=David |last=Perlman |publisher=National Geographic News |date=July 12, 2001 |accessdate=March 18, 2017 |quote=Another co-author is Tim D.

''A. ramidus'' was named in September 1994. The first fossil found was dated to 4.4 million years ago on the basis of its stratigraphic position between two volcanic [[stratum|strata]]: the basal [[Tuff|Gaala Tuff Complex]] (G.A.T.C.) and the [[basalt|Daam Aatu Basaltic Tuff]] (D.A.B.T.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/371306a0 |pmid=8090200 |title=Australopithecus ramidus, a new species of early hominid from Aramis, Ethiopia |journal=Nature |volume=371 |issue=6495 |pages=306–12 |year=1994 |last1=White |first1=Tim D. |last2=Suwa |first2=Gen |last3=Asfaw |first3=Berhane |bibcode=1994Natur.371..306W }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Ardipithecus ramidus'' stems mostly from the [[Afar language]], in which ''Ardi'' means &quot;ground/floor&quot; and ''ramid'' means &quot;root&quot;. The ''pithecus'' portion of the name is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for &quot;ape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOVA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=NOVA, Aliens from Earth: Who's who in human evolution |last=Tyson |first=Peter |date=October 2009 |publisher=PBS |accessdate=2009-10-08 |url= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hobbit/tree-nf.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most hominids, but unlike all previously recognized hominins, it had a grasping [[hallux]] or big toe adapted for locomotion in the trees. It is not confirmed how much other features of its skeleton reflect adaptation to [[bipedalism]] on the ground as well. Like later hominins, ''Ardipithecus'' had reduced [[Canine tooth|canine teeth]].

In 1992–1993 a research team headed by [[Tim D. White|Tim White]] discovered the first ''A. ramidus'' fossils—seventeen fragments including skull, mandible, teeth and arm bones—from the [[Afar Depression]] in the [[Middle Awash]] river valley of [[Ethiopia]]. More fragments were recovered in 1994, amounting to 45% of the total skeleton. This fossil was originally described as a species of ''[[Australopithecus]]'', but White and his colleagues later published a note in the same journal renaming the fossil under a new genus, ''Ardipithecus''. Between 1999 and 2003, a multidisciplinary team led by [[Sileshi Semaw]] discovered bones and teeth of nine ''A. ramidus'' individuals at [[As Duma]] in the [[Gona]] Western Margin of Ethiopia's [[Afar Region]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stoneageinstitute.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=New Fossil Hominids of Ardipithecus ramidus from Gona, Afar, Ethiopia |url= http://www.stoneageinstitute.org/news/gona_nature_paper.shtml#1 |accessdate=2009-01-30 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080624005441/http://www.stoneageinstitute.org/news/gona_nature_paper.shtml |archivedate=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fossils were dated to between 4.35 and 4.45 million years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/1822.html |publisher=Indiana University |title=Anthropologists find 4.5 million-year-old hominid fossils in Ethiopia |accessdate=March 18, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Map of the fossil sites of the earliest hominids (35.8-3.3M BP).svg|thumb|left|300px|Map showing discovery locations.]]
''Ardipithecus ramidus'' had a small brain, measuring between 300 and 350&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This is slightly smaller than a modern [[bonobo]] or female [[common chimpanzee]] brain, but much smaller than the brain of [[Australopithecus|australopithecines]] like Lucy (~400 to 550&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and roughly 20% the size of the modern ''Homo sapiens'' brain. Like common chimpanzees, ''A. ramidus'' was much more [[Prognathism|prognathic]] than modern humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suwa_2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1175825 |pmid=19810194 |title=The Ardipithecus ramidus Skull and Its Implications for Hominid Origins |journal=Science |volume=326 |issue=5949 |pages=68e1–7 |year=2009 |last1=Suwa |first1=G. |last2=Asfaw |first2=B. |last3=Kono |first3=R.

The teeth of ''A. ramidus'' lacked the specialization of other apes, and suggest that it was a generalized [[omnivore]] and [[frugivore]] (fruit eater) with a diet that did not depend heavily on foliage, fibrous plant material (roots, tubers, etc.), or hard and or abrasive food. The size of the upper [[canine tooth]] in ''A. ramidus'' males was not distinctly different from that of females. Their upper canines were less sharp than those of modern common chimpanzees in part because of this decreased upper canine size, as larger upper canines can be honed through wear against teeth in the lower mouth. The features of the upper canine in ''A. ramidus'' contrast with the [[sexual dimorphism]] observed in common chimpanzees, where males have significantly larger and sharper upper canine teeth than females.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suwa_2009b&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1175824 |pmid=19810195 |title=Paleobiological Implications of the Ardipithecus ramidus Dentition |journal=Science |volume=326 |issue=5949 |pages=94–9 |year=2009 |last1=Suwa |first1=G. |last2=Kono |first2=R.

D. |bibcode=2009Sci...326...94S |url= http://doc.rero.ch/record/211460/files/PAL_E4443.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The less pronounced nature of the upper canine teeth in ''A. ramidus'' has been used to infer aspects of the [[Primatology#Primatology in sociobiology|social behavior]] of the species and more ancestral hominids. In particular, it has been used to suggest that the [[last common ancestor]] of hominids and African apes was characterized by relatively little aggression between males and between groups. This is markedly different from social patterns in common chimpanzees, among which intermale and intergroup aggression are typically high. Researchers in a 2009 study said that this condition &quot;compromises the living chimpanzee as a behavioral model for the ancestral hominid condition.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Suwa_2009b&quot;/&gt;

''A. ramidus'' existed more recently than the [[most recent common ancestor]] of humans and chimpanzees ([[Chimpanzee-human last common ancestor|CLCA or ''Pan''-''Homo'' LCA]]) and thus is not fully representative of that common ancestor. Nevertheless, it is in some ways unlike chimpanzees, suggesting that the common ancestor differs from the modern chimpanzee. After the chimpanzee and human lineages diverged, both underwent substantial evolutionary change. Chimp feet are specialized for grasping trees; ''A. ramidus'' feet are better suited for walking. The canine teeth of ''A. ramidus'' are smaller, and equal in size between males and females, which suggests reduced male-to-male conflict, increased pair-bonding, and increased parental investment. &quot;Thus, fundamental reproductive and social behavioral changes probably occurred in hominids long before they had enlarged brains and began to use stone tools,&quot; the research team concluded.&lt;ref name=&quot;AndThePaleobiology&quot; /&gt;

{{Main|Ardi}}
On October 1, [[2009 in science|2009]], paleontologists formally announced the discovery of the relatively complete ''A. ramidus'' fossil skeleton first unearthed in 1994. The fossil is the remains of a small-brained 50-kilogram (110&amp;nbsp;lb) female, nicknamed &quot;Ardi&quot;, and includes most of the skull and teeth, as well as the pelvis, hands, and feet.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewKind&quot; /&gt; It was discovered in Ethiopia's harsh [[Afar Region|Afar desert]] at a site called [[Aramis, Ethiopia|Aramis]] in the Middle Awash region. Radiometric dating of the layers of volcanic ash encasing the deposits suggest that Ardi lived about 4.3-4.5 million years ago. This date, however, has been questioned by others. Fleagle and Kappelman suggest that the region in which Ardi was found is difficult to date radiometrically, and they argue that Ardi should be dated at 3.9 million years.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/nature09709&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/376558b0 |pmid=7503900 |last1=Kappelman |first1= John| last2=Fleagle |first2= John G.| date=1995 |title=Age of early hominids |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=376 |issue=6541| pages=558–559 |bibcode=1995Natur.376..558K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fossil is regarded by its describers as shedding light on a stage of human evolution about which little was known, more than a million years before [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]] (''Australopithecus afarensis''), the iconic early human ancestor candidate who lived 3.2 million years ago, and was discovered in 1974 just {{convert|74|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from Ardi's discovery site. However, because the &quot;Ardi&quot; skeleton is no more than 200,000 years older than the earliest fossils of ''Australopithecus'', and may in fact be younger than they are,&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/nature09709&quot;/&gt; some researchers doubt that it can represent a direct ancestor of ''Australopithecus''.

Some researchers infer from the form of her pelvis and limbs and the presence of her [[Abduction (kinesiology)|abductable]] [[hallux]], that &quot;Ardi&quot; was a [[facultative biped]]: [[biped]]al when moving on the ground, but [[quadruped]]al when moving about in tree branches.&lt;ref name=&quot;AndThePaleobiology&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1175802 |pmid=19810190 |title=Ardipithecus ramidus and the Paleobiology of Early Hominids |journal=Science |volume=326 |issue=5949 |pages=75–86 |year=2009 |last1=White |first1=T.

== Classification ==

Due to several shared characteristics with chimpanzees, its closeness to ape divergence period, and due to its fossil incompleteness, the exact position of ''Ardipithecus'' in the fossil record is a subject of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature09709 |pmid=21331035 |last1=Wood |first1= Bernard| last2=Harrison |first2= Terry| date=2011 |title=The evolutionary context of the first hominins |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=470 |pages=347–35 |bibcode=2011Natur.470..347W |issue=7334 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Primatologist [[Esteban Sarmiento]] had systematically compared and concluded that there is not sufficient anatomical evidence to support an exclusively human lineage. Sarmiento noted that ''Ardipithecus'' does not share any characteristics exclusive to humans, and some of its characteristics (those in the wrist and basicranium) suggest it diverged from humans prior to the [[human–gorilla last common ancestor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1184148 |pmid=20508113 |title=Comment on the Paleobiology and Classification of ''Ardipithecus ramidus'' |journal=Science |volume=328 |issue=5982 |pages=1105; author reply 1105 |year=2010 |last1=Sarmiento |first1=E. E. |bibcode=2010Sci...328.1105S }}&lt;/ref&gt; His comparative (narrow [[allometry]]) study in 2011 on the molar and body segment lengths (which included living primates of similar body size) noted that some dimensions including short upper limbs, and [[metacarpals]] are reminiscent of humans, but other dimensions such as long toes and relative molar surface area are great ape-like. Sarmiento concluded that such length measures can change back and forth during evolution and are not very good indicators of relatedness ([[homoplasy]]).&lt;ref name=Sarmiento2011&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jchb.2011.01.003 |pmid=21388620 |title=Behavioral and phylogenetic implications of a narrow allometric study of ''Ardipithecus ramidus'' |journal=HOMO |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=75–108 |year=2011 |last1=Sarmiento |first1=E.E. |last2=Meldrum |first2=D.J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some later studies still argue for its classification in the human lineage. In 2014 it was reported that the hand bones of ''Ardipithecus'', ''[[Australopithecus sediba]]'' and ''[[A. afarensis]]'' have the third metacarpal [[Styloid process (radius)|styloid process]], which is absent in other apes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1316014110 |pmid=24344276 |pmc=3890866 |title=Early Pleistocene third metacarpal from Kenya and the evolution of modern human-like hand morphology |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=111 |issue=1 |pages=121–4 |year=2013 |last1=Ward |first1=C.

The ''Ardipithecus'' length measures are good indicators of function and together with dental isotope data and the fauna and flora from the fossil site indicate ''Ardipithecus'' was mainly a terrestrial quadruped collecting a large portion of its food on the ground. Its arboreal behaviors would have been limited and suspension from branches solely from the upper limbs rare.&lt;ref name=Sarmiento2011/&gt; A comparative study in 2013 on carbon and oxygen stable isotopes within modern and fossil [[tooth enamel]] revealed that ''Ardipithecus'' fed both [[Arboreal locomotion|arboreally]] (on trees) and on the ground in a more open habitat, unlike chimpanzees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.2324 |pmid=24197413 |pmc=3826229 |title=Chimpanzee fauna isotopes provide new interpretations of fossil ape and hominin ecologies |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=280 |issue=1773 |pages=20132324 |year=2013 |last1=Nelson |first1=S.

In 2015, Australian anthropologists Gary Clark and Maciej Henneberg said that ''Ardipithecus'' adults have a facial anatomy more similar to chimpanzee subadults than adults, with a less-projecting face and smaller canines (large canines in primate males are used to compete within mating hierarchies), and attributed this to a decrease in craniofacial growth in favour of brain growth. This is only seen in humans, so they argued that the species may show the first trend towards human social, parenting and sexual psychology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark &amp; Henneberg 2015&quot;/&gt; Previously, it was assumed that such ancient human ancestors behaved much like chimps, but this is no longer considered to be a viable comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev-anthro-092611-145815 |ssrn=2158266 |title=Human Evolution and the Chimpanzee Referential Doctrine |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=41 |pages=119–38 |year=2012 |last1=Sayers |first1=Ken |last2=Raghanti |first2=Mary Ann |last3=Lovejoy |first3=C. Owen }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has yet to be corroborated by more detailed studies of the growth of ''A.ramidus''. The study also provides support for Stephen Jay Gould's theory in [[Ontogeny and Phylogeny (book)|''Ontogeny and Phylogeny'']] that the paedomorphic (child-like) form of early hominin craniofacial morphology results from dissociation of growth trajectories.

Clark and Henneberg also argued that such shortening of the skull—which may have caused a descension of the [[larynx]]—as well as lordosis—allowing better movement of the larynx—increased vocal ability, significantly pushing back the [[origin of language]] to well before the evolution of ''Homo''. They argued that self domestication was aided by the development of vocalization, living in a pro-social society. They conceded that chimps and ''A. ramidus'' likely had the same vocal capabilities, but said that ''A. ramidus'' made use of more complex vocalizations, and vocalized at the same level as a human infant due to [[selective pressure]] to become more social. This would have allowed their society to become more complex. They also noted that the base of the skull stopped growing with the brain by the end of juvenility, whereas in chimps it continues growing with the rest of the body into adulthood; and considered this evidence of a switch from a gross skeletal anatomy trajectory to a neurological development trajectory due to selective pressure for sociability. Nonetheless, their conclusions are highly speculative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=G.|last=Clark|first2=M.|last2=Henneberg|year=2017|title=''Ardipithecus ramidus'' and the evolution of language and singing: An early origin for hominin vocal capability|journal=Homo|volume=68|issue=2|pages=101–121|doi=10.1016/j.jchb.2017.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark &amp; Henneberg 2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1515/anre-2015-0009 |title=The life history of Ardipithecus ramidus: A heterochronic model of sexual and social maturation |journal=Anthropological Review |volume=78 |issue=2 |page=109–132|year=2015 |last1=Clark |first1=Gary |last2=Henneberg |first2=Maciej }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Scott Simpson (anthropologist)|Scott Simpson]], the Gona Project's [[biological anthropology|physical anthropologist]], the fossil evidence from the [[Middle Awash]] indicates that both ''A. kadabba'' and ''A. ramidus'' lived in &quot;a mosaic of woodland and grasslands with lakes, swamps and springs nearby,&quot; but further research is needed to determine which habitat ''Ardipithecus'' at Gona preferred.&lt;ref name=&quot;stoneageinstitute.org&quot; /&gt;
