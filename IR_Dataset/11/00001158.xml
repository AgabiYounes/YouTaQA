[[File:Square root of 2 triangle.svg|thumb|200px|The square root of 2 is an algebraic number equal to the length of the [[hypotenuse]] of a [[right triangle]] with legs of length 1]]

An '''algebraic number''' is any [[complex number]] (including [[real number]]s) that is a [[root of a function|root]] of a non-zero [[polynomial]] (that is, a value which causes the polynomial to equal 0) in one variable with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients (or equivalently – by [[clearing denominators]] – with [[integer]] coefficients). All integers and rational numbers are algebraic, as are all [[nth root|roots of integers]]. There are real and complex numbers that are not algebraic, such as [[Pi|{{pi}}]] and [[e (mathematical constant)|{{mvar|e}}]]. These numbers are called [[transcendental number]]s. While the set of complex numbers is [[uncountable set|uncountable]], the set of algebraic numbers is [[countable set|countable]] and has [[measure zero]] in the [[Lebesgue measure]] as a subset of the complex numbers, and in this sense [[almost all]] complex numbers are transcendental.

==Examples==
*All [[rational number]]s are algebraic. Any rational number, expressed as the quotient of two [[integer]]s {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, {{math|''b''}} not equal to zero, satisfies the above definition because {{math|1=''x'' = {{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} is the root of a non-zero polynomial, namely {{math|''bx'' − ''a''}}.&lt;ref&gt;Some of the following examples come from Hardy and Wright 1972: 159–160 and pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[quadratic surd]]s (irrational roots of a quadratic polynomial {{math|''ax''{{sup|2}} + ''bx'' + ''c''}} with integer coefficients {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}}) are algebraic numbers. If the quadratic polynomial is monic ({{math|1=''a'' = 1}}) then the roots are further qualified as [[quadratic integer]]s.
*The [[constructible number]]s are those numbers that can be constructed from a given unit length using straightedge and compass. These include all quadratic surds, all rational numbers, and all numbers that can be formed from these using the [[Arithmetic#Arithmetic operations|basic arithmetic operations]] and the extraction of square roots. (By designating cardinal directions for 1, −1, {{math|''i''}}, and {{math|−''i''}}, complex numbers such as {{math|3 + {{sqrt|2}}''i''}} are considered constructible.)
*Any expression formed from algebraic numbers using any combination of the basic arithmetic operations and extraction of [[nth root|{{mvar|n}}th roots]] gives another algebraic number.
*Polynomial roots that ''cannot'' be expressed in terms of the basic arithmetic operations and extraction of {{math|''n''}}th roots (such as the roots of {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; − ''x'' + 1}}). This [[Abel–Ruffini theorem|happens with many]], but not all, polynomials of degree 5 or higher.
*[[Gaussian integer]]s: those complex numbers {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} where both {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are integers and are also quadratic integers.
*Values of [[trigonometric functions]] of [[rational number|rational]] multiples of {{pi}} (except when undefined): that is, the [[trigonometric number]]s. For example, each of {{math|cos {{sfrac|π|7}}}}, {{math|cos {{sfrac|3π|7}}}}, {{math|cos {{sfrac|5π|7}}}} satisfies {{math|8''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − 4''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 4''x'' + 1 {{=}} 0}}. This polynomial is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] over the rationals, and so these three cosines are ''conjugate'' algebraic numbers. Likewise, {{math|tan {{sfrac|3π|16}}}}, {{math|tan {{sfrac|7π|16}}}}, {{math|tan {{sfrac|11π|16}}}}, {{math|tan {{sfrac|15π|16}}}} all satisfy the irreducible polynomial {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; − 4''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − 6''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 4''x'' + 1 {{=}} 0}}, and so are conjugate [[algebraic integers]].
*Some [[irrational number]]s are algebraic and some are not:
**The numbers {{sqrt|2}} and {{math|{{sfrac|{{radic|3|3}}|2}}}} are algebraic since they are roots of polynomials {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 2}} and {{math|8''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − 3}}, respectively.
**The [[golden ratio]] {{mvar|φ}} is algebraic since it is a root of the polynomial {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''x'' − 1}}.
**The numbers [[Pi|{{pi}}]] and [[e (mathematical constant)|{{mvar|e}}]] are not algebraic numbers (see the [[Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem]]).&lt;ref&gt;Also [[Liouville number|Liouville's theorem]] can be used to &quot;produce as many examples of transcendental numbers as we please,&quot; cf Hardy and Wright p.&amp;nbsp;161ff&lt;/ref&gt;

*The algebraic numbers are [[dense set|dense]] [[densely ordered|in the reals]], [[linearly ordered]], countable, and without first or last element (and therefore [[order-isomorphic]] to the set of rational numbers).
*The set of algebraic numbers is [[countable set|countable]] (enumerable)&lt;ref&gt;Hardy and Wright 1972:160 / 2008:205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niven 1956, Theorem 7.5.&lt;/ref&gt;, and therefore its [[Lebesgue measure]] as a subset of the complex numbers is 0 (essentially, the algebraic numbers take up no space in the complex numbers). That is to say, [[Almost everywhere|&quot;almost all&quot;]] real and complex numbers are transcendental.
*Given an algebraic number, there is a unique [[monic polynomial]] (with rational coefficients) of least [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] that has the number as a root. This polynomial is called its [[minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]]. If its minimal polynomial has degree {{mvar|n}}, then the algebraic number is said to be of degree {{mvar|n}}. For example, all [[rational number]]s have degree 1, and an algebraic number of degree 2 is a [[quadratic irrational]].
*All algebraic numbers are [[computable number|computable]] and therefore [[definable number|definable]] and [[arithmetical numbers|arithmetical]].
*For real numbers {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, the complex number {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} is algebraic if and only if both {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are algebraic.&lt;ref&gt;Niven 1956, Corollary 7.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The field of algebraic numbers==
[[File:Algebraic number in the complex plane.png|thumb|Algebraic numbers colored by degree (blue = 4, cyan = 3, red = 2, green = 1). The unit circle is black.]]
The sum, difference, product and quotient (if the denominator is nonzero) of two algebraic numbers is again algebraic (this fact can be demonstrated using the [[resultant]]), and the algebraic numbers therefore form a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|{{overline|'''Q'''}}}} (sometimes denoted by {{math|'''A'''}}, though this usually denotes the [[adele ring]]). Every root of a polynomial equation whose coefficients are ''algebraic numbers'' is again algebraic. This can be rephrased by saying that the field of algebraic numbers is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]]. In fact, it is the smallest algebraically closed field containing the rationals, and is therefore called the [[algebraic closure]] of the rationals.

The set of ''real'' algebraic numbers itself forms a field.&lt;ref&gt;Niven 1956, p.&amp;nbsp;92.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Numbers defined by radicals===
All numbers that can be obtained from the integers using a [[finite set|finite]] number of complex [[addition]]s, [[subtraction]]s, [[multiplication]]s, [[division (mathematics)|division]]s, and taking {{mvar|n}}th roots where {{mvar|n}} is a positive integer ([[radical expression]]s), are algebraic. The converse, however, is not true: there are algebraic numbers that cannot be obtained in this manner. These numbers are roots of polynomials of degree 5 or higher, a result of [[Galois theory]] (see [[Quintic equation]]s and the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]]). An example is {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; − ''x'' − 1}}, where the unique real root is 

&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{32\operatorname{_{4}F_{3}}\left(\left.\begin{array}{ccc}-\frac{1}{20},\frac{3}{20},\frac{7}{20},\frac{11}{20}\\ \frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{4}\end{array}\right|\frac{3125}{256}\right)+8\operatorname{_{4}F_{3}}\left(\left.\begin{array}{ccc}\frac{1}{5},\frac{2}{5},\frac{3}{5},\frac{4}{5}\\ \frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{4},\frac{5}{4}\end{array}\right|\frac{3125}{256}\right)-5\operatorname{_{4}F_{3}}\left(\left.\begin{array}{ccc}\frac{9}{20},\frac{13}{20},\frac{17}{20},\frac{21}{20}\\ \frac{3}{4},\frac{5}{4},\frac{3}{2}\end{array}\right|\frac{3125}{256}\right)+5\operatorname{_{4}F_{3}}\left(\left.\begin{array}{ccc}\frac{7}{10},\frac{9}{10},\frac{11}{10},\frac{13}{10}\\ \frac{5}{4},\frac{3}{2},\frac{7}{4}\end{array}\right|\frac{3125}{256}\right)}{32}=1.167303978261418684\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{_{p}F_{q}}\left(\left.\begin{array}{ccc}a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_p\\ b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_q\end{array}\right|z\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[generalized hypergeometric function]].

===Closed-form number===
{{Main|Closed-form number}}
Algebraic numbers are all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials, starting from the rational numbers. One may generalize this to &quot;[[closed-form number]]s&quot;, which may be defined in various ways. Most broadly, all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms are called &quot;[[Elementary_number|elementary numbers]]&quot;, and these include the algebraic numbers, plus some transcendental numbers. Most narrowly, one may consider numbers ''explicitly'' defined in terms of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms – this does not include all algebraic numbers, but does include some simple transcendental numbers such as {{mvar|e}} or [[Natural logarithm of 2|ln&amp;nbsp;2]].

==Algebraic integers==
[[Image:Leadingcoeff.png|thumb|Algebraic numbers colored by leading coefficient (red signifies 1 for an algebraic integer)]]
{{Main|Algebraic integer}}
An '''[[algebraic integer]]''' is an algebraic number that is a root of  a polynomial with integer coefficients with leading coefficient 1 (a monic polynomial). Examples of algebraic integers are {{math|5 + 13{{sqrt|2}}}}, {{math|2 − 6''i''}} and {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}(1 + ''i''{{sqrt|3}})}}. Therefore, the algebraic integers constitute a proper [[superset]] of the [[integer]]s, as the latter are the roots of monic polynomials {{math|''x'' − ''k''}} for all {{math|''k'' ∈ '''Z'''.}} In this sense, algebraic integers are to algebraic numbers what [[integer]]s are to [[rational number]]s.

The sum, difference and product of algebraic integers are again algebraic integers, which means that the algebraic integers form a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]. The name ''algebraic integer'' comes from the fact that the only rational numbers that are algebraic integers are the integers, and because the algebraic integers in any [[algebraic number field|number field]] are in many ways analogous to the integers. If {{math|''K''}} is a number field, its [[ring of integers]] is the subring of algebraic integers in {{math|''K''}}, and is frequently denoted as {{math|''O&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. These are the prototypical examples of [[Dedekind domain]]s.
