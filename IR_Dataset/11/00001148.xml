'''Adelaide''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|d|ə|l|eɪ|d||audio=En-au-Adelaide.oga}} {{respell|AD|ə|layd}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Macquarie ABC Dictionary |publisher=The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd |year=2003 |page=10 |isbn=1-876429-37-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[List of Australian capital cities|capital]] city of the state of [[South Australia]], and the [[List of cities in Australia by population|fifth-most populous city of Australia]]. The demonym {{em|Adelaidean}} is used to denote the city and the residents of Adelaide.

Adelaide is situated on the [[Adelaide Plains]] north of the [[Fleurieu Peninsula]], between the [[Gulf St Vincent]] in the west and the [[Mount Lofty Ranges]] in the east. Its metropolitan area extends {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the coast to the [[Adelaide Hills|foothills]] of the Mount Lofty Ranges, and stretches {{convert|96|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Gawler]] in the north to [[Sellicks Beach]] in the south.

Named in honour of [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|Queen Adelaide]], [[queen consort|consort]] to [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]], the city was founded in 1836 as the [[new town|planned capital]] for the only freely-settled British province in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/how-well-do-you-really-know-our-queen-adelaide/news-story/b249bd054376d472496f232a7f3d75ed|title=How well do you know our Queen?|date=2013-05-03|website=www.adelaidenow.com.au|language=en|access-date=2019-08-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807040642/https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/how-well-do-you-really-know-our-queen-adelaide/news-story/b249bd054376d472496f232a7f3d75ed|archive-date=7 August 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Light|Colonel William Light]], one of Adelaide's founding fathers, designed the city centre and chose its location close to the [[River Torrens]], in the area originally inhabited by the [[Kaurna people]] and known as ''[[Tarndanyangga]]'' (&quot;place of the red kangaroo&quot;). Light's design, now [[Australian National Heritage List|listed as national heritage]], set out the city centre in a [[grid plan|grid layout]], interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares, and entirely surrounded by [[Adelaide Parklands|parklands]].

Early colonial Adelaide was shaped by the diversity and wealth of its free settlers, in contrast to the convict history of other Australian cities. Until the [[post-war]] era, it was Australia's third-largest city. It has been noted for its leading examples of religious freedom and progressive political reforms, and became known as the &quot;City of Churches&quot; due to its diversity of faiths. Today, Adelaide is noted for [[:Category:Festivals in Adelaide|its many festivals]] and sporting events, its [[South Australian wine|food and wine]], its coastline and hills, and its large defence and manufacturing sectors. Adelaide's [[quality of life]] has ranked consistently highly in various measures through the 21st century.

As South Australia's government and commercial centre, Adelaide is the site of many governmental and financial institutions. Most of these are concentrated in the [[Adelaide city centre|city centre]] along the cultural boulevards of [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]] and [[King William Street, Adelaide|King William Street]].

[[File:Kaurnaland.png|thumb|left|upright|Approximate extent of Kaurna territory, based on the description by Amery (2000)]]
Before its proclamation as a British settlement in 1836, the area around Adelaide was inhabited by the indigenous [[Kaurna]] people, one of many [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal]] nations in South Australia. The city and [[Adelaide park lands|parklands]] area was known as Tarntanya,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adelaidia.sa.gov.au/subjects/kaurna-people|title=Kaurna people|website=Adelaidia|accessdate=28 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908065802/http://adelaidia.sa.gov.au/subjects/kaurna-people|archive-date=8 September 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Tarndanyangga]] in the [[Kaurna language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://kaurnaplacenames.com/primary.php?id=4697 |title=Kaurna Name: Tarndanyangga |access-date=28 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312102340/http://kaurnaplacenames.com/primary.php?id=4697 |archive-date=12 March 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The surrounding area was an open grassy plain with patches of trees and shrub which had been managed by hundreds of generations. Kaurna country encompassed the plains which stretched north and south of Tarntanya as well as the wooded foothills of the [[Mount Lofty Ranges|Mt Lofty Ranges]]. The River Torrens was known as the Karrawirra Pari (red gum forest river). About 300 Kaurna populated the Adelaide area, and were referred to by the settlers as the Cowandilla.&lt;ref name=KaurnaSA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sahistoryhub.com.au/subjects/kaurna-people|website=SA History Hub|title=Kaurna People|access-date=29 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190428075730/http://sahistoryhub.com.au/subjects/kaurna-people|archive-date=28 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kaurna language was a complex one, reflecting their sophisticated culture and deep environmental knowledge.&lt;ref name=KaurnaSA /&gt; Within a few decades of European settlement of South Australia, Kaurna culture and language were almost completely destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.sa.gov.au/history/adelaide_history/adelaide_brief_history.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515205647/http://www.history.sa.gov.au/history/adelaide_history/adelaide_brief_history.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Adelaide: A Brief History (SA Govt)|archivedate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive documentation by early missionaries and other researchers has enabled a modern revival of both,&lt;ref name=Amery&gt;{{cite book |title=Warrabarna Kaurna! – Reclaiming an Australian Language |last=Amery |first=Rob |year=2000 |publisher=Swets &amp; Zeitlinger |location=The Netherlands |isbn=90-265-1633-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has included a commitment by local and state governments to rename or include Kaurna names for many local places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://adelaideparklands.com.au/parks-and-squares/victoria-square-tarntanyangga|title=Victoria Square/Tarntanyangga|website=City of Adelaide|accessdate=27 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190427083524/https://adelaideparklands.com.au/parks-and-squares/victoria-square-tarntanyangga|archive-date=27 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adelaide.edu.au/kwp/placenames/council/|website=Kaurna Warra Pintyanthi|title=Adelaide City Council Placenaming Initiatives|access-date=27 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190427083521/https://www.adelaide.edu.au/kwp/placenames/council/|archive-date=27 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Australia was officially established as a British Province in England in February 1836. The first Governor 
proclaimed the commencement of colonial government in South Australia on 28 December 1836, near [[The Old Gum Tree]] in what is now the suburb of [[Glenelg North, South Australia|Glenelg North]]. The event is commemorated in South Australia as [[Proclamation Day (South Australia)|Proclamation Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holdfast.sa.gov.au/page.aspx?u=1463 |title=City of Holdfast Bay – Proclamation Day |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713121428/http://www.holdfast.sa.gov.au/page.aspx?u=1463 |archivedate=13 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site of the colony's capital was surveyed and laid out by Colonel [[William Light]], the first Surveyor-General of South Australia, with his own original, unique, topographically sensitive design.

Adelaide was established as a planned colony of free immigrants, promising civil liberties and freedom from religious persecution, based upon the ideas of [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]]. Wakefield had read accounts of Australian settlement while in prison in London for attempting to abduct an heiress,&lt;ref&gt;Wakefield cites:
* Edward Curr, ''An Account of the Colony of Van Diemen's Land, principally designed for the use of emigrants'', George Cowie &amp; Co., London, 1824;
* Henry Widdowson, ''Present State of Van Diemen's Land; comprising an account of its agricultural capabilities, with observations on the present state of farming, &amp;c. &amp;c. pursued in that colony: and other important matters connected with Emigration'', S. Robinson, W. Joy and J. Cross, London, and J. Birdsall, Northampton, 1829; and
* James Atkinson, ''An Account of the State of Agriculture &amp; Grazing in New South Wales; Including Observations on the Soils and General Appearance of the Country, and some of its most useful natural productions; with an account of the Various Methods of Clearing and Improving Lands, Breeding and Grazing Live Stock, Erecting Buildings, the System of employing Convicts, and the expense of Labour generally; the Mode of Applying for Grants of Land; with Other Information Important to those who are about to emigrate to that Country: The result of several years' residence and practical experience in those matters in the Colony''., J. Cross, London, 1826&lt;/ref&gt; and realised that the eastern colonies suffered from a lack of available labour, due to the practice of giving land grants to all arrivals.&lt;ref&gt;Wakefield, ''Letter from Sydney'', December 1829, pp. 99–185, written from Newgate prison. Editor Robert Gouger.&lt;/ref&gt; Wakefield's idea was for the Government to survey and sell the land at a rate that would maintain land values high enough to be unaffordable for labourers and journeymen.&lt;ref&gt;Wakefield wrote about this under a pseudonym, purporting to be an Australian settler. His subterfuge was so successful that he confused later writers, including [[Karl Marx]], who wrote &quot;It is the great merit of E.G. Wakefield to have discovered not anything new about the Colonies, but to have discovered in the Colonies the truth of as to the condition of capitalist production in the mother-country.' ''Das Kapital'', Moscow, 1958, p 766&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Funds raised from the sale of land were to be used to bring out working-class emigrants, who would have to work hard for the monied settlers to ever afford their own land.&lt;ref&gt;''Plan of a Company to be Established for the Purpose of Founding a Colony in Southern Australia, Purchasing Land Therein, and Preparing the Land so Purchased for the Reception of Immigrants'', 1832; in Wakefield, Edward Gibbon, Prichard, M. F., (ed.) ''The Collected Works of Edward Gibbon Wakefield'', Collins, London, 1968, p 290.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this policy, Adelaide does not share [[Convictism in Australia|the convict settlement history]] of other Australian cities like [[Sydney]], [[Brisbane]] and [[Hobart]].

[[File:North Terrace, 1841.jpg|thumb|North Terrace in 1841]]

As it was believed that in a colony of free settlers there would be little crime, no provision was made for a [[Prison|gaol]] in Colonel Light's 1837 plan. But by mid-1837 the ''[[South Australian Register]]'' was warning of escaped convicts from New South Wales and tenders for a temporary gaol were sought. Following a burglary, a murder, and two attempted murders in Adelaide during March 1838, Governor Hindmarsh created the South Australian Police Force (now the [[South Australia Police]]) in April 1838 under 21-year-old [[Henry Inman (police commander)|Henry Inman]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Wrathall Bull|J. W.

Adelaide's early history was marked by economic uncertainty and questionable leadership.{{Dubious|date=October 2015}} The first governor of South Australia, [[John Hindmarsh]], clashed frequently with others, in particular the Resident Commissioner, [[James Hurtle Fisher]]. The rural area surrounding Adelaide was surveyed by Light in preparation to sell a total of over {{convert|405|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land. Adelaide's early economy started to get on its feet in 1838 with the arrival of livestock from [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[New South Wales]] and [[Tasmania]]. Wool production provided an early basis for the South Australian economy. By 1860, wheat farms had been established from [[Encounter Bay]] in the south to [[Clare, South Australia|Clare]] in the north.
[[File:Karte Adelaide MKL1888.png|thumb|left|upright|1888 map of Adelaide, showing the gradual development of its urban layout]]
[[George Gawler]] took over from Hindmarsh in late 1838 and, despite being under orders from the ''Select Committee on South Australia'' in Britain not to undertake any public works, promptly oversaw construction of a governor's house, the [[Adelaide Gaol]], police barracks, a hospital, a [[Customs House Port Adelaide|customs house]] and a wharf at [[Port Adelaide]]. Gawler was recalled and replaced by [[George Edward Grey]] in 1841. Grey slashed public expenditure against heavy opposition, although its impact was negligible at this point: silver was discovered in [[Glen Osmond, South Australia|Glen Osmond]] that year, agriculture was well underway, and other mines sprung up all over the state, aiding Adelaide's commercial development. The city exported meat, wool, wine, fruit and wheat by the time Grey left in 1845, contrasting with a low point in 1842 when one-third of Adelaide houses were abandoned.

Trade links with the rest of the Australian states were established after the [[Murray River]] was successfully navigated in 1853 by [[Francis Cadell (explorer)|Francis Cadell]], an Adelaide resident. South Australia became a [[self-governing colony]] in 1856 with the ratification of a new constitution by the British parliament.

In 1860 the [[Thorndon Park]] reservoir was opened, finally providing an alternative water source to the now turbid River Torrens. Gas street lighting was implemented in 1867, the [[University of Adelaide]] was founded in 1874, the [[South Australian Art Gallery]] opened in 1881 and the [[Happy Valley Reservoir]] opened in 1896. In the 1890s Australia was affected by a severe economic depression, ending a hectic era of land booms and tumultuous expansionism. Financial institutions in Melbourne and banks in Sydney closed. The national fertility rate fell and immigration was reduced to a trickle. The value of South Australia's exports nearly halved. Drought and poor harvests from 1884 compounded the problems, with some families leaving for Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clickacity.com/history-of-adelaide/|title=History of Adelaide, Australia.

Historian F. W. Crowley examined the reports of visitors in the early 20th century, noting that &quot;many visitors to Adelaide admired the [[Light's Vision|foresighted planning]] of its founders&quot;, as well as pondering the riches of the young city.&lt;ref&gt;F.K. Crowley, ''Modern Australia in Documents: 1901–1939''&lt;/ref&gt; Adelaide enjoyed a postwar boom, entering a time of relative prosperity. Its population grew, and it became the third most populous metropolitan area in the country, after Sydney and Melbourne. Its prosperity was short-lived, with the return of droughts and the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s. It later returned to fortune under strong government leadership. [[Secondary sector of industry|Secondary industries]] helped reduce the state's dependence on [[primary sector of industry|primary industries]]. World War II brought industrial stimulus and diversification to Adelaide under the [[Thomas Playford IV|Playford]] Government, which advocated Adelaide as a safe place for manufacturing due to its less vulnerable location.&lt;ref&gt;Cockburn, S (1991): ''Playford – Benevolent Despot.'' Axiom Publishing. P. 85. {{ISBN|0 9594164 4 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shipbuilding was expanded at the nearby port of [[Whyalla, South Australia|Whyalla]].

The South Australian Government in this period built on former wartime manufacturing industries but neglected cultural facilities which meant South Australia's economy lagged behind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marsden&quot; /&gt; International manufacturers like General Motors [[Holden]] and [[Chrysler Australia|Chrysler]]&lt;ref&gt;When Chrysler stopped manufacturing in Adelaide, [[Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited]] took over the [[Tonsley Park]] factory. After many years of mixed fortunes, Mitsubishi ceased manufacturing at Tonsley Park on 27 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; made use of these factories around the Adelaide area in suburbs like [[Elizabeth, South Australia|Elizabeth]], completing its transformation from an agricultural service centre to a 20th-century city. The [[Mannum–Adelaide pipeline]] brought [[River Murray]] water to Adelaide in 1955 and [[Adelaide International Airport|an airport]] opened at [[West Beach, South Australia|West Beach]] in 1955. [[Flinders University]] and the [[Flinders Medical Centre]] were established in the 1960s at Bedford Park, south of the city. Today, Flinders Medical Centre is one of the largest teaching hospitals in South Australia. In the post-war years around the early 1960s Adelaide was surpassed by Brisbane as Australia's third largest city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marsden&quot; /&gt;

In the early years of the 21st century, a significant increase in the state government's spending on Adelaide's infrastructure occurred. The [[Mike Rann|Rann government]] invested A$535 million in a major upgrade of the Adelaide Oval to enable [[Australian Football League]] to be played in the city centre&lt;ref&gt;Michael Owen, The Australian, 3 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and more than A$2 [[billion]] to build a new [[Royal Adelaide Hospital]] on land adjacent to the Adelaide Railway Station.&lt;ref&gt;ABC News, Wednesday 7 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Glenelg tramline was extended through the city to Hindmarsh&lt;ref&gt;ABC News, 6 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; down to East Terrace&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dpti.sa.gov.au/infrastructure/public_transport_projects/city_tram_extension |website=Government of South Australia Department of Transport, Planning, and Infrastructure |publisher=Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure |accessdate=21 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the suburban railway line extended south to Seaford.&lt;ref&gt;ABC News, 13 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a period of stagnation in the 1990s and 2000s, Adelaide began several major developments and redevelopments. The Adelaide Convention Centre was redeveloped and expanded at a cost of A$350 million beginning in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;ABC News, 29 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Three historic buildings were adapted for modern use: the [[Torrens Building]] in Victoria Square as the Adelaide campus for Carnegie Mellon University, University College London, and Torrens University;&lt;ref&gt;News Release Government of SA, 15 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; the Stock Exchange building as the Science Exchange of the Royal Institution Australia; and the Glenside Psychiatric Hospital as the Adelaide Studios of the [[South Australian Film Corporation|SA Film Corporation]]. The government also invested more than A$2 billion to build a [[desalination]] plant, powered by renewable energy, as an 'insurance policy' against droughts affecting Adelaide's [[water supply]].&lt;ref&gt;Nick Harmsen, ABC News, 11 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Adelaide Festival]], [[Adelaide Fringe Festival|Fringe]], and [[Womadelaide]] became annual events.&lt;ref&gt;Adelaide Advertiser 26 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Adelaide is north of the Fleurieu Peninsula, on the Adelaide Plains between the Gulf St Vincent and the low-lying Mount Lofty Ranges. The city stretches {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the coast to the foothills, and {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Gawler, South Australia|Gawler]] at its northern extent to [[Sellicks Beach, South Australia|Sellicks Beach]] in the south. According to the Regional Development Australia, an Australian government planning initiative, the &quot;Adelaide Metropolitan Region&quot; has a total land area of {{convert|870|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, while a more expansive definition by the Australian Bureau of Statistics defines a &quot;Greater Adelaide&quot; statistical area totalling {{convert|3,259.8|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABS-GA&quot; /&gt; The city sits at an average elevation of {{convert|50|m|ft}} above sea level. [[Mount Lofty]], east of the Adelaide metropolitan region in the Adelaide Hills at an elevation of {{convert|727|m|ft}}, is the tallest point of the city and in the state south of [[Burra, South Australia|Burra]].

[[File:Adelaide Metropol.png|thumb|left|Satellite image of Adelaide's metropolitan area. The Adelaide Hills is the green area to the right of the Adelaide plains.]]
Much of Adelaide was bushland before British settlement, with some variation – sandhills, swamps and marshlands were prevalent around the coast. The loss of the sandhills to urban development had a particularly destructive effect on the coastline due to erosion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/files/sharedassets/public/coasts/no27.pdf The Adelaide Metropolitan Coastline] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208214443/http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/files/sharedassets/public/coasts/no27.pdf |date=8 December 2015 }} ''Coastline'', South Australian Coastal Protection Board, No. 27, April 1993. Retrieved 6 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Where practical, the government has implemented programs to rebuild and vegetate sandhills at several of Adelaide's beachside suburbs. Much of the original vegetation has been cleared with what is left to be found in reserves such as the [[Cleland Conservation Park]] and [[Belair National Park]]. A number of creeks and rivers flow through the Adelaide region. The largest are the Torrens and [[Onkaparinga River National Park|Onkaparinga]] catchments. Adelaide relies on its many reservoirs for water supply with the [[Happy Valley Reservoir]] supplying around 40% and the much larger [[Mount Bold Reservoir]] 10% of Adelaide's domestic requirements respectively.

Adelaide and its surrounding area is one of the most seismically active regions in Australia. On 1 March 1954 at 3:40&amp;nbsp;am Adelaide experienced its largest recorded earthquake to date, with the epicentre 12&amp;nbsp;km from the city centre at [[Darlington, South Australia|Darlington]], and a reported magnitude of 5.6.&lt;ref&gt;C.

=== Urban layout ===
{{Further|William Light}}Adelaide is a planned city, designed by the first Surveyor-General of South Australia, Colonel [[William Light]]. His plan, sometimes referred to as &quot;Light's Vision&quot; (also the name of a statue of him on [[Montefiore Hill]]), arranged Adelaide in a [[Grid plan|grid]], with [[:Category:Squares in Adelaide|five squares]] in the [[Adelaide city centre]] and a ring of parks, known as the [[Adelaide Parklands]], surrounding it. Light's selection of the location for the city was initially unpopular with the early settlers, as well as South Australia's first governor, John Hindmarsh, due to its distance from the harbour at Port Adelaide, and the lack of fresh water there.&lt;ref&gt;Page, M. (1981): ''Port Adelaide and its Institute, 1851–1979.'' Rigby Publishers Ltd. Pp.17–20. {{ISBN|0-7270-1510-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Light successfully persisted with his choice of location against this initial opposition. Recent evidence suggests that Light worked closely with George Kingston as well as a team of men to set out Adelaide, using various templates for city plans going back to [[Ancient Greece]], including [[Italian Renaissance]] designs and the layouts of the American cities [[Philadelphia]] and [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Adelaide|first=Kerryn|last=Goldsworthy|year=2011|publisher=NewSouth|isbn=9-7817-4224092-3|pp=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefits of Light's design are numerous: Adelaide has had wide multi-lane roads from its beginning, an easily navigable [[cardinal direction]] grid layout and an expansive green ring around the city centre. There are two sets of [[ring road]]s in Adelaide that have resulted from the original design. The [[City Ring Route, Adelaide|inner ring route]] ([[A21 road (Australia)|A21]]) borders the parklands, and the outer route ([[A3 road (South Australia)|A3]]/[[South Road, Adelaide|A13]]/[[A16 highway (Australia)|A16]]/[[A17 highway (Australia)|A17]]) completely bypasses the inner city via (in clockwise order) [[Grand Junction Road]], Hampstead Road, Ascot Avenue, [[Portrush Road]], [[Cross Road, Adelaide|Cross Road]] and [[South Road, Adelaide|South Road]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transport.sa.gov.au/transport_network/projects/better_roads/adelaides_inner_outer_ring_routes.asp ''Adelaide's Inner and Outer Ring Routes''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306220115/http://www.transport.sa.gov.au/transport_network/projects/better_roads/adelaides_inner_outer_ring_routes.asp |date=6 March 2014 }}, 24 August 2004, South Australian Department of Transport.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suburban expansion has to some extent outgrown Light's original plan. Numerous former outlying villages and &quot;country towns&quot;, as well as the satellite city of [[Elizabeth, South Australia|Elizabeth]], have been enveloped by its [[urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]]. Expanding developments in the Adelaide Hills region led to the construction of the [[South Eastern Freeway]] to cope with growth, which has subsequently led to new developments and further improvements to that transport corridor. Similarly, the booming development in Adelaide's [[City of Onkaparinga|South]] led to the construction of the [[Southern Expressway (Australia)|Southern Expressway]].

New roads are not the only transport infrastructure developed to cope with the urban growth. The [[O-Bahn Busway]] is an example of a unique solution to [[Tea Tree Gully, South Australia|Tea Tree Gully's]] transport woes in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Adelaide's Freeways – A History from MATS to the Port River Expressway |work=Ozroads |url=http://www.ozroads.com.au/SA/freeways.htm |access-date=21 January 2006 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61Co1srti?url=http://www.ozroads.com.au/SA/freeways.htm |archive-date=25 August 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the nearby suburb of [[Golden Grove, South Australia|Golden Grove]] in the late 1980s is an example of well-thought-out urban planning.

[[File:Transformers - Victoria Square Adelaide SA - panoramio.jpg|thumb|270px|Aerial view of [[Victoria Square, Adelaide|Victoria Square]], one of the five main squares in the city centre and considered the heart of Adelaide's [[Grid plan|grid layout]].]]

In the 1960s, a [[Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study]] Plan was proposed in order to cater for the future growth of the city. The plan involved the construction of freeways, [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]] and the upgrade of certain aspects of the public transport system. The then premier [[Steele Hall]] approved many parts of the plan and the government went as far as purchasing land for the project. The later [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government elected under [[Don Dunstan]] shelved the plan, but allowed the purchased land to remain vacant, should the future need for freeways arise. In 1980, the [[Liberal party of Australia|Liberal party]] won government and premier [[David Tonkin]] committed his government to selling off the land acquired for the MATS plan, ensuring that even when needs changed, the construction of most MATS-proposed freeways would be impractical. Some parts of this land have been used for transport, (e.g. the O-Bahn Busway and Southern Expressway), while most has been progressively subdivided for residential use.

In 2008, the [[Government of South Australia|SA Government]] announced plans for a network of [[transport-oriented development]]s across the Adelaide metropolitan area and purchased a [[Clipsal site development|10 hectare industrial site]] at [[Bowden, South Australia|Bowden]] for $52.5&amp;nbsp;million as the first of these developments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081206075528/http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/news.php?id=3826 &quot;Clipsal site at Bowden to become a green village&quot;], Ministerial Press Release, 24 October 2008, SA Govt.

Historically, Adelaide's suburban residential areas have been characterised by single-storey detached houses built on {{convert|1/4|acre|m2|adj=on|order=flip}} blocks. A relative lack of suitable, locally-available timber for construction purposes led to the early development of a brick-making industry, as well as the use of stone, for houses and other buildings. By 1891 68% of houses were built of stone, 15% of timber, and 10% of brick, with brick also being widely used in stone houses for quoins, door and window surrounds, and chimneys and fireplaces.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, R.M.

There is a wide variety in the styles of these houses. Until the 1960s most of the more substantial houses were built of red brick, though many front walls were of ornamental stone. Then cream bricks became fashionable, and in the 1970s, deep red and brown bricks became popular.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Until the 1970s, roofs tended to be clad with (painted) [[corrugated iron]] or tiles (cement or clay, usually red &quot;terracotta&quot;&lt;!--local terminology, do not link--&gt;). Since then, [[Colorbond]]® corrugated steel has dominated. Most roofs are pitched; flat roofs are not common. Up to the 1970s, most houses were of &quot;double brick&quot; construction on concrete footings, with timber floors laid on joists supported by &quot;dwarf walls&quot;. Later houses have mainly been of &quot;[[brick veneer]]&quot; construction — structural [[Framing (construction)|timber]] or, more recently, [[steel frame#Cold-formed steel frames|lightweight steel]]) frame on a [[concrete slab]] [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]], lined with [[Gyprock]]®, and with an outer skin of brickwork,&lt;ref name=Cadden&gt;Rosemary Cadden: ''Building South Australia: celebrating 125 years''.

In contrast, the winter has fairly reliable rainfall with June being the wettest month of the year, averaging around 80&amp;nbsp;mm. [[Frosts]] are occasional, with the most notable occurrences in July 1908 and July 1982. Hail is also common in winter. Adelaide is a windy city with significant [[wind chill]] in winter, which makes the temperature [[apparent temperature|seem colder than it actually is]]. Snowfall in the metropolitan area is extremely uncommon, although light and sporadic falls in the nearby hills and at [[Mount Lofty]] occur during winter. Dewpoints in the summer typically range from {{convert|8|to|10|°C|°F}}.

== Governance ==
{{Main|Government of South Australia}}

[[File:Parliament House, South Australia.jpg|left|thumb|[[Parliament House, Adelaide]]]]

Adelaide, as the capital of South Australia, is the seat of the [[Government of South Australia]]. As Adelaide is South Australia's capital and most populous city, the [[Government of South Australia|State Government]] co-operates extensively with the [[City of Adelaide]]. In 2006, the Ministry for the City of Adelaide was created to facilitate the State Government's collaboration with the [[Adelaide City Council]] and the Lord Mayor to improve Adelaide's image. The State Parliament's Capital City Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capcity.adelaide.sa.gov.au |title=Capital City Committee |date=October 2008 |publisher=Government of South Australia and Adelaide City Council |accessdate=20 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618221636/http://www.capcity.adelaide.sa.gov.au/ |archivedate=18 June 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; is also involved in the governance of the City of Adelaide, being primarily concerned with the planning of Adelaide's urban development and growth.

Reflecting South Australia's status as Australia's most centralised state, Adelaide elects a substantial majority of the [[South Australian House of Assembly]]. Of the 47 seats in the chamber, 34 seats (three-quarters of the legislature) are based in Adelaide, and two rural seats include Adelaide suburbs.

=== Local governments ===
{{Further|Local government areas of South Australia}}

The Adelaide metropolitan area is divided between nineteen [[Local Government Areas of South Australia|local government areas]]. At its centre, the [[City of Adelaide]] administers the [[Adelaide city centre]], [[North Adelaide]], and the surrounding [[Adelaide Parklands]]. It is the oldest municipal authority in Australia and was established in 1840, when Adelaide and Australia's first mayor, [[James Hurtle Fisher]], was elected. From 1919 onwards, the City has had a [[List of Mayors and Lord Mayors of Adelaide|Lord Mayor]], the current being Lord Mayor ''The Right Honourable'' [[Sandy Verschoor]].

While established as a British province, and very much English in terms of its culture, Adelaide attracted immigrants from other parts of Europe early on, including German and other European non-conformists escaping religious persecution. The first German Lutherans arrived in 1838&lt;ref&gt;Monteath, P., Paul, M., &amp; Martin, R. (2014): ''Interned: Torrens Island 1914–1915'', Wakefield Press, {{ISBN|9781743053386}} p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; bringing with them the [[vine cuttings]] that they used to found the acclaimed wineries of the [[Barossa Valley]].

The [[Royal Adelaide Show]] is an annual [[agricultural show]] and [[state fair]], established in 1839 and now a huge event held in the [[Adelaide Showground]] annually.

Adelaide's arts scene flourished in the 1960s and 1970s with the support of successive premiers from both major political parties. The renowned [[Adelaide Festival of Arts]] was established in 1960 under Thomas Playford, which in the same year spawned an unofficial uncurated series of performances and exhibits which grew into the [[Adelaide Fringe]]. Construction of the [[Adelaide Festival Centre]] began under Steele Hall in 1970 and was completed under the subsequent government of Don Dunstan, who also established the [[South Australian Film Corporation]] in 1972 and the [[State Opera of South Australia]] in 1976.

Over time, the Adelaide Festival expanded to include [[Adelaide Writers' Week]] and [[WOMADelaide]], and other separate festivals were established, such as the [[Adelaide Cabaret Festival]] (2002), the [[Adelaide Festival of Ideas]] (1999), the [[Adelaide Film Festival]] (2013), [[Feast Festival|FEAST]] (1999, a [[LGBT culture|queer culture]]) and [[Tasting Australia]] (1997, a food and wine affair).

Initially playing at the Adelaide Oval, the club moved to the more suitable Hindmarsh Stadium late in the 1998 season. As part of a peace deal with the [[Australian Rugby League]] to end the [[Super League war]], the club's owners [[News Limited]] (who were also owners of the SL) suddenly closed the club only weeks before the start of the [[1999 NRL season|1999 season]].

=== Transport ===
{{Main|Transport in Adelaide}}
[[File:TransAdelaideRailwayMap.svg|thumb|A map of Adelaide's railway and tram network, served by the [[Adelaide Metro]].]]

Being centrally located on the Australian mainland, Adelaide forms a strategic transport hub for east-west and north-south routes. The city itself has a metropolitan public transport system managed by and known as the [[Adelaide Metro]]. The Adelaide Metro consists of a contracted bus system including the [[O-Bahn Busway]], [[Railways in Adelaide|6 commuter rail lines]] (diesel and electric), and a small tram network operating between inner suburb [[Hindmarsh, South Australia|Hindmarsh]], the city centre, and seaside [[Glenelg Tram|Glenelg]]. Tramways were largely dismantled in the 1950s, but saw a revival in the 2010s with upgrades and extensions. A proposal to significantly extend the tram network called [[Trams in Adelaide#Proposed future extensions|AdeLINK]] is dormant following a change of state government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://indaily.com.au/news/politics/2018/03/09/libs-wont-rebuild-adelaides-suburban-tram-network/ |title=Libs won't rebuild Adelaide's suburban tram network |last=Siebert |first=Bension |date=9 March 2018 |website=InDaily |access-date=6 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406230125/https://indaily.com.au/news/politics/2018/03/09/libs-wont-rebuild-adelaides-suburban-tram-network/ |archive-date=6 April 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Road transport in Adelaide has historically been easier than many of the other Australian cities, with a well-defined city layout and wide multiple-lane roads from the beginning of its development. Adelaide was known as a &quot;twenty-minute city&quot;, with commuters having been able to travel from metropolitan outskirts to the city proper in roughly twenty minutes. However, such arterial roads often experience traffic congestion as the city grows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metro Malcontent – The Twenty Minute City No More |work=Royal Automobile Association, South Australia |year=2005 |url=http://www.raa.net/download.asp?file=documents\document_677.pdf |accessdate=28 December 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115022910/http://www.raa.net/download.asp?file=documents%5Cdocument_677.pdf |archivedate=15 January 2009 |df=dmy }} (1.18MB)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Adelaide metropolitan area has one freeway and three expressways. In order of construction, they are:
* The [[South Eastern Freeway]] (M1), connects the south-east corner of the Adelaide Plain to the Adelaide Hills and beyond to [[Murray Bridge, South Australia|Murray Bridge]] and [[Tailem Bend]], where it then continues as National Highway 1 south-east to Melbourne.
* The [[Southern Expressway (Australia)|Southern Expressway]] (M2), connecting the outer southern suburbs with the inner southern suburbs and the city centre. It duplicates the route of [[South Road]].
* The [[North-South Motorway]] (M2), is an ongoing major project that will become the major north-south corridor, replacing most of what is now [[South Road, Adelaide|South Road]], connecting the [[Southern Expressway (Adelaide)|Southern Expressway]] and the [[Northern Expressway]] via an expressway with no traffic lights. Currently, the motorway runs as an elevated freeway from its junction with the Port River Expressway to Regency Road, in Adelaide's inner north-west. Continuation of the motorway is currently under construction in form of the [[Northern Connector]] project, the Darlington Upgrade project and the [[Torrens Road]] to [[River Torrens]] project.
* The [[Port River Expressway]] (A9), connects Port Adelaide and [[Outer Harbor, South Australia|Outer Harbor]] to Port Wakefield Road at the northern &quot;entrance&quot; to the metropolitan area.
* The [[Northern Expressway]] (Max Fatchen Expressway) (M20), is the northern suburbs bypass route connecting the Sturt Highway (National Highway 20) via the [[Gawler Bypass]] to Port Wakefield Road at a point a few kilometres north of the Port River Expressway connection.
* The [[Northern Connector]] (proposed route M20) commenced construction in 2016, to connect the North-South Motorway with the Northern Expressway. The road will not be subject to direct tolls, but South Australia will become a testing ground for a &quot;network fee&quot; that involves charging trucks based on road use and impact in place of high registration fees.

==== Airports ====
[[File:Adelaide Airport, 2008.jpg|thumb|A [[Qantas]] plane leaving [[Adelaide Airport]].]]

The Adelaide metropolitan area has two commercial airports, [[Adelaide Airport|Adelaide International Airport]] and [[Parafield Airport]]. Adelaide Airport, in Adelaide's south-western suburbs, serves in excess of 8 million passengers annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adelaide Airport&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adelaideairport.com.au/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/nr-8-million-pax-01.17-v2.pdf|title=Adelaide Airport reaches 8 million passengers in 2016|date=16 January 2017|publisher=Adelaide Airport Ltd. media release|accessdate=23 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320061749/http://www.adelaideairport.com.au/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/nr-8-million-pax-01.17-v2.pdf|archive-date=20 March 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parafield Airport, Adelaide's second airport {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=off}} north of the city centre, is used for small aircraft, pilot training and recreational aviation purposes. Parafield Airport served as Adelaide's main aerodrome until the opening of the Adelaide Airport in February 1955. Adelaide airport serves many international and domestic destinations including all Australian state capitals.

Adelaide is also home to a military airport, known as [[RAAF Base Edinburgh|Edinburgh Airport]], located in the northern suburbs. It was built in 1955 in a joint initiative with the UK for weapon development.

=== Energy ===
Adelaide's energy requirements were originally met by the [[Adelaide Electric Supply Company]], which was nationalised by the [[Thomas Playford IV|Playford]] government in 1946,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/norrie-sir-charles-willoughby-moke-11254 |title=Biography – Sir Charles Willoughby Moke Norrie |work=Australian Dictionary of Biography |author=P.A.

Despite significant public opposition and the Labor party's anti-privatisation stance which left the Liberal party one vote short of the numbers needed to pass the legislation, ETSA was privatised by the [[John Olsen|Olsen]] Government in 1999 by way of a 200-year lease for the distribution network (ETSA&amp;nbsp;Utilities, later renamed [[SA Power Networks]]) and the outright purchase of ETSA Power{{Clarify|date=July 2019}} by the [[Cheung Kong Holdings]] for $3.5 billion (11 times ETSA's annual earnings) after Labor MP [[Trevor Crothers]] resigned from the party and voted with the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:WcHxiFkbzDoJ:http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s27853.htm Shock Labor &quot;betrayal&quot; allows SA Govt to effectively privatise power utility] ''[[7.30 Report]]'', ABC, 3 June 1999.

The electricity retail market was opened to competition in 2003 and although competition was expected to result in lower retail costs, prices increased by 23.7% in the market's first year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-110318191.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501052319/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-110318191.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-05-01 |title=Power crisis 'as bad as California'. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the privatisation was deemed to be a failure with consumers paying 60% more for their power and with the state government estimated to lose $3 billion in power generation net income in the first ten years of privatisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-115625174.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502161236/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-115625174.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-05-02 |title=Privatisation 'will cost state billions'. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the industry came under scrutiny for allegedly reducing supply by shutting down generators during periods of peak demand to force prices up. Increased media attention also revealed that in 2009 the state government had approved a 46% increase in retail prices to cover expected increases in the costs of generation while generation costs had in fact fallen 35% by 2012.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} South Australia has the highest retail price for electricity in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theconversation.com/factcheck-does-south-australia-have-the-highest-energy-prices-in-the-nation-and-the-least-reliable-grid-92928 |title=FactCheck: does South Australia have the 'highest energy prices' in the nation and 'the least reliable grid'? |work=The Conversation |author1=Dylan McConnell |author2=David Blowers |date=13 March 2018 |accessdate=9 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709153620/https://theconversation.com/factcheck-does-south-australia-have-the-highest-energy-prices-in-the-nation-and-the-least-reliable-grid-92928 |archive-date=9 July 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Privatisation led to competition from a variety of companies who now separately provide for the generation, transmission, distribution and retail sales of gas and electricity. Electricity generation comes from a range of technologies and operators. [[ElectraNet]] operates the high-voltage electricity transmission network. [[SA Power Networks]] distributes electricity to end users. The largest electricity and gas retailing companies are also the largest generating companies.

The largest fossil fuel power stations are the [[Torrens Island Power Station]] gas-fired plant operated by [[AGL Energy]] and the [[Pelican Point Power Station]] operated by [[Engie]]. South Australia also has wind and solar power and connections to the national grid. [[Natural gas|Gas]] is supplied from the [[Moomba, South Australia|Moomba]] Gas Processing Plant in the [[Cooper Basin]] via the [[Moomba Adelaide Pipeline System]]&lt;ref name=&quot;EnergySA2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Supply Security |work=Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure |url=http://www.energy.sa.gov.au/pages/conventional/planning/supply/security.htm:sectID=10&amp;tempID=1 |accessdate=5 May 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050624044821/http://www.energy.sa.gov.au/pages/conventional/planning/supply/security.htm%3AsectID%3D10%26tempID%3D1 |archivedate=24 June 2005 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[SEAGas pipeline]] from [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]].

In 2011, South Australia generated 18% of its electricity from [[wind power]], and had 51% of the installed capacity of wind generators in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.sa.gov.au/subject/Water,+energy+and+environment/Energy/Renewable+energy/Wind+energy/Wind+energy+in+South+Australia |title=Wind Energy in South Australia |publisher=Government of South Australia |accessdate=16 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018043135/http://www.sa.gov.au/subject/Water%2C%2Benergy%2Band%2Benvironment/Energy/Renewable%2Benergy/Wind%2Benergy/Wind%2Benergy%2Bin%2BSouth%2BAustralia |archivedate=18 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to almost universal blackouts within the city during September 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-28/sa-power-outage-explainer/7886090 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160929142924/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-28/sa-power-outage-explainer/7886090|archive-date=2016-09-29 |title=SA power outage: How did it happen?. }}&lt;/ref&gt; the state worked with [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]] to produce the world's largest electricity battery at [[Hornsdale Wind Farm|Hornsdale Power Reserve]] which has increased that state's electrical security to the extent in which large blackouts are no longer an event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-27/tesla-battery-cost-revealed-two-years-after-blackout/10310680 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930201754/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-27/tesla-battery-cost-revealed-two-years-after-blackout/10310680|archive-date=2018-09-28 |title=Tesla battery cost revealed two years after SA blackout. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water ===

[[File:Happy Valley Reservoir 20070223.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of [[Happy Valley Reservoir]] in early 2007]]

The provision of water services is by the government-owned [[SA Water]]. Adelaide's water is supplied from its seven reservoirs: [[Mount Bold Reservoir|Mount Bold]], [[Happy Valley Reservoir|Happy Valley]], [[Myponga Reservoir|Myponga]], [[Millbrook Reservoir|Millbrook]], [[Hope Valley Reservoir|Hope Valley]], [[Little Para Reservoir|Little Para]] and [[South Para Reservoir|South Para]]. The yield from these reservoir catchments can be as little as 10% of the city's requirements (90GL per annum&lt;ref name=desal /&gt;) in drought years and about 60% in average years. The remaining demand is met by the pumping of water from the [[River Murray]].&lt;ref name=desal /&gt;

A [[Adelaide Desalination Plant|sea-water desalination plant]] capable of supplying 100GL per annum was built during the 2001–2009 drought; however, it operated at about 8% of its capacity until 2019. In December 2018, the State and Federal Governments agreed to fund a $2m study to determine how the plant could be used to reduce reliance on river water, in an effort to help save the Murray River basin and mouth (including the [[Coorong]]) from further ecological damage.&lt;ref name =desal&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|website=ABC News|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-14/adelaide-desal-plant-revival-plan-to-ease-use-of-murray-water/10619960|first1=Marty|last1=McCarthy|first2=Matt|last2=Coleman|date=14 Dec 2018|title=Plan to revive Adelaide's desalination plant to help Murray River|access-date=12 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190730175120/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-14/adelaide-desal-plant-revival-plan-to-ease-use-of-murray-water/10619960|archive-date=30 July 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
