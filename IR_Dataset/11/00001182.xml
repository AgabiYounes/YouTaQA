Walter Burkert, a major authority on ancient Greek religion, states: &quot;Since -ene is a typical place-name suffix - Mykene, Pallene, Troizen(e), Messene, and Cyrene - the goddess most probably takes her name from the city; she is the Pallas of Athens, just as Hera of Argos is Here Argeie.&quot; Thank you.--&gt;{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=139}} She's usually shown in art wearing a helmet and holding a spear. Her major symbols include [[Owl of Minerva|owls]], [[olive trees]], [[snake]]s, and the [[Gorgoneion]].

From her origin as an Aegean [[tutelary deity|palace goddess]], Athena was closely associated with the city. She was known as ''Polias'' and ''Poliouchos'' (both derived from ''[[polis]]'', meaning &quot;city-state&quot;), and her temples were usually located atop the fortified [[acropolis]] in the central part of the city. The [[Parthenon]] on the [[Athenian Acropolis]] is dedicated to her, along with numerous other temples and monuments. As the patron of craft and weaving, Athena was known as ''Ergane''. She's also a [[Women in ancient warfare|warrior goddess]], and was believed to lead soldiers into battle as ''[[Athena Promachos]]''. Her main festival in Athens was the [[Panathenaic Games|Panathenaia]], which was celebrated during the month of [[Attic calendar|Hekatombaion]] in midsummer and was the most important festival on the Athenian calendar.

In [[Greek mythology]], Athena was believed to have been born from the head of her father [[Zeus]]. In the [[founding myth]] of Athens, Athena bested [[Poseidon]] in a competition over patronage of the city by creating the first olive tree. She's known as ''[[Athena Parthenos]]'' &quot;Athena the Virgin,&quot; but in one archaic [[Attica|Attic]] myth, the god [[Hephaestus]] tried and failed to rape her, resulting in [[Gaia]] giving birth to [[Erichthonius of Athens|Erichthonius]], an important Athenian founding hero.

Athena was the patron goddess of heroic endeavor; she's believed to have aided the heroes [[Perseus]], [[Heracles]], [[Bellerophon]], and [[Jason]]. Along with [[Aphrodite]] and [[Hera]], Athena was one of the three goddesses [[Judgement of Paris|whose feud]] resulted in the beginning of the [[Trojan War]]. She plays an active role in the ''[[Iliad]]'', in which she assists the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] and, in the ''[[Odyssey]]'', she is the divine counselor to [[Odysseus]].

In the later writings of the Roman poet [[Ovid]], Athena was said to have competed against the mortal [[Arachne]] in a weaving competition, afterwards transforming Arachne into the first spider; Ovid also describes how she transformed [[Medusa]] into a [[Gorgon]] after witnessing her being raped by Poseidon in her temple. Since the [[Renaissance]], Athena has become an international symbol of wisdom, the arts, and [[Classics|classical learning]]. Western artists and [[allegorists]] have often used Athena as a symbol of [[freedom]] and [[democracy]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Akropolis by Leo von Klenze.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Acropolis at Athens'' (1846) by [[Leo von Klenze]]. Athena's name probably comes from the name of the city of [[Athens]].{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=139}}{{snf|Ruck|Staples|1994|page=24}}]]

Athena is associated with the city of [[Athens]].{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=139}}{{sfn|Powell|2012|page=230}} The name of the city in ancient Greek is ''Ἀθῆναι'' (''Athenai''), a plural [[toponym]], designating the place where—according to myth—she presided over the ''Athenai'', a sisterhood devoted to her worship.{{snf|Ruck|Staples|1994|page=24}} In ancient times, scholars argued whether Athena was named after Athens or Athens after Athena.{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=139}} Now scholars generally agree that the goddess takes her name from the city;{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=139}}{{sfn|Powell|2012|page=230}} the ending -''ene'' is common in names of locations, but rare for personal names.{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=139}} Testimonies from different cities in [[ancient Greece]] attest that similar [[city goddess]]es were worshipped in other cities{{snf|Ruck|Staples|1994|page=24}} and, like Athena, took their names from the cities where they were worshipped.{{snf|Ruck|Staples|1994|page=24}} For example, in [[Mycenae]] there was a goddess called Mykene, whose sisterhood was known as ''Mykenai'',{{snf|Ruck|Staples|1994|page=24}} whereas at [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] an analogous deity was called Thebe, and the city was known under the plural form ''Thebai'' (or Thebes, in English, where the 's' is the plural formation).{{snf|Ruck|Staples|1994|page=24}} The name ''Athenai'' is likely of [[Pre-Greek]] origin because it contains the presumably Pre-Greek morpheme ''*-ān-''.{{snf|Beekes|2009|page=29}}

In his dialogue ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', the ancient Greek philosopher [[Plato]] (428–347 BC) gives some rather imaginative etymologies of Athena's name, based on the theories of the ancient Athenians and his own etymological speculations:

{{quote|That is a graver matter, and there, my friend, the modern interpreters of Homer may, I think, assist in explaining the view of the ancients. For most of these in their explanations of the poet, assert that he meant by Athena &quot;mind&quot; [{{lang|grc|νοῦς}}, ''[[Nous|noũs]]''] and &quot;intelligence&quot; [{{lang|grc|διάνοια}}, ''[[diánoia]]''], and the maker of names appears to have had a singular notion about her; and indeed calls her by a still higher title, &quot;divine intelligence&quot; [{{lang|grc|θεοῦ νόησις}}, ''theoũ nóēsis''], as though he would say: This is she who has the mind of God [{{lang|grc|ἁ θεονόα}}, ''a theonóa''). Perhaps, however, the name Theonoe may mean &quot;she who knows divine things&quot; [{{lang|grc|τὰ θεῖα νοοῦσα}}, ''ta theia noousa''] better than others. Nor shall we be far wrong in supposing that the author of it wished to identify this Goddess with moral intelligence [{{lang|grc|εν έθει νόεσιν}}, ''en éthei nóesin''], and therefore gave her the name Etheonoe; which, however, either he or his successors have altered into what they thought a nicer form, and called her Athena.|author=Plato|title=Cratylus ''407b''}}

Thus, Plato believed that Athena's name was derived from Greek {{lang|grc|Ἀθεονόα}}, ''Atheonóa''—which the later Greeks rationalised as from the deity's (θεός, ''theós'') mind (νοῦς, ''noũs''). The second-century AD orator [[Aelius Aristides]] attempted to derive natural symbols from the etymological roots of Athena's names to be ''aether'', ''air'', ''earth'', and ''moon''.{{snf|Johrens|1981|pages=438–452}}

==Origins==
[[File:Goddess-boars-tusk-griffin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Fragment of a fresco from the Cult Center at [[Mycenae]] dating the late thirteenth century BC depicting a warrior goddess, possibly Athena, wearing a [[boar's tusk helmet]] and clutching a [[griffin]].{{sfn|Hurwit|1999|page=14}}]]

Athena was originally the [[Aegean civilization|Aegean]] goddess of the palace, who presided over household crafts and protected the king.{{sfn|Nilsson|1967|pages=347, 433}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=140}}{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=133}}{{sfn|Kinsley|1989|pages=141–142}} A single [[Mycenaean Greek]] inscription {{lang|gmy|𐀀𐀲𐀙𐀡𐀴𐀛𐀊}} ''a-ta-na po-ti-ni-ja'' /Athana potnia/ appears at [[Knossos]] in the [[Linear B]] tablets from the Late Minoan II-era &quot;Room of the Chariot Tablets&quot;;{{sfn|Chadwick|1976|pages=88–89}}{{sfn|Ventris|Chadwick|1973|page=126}}{{sfn|Hurwit|1999|page=14}} these comprise the earliest Linear B archive anywhere.{{sfn|Ventris|Chadwick|1973|page=126}} Although ''Athana potnia'' is often translated ''Mistress Athena'',{{sfn|Palaima|2004|page=444}} it could also mean &quot;the ''[[Potnia]]'' of Athana&quot;, or ''the Lady of Athens''.{{sfn|Palaima|2004|page=444}}{{sfn|Hurwit|1999|page=14}} However, any connection to the city of Athens in the Knossos inscription is uncertain.{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=44}} A sign series ''a-ta-no-dju-wa-ja'' appears in the still undeciphered corpus of [[Linear A]] tablets, written in the unclassified [[Minoan language]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kophinas|KO]] Za 1 inscription, line 1.&lt;/ref&gt; This could be connected with the Linear B Mycenaean expressions ''a-ta-na po-ti-ni-ja'' and ''di-u-ja'' or ''di-wi-ja'' (''Diwia'', &quot;of Zeus&quot; or, possibly, related to a [[List of Mycenaean deities#Goddesses|homonymous goddess]]),{{sfn|Ventris|Chadwick|1973|page=126}} resulting in a translation &quot;Athena of Zeus&quot; or &quot;divine Athena&quot;. Similarly, in the Greek mythology and epic tradition, Athena figures as a daughter of Zeus (Διός θυγάτηρ; ''cfr.'' [[Dyeus]]).{{sfn|Best|1989|page=30}} However, the inscription quoted seems to be very similar to &quot;a-ta-nū-tī wa-ya&quot;, quoted as [[Kato Syme|SY]] Za 1 by Jan Best.{{sfn|Best|1989|page=30}} Best translates the initial ''a-ta-nū-tī'', which is recurrent in line beginnings, as &quot;I have given&quot;.{{sfn|Best|1989|page=30}}

A [[Mycenea]]n fresco depicts two women extending their hands towards a central figure, who is covered by an enormous figure-eight shield;{{sfn|Mylonas|1966|page=159}}{{sfn|Hurwit|1999|pages=13–14}} this may depict the warrior-goddess with her ''[[Palladium (classical antiquity)|palladion]]'', or her palladion in an aniconic representation.{{sfn|Mylonas|1966|page=159}}{{sfn|Hurwit|1999|pages=13–14}} In the &quot;[[List of Aegean frescos|Procession Fresco]]&quot; at [[Knossos]], which was reconstructed by the Mycenaeans,{{sfn|Fururmark|1978|page=672}} two rows of figures carrying vessels seem to meet in front of a central figure,{{sfn|Fururmark|1978|page=672}} which is probably the Minoan precursor to Athena.{{sfn|Fururmark|1978|page=672}} The early twentieth-century scholar [[Martin P. Nilsson|Martin Persson Nilsson]] argued that the [[Minoan snake goddess figurines]] are early representations of Athena.{{sfn|Nilsson|1967|pages=347, 433}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=140}}

Nilsson and others have claimed that, in early times, Athena was either an [[owl]] herself or a [[bird goddess]] in general.{{snf|Nilsson|1950|page=496}} In the third book of the ''[[Odyssey]]'', she takes the form of a [[Sea eagle (bird)|sea-eagle]].{{snf|Nilsson|1950|page=496}} Proponents of this view argue that she dropped her prophylactic owl-mask before she lost her wings. &quot;Athena, by the time she appears in art,&quot; Jane Ellen Harrison remarks, &quot;has completely shed her animal form, has reduced the shapes she once wore of snake and bird to attributes, but occasionally in [[Black figure pottery|black-figure vase-paintings]] she still appears with wings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison 1922:306. {{cite web|url=http://people.uncw.edu/kozloffm/Winged_Athena.jpg |title=''Cfr. ibid.'', p. 307, fig. 84: Detail of a cup in the Faina collection |accessdate=2007-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041105112709/http://people.uncw.edu/kozloffm/Winged_Athena.jpg |archivedate=5 November 2004 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally agreed that the cult of Athena preserves some aspects of the Proto-Indo-European [[Proto-Indo-European religion#Societal deities|transfunctional goddess]].{{snf|Puhvel|1987|pages=133–134}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=433}} The cult of Athena may have also been influenced by those of Near Eastern warrior goddesses such as the [[East Semitic]] [[Ishtar]] and the [[Ugarit]]ic [[Anat]],{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=140}}{{sfn|Hurwit|1999|page=14}} both of whom were often portrayed bearing arms.{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=140}} Classical scholar Charles Penglase notes that Athena closely resembles Inanna in her role as a &quot;terrifying warrior goddess&quot;{{sfn|Penglase|1994|page=235}} and that both goddesses were closely linked with creation.{{sfn|Penglase|1994|page=235}} Athena's birth from the head of Zeus may be derived from the earlier [[Sumer]]ian myth of [[Inanna]]'s descent into and return from the [[Ancient Mesopotamian Underworld|Underworld]].{{sfn|Deacy|2008|pages=20–21, 41}}{{sfn|Penglase|1994|pages=233–325}}

Plato notes that the citizens of [[Sais]] in Egypt worshipped a goddess known as [[Neith]],{{efn|&quot;The citizens have a deity for their foundress; she is called in the Egyptian tongue Neith, and is asserted by them to be the same whom the Hellenes call Athena; they are great lovers of the Athenians, and say that they are in some way related to them.&quot; (''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' 21e.)}} whom he identifies with Athena.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. also Herodotus, ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 2:170–175.&lt;/ref&gt; Neith was the ancient Egyptian goddess of war and hunting, who was also associated with weaving; her worship began during the Egyptian Pre-Dynastic period. In Greek mythology, Athena was reported to have visited mythological sites in North Africa, including Libya's [[Triton (mythology)|Triton River]] and the [[Phlegra (mythology)|Phlegraean plain]].{{efn|[[Aeschylus]], ''[[The Eumenides|Eumenides]]'', v. 292 f. Cf. the tradition that she was the daughter of Neilos: see, e.&amp;nbsp;g. Clement of Alexandria ''Protr.'' 2.28.2; Cicero, ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' 3.59.}} Based on these similarities, the [[Sinologist]] [[Martin Bernal]] created the &quot;[[Black Athena]]&quot; hypothesis, which claimed that Neith was brought to Greece from Egypt, along with &quot;an enormous number of features of civilization and culture in the third and second millennia&quot;.{{snf|Bernal|1987|pages=21, 51 ff}}{{sfn|Fritze|2009|pages=221–229}} The &quot;Black Athena&quot; hypothesis stirred up widespread controversy near the end of the twentieth century,{{snf|Berlinerblau|1999|page=93ff}}{{sfn|Fritze|2009|pages=221–255}} but it has now been widely rejected by modern scholars.{{snf|Jasanoff|Nussbaum|1996|page=194}}{{sfn|Fritze|2009|pages=250–255}}

As ''[[Athena Promachos]]'', she was believed to lead soldiers into battle.{{sfn|Herrington|1955|pages=11–14}}{{sfn|Schmitt|2000|pages=1059–1073}} Athena represented the disciplined, strategic side of war, in contrast to her brother [[Ares]], the patron of violence, bloodlust, and slaughter—&quot;the raw force of war&quot;.{{sfn|Darmon|1992|pages=114–115}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|pages=123–124}} Athena was believed to only support those fighting for a just cause{{sfn|Darmon|1992|pages=114–115}} and was thought to view war primarily as a means to resolve conflict.{{sfn|Darmon|1992|pages=114–115}} The Greeks regarded Athena with much higher esteem than Ares.{{sfn|Darmon|1992|pages=114–115}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|pages=123–124}} Athena was especially worshipped in this role during the festivals of the [[Panathenaea]] and [[Pamboeotia]],{{sfn|Robertson|1992|pages=90–109}} both of which prominently featured displays of athletic and military prowess.{{sfn|Robertson|1992|pages=90–109}} As the patroness of heroes and warriors, Athena was believed to favor those who used cunning and intelligence rather than brute strength.{{sfn|Hurwit|1999|page=18}}

In her aspect as a warrior maiden, Athena was known as ''[[Athena Parthenos|Parthenos]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[:wikt:παρθένος|Παρθένος]]}} &quot;virgin&quot;),{{sfn|Herrington|1955|pages=11–14}}{{sfn|Goldhill|1986|page=121}}{{sfn|Garland|2008|page=217}} because, like her fellow goddesses [[Artemis]] and [[Hestia]], she was believed to remain perpetually a virgin.{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=123}}{{sfn|Goldhill|1986|page=31}}{{sfn|Herrington|1955|pages=11–14}}{{sfn|Garland|2008|page=217}}{{sfn|Kerényi|1952|pages=}} Athena's most famous temple, the [[Parthenon]] on the [[Athenian Acropolis]], takes its name from this title.{{sfn|Kerényi|1952|pages=}} According to [[Károly Kerényi|Karl Kerényi]], a scholar of Greek mythology, the name ''Parthenos'' is not merely an observation of Athena's virginity, but also a recognition of her role as enforcer of rules of sexual modesty and ritual mystery.{{sfn|Kerényi|1952|pages=}} Even beyond recognition, the Athenians allotted the goddess value based on this pureness of virginity, which they upheld as a rudiment of female behavior.{{sfn|Kerényi|1952|pages=}} Kerényi's study and theory of Athena explains her virginal epithet as a result of her relationship to her father Zeus and a vital, cohesive piece of her character throughout the ages.{{sfn|Kerényi|1952|pages=}} This role is expressed in a number of stories about Athena. [[Marinus of Neapolis]] reports that when Christians removed the statue of the goddess from the [[Parthenon]], a beautiful woman appeared in a dream to [[Proclus]], a devotee of Athena, and announced that the ''&quot;Athenian Lady&quot;'' wished to dwell with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Marinus of Samaria, The Life of Proclus or Concerning Happiness |url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/marinus_01_life_of_proclus.htm |website=tertullian.org |pages=15–55 |date=1925 |quote=Translated by Kenneth S.

Athena was known as ''Atrytone'' ({{lang|grc|Άτρυτώνη}} &quot;the Unwearying&quot;), ''Parthenos'' ({{lang|grc|Παρθένος}} &quot;Virgin&quot;), and ''Promachos'' ({{lang|grc|Πρόμαχος}} &quot;she who fights in front&quot;). The epithet ''Polias'' (Πολιάς &quot;of the city&quot;), refers to Athena's role as protectress of the city.{{snf|Schmitt|2000|pages=1059–1073}} The epithet ''Ergane'' (Εργάνη &quot;the Industrious&quot;) pointed her out as the patron of craftsmen and artisans.{{sfn|Schmitt|2000|pages=1059–1073}} Burkert notes that the Athenians sometimes simply called Athena &quot;the Goddess&quot;, ''hē theós'' (ἡ θεός), certainly an ancient title.{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=139}} After serving as the judge at the trial of [[Orestes]] in which he was acquitted of having murdered his mother [[Clytemnestra]], Athena won the epithet ''Areia'' (Αρεία).{{sfn|Schmitt|2000|pages=1059–1073}}

Athena was sometimes given the epithet ''Hippia'' (Ἵππια &quot;of the horses&quot;, &quot;equestrian&quot;),{{sfn|Hurwit|1999|page=15}}{{sfn|Hubbard|1986|page=28}} referring to her invention of the [[bit (horse)|bit]], [[bridle]], [[chariot]], and [[wagon]].{{sfn|Hurwit|1999|page=15}} The Greek geographer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] mentions in his ''Guide to Greece'' that the temple of Athena ''Chalinitis'' (&quot;the bridler&quot;){{sfn|Hubbard|1986|page=28}} in Corinth was located near the tomb of [[Medea]]'s children.{{sfn|Hubbard|1986|page=28}} Other epithets include [[Ageleia]], [[Itonia]] and ''Aethyia'', under which she was worshiped in [[Megara]].{{sfn|Bell|1993|page=13}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], i. 5. § 3; 41. § 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''aíthyia'' ({{lang|grc|αἴθυια}}) signifies a &quot;diver&quot;, also some diving bird species (possibly the [[shearwater]]) and figuratively, a &quot;ship&quot;, so the name must reference Athena teaching the art of shipbuilding or navigation.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Tzetzes]], ''ad Lycophr.'', ''l.c.''.&lt;/ref&gt; In a temple at Phrixa in [[Elis]], reportedly built by [[Clymenus]], she was known as ''Cydonia'' (Κυδωνία).{{sfn|Schaus|Wenn|2007|page=30}}

The Greek biographer [[Plutarch]] (46–120 AD) refers to an instance during the Parthenon's construction of her being called ''Athena [[Hygieia]]'' (Ὑγίεια, i.&amp;nbsp;e. personified &quot;Health&quot;) after inspiring a physician to a successful course of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Plutarch, Parallel Lives |date=1916 |publisher=uchicago.edu |chapter-url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pericles*.html#13.8 |chapter=Life of Pericles 13,8 |quote=The Parallel Lives by Plutarch published in Vol. III of the Loeb Classical Library edition, 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Homer]]'s [[Epic poetry|epic works]], Athena's most common [[epithets in Homer|epithet]] is ''Glaukopis'' ({{lang|grc|γλαυκῶπις}}), which usually is translated as, &quot;bright-eyed&quot; or &quot;with gleaming eyes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|glaukw{{=}}pis|γλαυκῶπις|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The word is a combination of ''glaukós'' ({{lang|grc|γλαυκός}}, meaning &quot;gleaming, silvery&quot;, and later, &quot;bluish-green&quot; or &quot;gray&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|glauko/s1|γλαυκός|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''ṓps'' ({{lang|grc|ὤψ}}, &quot;eye, face&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|w)/y|ὤψ|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''glaúx'' ({{lang|grc|γλαύξ}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Thompson, D'Arcy Wentworth |authorlink1=D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson |title=A glossary of Greek birds |date=1895 |publisher=Oxford, Clarendon Press |page=45 |url=https://archive.org/stream/glossaryofgreekb00thomrich#page/44/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;little owl&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|glau/c|γλαύξ|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is from the same root, presumably according to some, because of the bird's own distinctive eyes. Athena was clearly associated with the owl from very early on;{{sfn|Nilsson|1950|pages=491–496}} in archaic images, she is frequently depicted with an [[Owl of Athena|owl]] perched on her hand.{{sfn|Nilsson|1950|pages=491–496}} Through its association with Athena, the owl evolved into the national mascot of the Athenians and eventually became a symbol of wisdom.{{sfn|Deacy|Villing|2001|pages=}}

In the ''[[Iliad]]'' (4.514), the ''[[Odyssey]]'' (3.378), the ''[[Homeric Hymns]]'', and in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', Athena is also given the curious epithet ''Tritogeneia'' (Τριτογένεια), whose significance remains unclear.{{sfn|Graves|1960|page=55}} It could mean various things, including &quot;Triton-born&quot;, perhaps indicating that the [[Triton (mythology)|homonymous sea-deity]] was her parent according to some early myths.{{sfn|Graves|1960|page=55}} One myth relates the foster father relationship of this Triton towards the half-orphan Athena, whom he raised alongside his own daughter [[Pallas (daughter of Triton)|Pallas]].{{sfn|Graves|1960|pages=50–55}} Kerényi suggests that &quot;Tritogeneia did not mean that she came into the world on any particular river or lake, but that she was born of the water itself; for the name Triton seems to be associated with water generally.&quot;{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=128}}&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|*tritoge/neia|Τριτογένεια|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', Athena is occasionally referred to as &quot;Tritonia&quot;.

Another possible meaning may be &quot;triple-born&quot; or &quot;third-born&quot;, which may refer to a triad or to her status as the third daughter of Zeus or the fact she was born from Metis, Zeus, and herself; various legends list her as being the first child after Artemis and Apollo, though other legends identify her as Zeus' first child.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' II, 886–900.&lt;/ref&gt; Several scholars have suggested a connection to the [[Rigveda|Rigvedic]] god [[Trita]],{{sfn|Janda|2005|page=289-298}} who was sometimes grouped in a body of three mythological poets.{{sfn|Janda|2005|page=289-298}} Michael Janda has connected the myth of Trita to the scene in the ''[[Iliad]]'' in which the &quot;three brothers&quot; Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades divide the world between them, receiving the &quot;broad sky&quot;, the sea, and the underworld respectively.{{sfn|Janda|2005|page=293}}&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Iliad'' XV, 187–195.&lt;/ref&gt; Janda further connects the myth of Athena being born of the head (i.&amp;nbsp;e. the uppermost part) of Zeus, understanding ''Trito-'' (which perhaps originally meant &quot;the third&quot;) as another word for &quot;the sky&quot;.{{sfn|Janda|2005|page=293}} In Janda's analysis of Indo-European mythology, this heavenly sphere is also associated with the mythological body of water surrounding the inhabited world (''cfr.'' Triton's mother, [[Amphitrite]]).{{sfn|Janda|2005|page=293}}

Yet another possible meaning is mentioned in [[Diogenes Laertius]]' biography of [[Democritus]], that Athena was called &quot;Tritogeneia&quot; because three things, on which all mortal life depends, come from her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0258%3Abook%3D9%3Achapter%3D7 | title=Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers, BOOK IX, Chapter 7.

Athena's epithet ''Pallas'' is derived either from {{lang|grc|πάλλω}}, meaning &quot;to brandish [as a weapon]&quot;, or, more likely, from {{lang|grc|παλλακίς}} and related words, meaning &quot;youth, young woman&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Chantraine, s.v.;  the ''New Pauly'' says the etymology is simply unknown&lt;/ref&gt; On this topic, Walter Burkert says &quot;she is the Pallas of Athens, ''Pallas Athenaie'', just as Hera of Argos is ''Here Argeie''.&quot;{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=139}} In later times, after the original meaning of the name had been forgotten, the Greeks invented myths to explain its origin, such as those reported by the Epicurean philosopher [[Philodemus]] and the ''Bibliotheca'' of Pseudo-Apollodorus, which claim that ''Pallas'' was originally a separate entity, whom Athena had slain in combat.&lt;ref&gt;''New Pauly'' s.v. Pallas&lt;/ref&gt;

In one version of the myth, [[Pallas (daughter of Triton)|Pallas]] was the daughter of the sea-god [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]];{{sfn|Graves|1960|pages=50–55}} she and Athena were childhood friends, but Athena accidentally killed her during a friendly [[sparring]] match.{{sfn|Graves|1960|page=50}} Distraught over what she had done, Athena took the name Pallas for herself as a sign of her grief.{{sfn|Graves|1960|page=50}} In another version of the story, [[Pallas (Giant)|Pallas]] was a [[Giants (Greek mythology)|Gigante]];{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=120}} Athena slew him during the [[Gigantomachy]] and [[flaying|flayed off]] his skin to make her cloak, which she wore as a victory trophy.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=120}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=140}}{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=51}}{{sfn|Powell|2012|page=231}} In an alternative variation of the same myth, Pallas was instead Athena's father,{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=120}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=140}} who attempted to assault his own daughter,{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=120-121}} causing Athena to kill him and take his skin as a trophy.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=121}}

The ''[[Palladium (classical antiquity)|palladion]]'' was a statue of Athena that was said to have stood in her temple on the Trojan Acropolis.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=68}} Athena was said to have carved the statue herself in the likeness of her dead friend Pallas.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=68}} The statue had special talisman-like properties{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=68}} and it was thought that, as long as it was in the city, Troy could never fall.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=68}} When the Greeks captured Troy, [[Cassandra]], the daughter of [[Priam]], clung to the palladion for protection,{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=68}} but [[Ajax the Lesser]] violently tore her away from it and dragged her over to the other captives.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=68}} Athena was infuriated by this violation of her protection.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|pages=68–69}} Although Agamemnon attempted to placate her anger with sacrifices, Athena sent a storm at Cape Kaphereos to destroy almost the entire Greek fleet and scatter all of the surviving ships across the Aegean.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=71}}

Pseudo-Apollodorus{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=281}} records an archaic legend, which claims that [[Hephaestus]] once attempted to rape Athena, but she pushed him away, causing him to [[ejaculate]] on her thigh.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}}{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=143}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}} Athena wiped the [[semen]] off using a tuft of [[wool]], which she tossed into the dust,{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}}{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=143}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}} impregnating [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] and causing her to give birth to [[Erichthonius of Athens|Erichthonius]].{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}}{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=143}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}} Athena adopted Erichthonius as her son and raised him.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}} The Roman mythographer [[Hyginus]]{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=281}} records a similar story in which Hephaestus demanded Zeus to let him marry Athena since he was the one who had smashed open Zeus's skull, allowing Athena to be born.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}} Zeus agreed to this and Hephaestus and Athena were married,{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}} but, when Hephaestus was about to consummate the union, Athena vanished from the bridal bed, causing him to ejaculate on the floor, thus impregnating Gaia with Erichthonius.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}}

The geographer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=281}} records that Athena placed the infant Erichthonius into a small chest{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=125}} (''cista''), which she entrusted to the care of the three daughters of [[Cecrops I|Cecrops]]: [[Herse]], [[Pandrosos]], and [[Aglaulus, daughter of Cecrops|Aglauros]] of Athens.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=125}} She warned the three sisters not to open the chest,{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=125}} but did not explain to them why or what was in it.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=125}} Aglauros, and possibly one of the other sisters,{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=125}} opened the chest.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=125}} Differing reports say that they either found that the child itself was a serpent, that it was guarded by a serpent, that it was guarded by two serpents, or that it had the legs of a serpent.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|pages=125–126}} In Pausanias's story, the two sisters were driven mad by the sight of the chest's contents and hurled themselves off the [[Acropolis]], dying instantly,{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=126}} but an Attic vase painting shows them being chased by the serpent off the edge of the cliff instead.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=126}}

Erichthonius was one of the most important founding heroes of Athens{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=143}} and the legend of the daughters of Cecrops was a cult myth linked to the rituals of the [[Arrhephoria]] festival.{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=143}}{{sfn|Deacy|2008|pages=88–89}} Pausanias records that, during the Arrhephoria, two young girls known as the ''[[Arrhephoroi]]'', who lived near the temple of Athena Polias, would be given hidden objects by the [[High Priestess of Athena Polias  | priestess of Athena]],{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=89}} which they would carry on their heads down a natural underground passage.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=89}} They would leave the objects they had been given at the bottom of the passage and take another set of hidden objects,{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=89}} which they would carry on their heads back up to the temple.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=89}} The ritual was performed in the dead of night{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=89}} and no one, not even the priestess, knew what the objects were.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=89}} The serpent in the story may be the same one depicted coiled at Athena's feet in Pheidias's famous statue of the ''Athena Parthenos'' in the Parthenon.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=88}} Many of the surviving sculptures of Athena show this serpent.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=88}}

Herodotus records that a serpent lived in a crevice on the north side of the summit of the Athenian Acropolis{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=88}} and that the Athenians left a honey cake for it each month as an offering.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=88}} On the eve of the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece]] in 480 BC, the serpent did not eat the honey cake{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=88}} and the Athenians interpreted it as a sign that Athena herself had abandoned them.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=88}} Another version of the myth of the Athenian maidens is told in ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' by the Roman poet [[Ovid]] (43 BC{{snds}}17 AD); in this late variant [[Hermes]] falls in love with Herse. Herse, Aglaulus, and Pandrosus go to the temple to offer sacrifices to Athena. Hermes demands help from Aglaulus to seduce Herse. Aglaulus demands money in exchange. Hermes gives her the money the sisters have already offered to Athena. As punishment for Aglaulus's greed, Athena asks the goddess [[Invidia|Envy]] to make Aglaulus jealous of Herse. When Hermes arrives to seduce Herse, Aglaulus stands in his way instead of helping him as she had agreed. He turns her to stone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'', X.

According to Pseudo-Apollodorus's ''Bibliotheca'', Athena advised [[Argus (son of Arestor)|Argos]], the builder of the ''[[Argo]]'', the ship on which the hero [[Jason]] and his band of [[Argonauts]] sailed, and aided in the ship's construction.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D9%3Asection%3D16 1.9.16]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=124}} Pseudo-Apollodorus also records that Athena guided the hero [[Perseus (mythology)|Perseus]] in his quest to behead [[Medusa (mythology)|Medusa]].{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=141}}{{sfn|Kinsley|1989|page=151}}{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=61}} She and [[Hermes]], the god of travelers, appeared to Perseus after he set off on his quest and gifted him with tools he would need to kill the Gorgon.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=61}}&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 2.37, 38, 39&lt;/ref&gt; Athena gave Perseus a polished bronze shield to view Medusa's reflection rather than looking at her directly and thereby avoid being turned to stone.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=61}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Bibliotheca2.41&quot;&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 2.41&lt;/ref&gt; Hermes gave him an [[adamant]]ine [[scythe]] to cut off Medusa's head.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=61}}&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 2.39&lt;/ref&gt; When Perseus swung his blade to behead Medusa, Athena guided it, allowing his scythe to cut it clean off.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=61}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Bibliotheca2.41&quot;/&gt; According to Pindar's ''Thirteenth Olympian Ode'', Athena helped the hero [[Bellerophon]] tame the winged horse [[Pegasus]] by giving him a [[Bit (horse)|bit]].{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=48}}&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, ''Olympian Ode'' 13.75-78&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient Greek art]], Athena is frequently shown aiding the hero [[Heracles]].{{sfn|Deacy|2008|pages=64–65}} She appears in four of the twelve [[metope]]s on the [[Temple of Zeus at Olympia]] depicting Heracles's [[Labors of Heracles|Twelve Labors]],{{sfn|Pollitt|1999|pages=48–50}}{{sfn|Deacy|2008|pages=64–65}} including the first, in which she passively watches him slay the [[Nemean lion]],{{sfn|Deacy|2008|pages=64–65}} and the tenth, in which she is shown actively helping him hold up the sky.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=65}} She is presented as his &quot;stern ally&quot;,{{sfn|Pollitt|1999|page=50}} but also the &quot;gentle... acknowledger of his achievements.&quot;{{sfn|Pollitt|1999|page=50}} Artistic depictions of Heracles's [[apotheosis]] show Athena driving him to Mount Olympus in her chariot and presenting him to Zeus for his deification.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=65}} In [[Aeschylus]]'s tragedy ''[[Orestes (play)|Orestes]]'', Athena intervenes to save [[Orestes]] from the wrath of the [[Erinyes]] and presides over his trial for the murder of his mother [[Clytemnestra]].{{sfn|Roman|Roman|2010|page=161}} When half the [[jury]] votes to [[acquittal|acquit]] and the other half votes to [[convict]], Athena casts the deciding vote to acquit Orestes{{sfn|Roman|Roman|2010|page=161}} and declares that, from then on, whenever a jury is tied, the defendant shall always be acquitted.{{sfn|Roman|Roman|2010|pages=161–162}}

The [[Gorgoneion]] appears to have originated as an [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] symbol intended to ward off evil.{{sfn|Phinney|1971|pages=445–447}} In a late myth invented to explain the origins of the Gorgon,{{sfn|Phinney|1971|pages=445–463}} [[Medusa]] is described as having been a young priestess who served in the temple of Athena in Athens.{{sfn|Seelig|2002|page=895}} Poseidon lusted after Medusa, and raped her in the temple of Athena,{{sfn|Seelig|2002|page=895}} refusing to allow her vow of chastity to stand in his way.{{sfn|Seelig|2002|page=895}} Upon discovering the desecration of her temple, Athena transformed Medusa into a hideous monster with serpents for hair whose gaze [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|would turn any mortal to stone]].{{sfn|Seelig|2002|page=895-911}}

In his ''Twelfth Pythian Ode'', [[Pindar]] recounts the story of how Athena invented the ''[[aulos]]'', a kind of flute, in imitation of the lamentations of Medusa's sisters, the Gorgons, after she was beheaded by the hero [[Perseus]].{{sfn|Poehlmann|2017|page=330}} According to Pindar, Athena gave the aulos to mortals as a gift.{{sfn|Poehlmann|2017|page=330}} Later, the comic playwright [[Melanippides|Melanippides of Melos]] ({{circa}} 480-430 BC) embellished the story in his comedy ''Marsyas'',{{sfn|Poehlmann|2017|page=330}} claiming that Athena looked in the mirror while she was playing the aulos and saw how blowing into it puffed up her cheeks and made her look silly, so she threw the aulos away and cursed it so that whoever picked it up would meet an awful death.{{sfn|Poehlmann|2017|page=330}} The aulos was picked up by the satyr [[Marsyas]], who was later killed by Apollo for his [[hubris]].{{sfn|Poehlmann|2017|page=330}} Later, this version of the story became accepted as canonical{{sfn|Poehlmann|2017|page=330}} and the Athenian sculptor [[Myron]] created a group of bronze sculptures based on it, which was installed before the western front of the Parthenon in around 440 BC.{{sfn|Poehlmann|2017|page=330}}

The myth of the Judgement of Paris is mentioned briefly in the ''[[Iliad]]'',{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=31}} but is described in depth in an [[epitome]] of the ''[[Cypria]]'', a lost poem of the [[Epic Cycle]],{{sfn|Walcot|1977|pages=31–32}} which records that all the gods and goddesses as well as various mortals were invited to the marriage of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]] (the eventual parents of [[Achilles]]).{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=31}} Only [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], goddess of discord, was not invited.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|pages=31–32}} She was annoyed at this, so she arrived with a golden apple inscribed with the word καλλίστῃ (kallistēi, &quot;for the fairest&quot;), which she threw among the goddesses.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=32}} Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena all claimed to be the fairest, and thus the rightful owner of the apple.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=32}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}}

All three goddesses were ideally beautiful and Paris could not decide between them, so they resorted to bribes.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=32}} Hera tried to bribe Paris with power over all [[Asia]] and [[Europe]],{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=32}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}} and Athena offered fame and glory in battle,{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=32}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}} but Aphrodite promised Paris that, if he were to choose her as the fairest, she would let him marry the most beautiful woman on earth.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|pages=32–33}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}} This woman was [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], who was already married to King [[Menelaus]] of [[Sparta#Prehistory|Sparta]].{{sfn|Walcot|1977|pages=32–33}} Paris selected Aphrodite and awarded her the apple.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|pages=32–33}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}} The other two goddesses were enraged and, as a direct result, sided with the Greeks in the [[Trojan War]].{{sfn|Walcot|1977|pages=32–33}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}}

In Books V–VI of the ''[[Iliad]]'', Athena aids the hero [[Diomedes]], who, in the absence of Achilles, proves himself to be the most effective Greek warrior.{{sfn|Burgess|2001|page=84}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=124}} Several artistic representations from the early sixth century BC may show Athena and Diomedes,{{sfn|Burgess|2001|page=84}} including an early sixth-century BC shield band depicting Athena and an unidentified warrior riding on a chariot, a vase painting of a warrior with his charioteer facing Athena, and an inscribed clay plaque showing Diomedes and Athena riding in a chariot.{{sfn|Burgess|2001|page=84}} Numerous passages in the ''Iliad'' also mention Athena having previously served as the patron of Diomedes's father [[Tydeus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 4.390, 5.115-120, 10.284-94&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Burgess|2001|pages=84–85}} When the Trojan women go to the temple of Athena on the Acropolis to plead her for protection from Diomedes, Athena ignores them.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|pages=68–69}}

In Book XXII of the ''Iliad'', while Achilles is chasing [[Hector]] around the walls of Troy, Athena appears to Hector disguised as his brother [[Deiphobus]]{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=69}} and persuades him to hold his ground so that they can fight Achilles together.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=69}} Then, Hector throws his spear at Achilles and misses, expecting Deiphobus to hand him another,{{sfn|Deacy|2008|pages=69–70}} but Athena disappears instead, leaving Hector to face Achilles alone without his spear.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|pages=69–70}} In [[Sophocles]]'s tragedy ''[[Ajax (play)|Ajax]]'', she punishes Odysseus's rival [[Ajax the Great]], driving him insane and causing him to massacre the Achaeans' cattle, thinking that he is slaughtering the Achaeans themselves.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|pages=59–60}} Even after Odysseus himself expresses pity for Ajax,{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=60}} Athena declares, &quot;To laugh at your enemies - what sweeter laughter can there be than that?&quot; (lines 78–9).{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=60}} Ajax later commits [[suicide]] as a result of his humiliation.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=60}}

==Classical art==

Athena appears frequently in classical Greek art, including on coins and in paintings on ceramics.{{sfn|Aghion|Barbillon|Lissarrague|1996|page=193}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=126}} She is especially prominent in works produced in Athens.{{sfn|Aghion|Barbillon|Lissarrague|1996|page=193}} In classical depictions, Athena is usually portrayed standing upright, wearing a full-length [[chiton (costume)|chiton]].{{sfn|Palagia|Pollitt|1996|page=28-32}} She is most often represented dressed in armor like a male soldier{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=126}}{{sfn|Palagia|Pollitt|1996|page=28-32}}{{sfn|Powell|2012|page=230}} and wearing a [[Corinthian helmet]] raised high atop her forehead.{{sfn|Palagia|Pollitt|1996|page=32}}{{sfn|Powell|2012|page=230}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=126}} Her shield bears at its centre the aegis with the head of the gorgon (''gorgoneion'') in the center and snakes around the edge.{{sfn|Phinney|1971|pages=445–463}} Sometimes she is shown wearing the aegis as a cloak.{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=126}} As Athena Promachos, she is shown brandishing a spear.{{sfn|Aghion|Barbillon|Lissarrague|1996|page=193}}{{sfn|Powell|2012|page=230}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=126}} Scenes in which Athena was represented include her birth from the head of Zeus, her battle with the [[Giants (Greek mythology)|Gigantes]], the birth of Erichthonius, and the Judgement of Paris.{{sfn|Aghion|Barbillon|Lissarrague|1996|page=193}}

The ''[[Mourning Athena]]'' or ''Athena Meditating'' is a famous relief sculpture dating to around 470-460 BC{{sfn|Palagia|Pollitt|1996|page=32}}{{sfn|Aghion|Barbillon|Lissarrague|1996|page=193}} that has been interpreted to represent Athena Polias.{{sfn|Palagia|Pollitt|1996|page=32}} The most famous classical depiction of Athena was the ''[[Athena Parthenos]]'', a now-lost {{cvt|11.5|m}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.ancient.eu/article/785/athena-parthenos-by-phidias/ |title=Athena Parthenos by Phidias|encyclopedia=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2019-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chryselephantine|gold and ivory]] statue of her in the [[Parthenon]] created by the Athenian sculptor [[Phidias]].{{sfn|Palagia|Pollitt|1996|page=28-32}}{{sfn|Aghion|Barbillon|Lissarrague|1996|page=193}} Copies reveal that this statue depicted Athena holding her shield in her left hand with [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], the winged goddess of victory, standing in her right.{{sfn|Aghion|Barbillon|Lissarrague|1996|page=193}} Athena Polias is also represented in a Neo-Attic relief now held in the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]],{{sfn|Palagia|Pollitt|1996|page=32}} which depicts her holding an owl in her hand{{efn|The owl's role as a symbol of wisdom originates in this association with Athena.}} and wearing her characteristic Corinthian helmet while resting her shield against a nearby ''[[herma]]''.{{sfn|Palagia|Pollitt|1996|page=32}} The Roman goddess Minerva adopted most of Athena's Greek iconographical associations,{{sfn|Aghion|Barbillon|Lissarrague|1996|page=194}} but was also integrated into the [[Capitoline Triad]].{{sfn|Aghion|Barbillon|Lissarrague|1996|page=194}}

===Art and symbolism===
[[File:Austria Parlament Athena bw.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|Statue of Pallas Athena in front of the [[Austrian Parliament Building]]. Athena has been used throughout western history as a symbol of freedom and democracy.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|pages=145–149}}]]

Early Christian writers, such as [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Julius Firmicus Maternus|Firmicus]], denigrated Athena as representative of all the things that were detestable about paganism;{{snf|Deacy|2008|pages=141–144}} they condemned her as &quot;immodest and immoral&quot;.{{snf|Deacy|2008|page=144}} During the Middle Ages, however, many attributes of Athena were given to the [[Virgin Mary]],{{snf|Deacy|2008|page=144}} who, in fourth century portrayals, was often depicted wearing the [[Gorgoneion]].{{snf|Deacy|2008|page=144}} Some even viewed the Virgin Mary as a warrior maiden, much like Athena Parthenos;{{snf|Deacy|2008|page=144}} one anecdote tells that the Virgin Mary once appeared upon the walls of [[Constantinople]] when it was under siege by the Avars, clutching a spear and urging the people to fight.{{snf|Deacy|2008|pages=144–145}} During the Middle Ages, Athena became widely used as a Christian symbol and allegory, and she appeared on the family crests of certain noble houses.{{snf|Deacy|2008|pages=146–148}}

During the Renaissance, Athena donned the mantle of patron of the arts and human endeavor;{{snf|Deacy|2008|pages=145–146}} allegorical paintings involving Athena were a favorite of the Italian Renaissance painters.{{snf|Deacy|2008|pages=145–146}} In [[Sandro Botticelli]]'s painting ''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'', probably painted sometime in the 1480s, Athena is the personification of chastity, who is shown grasping the forelock of a centaur, who represents lust.{{sfn|Randolph|2002|page=221}}{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=145}} [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s 1502 painting ''[[Triumph of the Virtues (Mantegna)|Minerva Expelling the Vices from the Garden of Virtue]]'' uses Athena as the personification of Graeco-Roman learning chasing the vices of medievalism from the garden of modern scholarship.{{sfn|Brown|2007|page=1}}{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=145}}{{sfn|Aghion|Barbillon|Lissarrague|1996|pages=193–194}} Athena is also used as the personification of wisdom in [[Bartholomeus Spranger]]'s 1591 painting ''The Triumph of Wisdom'' or ''Minerva Victorious over Ignorance''.{{sfn|Aghion|Barbillon|Lissarrague|1996|page=194}}

During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Athena was used as a symbol for female rulers.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=147-148}} In his book ''A Revelation of the True Minerva'' (1582), [[Thomas Blennerhassett]] portrays [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I of England]] as a &quot;new Minerva&quot; and &quot;the greatest goddesse nowe on earth&quot;.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=147}} A series of paintings by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] depict Athena as [[Marie de' Medici]]'s patron and mentor;{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=148}} the final painting in the series goes even further and shows Marie de' Medici with Athena's iconography, as the mortal incarnation of the goddess herself.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=148}} The German sculptor [[Jean-Pierre-Antoine Tassaert]] later portrayed [[Catherine II of Russia]] as Athena in a marble bust in 1774.{{sfn|Aghion|Barbillon|Lissarrague|1996|page=194}} During the [[French Revolution]], statues of pagan gods were torn down all throughout France, but statues of Athena were not.{{snf|Deacy|2008|page=148}} Instead, Athena was transformed into the personification of freedom and the republic{{snf|Deacy|2008|page=148}} and a statue of the goddess stood in the center of the [[Place de la Revolution]] in Paris.{{snf|Deacy|2008|page=148}} In the years following the Revolution, artistic representations of Athena proliferated.{{snf|Deacy|2008|pages=148–149}}

A statue of Athena stands directly in front of the [[Austrian Parliament Building]] in [[Vienna]],{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=149}} and depictions of Athena have influenced other symbols of western freedom, including the [[Statue of Liberty]] and [[Britannia]].{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=149}} For over a century, [[Parthenon (Nashville)|a full-scale replica of the Parthenon]] has stood in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].{{sfn|Garland|2008|page=330}} In 1990, the curators added a gilded forty-two foot (12.5 m) tall [[Athena Parthenos#Replica at Nashville|replica of Phidias's ''Athena Parthenos'']], built from concrete and fiberglass.{{sfn|Garland|2008|page=330}} The state [[seal of California]] bears the image of Athena kneeling next to a brown grizzly bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learncalifornia.org/doc.asp?id=97 |title=Symbols of the Seal of California |publisher=LearnCalifornia.org |accessdate=2010-08-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124160916/http://learncalifornia.org/doc.asp?id=97 |archivedate=24 November 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Athena has occasionally appeared on modern coins, as she did on the ancient Athenian [[drachma]].

One of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s most treasured possessions was a small, bronze sculpture of Athena, which sat on his desk.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=153}} Freud once described Athena as &quot;a woman who is unapproachable and repels all sexual desires - since she displays the terrifying genitals of the Mother.&quot;{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=154}} [[Feminism|Feminist]] views on Athena are sharply divided;{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=154}} some feminists regard her as a symbol of female empowerment,{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=154}} while others regard her as &quot;the ultimate [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] sell out... who uses her powers to promote and advance men rather than others of her sex.&quot;{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=154}} In contemporary [[Wicca]], Athena is venerated as an aspect of the [[Wiccan views of divinity|Goddess]]{{sfn|Gallagher|2005|page=109}} and some Wiccans believe that she may bestow the &quot;Owl Gift&quot; (&quot;the ability to write and communicate clearly&quot;) upon her worshippers.{{sfn|Gallagher|2005|page=109}} Due to her status as one of the twelve Olympians, Athena is a major deity in [[Hellenism (religion)|Hellenismos]],{{sfn|Alexander|2007|pages=31–32}} a [[Modern Paganism|Neopagan]] religion which seeks to authentically revive and recreate the religion of ancient Greece in the modern world.{{sfn|Alexander|2007|pages=11–20}}
