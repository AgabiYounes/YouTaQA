An '''encyclopedia''' or '''encyclopaedia''' is a [[reference work]] or [[compendium]] providing summaries of [[knowledge]] either from all branches or from a particular field or discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.rcc.edu/riverside/glossaryoflibraryterms.htm#e |title=Encyclopedia. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803182506/http://library.rcc.edu/riverside/glossaryoflibraryterms.htm#e |archivedate=August 3, 2007}} Glossary of Library Terms.

Encyclopedias have existed for around 2,000 years and have evolved considerably during that time as regards to language (written in a major international or a vernacular language), size (few or many volumes), intent (presentation of a global or a limited range of knowledge), cultural perspective (authoritative, ideological, didactic, utilitarian), authorship (qualifications, style), readership (education level, background, interests, capabilities), and the technologies available for their production and distribution (hand-written manuscripts, small or large print runs, Internet). As a valued source of reliable information compiled by experts, printed versions found a prominent place in libraries, schools and other educational institutions.

The appearance of [[Online encyclopedia|digital and open-source versions]] in the 21st century has vastly expanded the accessibility, authorship, readership, and variety of encyclopedia entries.

==Etymology==
{{Quote box|Indeed, the purpose of an encyclopedia is to collect knowledge disseminated around the globe; to set forth its general system to the men with whom we live, and transmit it to those who will come after us, so that the work of preceding centuries will not become useless to the centuries to come; and so that our offspring, becoming better instructed, will at the same time become more virtuous and happy, and that we should not die without having rendered a service to the human race in the future years to come.|[[Denis Diderot|Diderot]]&lt;ref&gt;Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;idno=did2222.0000.004;rgn=main;view=text ''Encyclopédie.''] University of Michigan Library:Scholarly Publishing Office and DLXS.

===Two Greek words misunderstood as one===
The word ''[[wikt:encyclopedia|encyclopedia]]'' comes from the [[Koine Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἐγκύκλιος παιδεία}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0060%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D10%3Asection%3D1 Ἐγκύκλιος παιδεία], Quintilian, ''Institutio Oratoria'', 1.10.1, at Perseus Project&lt;!--Perseus features an erroneous transcription: *ἐγκύκλικος instead of ἐγκύκλιος--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; transliterated ''enkyklios paedia'', meaning &quot;general education&quot; from ''enkyklios'' (ἐγκύκλιος), meaning &quot;circular, recurrent, required regularly, general&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29gku%2Fklios ἐγκύκλιος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', at Perseus Project&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[paideia|paedia]]'' (παιδεία), meaning &quot;education, rearing of a child&quot;; together, the phrase literally translates as &quot;complete instruction&quot; or &quot;complete knowledge&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpaidei%2Fa παιδεία], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', at Perseus Project&lt;/ref&gt; However, the two separate words were reduced to a single word due to a scribal error&lt;ref&gt;According to some accounts, such as the [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/encyclopedia ''American Heritage Dictionary''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819022705/http://www.thefreedictionary.com/encyclopedia |date=August 19, 2017 }}, copyists of Latin manuscripts took this phrase to be a single Greek word, ἐγκυκλοπαιδεία ''enkyklopaedia''.&lt;!--The American Heritage Dictionary gives &quot;enkuklopaedia&quot; (a mistaken transliteration) but Wikipedia follows [[WP:GREEK]].--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; by copyists of a [[Latin]] manuscript edition of [[Quintillian]] in 1470.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Franklin-Brown | first = Mary | title = Reading the world : encyclopedic writing in the scholastic age | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago London | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780226260709|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The copyists took this phrase to be a single Greek word, ''enkyklopaedia'', with the same meaning, and this spurious Greek word became the [[New Latin]] word &quot;encyclopaedia&quot;, which in turn came into English. Because of this compounded word, fifteenth century readers and since have often, and incorrectly, thought that the Roman authors [[Quintillian]] and [[Natural History (Pliny)|Pliny]] described an ancient genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = König | first = Jason | title = Encyclopaedism from antiquity to the Renaissance | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = New York | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-1-107-03823-3 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sixteenth century usage of the compounded word===
[[File:Pavao Skalić; Enciklopedija ili znanje svijeta svetih i svjetovnih struka (1559).jpg|thumb|right|Title page of [[Pavao Skalić|Skalich's]] ''Encyclopaediæ, seu orbis disciplinarum, tam sacrarum quam prophanarum, epistemon'' from 1559, first clear use of the word ''encyclopaedia'' in the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Yeo | first = Richard | title = Encyclopaedic visions : scientific dictionaries and enlightenment culture | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0521152921 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the sixteenth century there was a level of ambiguity as to how to use this new word. As several titles illustrate, there was not a settled notion about its spelling nor its status as a noun. For example: Jacobus Philomusus's ''{{lang|la|Margarita philosophica encyclopaediam exhibens}}'' (1508); [[Johannes Aventinus]]'s ''{{lang|la|Encyclopedia orbisque doctrinarum, hoc est omnium artium, scientiarum, ipsius philosophiae index ac divisio}}''; [[Joachimus Fortius Ringelbergius]]'s ''{{lang|la|Lucubrationes vel potius absolutissima kyklopaideia}}'' (1538, 1541); [[Paul Skalich]]'s ''{{lang|la|[[Encyclopaediæ, seu orbis disciplinarum, tam sacrarum quam prophanarum, epistemon]]}}'' (1559); [[Gregor Reisch]]'s ''{{lang|la|Margarita philosophica}}'' (1503, retitled Encyclopaedia in 1583); and [[Samuel Eisenmenger]]'s ''{{lang|la|Cyclopaedia Paracelsica}}'' (1585).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=Ph.D|title=Varieties of encyclopedism in the early Roman Empire: Vitruvius, Pliny the Elder, Artemidorus |last=Harris-McCoy |first=Daniel |year=2008 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania |page=12|ref=harv|id={{ProQuest|304510158}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been two examples of the oldest [[vernacular]] use of the compounded word. In approximately 1490, Franciscus Puccius wrote a letter to Politianus thanking him for his ''Miscellanea'', calling it an encyclopedia.{{sfn|Harris-McCoy|2008|page=11–12}} More commonly, [[François Rabelais]] is cited for his use of the term in ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel|Pantagruel]]'' (1532).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Roest |first=Bert |booktitle=Pre-Modern Encyclopaedic Texts: Proceedings of the Second Comers Congress, Groningen, 1 – July 4, 1996|year=1997|publisher=BRILL|pages=213|title=Compilation as Theme and Praxis in Franciscan Universal Chronicles|ISBN=90-04-10830-0|editor=Peter Binkley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carey |first=Sorcha |title=Pliny's Catalogue of Culture: Art and Empire in the Natural History|page=17|chapter=Two Strategies of Encyclopaedism|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-925913-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The suffix ''-p(a)edia''===
Several encyclopedias have names that include the suffix ''-p(a)edia'', to mark the text as belonging to the genre of encyclopedias. An example is [[Banglapedia]] (on matters relevant for Bangladesh).

===Contemporary usage===
Today in English, the word is most commonly spelled ''encyclopedia'', though ''encyclopaedia'' ([[American and British English spelling differences#ae and oe|from ''encyclopædia'']]) is also used in Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/61848?redirectedFrom=encyclopaedia#eid |format=online |publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED.com), [[Oxford University Press]] |title=encyclopaedia |accessdate=February 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, both encyclopedias and dictionaries have been researched and written by well-educated, well-informed content [[expert]]s, but they are significantly different in structure. A dictionary is a linguistic work which primarily focuses on alphabetical listing of [[words]] and their [[definitions]]. [[Synonym]]ous words and those related by the subject matter are to be found scattered around the dictionary, giving no obvious place for in-depth treatment. Thus, a dictionary typically provides limited [[information]], [[wikt:Analysis|analysis]] or background for the word defined. While it may offer a definition, it may leave the reader lacking in [[understanding]] the meaning, significance or limitations of a [[Term (language)|term]], and how the term relates to a broader field of knowledge. An encyclopedia is, theoretically, not written in order to convince, although one of its goals is indeed to convince its reader of its own veracity.

To address those needs, an encyclopedia article is typically not limited to simple definitions, and is not limited to defining an individual word, but provides a more extensive meaning for a ''subject or [[list of academic disciplines|discipline]]''. In addition to defining and listing synonymous terms for the topic, the article is able to treat the topic's more extensive meaning in more depth and convey the most relevant accumulated knowledge on that subject. An encyclopedia article also often includes many [[map]]s and [[illustration]]s, as well as [[bibliography]] and [[statistics]].

Four major elements define an encyclopedia: its subject matter, its scope, its method of organization, and its method of production:
* Encyclopedias can be general, containing articles on topics in every field (the English-language ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' and German ''[[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie|Brockhaus]]'' are well-known examples). General encyclopedias may contain guides on how to do a variety of things, as well as embedded dictionaries and [[gazetteer]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} There are also encyclopedias that cover a wide variety of topics from a particular cultural, ethnic, or national perspective, such as the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' or ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]''.
* Works of encyclopedic scope aim to convey the important accumulated knowledge for their subject domain, such as an encyclopedia of [[medicine]], [[philosophy]] or [[law]]. Works vary in the breadth of material and the depth of discussion, depending on the [[target audience]]. 
* Some systematic method of organization is essential to making an encyclopedia usable for reference. There have historically been two main methods of organizing printed encyclopedias: the [[alphabetical order|alphabetical]] method (consisting of a number of separate articles, organized in alphabetical order) and organization by [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] categories. The former method is today the more common, especially for general works. The fluidity of [[electronic media]], however, allows new possibilities for multiple methods of organization of the same content. Further, electronic media offer new capabilities for search, [[Subject indexing|indexing]] and [[cross reference]]. The [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] from [[Horace]] on the title page of the 18th century ''Encyclopédie'' suggests the importance of the structure of an encyclopedia: &quot;What grace may be added to commonplace matters by the power of order and connection.&quot;
* As modern multimedia and the information age have evolved, new methods have emerged for the collection, verification, summation, and presentation of information of all kinds. Projects such as [[Everything2]], [[Encarta]], [[h2g2]], and [[Wikipedia]] are examples of new forms of the encyclopedia as [[information retrieval]] becomes simpler. The method of production for an encyclopedia historically has been supported in both for-profit and non-profit contexts. The ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' mentioned above was entirely state sponsored, while the ''Britannica'' was supported as a for-profit institution. By comparison, Wikipedia is supported by volunteers contributing in a non-profit environment under the organization of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]].

Some works entitled &quot;dictionaries&quot; are actually similar to encyclopedias, especially those concerned with a particular field (such as the ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', the ''[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]'', and ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]''). The ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]],'' Australia's national dictionary, became an [[encyclopedic dictionary]] after its first edition in recognition of the use of proper nouns in common communication, and the words derived from such proper nouns.

There are some broad differences between encyclopedias and dictionaries. Most noticeably, encyclopedia articles are longer, fuller and more thorough than entries in most general-purpose dictionaries.&lt;ref name=DOLencyclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=DOLencyclopedicdefinition /&gt; There are differences in content as well. Generally speaking, dictionaries provide [[linguistics|linguistic]] information about words themselves, while encyclopedias focus more on the thing for which those words stand.&lt;ref name=bejoint /&gt;&lt;ref name=EB /&gt;&lt;ref name=DOLei /&gt;&lt;ref name=OHEL22 /&gt; Thus, while dictionary entries are inextricably fixed to the word described, encyclopedia articles can be given a different entry name. As such, dictionary entries are not fully translatable into other languages, but encyclopedia articles can be.&lt;ref name=bejoint /&gt;

In practice, however, the distinction is not concrete, as there is no clear-cut difference between factual, &quot;encyclopedic&quot; information and linguistic information such as appears in dictionaries.&lt;ref name=DOLei /&gt;&lt;ref name=DOLencyclopedicdefinition&gt;{{cite book|journal= Dictionary of Lexicography|last= Hartmann|first=R.

Information in traditional encyclopedias can be assessed by [[Measure (mathematics)|measures]] related to such [[data quality|quality]] dimension as [[authority]], [[Completeness (knowledge bases)|completeness]], [[Content format|format]], [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]], [[Writing style|style]], [[timeliness]] and [[uniqueness]].&lt;ref name=&quot;quality2019&quot; /&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of encyclopedias}}
Encyclopedias have progressed from written form in antiquity, to print in modern times. Today they can also be distributed and displayed electronically.

===Ancient times===
[[File:naturalishistoria.jpg|thumb|''Naturalis Historiae'', 1669 edition, title page]]
One of the earliest encyclopedic works to have survived to modern times is the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historiae]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statesman living in the first century AD. He compiled a work of 37 chapters covering natural history, architecture, medicine, geography, geology, and other aspects of the world around him. He stated in the preface that he had compiled 20,000 facts from 2000 works by over 200 authors, and added many others from his own experience. The work was published around AD 77–79, although Pliny probably never finished editing the work before his death in the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] in AD 79.&lt;ref name=naturalis&gt;Naturalis Historia&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
[[Isidore of Seville]], one of the greatest scholars of the early [[Middle Ages]], is widely recognized for writing the first encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' (''The Etymologies'') or ''Origines'' (around 630), in which he compiled a sizable portion of the learning available at his time, both ancient and contemporary. The work has 448 chapters in 20 volumes, and is valuable because of the quotes and fragments of texts by other authors that would have been lost had he not collected them.

The most popular encyclopedia of the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian Age]] was the ''De universo'' or ''De rerum naturis'' by [[Rabanus Maurus]], written about 830; it was based on ''Etymologiae''.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The encyclopedia of [[Suda]], a massive 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, had 30 000 entries, many drawing from ancient sources that have since been lost, and often derived from medieval [[Christianity|Christian]] compilers. The text was arranged alphabetically with some slight deviations from common vowel order and place in the Greek alphabet.

The [[Historiography of early Islam|early Muslim compilations of knowledge]] in the Middle Ages included many comprehensive works. Around year 960, the [[Brethren of Purity]] of [[Basra]] were engaged in their ''[[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;P.D. Wightman (1953), ''The Growth of Scientific Ideas''&lt;/ref&gt; Notable works include [[Al-Razi|Abu Bakr al-Razi]]'s encyclopedia of science, the [[Mutazilite]] [[Al-Kindi]]'s prolific output of 270 books, and [[Ibn Sina]]'s medical encyclopedia, which was a standard reference work for centuries. Also notable are works of [[universal history]] (or sociology) from [[Asharite]]s, [[al-Tabri]], [[Masudi|al-Masudi]], [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Tabari]]'s ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings]]'', [[Ibn Rustah]], [[Ali ibn al-Athir|al-Athir]], and [[Ibn Khaldun]], whose ''[[The Muqadimmah|Muqadimmah]]'' contains cautions regarding trust in written records that remain wholly applicable today.

The enormous encyclopedic work in China of the ''[[Four Great Books of Song]]'', compiled by the 11th century during the early [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), was a massive literary undertaking for the time. The last encyclopedia of the four, the ''[[Prime Tortoise of the Record Bureau]]'', amounted to 9.4 million [[Chinese characters]] in 1000 written volumes. The 'period of the encyclopedists' spanned from the tenth to seventeenth centuries, during which the government of China employed hundreds of scholars to assemble massive encyclopedias.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The library : an illustrated history|last=1948-|first=Murray, Stuart|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|isbn=9781602397064|location=New York, NY|oclc=277203534}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest of which is the [[Yongle Encyclopedia]]; it was completed in 1408 and consisted of almost 23,000 folio volumes in manuscript form.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

In late medieval Europe, several authors had the ambition of compiling the sum of human knowledge in a certain field or overall, for example [[Bartholomew of England]], [[Vincent of Beauvais]], [[Radulfus Ardens]], [[Book of Sydrac|Sydrac]], [[Brunetto Latini]], Giovanni da Sangiminiano, [[Pierre Bersuire]]. Some were women, like [[Hildegard of Bingen]] and [[Herrad of Landsberg]]. The most successful of those publications were the ''Speculum maius (Great Mirror)'' of [[Vincent of Beauvais]] and the ''De proprietatibus rerum (On the Properties of Things)'' by [[Bartholomew of England]]. The latter was translated (or adapted) into [[French language|French]], Provençal, [[Italian language|Italian]], [[English language|English]], [[Flemish]], [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[German language|German]] during the Middle Ages. Both were written in the middle of the 13th century. No medieval encyclopedia bore the title ''Encyclopaedia'' – they were often called ''On nature (De natura, De naturis rerum)'', ''Mirror (Speculum maius, Speculum universale)'', ''Treasure (Trésor)''.&lt;ref&gt;Monique Paulmier-Foucart, &quot;Medieval Encyclopaedias&quot;, in André Vauchez (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages'', James Clarke &amp; Co, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
[[File:Margarita Philosopica by Reisch 2.jpg|thumb|Anatomy in ''Margarita Philosophica'', 1565]]
Medieval encyclopedias were all hand-copied and thus available mostly to wealthy patrons or monastic men of learning; they were expensive, and usually written for those extending knowledge rather than those using it.&lt;ref name=&quot;dotma&quot;&gt;See &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; in ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]], the creation of [[printing]] allowed a wider diffusion of encyclopedias and every scholar could have his or her own copy. The ''[[De expetendis et fugiendis rebus]]'' by [[Giorgio Valla]] was posthumously printed in 1501 by [[Aldo Manuzio]] in [[Venice]]. This work followed the traditional scheme of liberal arts. However, Valla added the translation of ancient Greek works on mathematics (firstly by [[Archimedes]]), newly discovered and translated. The ''Margarita Philosophica'' by [[Gregor Reisch]], printed in 1503, was a complete encyclopedia explaining the [[seven liberal arts]].

The term ''encyclopaedia'' was coined by 16th-century humanists who misread copies of their texts of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0138%3Abook%3Dpreface%3Achapter%3D3 Pliny the Elder, ''Naturalis Historia'', Preface 14].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Quintilian]],&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian, ''Institutio oratoria'', 1.10.1: ''ut efficiatur orbis ille doctrinae, quem Graeci ἐγκύκλιον παιδείαν vocant.''&lt;/ref&gt; and combined the two Greek words &quot;''enkyklios paedia''&quot; into one word, έγκυκλοπαιδεία.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29gkuklopaidei%2Fa έγκυκλοπαιδεία], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', at Perseus Project: &quot;f. l. [= ''falsa lectio'', Latin for &quot;false reading&quot;] for ἐγκύκλιος παιδεία&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''enkyklios paedia'' (ἐγκύκλιος παιδεία) was used by Plutarch and the Latin word encyclopaedia came from him.

The first work titled in this way was the ''Encyclopedia orbisque doctrinarum, hoc est omnium artium, scientiarum, ipsius philosophiae index ac divisio'' written by [[Johannes Aventinus]] in 1517.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The English physician and philosopher, Sir [[Thomas Browne]] used the word 'encyclopaedia' in 1646 in the preface [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/pseudodoxia/pseudo1.html to the reader] to define his ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'', a major work of the 17th-century scientific revolution. Browne structured his encyclopaedia upon the time-honoured scheme of the Renaissance, the so-called 'scale of creation' which ascends through the mineral, vegetable, animal, human, planetary, and cosmological worlds. ''Pseudodoxia Epidemica'' was a European best-seller, translated into French, Dutch, and German as well as Latin it went through no fewer than five editions, each revised and augmented, the last edition appearing in 1672.

Financial, commercial, legal, and intellectual factors changed the size of encyclopedias. During the [[Renaissance]], middle classes had more time to read and encyclopedias helped them to learn more. Publishers wanted to increase their output so some countries like Germany started selling books missing alphabetical sections, to publish faster. Also, publishers could not afford all the resources by themselves, so multiple publishers would come together with their resources to create better encyclopedias. When publishing at the same rate became financially impossible, they turned to subscriptions and serial publications. This was risky for publishers because they had to find people that would pay all upfront or make payments. When this worked, capital would rise and there would be a steady income for encyclopedias. Later, rivalry grew, causing copyright to occur due to weak underdeveloped laws. Some publishers would copy another publisher's work to produce an encyclopedia faster and cheaper so consumers did not have to pay a lot and they would sell more. Encyclopedias made it to where middle-class citizens could basically have a small library in their own house. Europeans were becoming more curious about their society around them causing them to revolt against their government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loveland|first=J.|date=2012|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241898454|title=Why Encyclopedias Got Bigger … and Smaller|journal=Information &amp; Culture|volume=47|issue=2|pages=233–254|doi=10.1353/lac.2012.0012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional encyclopedias===
[[File:Encyclopedie de D'Alembert et Diderot - Premiere Page - ENC 1-NA5.jpg|thumb|''[[Encyclopédie]]'', 1773]]
The beginnings of the modern idea of the general-purpose, widely distributed printed encyclopedia precede the 18th century encyclopedists. However, [[Ephraim Chambers|Chambers]]' ''[[Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]'' (1728), and the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] (1751 onwards), as well as ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' and the ''[[Brockhaus encyclopedia|Conversations-Lexikon]]'', were the first to realize the form we would recognize today, with a comprehensive scope of topics, discussed in depth and organized in an accessible, systematic method. Chambers, in 1728, followed the earlier lead of John Harris's ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]'' of 1704 and later editions (see also below); this work was by its title and content &quot;A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves&quot;.

Popular and affordable encyclopedias such as ''[[Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia]]'' and the ''[[Children's Encyclopaedia]]'' appeared in the early 1920s.

In the United States, the 1950s and 1960s saw the introduction of several large popular encyclopedias, often sold on installment plans. The best known of these were ''[[World Book]]'' and ''[[Funk and Wagnalls]]''. As many as 90% were sold [[door to door]]. Jack Lynch says in his book ''You Could Look It Up'' that encyclopedia salespeople were so common that they became the butt of jokes. He describes their sales pitch saying, ''“They were selling not books but a lifestyle, a future, a promise of social mobility.&quot;''  A 1961 ''World Book'' ad said, ''“You are holding your family’s future in your hands right now,”'' while showing a feminine hand holding an order form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Onion |first1=Rebecca |title=How Two Artists Turn Old Encyclopedias Into Beautiful, Melancholy Art |url=https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/06/how-two-artists-turn-old-encyclopedias-into-beautiful-melancholy-art.html |website=Slate |accessdate=September 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EncycBrit1913.jpg|thumb|1913 advertisement for ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', the oldest and one of the largest contemporary English encyclopedias]]
The second half of the 20th century also saw the proliferation of specialized encyclopedias that compiled topics in specific fields, mainly to support specific industries and professionals. This trend has continued. Encyclopedias of at least one volume in size now exist for most if not all [[academic discipline]]s, including such narrow topics such as [[bioethics]].

=== Rise of digital and online encyclopedias ===
By the late 20th century, encyclopedias were being published on [[CD-ROM]]s for use with personal computers. [[Microsoft]]'s ''[[Encarta]]'', published between 1993 and 2009, was a landmark example as it had no printed equivalent. Articles were supplemented with both video and audio files as well as numerous high-quality images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/guide_page_FAQ/FAQ.html |title=Important Notice: MSN Encarta to be Discontinued |publisher=MSN Encarta |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027213618/http://encarta.msn.com/guide_page_FAQ/FAQ.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital technologies and online [[crowdsourcing]] allowed encyclopedias to break away from traditional limitations in both breath and depth of topics covered. [[Wikipedia]], a crowd-sourced, [[List of Wikipedia language editions|multilingual]], [[Open content|open licence]], free [[online encyclopedia]] supported by the non-profit [[Wikimedia Foundation]] and [[open source]] [[MediaWiki]] software opened in 2001. Unlike commercial online encyclopedias such as [[Encyclopædia Britannica Online|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online]], which are written by experts, Wikipedia is collaboratively created and maintained by [[Wikipedians|volunteer editors]], organized by [[Voting|collaboratively agreed]] guidelines and [[Wikipedia community|user-roles]]. Most contributors use pseudonyms and stay anonymous. Content is therefor reviewed, checked, kept or removed based on its own intrinsic value and external [[Citation|sources]] supporting it. 

Traditional encyclopedias' reliability, on their side, stand upon authorship and associated professional expertise. Many academics, teachers, and journalists rejected and continue to reject open, crowd sourced encyclopedias, especially Wikipedia, as a reliable source of information, and Wikipedia is itself not a reliable source according to its own standards because of its openly editable and anonymous [[crowdsourcing]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20060923/news_lz1n23wiki.html|title=Wikipedia co-founder looks to add accountability, end anarchy|author=Sidener, Jonathan|date=September 23, 2006|work=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117190455/http://legacy.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20060923/news_lz1n23wiki.html|archive-date=January 17, 2018|accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 2005 found that Wikipedia's science articles were roughly comparable in accuracy to those of ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', containing the same number of serious errors and about 1/3 more minor factual inaccuracies, but that Wikipedia's writing tended to be confusing and less readable.&lt;ref name=&quot;GilesJ2005Internet&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giles|first=Jim|authorlink=Jim Giles (reporter)|date=December 2005|title=Internet encyclopedias go head to head|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=438|issue=7070|pages=900–901|bibcode=2005Natur.438..900G|doi=10.1038/438900a|pmid=16355180}}{{subscription required}}

There are several much smaller, usually more specialized, encyclopedias on various themes, sometimes dedicated to a specific geographic region or time period.&lt;ref&gt;Sideris A., [https://www.academia.edu/481168/The_Encyclopedic_Concept_in_the_Web_Era= &quot;The Encyclopedic Concept in the Web Era&quot;], in Ioannides M., Arnold D., Niccolucci F. and K. Mania (eds.), ''The e-volution of Information Communication Technology in Cultural Heritage. Where Hi-Tech Touches the Past: Risks and Challenges for the 21st Century. VAST 2006'', Epoch, Budapest 2006, pp. 192-197. {{ISBN|963-8046-74-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''. 

=== Largest encyclopedias ===
As of early 2020s, the largest encyclopedias are the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[Baidu Baike]] (16 million articles) and [[Baike.com|Hudong Baike]] (13 million), followed by [[List of Wikipedias|Wikipedias]] for [[English Wikipedia|English]] (6 millions), [[German Wikipedia|German]] (+2 millions) and [[French Wikipedia|French]] (+2 millions).&lt;ref name=&quot;wp.org&quot;&gt;https://wikipedia.org&lt;/ref&gt; More than a dozen other Wikipedias have 1 millions articles or more&lt;ref name=&quot;wp.org&quot; /&gt;, article of variable quality and length. Measuring an Encyclopedia's size by its articles stays an ambiguous method since online [[Chinese encyclopedias]] cited above allows multiples articles on a same topic, while Wikipedias allow automated creation of nearly empty articles.
