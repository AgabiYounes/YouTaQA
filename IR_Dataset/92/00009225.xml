'''Electronic paper''' and '''e-paper''', also sometimes '''electronic ink''', '''electrophoretic displays''' or '''e-ink''', are [[display device]]s that mimic the appearance of ordinary [[ink]] on [[paper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Heikenfeld |title= A critical review of the present and future prospects for electronic paper |journal= J.

This may make them more comfortable to read, and provide a wider viewing angle than most light-emitting displays. The [[contrast ratio]] in electronic displays available as of 2008 approaches newspaper, and newly (2008) developed displays are slightly better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.forbes.com/2008/09/23/amazon-irex-ebook-tech-intel-cx_ag_0923ebook_print.html |title= IRex Takes On The Kindle |accessdate= 2008-11-06 |work=Forbes |date=2008-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ideal e-paper display can be read in direct sunlight without the image appearing to fade.

Many electronic paper technologies hold static text and images indefinitely without electricity. Flexible electronic paper uses plastic substrates and [[plastic electronics]] for the display backplane. Applications of [[electronic visual display]]s include [[electronic shelf label]]s and [[digital signage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sipix.com/applications/pricinglabels.html |title=SiPix pricing labels |accessdate=2008-01-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109183247/http://www.sipix.com/applications/pricinglabels.html |archivedate=2008-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; time tables at bus stations, electronic billboards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.magink.com/product.php |title= magink e-paper billboards |accessdate= 2008-01-13 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070821191921/http://www.magink.com/product.php |archivedate= 2007-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[smartphone]] displays, and [[e-reader]]s able to display digital versions of books and magazines.

===Gyricon===
Electronic paper was first developed in the 1970s by Nick Sheridon at [[Xerox]]'s [[Xerox PARC|Palo Alto Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Genuth|first1=Iddo|title=The Future of Electronic Paper|url=https://thefutureofthings.com/3081-the-future-of-electronic-paper/|publisher=The Future Of Things|accessdate=2 March 2015|ref=tfot|date=2007-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first electronic paper, called [[Gyricon]], consisted of polyethylene spheres between 75 and 106 micrometers across. Each sphere is a [[janus particle]] composed of negatively charged black plastic on one side and positively charged white plastic on the other (each bead is thus a [[dipole]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;gyroid_dipole&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crowley |first1=Joseph M. |last2=Sheridon |first2=Nicholas K. |last3=Romano |first3=Linda |title=Dipole moments of gyricon balls |journal=Journal of Electrostatics |volume=55 |issue=3–4 |pages=247–259 |doi=10.1016/S0304-3886(01)00208-X|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spheres are embedded in a transparent silicone sheet, with each sphere suspended in a bubble of oil so that it can rotate freely. The polarity of the voltage applied to each pair of electrodes then determines whether the white or black side is face-up, thus giving the pixel a white or black appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;newscientist_1&quot;&gt;{{citation |last=Daviss |first=Bennett |title=Paper goes electric |date=15 May 1999 |magazine=New Scientist |publisher= Reed Business Information |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg16221864.700-paper-goes-electric.html |accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the FPD 2008 exhibition, Japanese company Soken demonstrated a wall with electronic wall-paper using this technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soken&quot;&gt;Techon [https://tech.nikkeibp.co.jp/dm/english/NEWS_EN/20081104/160670/ Soken electronic wall-paper]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the Estonian company Visitret Displays was developing this kind of display using [[polyvinylidene fluoride]] (PVDF) as the material for the spheres, dramatically improving the video speed and decreasing the control voltage needed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liiv&quot;&gt;J. Liiv. [https://web.archive.org/web/20160611190750/https://www.scholars-press.com/catalog/details/store/us/book/978-3-639-51567-1/pvdf-as-material-for-active-element-of-twisting-ball-displays?search=liiv PVDF as material for active element of twisting-ball displays]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrophoretic===
[[File:E-ink.svg|thumb|500px|Appearance of pixels]]
In the simplest implementation of an electrophoretic display, [[titanium dioxide]] (titania) particles approximately one micrometer in diameter is dispersed in a hydrocarbon oil. A dark-colored dye is also added to the oil, along with [[surfactant]]s and charging agents that cause the particles to take on an electric charge. This mixture is placed between two parallel, conductive plates separated by a gap of 10 to 100 [[micrometre]]s. When a voltage is applied across the two plates, the particles migrate [[electrophoresis|electrophoretically]] to the plate that bears the opposite charge from that on the particles. When the particles are located at the front (viewing) side of the display, it appears white, because the light is scattered back to the viewer by the high-index{{clarify|date=December 2019}} titania particles. When the particles are located at the rear side of the display, it appears dark, because the incident light is absorbed by the colored dye. If the rear electrode is divided into a number of small picture elements ([[pixel]]s), then an image can be formed by applying the appropriate voltage to each region of the display to create a pattern of reflecting and absorbing regions.

An electrophoretic display is also known as an EPD. They are typically addressed using [[MOSFET]]-based [[thin-film transistor]] (TFT) technology. TFTs are required{{cn|date=December 2019}} to form a high-density image in an EPD. A common application for TFT-based EPDs are e-readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brotherton |first1=S. D. |title=Introduction to Thin Film Transistors: Physics and Technology of TFTs |date=2013 |publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]] |isbn=9783319000022 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E0x0Zghk7okC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrophoretic displays are considered{{by whom|date=December 2019}} prime examples of the electronic paper category, because of their paper-like appearance and low power consumption.{{cn|date=December 2019}} Examples of commercial electrophoretic displays include the high-resolution [[active matrix]] displays used in the [[Amazon Kindle]], [[Barnes &amp; Noble Nook]], [[Sony Reader]], [[Kobo eReader]], and [[iRex iLiad]] e-readers. These displays are constructed from an electrophoretic imaging film manufactured by [[E Ink Corporation]]. A mobile phone that used the technology is the [[Motorola Fone]].

Electrophoretic Display technology has also been developed by SiPix and [[Bridgestone]]/Delta. SiPix is now part of E Ink Corporation. The SiPix design uses a flexible 0.15&amp;nbsp;mm Microcup architecture, instead of E Ink's 0.04&amp;nbsp;mm diameter microcapsules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.e-ink-info.com/introduction|title=E-Paper (E Ink) introduction and basic e-paper information|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epapercentral.com/epaper-technologies-guide |title=Epaper technologies guide |publisher=epapercentral |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919211056/https://www.epapercentral.com/epaper-technologies-guide |archivedate=2012-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bridgestone]] Corp.'s Advanced Materials Division cooperated with Delta Optoelectronics Inc. in developing Quick Response Liquid Powder Display technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.bridgestone-dp.jp/global/adv-materials/QR-LPD/|title=製品情報（タイヤ/化工品/スポーツ用品/自転車） - 株式会社ブリヂストン|access-date=2009-11-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716125733/http://www2.bridgestone-dp.jp/global/adv-materials/QR-LPD/|archive-date=2009-07-16|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecoolgadgets.com/bridgestone-flexible-epaper-quick-response-liquid-powder-technology/|title=BridgeStone Flexible ePaper – Quick Response Liquid Powder Technology - The Cool Gadgets - Quest for The Coolest Gadgets|publisher=|date=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''electrophoretic display''' forms images by rearranging charged pigment particles with an applied [[electric field]].
[[File:Kindle 3 texture (crop).jpg|thumb|Macro photograph of Kindle 3 screen; microcapsules are evident at [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Kindle_3_texture_%28crop%29.jpg full size]]]
In the 1990s another type of electronic ink based on a microencapsulated electrophoretic display was conceived and prototyped by a team of undergraduates at MIT&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= A New Printing Technology Sets Off a High-Stakes Race|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB946939872703897050|newspaper= Wall Street Journal|access-date= 2015-11-27|issn= 0099-9660|first= Alec Klein Staff Reporter of The Wall Street|last= Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; as described in their Nature paper.&lt;ref name=&quot;e_ink_nature&quot;/&gt; J.D. Albert, [[Barrett Comiskey]], Joseph Jacobson, Jeremy Rubin and Russ Wilcox co-founded [[E Ink Corporation]] in 1997 to commercialize the technology. E ink subsequently formed a partnership with [[Philips|Philips Components]] two years later to develop and market the technology. In 2005, Philips sold the electronic paper business as well as its related patents to [[Prime View International]]. &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;It has for many years been an ambition of researchers in display media to create a flexible low-cost system that is the electronic analog of paper. In this context, microparticle-based displays have long intrigued researchers. Switchable contrast in such displays is achieved by the electromigration of highly scattering or absorbing microparticles (in the size range 0.1–5 μm), quite distinct from the molecular-scale properties that govern the behavior of the more familiar liquid-crystal displays. Micro-particle-based displays possess intrinsic bistability, exhibit extremely low power d.c. field addressing and have demonstrated high contrast and reflectivity. These features, combined with a near-[[Lambertian reflectance|lambertian]] viewing characteristic, result in an 'ink on paper' look. But such displays have to date suffered from short lifetimes and difficulty in manufacture. Here we report the synthesis of an electrophoretic ink based on the microencapsulation of an electrophoretic dispersion. The use of a microencapsulated electrophoretic medium solves the lifetime issues and permits the fabrication of a bistable electronic display solely by means of printing. This system may satisfy the practical requirements of electronic paper.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= An electrophoretic ink for all-printed reflective electronic displays|journal= Nature|date= 1998-07-16|issn= 0028-0836|pages= 253–255|volume= 394|issue= 6690|doi= 10.1038/28349|first= Barrett|last= Comiskey|first2= J. D.|last2= Albert|first3= Hidekazu|last3= Yoshizawa|first4= Joseph|last4= Jacobson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This used tiny microcapsules filled with electrically charged white [[molecule|particles]] suspended in a colored [[mineral oil|oil]].&lt;ref name=&quot;e_ink_nature&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Comiskey |first1= B. |last2= Albert |first2= J. D. |last3= Yoshizawa |first3= H. |last4= Jacobson |first4= J. |year= 1998 |title= An electrophoretic ink for all-printed reflective electronic displays |doi= 10.1038/28349 |journal= Nature |volume= 394 |issue= 6690 |pages= 253–255}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early versions, the underlying [[circuitry]] controlled whether the white particles were at the top of the capsule (so it looked white to the viewer) or at the bottom of the capsule (so the viewer saw the color of the oil). This was essentially a reintroduction of the well-known [[electrophoresis|electrophoretic]] display technology, but microcapsules meant the display could be made on flexible plastic sheets instead of glass.
One early version of the electronic paper consists of a sheet of very small transparent capsules, each about 40 [[micrometre|micrometer]]s across. Each capsule contains an oily solution containing black dye (the electronic ink), with numerous white [[titanium dioxide]] particles suspended within. The particles are slightly negatively [[electric charge|charged]], and each one is naturally white.&lt;ref name=&quot;newscientist_1&quot;/&gt;
The screen holds microcapsules in a layer of [[liquid]] [[polymer]], sandwiched between two arrays of electrodes, the upper of which is transparent. The two arrays are aligned to divide the sheet into pixels, and each pixel corresponds to a pair of electrodes situated on either side of the sheet. The sheet is laminated with transparent plastic for protection, resulting in an overall thickness of 80 micrometers, or twice that of ordinary paper.
The network of electrodes connects to display circuitry, which turns the electronic ink 'on' and 'off' at specific pixels by applying a voltage to specific electrode pairs. A negative charge to the surface electrode repels the particles to the bottom of local capsules, forcing the black dye to the surface and turning the pixel black. Reversing the voltage has the opposite effect. It forces the particles to the surface, turning the pixel white. A more recent implementation of this concept requires only one layer of electrodes beneath the microcapsules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sample |first=Ian |newspaper=New Scientist |title=Roll The Presses |date=24 April 2001 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn659-roll-the-presses.html |accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=John A |last1=Rogers |first2=Zhenan |last2=Bao |first3=Kirk |last3=Baldwin |first4=Ananth |last4=Dodabalapur |first5=Brian |last5=Crone |first6=V R |last6=Raju |first7=Valerie |last7=Kuck |first8=Howard |last8=Katz |first9=Karl |last9=Amundson |first10=Jay |last10=Ewing |first11=Paul |last11=Drzaic |title=Paper-like electronic displays: Large-area rubber-stamped plastic sheets of electronics and microencapsulated electrophoretic inks |date=24 April 2001 |journal=PNAS |volume=98 |issue=9 |pages=4835–4840 |doi=10.1073/pnas.091588098 |pmid=11320233 |pmc=33123}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are commercially referred to as Active Matrix Electrophoretic Displays (AMEPD).

===Electrowetting===
{{Main|Electrowetting}}
Electrowetting display (EWD) is based on controlling the shape of a confined water/oil interface by an applied voltage. With no voltage applied, the (colored) oil forms a flat film between the water and a hydrophobic (water-repellent) insulating coating of an electrode, resulting in a colored pixel. When a voltage is applied between the electrode and the water, the interfacial tension between the water and the coating changes. As a result, the stacked state is no longer stable, causing the water to move the oil aside. This makes a partly transparent pixel, or, if a reflective white surface is under the switchable element, a white pixel. Because of the small pixel size, the user only experiences the average reflection, which provides a high-brightness, high-contrast switchable element.

Displays based on [[electrowetting]] provide several attractive features. The switching between white and colored reflection is fast enough to display video content.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Zyga |first=Lisa |date=26 July 2010 |title=Oil-based color pixels could let you watch videos on e-paper |url=https://phys.org/news/2010-07-oil-based-pixels-videos-e-paper.html |newspaper=PhysOrg |accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's a low-power, low-voltage technology, and displays based on the effect can be made flat and thin. The reflectivity and contrast are better than or equal to other reflective display types and approach the visual qualities of paper. In addition, the technology offers a unique path toward high-brightness full-color displays, leading to displays that are four times brighter than reflective LCDs and twice as bright as other emerging technologies.&lt;ref&gt;LiquaVista electrowetting display technologies http://www.liquavista.com&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of using red, green, and blue (RGB) filters or alternating segments of the three primary colors, which effectively result in only one-third of the display reflecting light in the desired color, electrowetting allows for a system in which one sub-pixel can switch two different colors independently.

This results in the availability of two-thirds of the display area to reflect light in any desired color. This is achieved by building up a pixel with a stack of two independently controllable colored oil films plus a color filter.

The colors are [[CMYK color model|cyan, magenta, and yellow]], which is a subtractive system, comparable to the principle used in inkjet printing. Compared to LCD, brightness is gained because no polarisers are required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/seta/2003/10/02/stories/2003100200060200.htm |date=October 2, 2003 |title=The Hindu: Technology for reflective full-color display |access-date=2018-11-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309052402/http://www.hinduonnet.com/seta/2003/10/02/stories/2003100200060200.htm |archive-date=2011-03-09 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional electrowetting displays were produced by [[Liquavista]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liquavista.com|title=Home - Liquavista - Electrowetting based low power, always viewable color video displays|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Industrial Technology Research Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itri.org.tw/eng/news-and-events/feature-story-detail.asp?RootNodeId=050&amp;NodeId=0502&amp;FocusNewsNBR=52] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Advanced Display Technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;Blankenbach K, Schmoll A, Bitman A, Bartels F and Jerosch D 2008 Novel highly reflective and bistable electrowetting displays SID J. 16 237–44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iop.org/Select/article/0960-1317/19/6/065029/jmm9_6_065029.pdf?request-id=37ba45f3-e740-4c0d-8c35-dcf2d9af1f10&lt;/ref&gt;

====Electrofluidic====
[[Electrofluidic display]] is a variation of an electrowetting display. Electrofluidic displays place an aqueous pigment dispersion inside a tiny reservoir. The reservoir comprises &lt;5-10% of the viewable pixel area and therefore the pigment is substantially hidden from view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gamma Dynamic Technology|url=http://gammadynamics.net/technology/|publisher=Gamma Dynamics|accessdate=1 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303154148/http://gammadynamics.net/technology/|archive-date=3 March 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voltage is used to electromechanically pull the pigment out of the reservoir and spread it as a film directly behind the viewing substrate. As a result, the display takes on color and brightness similar to that of conventional pigments printed on paper. When voltage is removed liquid surface tension causes the pigment dispersion to rapidly recoil into the reservoir. The technology can potentially provide &gt;85 % white state reflectance for electronic paper.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nature.com/articles/nphoton.2009.66 May 2009 issue of Nature Photonics]&lt;/ref&gt;

The core technology was invented at the Novel Devices Laboratory at the [[University of Cincinnati]]. The technology is currently being commercialized by Gamma Dynamics.

===Interferometric modulator (Mirasol)===
{{Main|Interferometric modulator display}}

The technology used in [[electronic visual display]]s that can create various colors via [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] of reflected light. The color is selected with an electrically switched light [[modulator]] comprising a [[micromachinery|microscopic cavity]] that is switched on and off using [[driver circuit|driver]] [[integrated circuit]]s similar to those used to address [[liquid crystal display]]s (LCD).

===Plasmonic electronic display===
Plasmonic nanostructures with conductive polymers have also been suggested as one kind of electronic paper.&lt;ref&gt;Xiong, Kunli; Emilsson, Gustav; Maziz, Ali. &quot;[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/adma.201603358 Plasmonic Metasurfaces with Conjugated Polymers for Flexible Electronic Paper in Color]&quot;Advanced Materials: sid. n/a–n/a. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.201603358/full doi:10.1002/adma.201603358]. ISSN 1521-4095. 28 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The material has two parts. The first part is a highly reflective metasurface made by metal-insulator-metal films tens of nanometers in thickness including nanoscale holes. The metasurfaces can reflect different colors depending on the thickness of the insulator. The three primary colors red, green and blue can be used as pixels for full-color displays. The second part is a polymer with optical absorption controllable by an electrochemical potential. After growing the polymer on the plasmonic metasurfaces, the reflection of the metasurfaces can be modulated by the applied voltage. This technology presents broad range colors, high polarization-independent reflection (&gt;50 %), strong contrast (&gt;30 %), the fast response time (hundreds of ms), and long-term stability. In addition, it has ultralow power consumption (&lt; 0.5&amp;nbsp;mW/cm2) and potential for high resolution (&gt;10000 dpi). Since the ultrathin metasurfaces are flexible and the polymer is soft, the whole system can be bent. Desired future improvements for this technology include bistability, cheaper materials and implementation with TFT arrays.

The array of pixels is divided into [[triad (monitors)|triad]]s, typically consisting of the standard cyan, magenta and yellow, in the same way as [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] monitors (although using subtractive primary colors as opposed to additive primary colors). The display is then controlled like any other electronic color display.

==Disadvantages==
Electronic paper technologies sometimes have a very low refresh rate compared to other low-power display technologies, such as LCDs. This prevents producers from implementing sophisticated interactive applications (using fast-moving menus, mouse pointers or scrolling) like those common on standard [[mobile device]]s. An example of this limit is that a document might not be smoothly zoomed without either extreme blurring during the transition or a very slow zoom.

[[File:e-ink ghost.jpg|thumb|right|An e-ink screen showing the &quot;ghost&quot; of a prior image]]

Another limit is that a shadow of an image may be visible after refreshing parts of the screen. Such shadows are termed &quot;ghost images&quot;, and the effect is termed &quot;ghosting&quot;. This effect is reminiscent of [[screen burn-in]] but, unlike screen burn-in, is solved after the screen is refreshed several times. Turning every pixel white, then black, then white, helps normalize the contrast of the pixels. This is why several devices with this technology &quot;flash&quot; the entire screen white and black when loading a new image.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

E Ink Corporation of E Ink Holdings Inc. released the first colored e-ink displays to be used in a marketed product. The [[Ectaco]] [[Ectaco jetBook|Jetbook Color]] was released in 2012 as the first colored e-ink e-reader, which used E Ink's Triton display technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;jetbookk12.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jetbookk12.com/|title=Ebook reader for education - ebook for schools, students, middle school.

Several companies are simultaneously developing electronic paper and ink. While the technologies used by each company provide many of the same features, each has its own distinct technological advantages. All electronic paper technologies face the following general challenges:

*A method for encapsulation
*An ink or active material to fill the encapsulation
*Electronics to activate the ink

Electronic ink can be applied to flexible or rigid materials. For flexible displays, the base requires a thin, flexible material tough enough to withstand considerable wear, such as extremely thin plastic. The method of how the inks are encapsulated and then applied to the substrate is what distinguishes each company from others. These processes are complex and are carefully guarded industry secrets. Nevertheless, making electronic paper is less complex and costly than LCDs.

There are many approaches to electronic paper, with many companies developing technology in this area. Other technologies being applied to electronic paper include modifications of [[liquid crystal display]]s, [[electrochromic]] displays, and the electronic equivalent of an [[Etch A Sketch]] at Kyushu University. Advantages of electronic paper include low power usage (power is only drawn when the display is updated), flexibility and better readability than most displays. Electronic ink can be printed on any surface, including walls, billboards, product labels and T-shirts. The ink's flexibility would also make it possible to develop [[rollable display]]s for electronic devices.

{{Main|Comparison of e-readers}}
In 2004 [[Sony]] released the [[Sony Librie|Librié]] in Japan, the first e-book reader with an electronic paper [[E Ink]] display. In September 2006, Sony released the PRS-500 [[Sony Reader]] e-book reader in the USA. On October 2, 2007, Sony announced the PRS-505, an updated version of the Reader. In November 2008, Sony released the PRS-700BC, which incorporated a backlight and a touchscreen.

In late 2007, Amazon began producing and marketing the [[Amazon Kindle]], an e-book reader with an e-paper display. In February 2009, Amazon released the [[Kindle 2]] and in May 2009 the larger [[Kindle DX]] was announced. In July 2010 the third-generation Kindle was announced, with notable design changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1453463&amp;highlight=|title=Amazon Media Room: Press Releases|publisher=|access-date=2010-09-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141004081234/http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1453463&amp;highlight=|archive-date=2014-10-04|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth generation of Kindle, called Touch, was announced in September 2011 that was the Kindle's first departure from keyboards and page turn buttons in favor of touchscreens. In September 2012, Amazon announced the fifth generation of the Kindle called the Paperwhite, which incorporates a LED frontlight and a higher contrast display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/6/3296627/amazon-new-kindle-paperwhite-announcement |title=Kindle Paperwhite e-reader announced, $119 Wi-Fi and $179 3G models ship October 1st |accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, Barnes and Noble launched the [[Barnes &amp; Noble Nook]], running an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system. It differs from other e-readers in having a replaceable battery, and a separate touch-screen color LCD below the main electronic paper reading screen.

In 2017, Sony and [[reMarkable]] offered e-books tailored for writing with a smart [[stylus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/05/sony-and-remarkables-dueling-e-paper-tablets-are-strange-but-impressive-beasts/|title=Sony and reMarkable's dueling e-paper tablets are strange but impressive beasts|last=Coldewey|first=Devin|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-12-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newspapers===
In February 2006, the [[Flanders|Flemish]] daily ''[[De Tijd]]'' distributed an electronic version of the paper to select subscribers in a limited marketing study, using a pre-release version of the [[iRex iLiad]]. This was the first recorded application of electronic ink to newspaper publishing.

The [[French language|French]] daily ''[[Les Échos (France)|Les Échos]]'' announced the official launch of an electronic version of the paper on a subscription basis, in September 2007. Two offers were available, combining a one-year subscription and a reading device. The offer included either a light (176g) reading device (adapted for Les Echos by Ganaxa) or the [[iRex iLiad]]. Two different processing platforms were used to deliver readable information of the daily, one based on the newly developed GPP electronic ink platform from ''[[Ganaxa]]'', and the other one developed internally by Les Echos.

===Displays embedded in smart cards===
Flexible display cards enable financial payment cardholders to generate a [[one-time password]] to reduce [[online banking]] and transaction fraud. Electronic paper offers a flat and thin alternative to existing [[key fob]] tokens for data security. The world's first ISO compliant [[smart card]] with an embedded display was developed by Innovative Card Technologies and nCryptone in 2005. The cards were manufactured by Nagra ID.

===Status displays===
[[File:Lexar Jumpdrive Secure II Plus.jpg|thumb|USB flash drive with E Ink-implemented capacity meter of available flash memory]]
Some devices, like [[USB flash drive]]s, have used electronic paper to display status information, such as available storage space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEXAR ADDS INNOVATIVE STORAGE CAPACITY METER WITH ELECTRONIC PAPER DISPLAY FROM E INK |url=http://www.eink.com/press_releases/lexar_usb_drive_using_e_ink_010306.html |publisher=Eink - Press Release |accessdate=1 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014111900/http://www.eink.com/press_releases/lexar_usb_drive_using_e_ink_010306.html |archivedate=14 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the image on the electronic paper has been set, it requires no power to maintain, so the readout can be seen even when the flash drive is not plugged in.

===Mobile phones===
Motorola's low-cost mobile phone, the [[Motorola FONE F3|Motorola F3]], uses an alphanumeric black-and-white electrophoretic display.

The [[Samsung SCH-U750|Samsung Alias 2]] mobile phone incorporates electronic ink from E Ink into the keypad, which allows the keypad to change character sets and orientation while in different display modes.

On December 12, 2012, [[Yota|Yota Devices]] announced the first &quot;YotaPhone&quot; prototype and was later released in December 2013, a unique double-display smartphone. It has a 4.3-inch, HD LCD on the front and an e-ink display on the back.

===Electronic shelf labels===
{{Main|Electronic shelf label}}
E-Paper based [[electronic shelf label]]s (ESL) are used to digitally display the prices of goods at retail stores. Electronic paper-based labels are updated via two-way infrared or radio technology.

=== Public transport timetables ===
[[File:Nádraží Vysočany, zastávkový sloupek s e-papírem, jízdní řády.jpg|thumb|upright|Tram timetables on e-paper. Prague, prototype from May 2019]]

E-paper displays at bus or trams stops can be shown using eletronic paper. Information can be remotely updated. Compared to LED or LCD displays, they have less energy consumption and the text or graphics stays visible during a power failure. Compared to LCD displays, it is well visible also under full sunshine.

===Digital signage===
{{Main|Digital signage}}
Because of its energy-saving properties, electronic paper has proved a technology suited to digital signage applications.

===Other===
Other proposed applications include clothes, digital photo frames, information boards, and keyboards. Keyboards with dynamically changeable keys are useful for less represented languages, non-standard keyboard layouts such as [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard|Dvorak]], or for special non-alphabetical applications such as video editing or games.
The [[reMarkable]] is a writer tablet for reading and taking notes.
