{{Main|History of engineering}}
[[File:Grondplan citadel Lille.JPG|thumb|Relief map of the [[Citadel of Lille]], designed in 1668 by [[Vauban]], the foremost military engineer of his age.]]

Engineering has existed since ancient times, when humans devised inventions such as the wedge, lever, wheel and pulley, etc.

The term ''engineering''  is derived from the word ''engineer'', which itself dates back to the 14th century when an ''engine'er'' (literally, one who builds or operates a ''[[siege engine]]'') referred to &quot;a constructor of military engines.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|engineer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, now obsolete, an &quot;engine&quot; referred to a military machine, ''i.e.'', a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a [[catapult]]). Notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps, ''e.g.'', the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]].

The word &quot;engine&quot; itself is of even older origin, ultimately deriving from the Latin ''ingenium'' (c. 1250), meaning &quot;innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Origin: 1250–1300; ME engin &lt; AF, OF &lt; L ingenium nature, innate quality, esp. mental power, hence a clever invention, equiv. to in- + -genium, equiv. to gen- begetting; Source: Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Random House, Inc. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, as the design of civilian structures, such as bridges and buildings, matured as a technical discipline, the term [[civil engineering]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ECPD Definition on Britannica&quot;/&gt; entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the discipline of [[military engineering]].

===Ancient era===
[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|thumb|The Ancient Romans built [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] to bring a steady supply of clean and fresh water to cities and towns in the empire.]]
The [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] in [[ancient Egypt]], [[ziggurats]] of [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] and [[Parthenon]] in Greece, the [[Roman aqueduct]]s, [[Via Appia]] and Colosseum, [[Teotihuacán]], and the [[Brihadeeswarar Temple]] of [[Thanjavur]], among many others, stand as a testament to the ingenuity and skill of ancient civil and military engineers. Other monuments, no longer standing, such as the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] and the [[Pharos of Alexandria]], were important engineering achievements of their time and were considered among the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]].

The six classic [[simple machines]] were known in the [[ancient Near East]]. The [[wedge (mechanical device)|wedge]] and the [[inclined plane]] (ramp) were known since [[prehistoric]] times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moorey |first1=Peter Roger Stuart |title=Ancient Mesopotamian Materials and Industries: The Archaeological Evidence |date=1999 |publisher=[[Eisenbrauns]] |isbn=9781575060422}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[wheel]], along with the [[wheel and axle]] mechanism, was invented in [[Mesopotamia]] (modern Iraq) during the 5th millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East|author=D.T.

Ancient Chinese, Greek, Roman and [[Huns|Hunnic]] armies employed military machines and inventions such as [[artillery]] which was developed by the Greeks around the 4th century BC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/244231/ancient-Greece/261062/Military-technology Britannica on Greek civilization in the 5th century - Military technology] Quote: &quot;The 7th century, by contrast, had witnessed rapid innovations, such as the introduction of the hoplite and the trireme, which still were the basic instruments of war in the 5th.&quot; and &quot;But it was the development of artillery that opened an epoch, and this invention did not predate the 4th century. It was first heard of in the context of Sicilian warfare against Carthage in the time of Dionysius I of Syracuse.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; the [[trireme]], the [[ballista]] and the [[catapult]]. In the Middle Ages, the [[trebuchet]] was developed.

Before the development of modern engineering, mathematics was used by artisans and craftsmen, such as [[millwright]]s, [[clockmaker]]s, instrument makers and surveyors.  Aside from these professions, universities were not believed to have had much practical significance to technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson-Musnon&quot;/&gt;{{rp|32}}

A standard reference for the state of mechanical arts during the Renaissance is given in the mining engineering treatise ''[[De re metallica]]'' (1556), which also contains sections on geology, mining, and chemistry.  ''De re metallica'' was the standard chemistry reference for the next 180 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson-Musnon&quot;/&gt;

[[John Smeaton]] was the first self-proclaimed civil engineer and is often regarded as the &quot;father&quot; of civil engineering. He was an English civil engineer responsible for the design of bridges, canals, harbors, and lighthouses. He was also a capable [[mechanical engineer]] and an eminent [[physicist]]. Using a model water wheel, Smeaton conducted experiments for seven years, determining ways to increase efficiency.&lt;ref name=&quot;University Of Chicago Press&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Powerful Idea in the World: A Story of Steam, Industry and Invention|last1=Rosen|first1= William|year= 2012 |publisher = University of Chicago Press|isbn= 978-0226726342 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|127}}   Smeaton introduced iron axles and gears to water wheels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson-Musnon&quot;/&gt;{{rp|69}} Smeaton also made mechanical improvements to the [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|Newcomen steam engine]]. Smeaton designed the third [[Eddystone Lighthouse]] (1755–59) where he pioneered the use of '[[hydraulic lime]]' (a form of [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] which will set under water) and developed a technique involving dovetailed blocks of granite in the building of the lighthouse. He is important in the history, rediscovery of, and development of modern [[cement]], because he identified the compositional requirements needed to obtain &quot;hydraulicity&quot; in lime; work which led ultimately to the invention of [[Portland cement]].

Applied science lead to the development of the steam engine.  The sequence of events began with the invention the [[barometer]] and the measurement of atmospheric pressure by [[Evangelista Torricelli]] in 1643, demonstration of the force of atmospheric pressure by [[Otto von Guericke]] using the [[Magdeburg hemispheres]] in 1656, laboratory experiments by [[Denis Papin]], who built experimental model steam engines and demonstrated the use of a piston, which he published in 1707.  [[Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester]] published a book of 100 inventions containing a method for raising waters similar to a [[coffee percolator]].  [[Samuel Morland]], a mathematician and inventor who worked on pumps, left notes at the Vauxhall Ordinance Office on a steam pump design that [[Thomas Savery]] read.

The application of steam-powered cast iron blowing cylinders for providing pressurized air for [[blast furnace]]s lead to a large increase in iron production in the late 18th century.  The higher furnace temperatures made possible with steam-powered blast allowed for the use of more lime in [[blast furnace]]s, which enabled the transition from charcoal to [[coke (fuel)|coke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Metallurgy, Second Edition |last=Tylecote |first=R.F. |year=  1992|publisher =Maney Publishing, for the Institute of Materials |location= London|isbn=978-0901462886}}&lt;/ref&gt; These innovations lowered the cost of iron, making [[Wagonway|horse railways]] and iron bridges practical.  The [[Puddling (metallurgy)|puddling process]], patented by [[Henry Cort]] in 1784 produced large scale quantities of wrought iron.  [[Hot blast]], patented by [[James Beaumont Neilson]] in 1828, greatly lowered the amount of fuel needed to smelt iron.  With the development of the high pressure steam engine, the power to weight ratio of steam engines made practical steamboats and locomotives possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930, Vol. 2: Steam Power |last1=Hunter |first1= Louis C.|year=1985 |ref=harv| publisher =University Press of Virginia|location= Charolttesville}}&lt;/ref&gt; New steel making processes, such as the [[Bessemer process]] and the open hearth furnace, ushered in an area of heavy engineering in the late 19th century.

One of the most famous engineers of the mid 19th century was [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], who built railroads, dockyards and steamships.

The [[Industrial Revolution]] created a demand for machinery with metal parts, which led to the development of several [[machine tools]]. Boring cast iron cylinders with precision was not possible until [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] invented his [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)#Boring machine for steam engines|boring machine]], which is considered the first [[machine tool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Roe | first = Joseph Wickham | title = English and American Tool Builders | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1916 | location = New Haven, Connecticut | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage | lccn = 16011753}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other machine tools included the [[screw cutting lathe]], [[milling machine]], [[turret lathe]] and the [[Planer (metalworking)|metal planer]].  Precision machining techniques were developed in the first half of the 19th century.  These included the use of gigs to guide the machining tool over the work and fixtures to hold the work in the proper position.  Machine tools and machining techniques capable of producing [[interchangeable parts]] lead to [[Mass production|large scale factory production]] by the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundations of [[electrical engineering]] in the 1800s included the experiments of [[Alessandro Volta]], [[Michael Faraday]], [[Georg Ohm]] and others and the invention of the [[electrical telegraph|electric telegraph]] in 1816 and the [[electric motor]] in 1872. The theoretical work of [[James Clerk Maxwell|James Maxwell]] (see: [[Maxwell's equations]]) and [[Heinrich Hertz]] in the late 19th century gave rise to the field of [[electronics]]. The later inventions of the [[vacuum tube]] and the [[transistor]] further accelerated the development of electronics to such an extent that electrical and electronics engineers currently outnumber their colleagues of any other engineering specialty.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECPD Definition on Britannica&quot;/&gt;
[[Chemical engineering]] developed in the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECPD Definition on Britannica&quot;/&gt; Industrial scale manufacturing demanded new materials and new processes and by 1880 the need for large scale production of chemicals was such that a new industry was created, dedicated to the development and large scale manufacturing of chemicals in new industrial plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECPD Definition on Britannica&quot;/&gt; The role of the chemical engineer was the design of these chemical plants and processes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECPD Definition on Britannica&quot;/&gt;

Aeronautical engineering deals with [[aircraft design process]] design while [[aerospace engineering]] is a more modern term that expands the reach of the discipline by including [[spacecraft]] design. Its origins can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the start of the 20th century although the work of [[Sir George Cayley]] has recently been dated as being from the last decade of the 18th century. Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering.&lt;ref name=&quot;americana&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | author = Van Every, Kermit E. | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia Americana | title = Aeronautical engineering| edition =| year = 1986| publisher = Grolier Incorporated| volume =1| pages = 226 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in engineering (technically, ''applied science and engineering'') awarded in the United States went to [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] at [[Yale University]] in 1863; it was also the second PhD awarded in science in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;

Engineering is a broad discipline that is often broken down into several sub-disciplines. Although an engineer will usually be trained in a specific discipline, he or she may become multi-disciplined through experience. Engineering is often characterized as having four main branches:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hy9WAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=In+most+universities+it+should+be+possible+to+cover+the+main+branches+of+engineering,+ie+civil,+mechanical,+electrical+and+chemical+engineering+in+this+way.&amp;dq=In+most+universities+it+should+be+possible+to+cover+the+main+branches+of+engineering,+ie+civil,+mechanical,+electrical+and+chemical+engineering+in+this+way.&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2UkYTff0MZL-ngfesbGMDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA Journal of the British Nuclear Energy Society: Volume 1 British Nuclear Energy Society – 1962 – Snippet view] Quote: In most universities it should be possible to cover the main branches of engineering, i.e. civil, mechanical, electrical and chemical engineering in this way.

===Chemical engineering===
{{Main|Chemical engineering}}
Chemical engineering is the application of physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering principles in order to carry out chemical processes on a commercial scale, such as the manufacture of [[commodity chemicals]], [[specialty chemicals]], [[Oil refinery|petroleum refining]], [[microfabrication]], [[fermentation]], and [[Biotechnology|biomolecule production]].

===Civil engineering===
{{Main|Civil engineering}}
Civil engineering is the design and construction of public and private works, such as [[infrastructure]] (airports, roads, railways, water supply, and treatment etc.), bridges, tunnels, dams, and buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History and Heritage of Civil Engineering |work=[[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]] |url=http://live.asce.org/hh/index.mxml?versionChecked=true |accessdate=August 8, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216235716/http://live.asce.org/hh/index.mxml?versionChecked=true |archivedate=February 16, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ice.org.uk/careers-and-professional-development/what-is-civil-engineering|title=What is Civil Engineering|publisher=[[Institution of Civil Engineers]]|accessdate=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines, including [[structural engineering]], [[environmental engineering]], and [[surveying]]. It is traditionally considered to be separate from [[military engineering]].&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia Britannica|url =https://www.britannica.com/technology/civil-engineering|title = Civil Engineering|last = Watson|first = J. Garth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrical engineering===
{{Main|Electrical engineering}}
[[File:Rotterdam_Ahoy_Europort_2011_(14).JPG|thumb|[[Electric motor]]]]
Electrical engineering is the design, study, and manufacture of various electrical and electronic systems, such as [[Broadcast engineering]], [[electrical circuit]]s, [[Electrical generator|generators]], [[Electric motor|motors]], [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]]/[[electromechanical]] devices, [[electronic devices]], [[electronic circuits]], [[optical fiber]]s, [[optoelectronic device]]s, [[computer]] systems, [[telecommunications]], instrumentation, controls, and [[electronics]].

===Mechanical engineering===
{{Main|Mechanical engineering}}
Mechanical engineering is the design and manufacture of physical or mechanical systems, such as power and [[energy]] systems, [[aerospace]]/[[aircraft]] products, [[weapon systems]], [[transportation]] products, [[Internal combustion engine|engines]], [[gas compressor|compressors]], [[powertrain]]s, [[kinematic chain]]s, vacuum technology, [[vibration isolation]] equipment, [[manufacturing]], robotics, turbines, audio equipments, and [[mechatronics]].

===Interdisciplinary engineering===
{{Main|List of engineering branches}}
Interdisciplinary engineering draws from more than one of the principle branches of the practice.  Historically, [[naval architecture|naval engineering]] and [[mining engineering]] were major branches.  Other engineering fields are [[manufacturing engineering]], [[acoustical engineering]], [[corrosion engineering]], [[instrumentation and control]], [[Aerospace engineering|aerospace]], [[Automotive engineering|automotive]], [[computer engineering|computer]], [[electronic engineering|electronic]], [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]], [[petroleum engineering|petroleum]], [[Environmental engineering|environmental]], [[systems engineering|systems]], [[audio engineering|audio]], [[software engineering|software]], [[architectural engineering|architectural]], [[agricultural engineering|agricultural]], [[biosystems engineering|biosystems]], [[biomedical engineering|biomedical]],&lt;ref&gt;Bronzino JD, ed., The Biomedical Engineering Handbook, CRC Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8493-2121-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geological engineering|geological]], [[Textile manufacturing|textile]], [[industrial engineering|industrial]], [[materials science|materials]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bensaude-Vincent|first1=Bernadette|title=The construction of a discipline: Materials science in the United States|journal=Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences|date=March 2001|volume=31|issue=2|pages=223–48|doi=10.1525/hsps.2001.31.2.223}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[nuclear engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.careercornerstone.org/pdf/nuclear/nuceng.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929162436/http://www.careercornerstone.org/pdf/nuclear/nuceng.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These and other branches of engineering are represented in the 36 licensed member institutions of the UK [[Engineering Council]].

New specialties sometimes combine with the traditional fields and form new branches – for example, [[Earth systems engineering and management]] involves a wide range of subject areas including [[engineering studies]], [[environmental science]], [[engineering ethics]] and [[philosophy of engineering]].

== Other branches of engineering ==

=== Aerospace engineering ===
{{Main|Aerospace engineering}}
Aerospace engineering studies design, manufacture aircraft, satellites, rockets, helicopters, and so on. It closely studies the pressure difference and aerodynamics of a vehicle to ensure safety and efficiency. Since most of the studies are related to fluids, it is applied to any moving vehicle, such as cars.

=== Marine engineering ===
{{Main|Marine engineering}}
Marine engineering is associated with anything on or near the ocean. Examples are, but not limited to, ships, submarines, oil rigs, structure, watercraft propulsion, on-board design and development, plants, harbors, and so on. It requires a combined knowledge in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering,and some programming abilities.

==Practice==
One who practices engineering is called an [[engineer]], and those licensed to do so may have more formal designations such as [[Professional Engineer]], [[Chartered Engineer]], [[Incorporated Engineer]], [[Ingenieur]], [[European Engineer]], or [[Federal Aviation Administration#Designated Engineering Representative (DER)|Designated Engineering Representative]].

==Methodology==
[[File:Dampfturbine Montage01.jpg|thumb|upright|Design of a [[turbine]] requires collaboration of engineers from many fields, as the system involves mechanical, electro-magnetic and chemical processes. The [[turbine blade|blades]], [[stator|rotor and stator]] as well as the [[steam cycle]] all need to be carefully designed and optimized.]]

In the [[engineering design]] process, engineers apply mathematics and sciences such as physics to find novel solutions to problems or to improve existing solutions. Engineers need proficient knowledge of relevant sciences for their design projects. As a result, many engineers continue to learn new material throughout their career.

If multiple solutions exist, engineers weigh each design choice based on their merit and choose the solution that best matches the requirements. The task of the engineer is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to yield a successful result. It is generally insufficient to build a technically successful product, rather, it must also meet further requirements.

Constraints may include available resources, physical, imaginative or technical limitations, flexibility for future modifications and additions, and other factors, such as requirements for cost, [[Safety engineering|safety]], marketability, productivity, and [[Serviceability (computer)|serviceability]]. By understanding the constraints, engineers derive [[specifications]] for the limits within which a viable object or system may be produced and operated.

===Problem solving===
[[File:Booster-Layout.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|A drawing for a booster engine for [[steam locomotive]]s. Engineering is applied to [[design]], with emphasis on function and the utilization of mathematics and science.]]
Engineers use their knowledge of [[science]], [[mathematics]], [[logic]], [[economics]], and [[empirical knowledge|appropriate experience]] or [[tacit knowledge]] to find suitable solutions to a problem. Creating an appropriate [[mathematical model]] of a problem often allows them to analyze it (sometimes definitively), and to test potential solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.livescience.com/47499-what-is-engineering.html|title=What is Engineering? {{!}} Types of Engineering|last=Nature|first=Jim Lucas 2014-08-22T00:44:14Z Human|website=livescience.com|language=en|access-date=September 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, multiple reasonable solutions exist, so engineers must evaluate the different [[design choice]]s on their merits and choose the solution that best meets their requirements. [[Genrich Altshuller]], after gathering statistics on a large number of [[patent]]s, suggested that [[compromise]]s are at the heart of &quot;[[level of invention|low-level]]&quot; engineering designs, while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theoriesaboutengineering.org/genrich_altshuller.html|title=Theories About Engineering – Genrich Altshuller|website=theoriesaboutengineering.org|access-date=September 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to full-scale production. They use, among other things: [[prototype]]s, [[scale model]]s, [[simulation]]s, [[destructive testing|destructive tests]], [[nondestructive testing|nondestructive tests]], and [[stress testing|stress tests]]. Testing ensures that products will perform as expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/engineering-design-process/engineering-design-compare-scientific-method|title=Comparing the Engineering Design Process and the Scientific Method|website=Science Buddies|language=en-US|access-date=September 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineers take on the responsibility of producing designs that will perform as well as expected and will not cause unintended harm to the public at large. Engineers typically include a [[factor of safety]] in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure.

The study of failed products is known as [[forensic engineering]] and can help the [[product design]]er in evaluating his or her design in the light of real conditions. The discipline is of greatest value after disasters, such as [[bridge collapse]]s, when careful analysis is needed to establish the cause or causes of the failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asce.org/forensic-engineering/forensic-engineering/|title=Forensic Engineering {{!}} ASCE|website=www.asce.org|access-date=September 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer use===
[[File:CFD Shuttle.jpg|thumb|left|A computer simulation of high velocity air flow around a [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] during re-entry. Solutions to the flow require [[Finite element method|modelling]] of the combined effects of [[Navier–Stokes equations|fluid flow]] and the [[heat equation]]s.]]

As with all modern scientific and technological endeavors, computers and software play an increasingly important role. As well as the typical business [[application software]] there are a number of computer aided applications ([[computer-aided technologies]]) specifically for engineering. Computers can be used to generate models of fundamental physical processes, which can be solved using [[numerical method]]s.

[[File:WorldWideWebAroundWikipedia.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Graphic representation of a minute fraction of the WWW, demonstrating [[hyperlink]]s]]
One of the most widely used [[design tool]]s in the profession is [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) software.  It enables engineers to create 3D models, 2D drawings, and schematics of their designs. CAD together with [[digital mockup]] (DMU) and [[Computer-aided engineering|CAE]] software such as [[Finite element method|finite element method analysis]] or [[analytic element method]] allows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes.

These allow products and components to be checked for flaws; assess fit and assembly; study ergonomics; and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses, temperatures, electromagnetic emissions, electrical currents and voltages, digital logic levels, fluid flows, and kinematics. Access and distribution of all this information is generally organized with the use of [[product data management]] software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The engineering profession engages in a wide range of activities, from large collaboration at the societal level, and also smaller individual projects.  Almost all engineering projects are obligated to some sort of financing agency: a company, a set of investors, or a government.  The few types of engineering that are minimally constrained by such issues are ''[[pro bono]]'' engineering and [[open design|open-design]] engineering.

By its very nature engineering has interconnections with society, culture and human behavior.  Every product or construction used by modern society is influenced by engineering. The results of engineering activity influence changes to the environment, society and economies, and its application brings with it a responsibility and public safety.

Engineering projects can be subject to controversy. Examples from different engineering disciplines include the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s, the [[Three Gorges Dam]], the design and use of [[sport utility vehicle]]s and the extraction of [[Fuel oil|oil]]. In response, some western engineering companies have enacted serious [[Corporate social responsibility|corporate and social responsibility]] policies.

Engineering is a key driver of innovation and human development. Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, has a very small engineering capacity which results in many African nations being unable to develop crucial infrastructure without outside aid.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The attainment of many of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] requires the achievement of sufficient engineering capacity to develop infrastructure and sustainable technological development.&lt;ref name=&quot;MDG&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.sistech.co.uk/media/ICEBrunelLecture2006.pdf?Docu_id=1420&amp;faculty=14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006054029/http://www.sistech.co.uk/media/ICEBrunelLecture2006.pdf?Docu_id=1420&amp;faculty=14 |archivedate=October 6, 2006|url-status=dead|title = Engineering Civilisation from the Shadows|last = Jowitt|first = Paul W.|date = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All overseas development and relief NGOs make considerable use of engineers to apply solutions in disaster and development scenarios. A number of charitable organizations aim to use engineering directly for the good of mankind:
* [[Engineers Without Borders]]
* [[Engineers Against Poverty]]
* Registered Engineers for Disaster Relief
* [[Engineers for a Sustainable World]]
* [[Engineering for Change]]
* Engineering Ministries International&lt;ref name=&quot;EMI&quot;&gt;[http://www.emiusa.org/index.html Home page for EMI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414014038/http://emiusa.org/index.html |date=April 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineering companies in many established economies are facing significant challenges with regard to the number of professional engineers being trained, compared with the number retiring.  This problem is very prominent in the UK where engineering has a poor image and low status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringuk.com/About_us/|title=engineeringuk.com/About_us|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530210132/http://www.engineeringuk.com/About_us/|archivedate=May 30, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many negative economic and political issues that this can cause, as well as ethical issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/policy/why-does-it-matter-why-are-engineering-skills-important |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 19, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140619142335/http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/policy/why-does-it-matter-why-are-engineering-skills-important |archivedate=June 19, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely agreed that the engineering profession faces an &quot;image crisis&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/the-era-foundation-report.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 19, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006103241/http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/the-era-foundation-report.html |archivedate=October 6, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than it being fundamentally an unattractive career.  Much work is needed to avoid huge problems in the UK and other western economies.

===Code of ethics===
{{Main|Engineering ethics}}
Many [[Engineering society|engineering societies]] have established codes of practice and [[engineering ethics|codes of ethics]] to guide members and inform the public at large.  The [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] code of ethics states:
{{quote| Engineering is an important and learned profession. As members of this profession, engineers are expected to exhibit the highest standards of honesty and integrity. Engineering has a direct and vital impact on the quality of life for all people. Accordingly, the services provided by engineers require honesty, impartiality, fairness, and equity, and must be dedicated to the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare.

There exists an overlap between the sciences and engineering practice; in engineering, one applies science. Both areas of endeavor rely on accurate observation of materials and phenomena.  Both use mathematics and classification criteria to analyze and communicate observations.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Scientists may also have to complete engineering tasks, such as designing experimental apparatus or building prototypes. Conversely, in the process of developing technology engineers sometimes find themselves exploring new phenomena, thus becoming, for the moment, scientists or more precisely &quot;engineering scientists&quot;.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

First, it often deals with areas in which the basic [[physics]] or [[chemistry]] are well understood, but the problems themselves are too complex to solve in an exact manner.

An example of this is the use of numerical approximations to the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] to describe aerodynamic flow over an aircraft, or the use of the [[Finite element method]] to calculate the stresses in complex components. Second, engineering research employs many semi-[[empirical methods]] that are foreign to pure scientific research, one example being the method of parameter variation.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

As stated by Fung ''et al.'' in the revision to the classic engineering text ''Foundations of Solid Mechanics'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Engineering is quite different from science. Scientists try to understand nature. Engineers try to make things that do not exist in nature. Engineers stress innovation and invention. To embody an invention the engineer must put his idea in concrete terms, and design something that people can use. That something can be a complex system, device, a gadget, a material, a method, a computing program, an innovative experiment, a new solution to a problem, or an improvement on what already exists. Since a design has to be realistic and functional, it must have its geometry, dimensions, and characteristics data defined.  In the past engineers working on new designs found that they did not have all the required information to make design decisions. Most often, they were limited by insufficient scientific knowledge. Thus they studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and mechanics. Often they had to add to the sciences relevant to their profession. Thus engineering sciences were born.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fung&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Classical and Computational Solid Mechanics, YC Fung and P. Tong|publisher=World Scientific|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although engineering solutions make use of scientific principles, engineers must also take into account safety, efficiency, economy, reliability, and constructability or ease of fabrication as well as the environment, ethical and legal considerations such as patent infringement or liability in the case of failure of the solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/code-ethics|title=Code of Ethics {{!}} National Society of Professional Engineers|website=www.nspe.org|access-date=September 10, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine and biology===
[[File:Modern_3T_MRI.JPG|thumb|left|250px|A 3 tesla clinical [[MRI scanner]].]]
The study of the human body, albeit from different directions and for different purposes, is an important common link between medicine and some engineering disciplines. [[Medicine]] aims to sustain, repair, enhance and even replace functions of the [[human body]], if necessary, through the use of [[technology]].

[[File:GFP Mice 01.jpg|thumb|right|Genetically engineered mice expressing [[green fluorescent protein]], which glows green under blue light. The central mouse is [[wild-type]].]]
Modern medicine can replace several of the body's functions through the use of artificial organs and can significantly alter the function of the human body through artificial devices such as, for example, [[brain implant]]s and [[Artificial pacemaker|pacemakers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Boston U&quot;&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Bioe/BioeMcGe.htm Ethical Assessment of Implantable Brain Chips. Ellen M. McGee and G.Q. Maguire, Jr. from Boston University]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IEEE foreign parts&quot;&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/2188/27125/01204814.pdf?arnumber=1204814 IEEE technical paper: Foreign parts (electronic body implants).by Evans-Pughe, C. quote from summary: Feeling threatened by cyborgs?]&lt;/ref&gt; The fields of [[bionics]] and medical bionics are dedicated to the study of synthetic implants pertaining to natural systems.

Conversely, some engineering disciplines view the human body as a biological machine worth studying and are dedicated to emulating many of its functions by replacing [[biology]] with technology. This has led to fields such as [[artificial intelligence]], [[neural networks]], [[fuzzy logic]], and [[robot]]ics.  There are also substantial interdisciplinary interactions between engineering and medicine.&lt;ref name=&quot;IME&quot;&gt;[http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/ime/mission.html Institute of Medicine and Engineering: Mission statement The mission of the Institute for Medicine and Engineering (IME) is to stimulate fundamental research at the interface between biomedicine and engineering/physical/computational sciences leading to innovative applications in biomedical research and clinical practice.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317145554/http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/ime/mission.html |date=March 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IEEE&quot;&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=51 IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology: Both general and technical articles on current technologies and methods used in biomedical and clinical engineering&amp;nbsp;...]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both fields provide solutions to real world problems. This often requires moving forward before phenomena are completely understood in a more rigorous scientific sense and therefore experimentation and empirical knowledge is an integral part of both.

Medicine, in part, studies the function of the human body. The human body, as a biological machine, has many functions that can be modeled using engineering methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal Academy&quot;&gt;[http://www.acmedsci.ac.uk/images/pressRelease/1170256174.pdf Royal Academy of Engineering and Academy of Medical Sciences: Systems Biology: a vision for engineering and medicine in pdf: quote1: Systems Biology is an emerging methodology that has yet to be defined quote2: It applies the concepts of systems engineering to the study of complex biological systems through iteration between computational or mathematical modelling and experimentation.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410011033/http://www.acmedsci.ac.uk/images/pressRelease/1170256174.pdf |date=April 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newly emerging branches of science, such as [[systems biology]], are adapting analytical tools traditionally used for engineering, such as systems modeling and computational analysis, to the description of biological systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal Academy&quot;/&gt;

===Art===
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci - presumed self-portrait - WGA12798.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonardo da Vinci]], seen here in a self-portrait, has been described as the epitome of the artist/engineer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bjerklie, David&quot;/&gt; He is also known for his studies on [[human anatomy]] and [[physiology]].]]

Among famous historical figures, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] is a well-known [[Renaissance]] artist and engineer, and a prime example of the nexus between art and engineering.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bjerklie, David&quot;&gt;Bjerklie, David.  &quot;The Art of Renaissance Engineering.&quot;  ''MIT's Technology Review'' Jan./Feb.1998: 54–59.  Article explores the concept of the &quot;artist-engineer&quot;, an individual who used his artistic talent in engineering. Quote from article: Da Vinci reached the pinnacle of &quot;artist-engineer&quot;-dom, Quote2: &quot;It was Leonardo da Vinci who initiated the most ambitious expansion in the role of artist-engineer, progressing from astute observer to inventor to theoretician.&quot; (Bjerklie 58)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Drew U&quot;&gt;[http://www.users.drew.edu/~ejustin/leonardo.htm Drew U: user website: cites Bjerklie paper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419194433/http://www.users.drew.edu/~ejustin/leonardo.htm |date=April 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business===

[[Business Engineering]] deals with the relationship between professional engineering, IT systems, business administration and [[change management]]. [[Engineering management]] or &quot;Management engineering&quot; is a specialized field of [[management]] concerned with engineering practice or the engineering industry sector.  The demand for management-focused engineers (or from the opposite perspective, managers with an understanding of engineering), has resulted in the development of specialized engineering management degrees that develop the knowledge and skills needed for these roles. During an engineering management course, students will develop [[industrial engineering]] skills, knowledge, and expertise, alongside knowledge of business administration, management techniques, and strategic thinking.  Engineers specializing in change management must have in-depth knowledge of the application of [[industrial and organizational psychology]] principles and methods.  Professional engineers often train as [[certified management consultant]]s in the very specialized field of [[management consulting]] applied to engineering practice or the engineering sector.  This work often deals with large scale complex [[business transformation]] or [[Business process management]] initiatives in aerospace and defence, automotive, oil and gas, machinery, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, electrical &amp; electronics, power distribution &amp; generation, utilities and transportation systems.  This combination of technical engineering practice, management consulting practice, industry sector knowledge, and change management expertise enables professional engineers who are also qualified as management consultants to lead major business transformation initiatives. These initiatives are typically sponsored by C-level executives.

===Other fields===
In [[political science]], the term ''engineering'' has been borrowed for the study of the subjects of [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] and [[political engineering]], which deal with forming [[political structure|political]] and [[social structure]]s using engineering methodology coupled with [[political science]] principles. [[Financial engineering]] has similarly borrowed the term.
