[[File:Ether-(general).png|thumb|150px|The general structure of an ether.  R and R' represent any [[alkyl]] or [[aryl]] [[substituent]].]]

'''Ethers''' are a class of [[organic compound]]s that contain an ether [[functional group|group]]—an [[oxygen]] [[atom]] connected to two [[alkyl]] or [[aryl]] groups.  They have the general formula R–O–R′, where R and R′ represent the alkyl or aryl groups. Ethers can again be classified into two varieties: if the alkyl groups are the same on both sides of the [[oxygen]] atom, then it is a simple or symmetrical ether, whereas if they are different, the ethers are called mixed or unsymmetrical ethers.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=ethers|file=E02221}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical example of the first group is the [[solvent]] and [[anesthetic]] [[diethyl ether]], commonly referred to simply as &quot;ether&quot; ({{nobr|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–O–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}). Ethers are common in organic chemistry and even more prevalent in biochemistry, as they are common linkages in [[carbohydrate]]s and [[lignin]].

==Structure and bonding==
Ethers feature C–O–C linkage defined by a [[Molecular geometry#Bonding|bond angle]] of about 110° and C–O distances of about 140&amp;nbsp;[[Picometre|pm]]. The barrier to rotation about the C–O bonds is low.  The bonding of oxygen in ethers, alcohols, and water is similar. In the language of [[valence bond theory]], the hybridization at oxygen is sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Oxygen is more [[Electronegativity|electronegative]] than carbon, thus the hydrogens alpha to ethers are more acidic than in simple hydrocarbons. They are far less acidic than hydrogens alpha to carbonyl groups (such as in [[ketones]] or [[aldehydes]]), however.

:Depending on the groups at R and R′, ethers are classified into two types:

# Simple ethers or symmetrical ethers; e.g., [[diethyl ether]], [[dimethyl ether]], [[dipropyl ether]] etc.
# Mixed ethers or asymmetrical ethers; e.g., [[methoxyethane|ethyl methyl ether]], [[Methoxybenzene|methyl phenyl ether]], etc.

==Nomenclature==
In the [[IUPAC nomenclature]] system, ethers are named using the general formula ''&quot;alkoxyalkane&quot;'', for example CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–O–CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is [[methoxyethane]]. If the ether is part of a more-complex molecule, it is described as an alkoxy substituent, so –OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; would be considered a ''&quot;[[methoxy]]-&quot;'' group. The simpler [[alkyl]] radical is written in front, so CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;–O–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; would be given as ''methoxy''(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O)''ethane''(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

===Trivial name===
IUPAC rules are often not followed for simple ethers. The trivial names for simple ethers (i.e., those with none or few other functional groups) are a composite of the two substituents followed by &quot;ether&quot;.  For example, ethyl methyl ether (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), diphenylether (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;). As for other organic compounds, very common ethers acquired names before rules for nomenclature were formalized. Diethyl ether is simply called &quot;ether&quot;, but was once called ''sweet oil of vitriol''. Methyl phenyl ether is [[anisole]], because it was originally found in [[aniseed]]. The [[aromatic]] ethers include [[furan]]s. [[Acetal]]s (α-alkoxy ethers R–CH(–OR)–O–R) are another class of ethers with characteristic properties.

===Polyethers===
Polyethers are compounds with more than one ether group. These have been used as impression materials in dentistry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dental Materials- : Properties and Manipulation|last=Powers, John M.|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780323291507|oclc=912232266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[crown ether]]s are examples of small polyethers. Some toxins produced by [[dinoflagellate]]s such as [[brevetoxin]] and [[ciguatoxin]] are extremely large and are known as ''cyclic'' or ''ladder'' polyethers.

Polyether generally refers to [[polymer]]s which contain the ether functional group in their main chain. The term [[polyol|glycol]] is reserved for low to medium range [[molar mass]] polymer when the nature of the [[end-group]], which is usually a [[hydroxyl]] group, still matters. The term &quot;oxide&quot; or other terms are used for high molar mass polymer when end-groups no longer affect polymer properties.

The phenyl ether polymers are a class of [[aromatic compound|aromatic]] polyethers containing aromatic cycles in their main chain: [[Polyphenyl ether]] (PPE) and [[Poly(p-phenylene oxide)|Poly(''p''-phenylene oxide)]] (PPO).

===Related compounds===
Many classes of compounds with C–O–C linkages are not considered ethers: [[Ester]]s (R–C(=O)–O–R′), [[hemiacetal]]s (R–CH(–OH)–O–R′), [[carboxylic acid anhydride]]s (RC(=O)–O–C(=O)R′).

==Physical properties==
Ether [[molecule]]s cannot form [[hydrogen bond]]s with each other, resulting in relatively low [[boiling point]]s compared to those of the analogous [[alcohol]]s. The difference in the boiling points of the ethers and their isomeric alcohols becomes lower as the carbon chains become longer, as the [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals]] interactions of the extended carbon chain dominates over the presence of hydrogen bonding.

Ethers are slightly polar. The C–O–C bond angle in the functional group is about 110°, and the C–O dipoles do not cancel out. Ethers are more polar than alkenes but not as polar as alcohols, esters, or [[amide]]s of comparable structure. The presence of two lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atoms makes hydrogen bonding with water molecules possible.

Cyclic ethers such as [[tetrahydrofuran]] and [[1,4-dioxane]] are miscible in water because of the more exposed oxygen atom for hydrogen bonding as compared to linear [[aliphatic]] ethers.

Other properties are:

* The lower ethers are highly volatile and flammable.
* Lower ethers also act as [[anaesthetics]].
* Ethers are good organic solvents.
* Simple ethers (such as diethyl ether) are tasteless.

==Reactions== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Organic reaction]] --&gt;
[[Image:Diethylether peroxide chemical structure.png|frame|Structure of the polymeric [[diethyl ether peroxide]]]]
Ethers are quite stable [[chemical compound]]s which do not react with [[base (chemistry)|base]]s, [[reactivity (chemistry)|active]] [[metal]]s, [[concentration|dilute]] [[acid]]s, [[oxidising agent]]s, and [[reducing agent]]s. Generally, they are of low chemical [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]], but they are more reactive than [[alkanes]]. [[Epoxide]]s, [[ketal]]s, and [[acetal]]s are unrepresentative classes of ethers and are discussed in separate articles.  Important reactions are listed below.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Wilhelm Heitmann, Günther Strehlke, Dieter Mayer &quot;Ethers, Aliphatic&quot; in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'' Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a10_023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ether cleavage===
{{see also|Ether cleavage}}

Although ethers resist hydrolysis, their polar bonds are cloven by mineral acids such as hydrobromic acid and [[hydroiodic acid]]. [[Hydrogen chloride]] cleaves ethers only slowly. Methyl ethers typically afford methyl halides:
:ROCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  HBr   →   CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br  +  ROH
These reactions proceed via [[onium compounds|onium]] intermediates, i.e. [RO(H)CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.

Some ethers undergo rapid cleavage with [[boron tribromide]] (even [[aluminium chloride]] is used in some cases) to give the alkyl bromide.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth|author = J. F. W. McOmie and D. E. West|title = 3,3′-Dihydroxylbiphenyl|collvol = 5|collvolpages = 412|year = 1973|prep = CV5P0412}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the substituents, some ethers can be cloven with a variety of reagents, e.g. strong base.

===Peroxide formation===
When stored in the presence of air or oxygen, ethers tend to form [[Explosive material|explosive]] [[organic peroxide|peroxides]], such as [[diethyl ether peroxide]]. The reaction is accelerated by light, metal catalysts, and [[aldehyde]]s. In addition to avoiding storage conditions likely to form peroxides, it is recommended, when an ether is used as a solvent, not to distill it to dryness, as any peroxides that may have formed, being less volatile than the original ether, will become concentrated in the last few drops of liquid.  The presence of peroxide in old samples of ethers may be detected by shaking them with freshly prepared solution of a FeSO4 followed by addition of KSCN.  Appearance of blood red color indicates presence of peroxides.

===Lewis bases===
Ethers serve as [[Lewis base]]s and Bronsted bases. Strong acids protonate the oxygen to give &quot;oxonium ions&quot;. For instance, diethyl ether forms a complex with [[boron trifluoride]], i.e. diethyl etherate (BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Ethers also coordinate to the [[magnesium|Mg]](II) center in [[Grignard reagent]]s.

===Alpha-halogenation===
This reactivity is similar to the tendency of ethers with alpha hydrogen atoms to form peroxides. Reaction with chlorine produces alpha-chloroethers.

==Synthesis==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Organic reaction]]--&gt;
Ethers can be prepared by numerous routes. In general alkyl ethers form more readily than aryl ethers, with the later species often requiring metal catalysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frlan |first1=Rok |last2=Kikelj |first2=Danijel |title=Recent Progress in Diaryl Ether Synthesis |journal=Synthesis |date=29 June 2006 |volume=2006 |issue=14 |pages=2271–2285 |doi=10.1055/s-2006-942440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The synthesis of diethyl ether by a reaction between [[ethanol]] and [[sulfuric acid]] has been known since the 13th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Ether|volume=9|page=806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dehydration of alcohols===
The [[dehydration reaction|dehydration]] of [[alcohol]]s affords ethers:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Organic chemistry |last1=Clayden |last2=Greeves |last3=Warren |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-850346-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/organicchemistry00clay_0/page/129 129] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/organicchemistry00clay_0/page/129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: 2 R–OH → R–O–R + [[Water (molecule)|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] at high temperature

[[Image:Symm2.svg|507px|center]]

This direct nucleophilic substitution reaction requires elevated temperatures (about 125&amp;nbsp;°C). The reaction is catalyzed by acids, usually sulfuric acid. The method is effective for generating symmetrical ethers, but not unsymmetrical ethers, since either OH can be protonated, which would give a mixture of products. Diethyl ether is produced from ethanol by this method. Cyclic ethers are readily generated by this approach. Elimination reactions compete with dehydration of the alcohol:
: R–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH) → R–CH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The dehydration route often requires conditions incompatible with delicate molecules. Several milder methods exist to produce ethers.

===Williamson ether synthesis===
[[Nucleophilic displacement]] of [[alkyl halide]]s by [[alkoxide]]s
: R–ONa + R′–X   →   R–O–R′ + Na[[Halide|X]]
This reaction is called the [[Williamson ether synthesis]]. It involves treatment of a parent [[alcohol]] with a strong [[Base (chemistry)|base]] to form the alkoxide, followed by addition of an appropriate aliphatic compound bearing a suitable [[leaving group]] (R–X). Suitable leaving groups (X) include [[iodide]], [[bromide]], or [[sulfonate]]s. This method usually does not work well for aryl halides (e.g. [[bromobenzene]], see Ullmann condensation below). Likewise, this method only gives the best yields for primary halides. Secondary and tertiary halides are prone to undergo E2 elimination on exposure to the basic alkoxide anion used in the reaction due to steric hindrance from the large alkyl groups.

In a related reaction, alkyl halides undergo nucleophilic displacement by [[phenoxide]]s. The R–X cannot be used to react with the alcohol. However [[phenols]] can be used to replace the alcohol while maintaining the alkyl halide. Since phenols are acidic, they readily react with a strong [[Base (chemistry)|base]] like [[sodium hydroxide]] to form phenoxide ions. The phenoxide ion will then substitute the –X group in the alkyl halide, forming an ether with an aryl group attached to it in a reaction with an [[SN2|S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2]] mechanism.

: C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;–O&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

: C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;–O&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + R–X   →   C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OR

===Ullmann condensation===
The [[Ullmann condensation]] is similar to the Williamson method except that the substrate is an aryl halide.  Such reactions generally require a catalyst, such as copper.

===Electrophilic addition of alcohols to alkenes===
Alcohols add to electrophilically activated [[alkene]]s.
: [[alkene|R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=CR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + R–OH → R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH–C(–O–R)–R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
[[Acid]] [[catalysis]] is required for this reaction. Often, mercury trifluoroacetate (Hg(OCOCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is used as a catalyst for the reaction generating an ether with [[Markovnikov]] regiochemistry.  Using similar reactions, [[tetrahydropyranyl ether]]s are used as [[protective group]]s for alcohols.

===Preparation of epoxides===
{{main|epoxide}}
[[Epoxide]]s are typically prepared by oxidation of alkenes.  The most important epoxide in terms of industrial scale is ethylene oxide, which is produced by oxidation of ethylene with oxygen.  Other epoxides are produced by one of two routes:
* By the oxidation of alkenes with a [[peroxyacid]] such as [[Meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid|''m''-CPBA]].
* By the base intramolecular nucleophilic substitution of a halohydrin.
