Starting from the late 18th century, settlements on and around the English Channel coastline in England grew rapidly into thriving [[seaside resort]]s, bolstered by their association with royalty and the middle and upper classes.]]
Known colloquially to the English as the ‘Narrow Sea’, until the 18th century, the English Channel had no fixed name either in English or in French. It was never defined as a political border, and the names were more or less descriptive. It was not considered as the property of a nation. Before the development of the modern nations, British scholars very often referred to it as &quot;Gaulish&quot; (''Gallicum'' in Latin) and French scholars as &quot;British&quot; or &quot;English&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;MORIEUX&lt;/ref&gt; The name &quot;English Channel&quot; has been widely used since the early 18th century, possibly originating from the designation {{lang|nl|Engelse Kanaal}} in Dutch sea maps from the 16th century onwards. In modern Dutch, however, it is known as {{lang|nl|Het Kanaal}} (with no reference to the word &quot;English&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It was called {{lang|la|Oceanus Britannicus}} by the 2nd-century geographer [[Ptolemy]]. The same name is used on an Italian map of about 1450, which gives the alternative name of {{lang|it|canalites Anglie}}—possibly the first recorded use of the &quot;Channel&quot; designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/unvbrit/m/001hrl000003686u00013000.html |title=Map Of Great Britain, Ca. 1450 |date=26 March 2009 |work=The unveiling of Britain |publisher=[[British Library]] |accessdate=1 November 2013 |quote=This may also be the first map to name the English Channel: &quot;britanicus oceanus nunc canalites Anglie&quot; |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103183346/http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/unvbrit/m/001hrl000003686u00013000.html |archive-date=3 November 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anglo-Saxon texts often call it ''Sūð-sǣ'' (&quot;South Sea&quot;) as opposed to ''Norð-sǣ'' (&quot;North Sea&quot; = [[Bristol Channel]]). The [[common word]] ''channel'' was first recorded in Middle English in the 13th century and was borrowed from Old French ''chanel'', variant form of ''chenel'' &quot;canal&quot;.

The French name {{lang|fr|la Manche}} has been used since at least the 17th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;/&gt; The name is usually said to refer to the Channel's sleeve ({{lang-fr|link=no|la manche}}) shape. Folk etymology has derived it from a [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] word meaning ''channel'' that is also the source of the name for [[the Minch]] in Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;Room A. ''Placenames of the world: origins and meanings'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; but this name is not attested before the 17th century, and French and British sources of that time are perfectly clear about its etymology. &lt;ref&gt;Cotgrave R., ''A Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues'', London, A. Islip, 1611, art. « Manche ».
&lt;/ref&gt; The name in French has been directly adapted in other Romance languages (Spanish: Canal de La Mancha, Portuguese: Canal da Mancha, Italian: La Manica). The name in Breton (''Mor Breizh'') means &quot;Breton Sea&quot;, and its Cornish name (''Mor Bretannek'') means &quot;British Sea&quot;.

The [[Strait of Dover]] (French: ''Pas de Calais''), at the Channel's eastern end, is its narrowest point, while its widest point lies between [[Lyme Bay]] and the Gulf of [[Saint Malo]], near its midpoint.&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia&quot;/&gt; It is relatively shallow, with an average depth of about {{convert|120|m|ft|abbr=on}} at its widest part, reducing to a depth of about {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}} between [[Dover]] and [[Calais]]. Eastwards from there the adjoining North Sea reduces to about {{convert|26|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the [[Broad Fourteens]] where it lies over the watershed of the former land bridge between [[East Anglia]] and the [[Low Countries]].

There are several major islands in the Channel, the most notable being the [[Isle of Wight]] off the English coast, and the [[Channel Islands]], British [[Crown dependencies]] off the coast of France. The coastline, particularly on the French shore, is deeply indented; several small islands close to the coastline, including [[Chausey]] and [[Mont Saint-Michel]], are within French jurisdiction. The [[Cotentin Peninsula]] in France juts out into the Channel, whilst on the English side there is a small parallel [[strait]] known as the [[Solent]] between the Isle of Wight and the mainland. The [[Celtic Sea]] is to the west of the Channel.

The Channel acts as a funnel that amplifies the tidal range from less than a metre as observed at sea{{clarify|date=December 2017}} to more than 6 metres as observed in the [[Channel Islands]], the west coast of the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] and the north coast of [[Brittany]]. The time difference of about six hours between high water at the eastern and western limits of the Channel is indicative of the tidal range being amplified further by [[resonance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Geological origins ===
[[File:Weichsel-Würm-Glaciation.png|thumb|Europe during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] ca. 20,000 years ago]]
The Channel is of geologically recent origin, having been dry land for most of the [[Pleistocene]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/English-Channel|title=English Channel {{!}} channel, Europe|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=16 May 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403222035/https://www.britannica.com/place/English-Channel|archive-date=3 April 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[Devensian glaciation]] (the most recent [[glacial period]], which ended around 10,000 years ago), [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]] were part of [[continental Europe]], linked by an unbroken [[Weald-Artois Anticline|Weald–Artois anticline]], a ridge that acted as a natural dam holding back a large freshwater [[pro-glacial lake]] in the [[Doggerland]] region, now submerged under the [[North Sea]]. During this period the North Sea and almost all of the British Isles were covered by ice. The lake was fed by meltwater from the Baltic and from the Caledonian and Scandinavian [[ice sheet]]s that joined to the north, blocking its exit. The sea level was about {{convert|120|m|ft|abbr=on}} lower than it is today. Then, between 450,000 and 180,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, at least two catastrophic [[glacial lake outburst flood]]s breached the Weald–Artois anticline.

The first flood would have lasted for several months, releasing as much as one million cubic metres of water per second.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gupta Nature&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta |first=Sanjeev |author2=Jenny S.

The flow eroded the retaining ridge, causing the rock dam to fail and releasing lake water into the Atlantic. After multiple episodes of changing sea level, during which the ''Fosses Dangeard'' were largely infilled by various layers of sediment, another catastrophic flood carved a large bedrock-floored valley, the [[Lobourg Channel]], some 500 m wide and 25 m deep, from the southern North Sea basin through the centre of the Straits of Dover and into the English Channel. It left streamlined islands, longitudinal erosional grooves, and other features characteristic of catastrophic [[megaflood]] events, still present on the sea floor and now revealed by high-resolution sonar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/ncomms15101| pmid=28375202| pmc=5382280| title=Two-stage opening of the Dover Strait and the origin of island Britain| journal=Nature Communications| volume=8| pages=15101| year=2017| last1=Gupta| first1=Sanjeev| last2=Collier| first2=Jenny S.| last3=Garcia-Moreno| first3=David| last4=Oggioni| first4=Francesca| last5=Trentesaux| first5=Alain| last6=Vanneste| first6=Kris| last7=De Batist| first7=Marc| last8=Camelbeeck| first8=Thierry| last9=Potter| first9=Graeme| last10=Van Vliet-Lanoë| first10=Brigitte| last11=Arthur| first11=John C.

The channel, which delayed human reoccupation of Great Britain for more than 100,000 years,&lt;ref&gt;&quot; Researchers speculate that the flooding induced changes in topography creating barriers to migration which led to a complete absence of humans in Britain 100,000 years ago.&quot; ''ScienceDaily'' (19 July 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; has in historic times been both an easy entry for seafaring people and a key natural defence, halting invading armies while in conjunction with control of the North Sea allowing Britain to blockade the continent.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The most significant failed invasion threats came when the Dutch and Belgian ports were held by a major continental power, e.g. from the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]]. Successful invasions include the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] and the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066, while the concentration of excellent harbours in the Western Channel on Britain's south coast made possible the largest amphibious invasion of all time, the [[Normandy Landings]] in 1944. Channel [[list of naval battles|naval battles]] include the [[Battle of the Downs]] (1639), [[Battle of Goodwin Sands]] (1652), the [[Battle of Portland]] (1653), the [[Battle of La Hougue]] (1692) and the engagement between [[USS Kearsarge (1861)|USS ''Kearsarge'']] and [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']] (1864).

In more peaceful times the Channel served as a link joining shared cultures and political structures, particularly the huge [[Angevin Empire]] from 1135 to 1217. For nearly a thousand years, the Channel also provided a link between the [[Modern Celts|Modern Celtic]] regions and languages of [[Cornwall]] and [[Brittany]]. Brittany was founded by [[Ancient Britons|Britons]] who fled [[Cornwall]] and [[Devon]] after Anglo-Saxon encroachment. In Brittany, there is a region known as &quot;[[Cornouaille]]&quot; (Cornwall) in French and &quot;Kernev&quot; in [[Breton language|Breton]]&lt;ref&gt;cf. &quot;Kernow&quot;, the Cornish for Cornwall.&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient times there was also a &quot;[[Domnonia]]&quot; (Devon) in Brittany as well.

In 55 BC [[Julius Caesar]] invaded, claiming that the Britons had aided the [[Veneti (Gaul)|Veneti]] against him the previous year. He was more successful in 54 BC, but Britain was not fully established as part of the Roman Empire until completion of the invasion by [[Aulus Plautius]] in 43 AD. A brisk and regular trade began between ports in Roman [[Gaul]] and those in Britain. This traffic continued until the [[end of Roman rule in Britain]] in 410 AD, after which the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|early Anglo-Saxons]] left less clear historical records.

In the power vacuum left by the retreating Romans, the Germanic [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], and [[Jutes]] began the next great migration across the North Sea. Having already been used as mercenaries in Britain by the Romans, many people from these tribes crossed during the [[Migration Period]], conquering and perhaps displacing the native [[Celt]]ic populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The attack on [[Lindisfarne]] in 793 is generally considered the beginning of the [[Viking Age]]. For the next 250&amp;nbsp;years the Scandinavian raiders of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark dominated the North Sea, raiding monasteries, homes, and towns along the coast and along the rivers that ran inland. According to the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' they began to settle in Britain in 851. They continued to settle in the [[British Isles]] and the continent until around 1050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Duchy of Normandy|fiefdom of Normandy]] was created for the [[Viking]] leader [[Rollo of Normandy|Rollo]] (also known as Robert of Normandy). Rollo had besieged Paris but in 911 entered [[vassal]]age to the king of the [[Western Francia|West Franks]] [[Charles the Simple]] through the [[Treaty of St.-Claire-sur-Epte]]. In exchange for his [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] and [[fealty]], Rollo legally gained the territory he and his Viking allies had previously conquered. The name &quot;Normandy&quot; reflects Rollo's Viking (i.e. &quot;Northman&quot;) origins.

The descendants of Rollo and his followers adopted the local [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance language]] and intermarried with the area's inhabitants and became the [[Normans]] – a [[Norman language|Norman French]]-speaking mixture of [[Scandinavia]]ns, [[Hiberno-Norse]], [[Orkney|Orcadians]], [[Danelaw|Anglo-Danish]], and indigenous [[Franks]] and [[Gauls]].

[[File:BayeuxTapestryScene39.jpg|Landing in England scene from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], depicting ships coming in and horses landing|thumb]]
Rollo's descendant [[William I of England|William, Duke of Normandy]] became king of England in 1066 in the [[Norman Conquest]] beginning with the [[Battle of Hastings]], while retaining the fiefdom of Normandy for himself and his descendants. In 1204, during the reign of [[John of England|King John]], mainland Normandy was taken from England by France under [[Philip II of France|Philip II]], while insular Normandy (the [[Channel Islands]]) remained under English control. In 1259, [[Henry III of England]] recognised the legality of French possession of mainland Normandy under the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris]]. His successors, however, often fought to regain control of mainland Normandy.

With the rise of [[William the Conqueror]] the North Sea and Channel began to lose some of their importance. The new order oriented most of England and Scandinavia's trade south, toward the [[Mediterranean]] and the Orient.

Although the British surrendered claims to mainland Normandy and other French possessions in 1801, the monarch of the United Kingdom retains the title Duke of Normandy in respect to the Channel Islands. The Channel Islands (except for [[Chausey]]) are [[Crown dependencies]] of the [[The Crown|British Crown]]. Thus the [[Loyal toast]] in the Channel Islands is ''La Reine, notre Duc'' (&quot;The Queen, our Duke&quot;). The British monarch is understood to ''not'' be the Duke of Normandy in regards of the French region of Normandy described herein, by virtue of the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris of 1259]], the surrender of French possessions in 1801, and the belief that the rights of succession to that title are subject to [[Salic Law]] which excludes inheritance through female heirs.

French Normandy was occupied by English forces during the [[Hundred Years' War]] in 1346–1360 and again in 1415–1450.

=== England and Britain: Naval superpower ===

[[File:La bataille des Cadinaux en novembre 1759.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]] which ended the [[Planned French invasion of Britain (1759)|French invasion plans]] in 1759]]
From the reign of [[Elizabeth I]], English foreign policy concentrated on preventing invasion across the Channel by ensuring no major European power controlled the potential Dutch and Flemish invasion ports. Her climb to the pre-eminent [[sea power]] of the world began in 1588 as the attempted invasion of the [[Spanish Armada]] was defeated by the combination of outstanding naval tactics by the English and the Dutch under command of [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham]] with [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] second in command, and the following stormy weather. Over the centuries the [[Royal Navy]] slowly grew to be the most powerful in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The building of the [[British Empire]] was possible only because the [[Royal Navy]] eventually managed to exercise unquestioned control over the seas around Europe, especially the Channel and the North Sea. During the [[Seven Years' War]], France attempted to [[Planned French Invasion of Britain (1759)|launch an invasion of Britain]]. To achieve this France needed to gain control of the Channel for several weeks, but was thwarted following the British naval victory at the [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]] in 1759.

Another significant challenge to British domination of the seas came during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The [[Battle of Trafalgar]] took place off the coast of Spain against a combined French and Spanish fleet and was won by Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]], ending [[Napoleon]]'s plans for a cross-Channel invasion and securing British dominance of the seas for over a century.

=== First World War ===
The exceptional strategic importance of the Channel as a tool for blockade was recognised by the First Sea Lord [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Admiral Fisher]] in the years before [[World War I]]. &quot;Five keys lock up the world! Singapore, the Cape, [[Alexandria]], Gibraltar, Dover.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Geoffrey Miller| url=http://www.manorhouse.clara.net/book3/chapter2.htm| title=The Millstone: Chapter 2| accessdate=1 November 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716113342/http://www.manorhouse.clara.net/book3/chapter2.htm| archive-date=16 July 2011| url-status=live}} quoting Fisher, ''Naval Necessities I'', p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 25 July 1909 [[Louis Blériot]] made the first Channel crossing from [[Calais]] to [[Dover]] in an aeroplane. Blériot's crossing signalled the end of the Channel as a barrier-moat for England against foreign enemies.

Because the ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' surface fleet could not match the British Grand Fleet, the Germans developed [[submarine warfare]], which was to become a far greater threat to Britain. The [[Dover Patrol]] was set up just before the war started to escort cross-Channel troopships and to prevent submarines from sailing in the Channel, obliging them to travel to the Atlantic via the much longer route around Scotland.

On land, the German army attempted to capture Channel ports in the [[Race to the Sea]] but although the trenches are often said to have stretched &quot;from the frontier of Switzerland to the English Channel&quot;, they reached the coast at the North Sea. Much of the British war effort in [[Flanders]] was a bloody but successful strategy to prevent the Germans reaching the Channel coast.

At the outset of the war, an attempt was made to block the path of [[U-boat]]s through the Dover Strait with [[naval mine]]fields. By February 1915, this had been augmented by a {{convert|25|km|mi}} stretch of light steel netting called the [[Dover Barrage]], which it was hoped would ensnare submerged submarines. After initial success, the Germans learned how to pass through the barrage, aided by the unreliability of British mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/atoz/doverbarrage.htm|title=First World War.com - Encyclopedia - The Dover Barrage|website=www.firstworldwar.com|access-date=21 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918001536/http://www.firstworldwar.com/atoz/doverbarrage.htm|archive-date=18 September 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 January 1917, the Germans restarted [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] leading to dire Admiralty predictions that submarines would defeat Britain by November,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.germannotes.com/hist_ww1_uboat.shtml| archive-url=https://archive.today/20080310175335/http://www.germannotes.com/hist_ww1_uboat.shtml| url-status=dead| archive-date=10 March 2008| title=U-Boat warfare at the Atlantic during World War I| publisher=German Notes| accessdate=1 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the most dangerous situation Britain faced in either world war.

The [[Battle of Passchendaele]] in 1917 was fought to reduce the threat by capturing the submarine bases on the Belgian coast, though it was the introduction of [[convoy]]s and not capture of the bases that averted defeat. In April 1918 the Dover Patrol carried out the [[Zeebrugge Raid]] against the U-boat bases. During 1917, the Dover Barrage was re-sited with improved mines and more effective nets, aided by regular patrols by small warships equipped with powerful searchlights. A German attack on these vessels resulted in the [[Battle of Dover Strait (1917)|Battle of Dover Strait in 1917]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=E_TE_ARPXdMC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=%22Dover+Barrage%22+1917#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Dover%20Barrage%22%201917&amp;f=false |first=Robert M. |last=Grant |title=U-Boats Destroyed: The Effect of Anti-Submarine Warfare 1914–1918 |publisher=Periscope Publishing Ltd |year=2002 |isbn=978-1-904381-00-6 |pages=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; A much more ambitious attempt to improve the barrage, by installing eight massive concrete towers across the strait was called the [[Admiralty M-N Scheme]] but only two towers were nearing completion at the end of the war and the project was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sotonwss.org.uk/blackjack/Sep09BJ.pdf|title=''Black Jack'' (Quarterly Magazine Southampton Branch World Ship Society) Issue No: 152 Autumn 2009: (p.6) SHOREHAM TOWERS – One of the Admiralty's greatest engineering secrets, Reproduced from Engineering &amp; Technology IET Magazine May 2009|access-date=21 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513143827/http://www.sotonwss.org.uk/blackjack/Sep09BJ.pdf|archive-date=13 May 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second World War]], naval activity in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European theatre]] was primarily [[Battle of the Atlantic|limited to the Atlantic]]. During the [[Battle of France]] in May 1940, the German forces succeeded in capturing both [[Battle of Boulogne (1940)|Boulogne]] and [[Siege of Calais (1940)|Calais]], thereby threatening the line of retreat for the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]]. By a combination of hard fighting and German indecision, the port of [[Dunkirk]] was kept open allowing 338,000 Allied troops to be evacuated in [[Operation Dynamo]]. More than 11,000 were evacuated from [[Le Havre]] during [[Operation Cycle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/operation_cycle.html|title=Operation Cycle, the evacuation from Havre, 10-13 June 1940|accessdate=2 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423063550/http://historyofwar.org/articles/operation_cycle.html|archive-date=23 April 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a further 192,000 were evacuated from ports further down the coast in [[Operation Ariel]] in June 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/operation_aerial.html Operation Aerial, the evacuation from north western France, 15–25 June 1940] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016033459/http://historyofwar.org/articles/operation_aerial.html |date=16 October 2012 }}.

The narrow waters of the Channel were considered too dangerous for major warships until the [[Normandy Landings]] with the exception, for the German [[Kriegsmarine]], of the [[Channel Dash]] (Operation Cerberus) in February 1942, and this required the support of the [[Luftwaffe]] in [[Operation Donnerkeil|Operation Thunderbolt]].

[[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]] was the site of an ill-fated [[Dieppe Raid]] by Canadian and British armed forces.

Intense negotiations resulted in some [[Red Cross]] humanitarian aid, but there was considerable hunger and privation during the occupation, particularly in the final months, when the population was close to starvation. The German troops on the islands surrendered on 9 May 1945, a day after the final surrender in mainland Europe.

Marine [[GPS]] systems allow ships to be preprogrammed to follow navigational channels accurately and automatically, further avoiding risk of running aground, but following the fatal collision between Dutch Aquamarine and Ash in October 2001, Britain's [[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]] (MAIB) issued a safety bulletin saying it believed that in these most unusual circumstances GPS use had actually contributed to the collision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.maib.gov.uk/cms_resources/SB_%202_2001_%20Ash_and_Dutch_Aquamarin.pdf| title=Safety Bulletin 2| year=2001| publisher=[[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]]| accessdate=1 November 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416131027/http://www.maib.gov.uk/cms_resources/SB_%202_2001_%20Ash_and_Dutch_Aquamarin.pdf| archive-date=16 April 2009| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ships were maintaining a very precise automated course, one directly behind the other, rather than making use of the full width of the traffic lanes as a human navigator would.

A combination of radar difficulties in monitoring areas near cliffs, a failure of a CCTV system, incorrect operation of the anchor, the inability of the crew to follow standard procedures of using a GPS to provide early warning of the ship dragging the anchor and reluctance to admit the mistake and start the engine led to the MV ''Willy'' running aground in Cawsand bay, [[Cornwall]] in January 2002. The MAIB report makes it clear that the harbour controllers were informed of impending disaster by shore observers before the crew were themselves aware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.maib.gov.uk/cms_resources/willy.pdf| title=Report on the Investigation of the grounding of MV ''Willy''| publisher=[[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]]| date=October 2002| accessdate=1 November 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416121715/http://www.maib.gov.uk/cms_resources/willy.pdf| archive-date=16 April 2009| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The village of [[Kingsand]] was evacuated for three days because of the risk of explosion, and the ship was stranded for 11 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1742910.stm| title=Picture gallery: Cornwall's stranded tanker| publisher=BBC| date=5 January 2002| accessdate=1 November 2008| location=London| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040411082843/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1742910.stm| archive-date=11 April 2004| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1745945.stm| date=6 January 2002| title=Salvage team hunts for leak| publisher=BBC| accessdate=1 November 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1759670.stm| title=Stranded tanker safe in port| date=14 January 2002| publisher=BBC| accessdate=1 November 2008| location=London| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030409143424/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1759670.stm| archive-date=9 April 2003| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Channel Tunnel ===
{{main|Channel Tunnel}}

Many travellers cross beneath the Channel using the Channel Tunnel, first proposed in the early 19th century and finally opened in 1994, connecting the UK and France by rail. It is now routine to travel between Paris or [[Brussels]] and London on the [[Eurostar]] train. Freight trains also use the tunnel. Cars, coaches and lorries are carried on [[Eurotunnel Shuttle]] trains between [[Folkestone]] and [[Calais]].

=== Tourism ===
[[File:Le Mont Saint-Michel.jpg|thumb|The [[Mont Saint-Michel]] is one of the most visited and recognisable landmarks on the English Channel.]]

The coastal resorts of the Channel, such as [[Brighton]] and [[Deauville]], inaugurated an era of aristocratic tourism in the early 19th century, which developed into the seaside tourism that has shaped resorts around the world.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Short trips across the Channel for leisure purposes are often referred to as [[Booze cruise|Channel Hopping]].

== History of Channel crossings ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2013}}
As one of the narrowest and most well-known international waterways lacking dangerous currents, the Channel has been the first objective of numerous innovative sea, air, and [[human power]]ed crossing technologies.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
Pre-historic people sailed from the mainland to England for millennia.

=== By swimming ===
{{Main|List of successful English Channel swimmers}}
The sport of Channel swimming traces its origins to the latter part of the 19th century when Captain [[Matthew Webb]] made the first observed and unassisted swim across the Strait of Dover, swimming from England to France on 24–25 August 1875 in 21&amp;nbsp;hours 45&amp;nbsp;minutes.

In 1927, at a time when fewer than ten swimmers (including the first woman, [[Gertrude Ederle]] in 1926) had managed to emulate the feat and many dubious claims were being made, the [[Channel Swimming Association]] (CSA) was founded to authenticate and ratify swimmers' claims to have swum the Channel and to verify crossing times. The CSA was dissolved in 1999 and was succeeded by two separate organisations: [[CSA (Ltd)]] and the [[Channel Swimming and Piloting Federation]] (CSPF). Both observe and authenticate cross-Channel swims in the Strait of Dover. The Channel Crossing Association was set up at about this time to cater for unorthodox crossings.

The team with the most number of Channel swims to its credit is the [[The Serpentine|Serpentine]] Swimming Club in London,&lt;ref&gt;serpentineswimmingclub.com {{cite web| url=http://serpentineswimmingclub.com/long-distance-swimmers| title=Serpentine Swimming Club| accessdate=4 June 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912055658/http://serpentineswimmingclub.com/long-distance-swimmers/| archive-date=12 September 2015| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the International [[Sri Chinmoy]] Marathon Team.&lt;ref&gt;srichinmoyraces.org {{cite web| url=http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/channel/channel_swimmers/channel_swimmers_list| title=Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team| accessdate=4 June 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317091724/http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/channel/channel_swimmers/channel_swimmers_list| archive-date=17 March 2009| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2005, 811 people had completed 1,185 verified crossings under the rules of the CSA, the CSA (Ltd), the CSPF and Butlins.

The number of swims conducted under and ratified by the Channel Swimming Association to 2005 was 982 by 665 people. This includes 24 two-way crossings and three three-way crossings.

The number of ratified swims to 2004 was 948 by 675 people (456 men, 214 women). There have been 16 two-way crossings (9 by men and 7 by women). There have been three three-way crossings (2 by men and 1 by a woman). (It is unclear whether this last set of data is comprehensive or CSA only.)

The Strait of Dover is the busiest stretch of water in the world. It is governed by International Law as described in ''Unorthodox Crossing of the Dover Strait Traffic Separation Scheme''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga07-home/emergencyresponse/mcga-searchandrescue/mcga-hmcgsar-sarsystem/channel_navigation_information_service__cnis_/dops_-_all-sar_cnis_unorthodox_crossings.htm| title=Unorthodox Crossing of the Dover Strait Traffic Separation Scheme| publisher=[[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]]| accessdate=1 November 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202020122/http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga07-home/emergencyresponse/mcga-searchandrescue/mcga-hmcgsar-sarsystem/channel_navigation_information_service__cnis_/dops_-_all-sar_cnis_unorthodox_crossings.htm| archive-date=2 February 2011| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states: &quot;[In] exceptional cases the French Maritime Authorities may grant authority for unorthodox craft to cross French territorial waters within the Traffic Separation Scheme when these craft set off from the British coast, on condition that the request for authorisation is sent to them with the opinion of the British Maritime Authorities.&quot;

The CCA, CSA, and CS&amp;PF are the organisations escorting channel swims, because their pilots have the experience, qualifications, and equipment to guarantee the safety of the swimmers they escort.

The fastest verified swim of the Channel was by the Australian [[Trent Grimsey]] on 8 September 2012, in 6 hours 55 minutes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.theage.com.au/breaking-news-sport/trent-grimsey-breaks-channel-swim-record-20120909-25lsh.html|title=Trent Grimsey breaks channel swim record|website=The Age|date=8 September 2012|access-date=13 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109065958/http://news.theage.com.au/breaking-news-sport/trent-grimsey-breaks-channel-swim-record-20120909-25lsh.html|archive-date=9 November 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dover.uk.com/channelswimming/records.php|title=Channel swimming records - Dover.UK.com|website=www.dover.uk.com|access-date=13 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817175330/http://www.dover.uk.com/channelswimming/records.php|archive-date=17 August 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; beating the previous record set in 2007 by Bulgarian swimmer [[Petar Stoychev]].

There may have been some unreported swims of the Channel, by people intent on entering Britain in circumvention of immigration controls. A failed attempt to cross the Channel by two Syrian refugees in October 2014 only came to light when their bodies were later discovered on the shores of the North Sea in Norway and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Wetsuitmen|first=Anders|last=Fjellberg|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/spesial/vatdraktmysteriet/eng/|year=2015|access-date=25 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150728074722/http://www.dagbladet.no/spesial/vatdraktmysteriet/eng/|archive-date=28 July 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
