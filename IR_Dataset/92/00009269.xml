A '''historical sovereign state''' is a state that once existed, but has since been dissolved due to conflict, war, rebellion, annexation, or uprising.

This page lists [[sovereign states]], [[country|countries]], [[nation]]s, or [[empire]]s that have ceased to exist as political entities, grouped geographically and by constitutional nature.

==Criteria for inclusion==
The criteria for inclusion in this list is similar to that of the [[List of states with limited recognition]]. To be included here, a polity must have claimed statehood and either:
* had de facto control over a territory, a population, a government, a capacity to enter into relations with other states, or
* have been recognised as a state by at least one other state.

For purposes of this list, the cutoff between medieval and early modern states is the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453.

==Ancient and medieval states==
* [[List of sovereign states in the 35th century BC]]
* [[List of Bronze Age states]]
* [[List of Classical Age states]]
* [[List of Iron Age states]]
* [[List of states during Late Antiquity]]
* [[List of states during the Middle Ages]]

!Notes
|-
|[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]]
|The whole of North America (including the [[Inuit]] of the Arctic).
|[[Native Americans in the United States]] and the [[First Nations]] of Canada had established varying levels of governmental organization before contact with Europeans. The most advanced civilizations of North America were represented by the [[indigenous peoples in Mexico]] and [[Central America]].
| All the native peoples were eventually incorporated into the United States, Mexico, Canada and Central America, but many retain various levels of self-government and autonomy within those nations.
|
|-
|[[Cahokia]]
|[[Illinois]], [[Missouri]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]] and parts of [[Ohio]].
|The population of the town at Cahokia exploded circa 1050 AD, indicating the establishment of a large &quot;chiefdom&quot;.
|The population of Cahokia dispersed in the 14th century, indicating the decline of the Cahokia &quot;chiefdom&quot;.
|Other political bodies existed in the [[Mississippian culture]]; the Mississippian culture article has a list of [[Mississippian culture#Known Mississippian chiefdoms|Known Mississippian Chiefdoms]].
|-
|[[Wyandot people|Huron]] Confederacy
|Central [[Ontario]].
|Confederacy of five [[Iroquoian]] tribes and several smaller groups. Controlled trade in corn and furs in the upper Great Lakes area and sporadically through the Ottawa and St. Lawrence River valleys.
|The Hurons were dispersed by the Iroquois in 1649. Many fled to the northern Lake Michigan region and Quebec, while a large group joined the Iroquois.
|
|-
|[[File:Flag_of_the_Iroquois_Confederacy.svg|20px|border]] [[Iroquois]] Confederacy
|[[Upstate New York]] and surrounding areas.
|Formed before European contact; arguably as early as 31 August 1142, though also likely sometime in the 15th to 17th centuries.
|The [[Treaty of Canandaigua]], signed in 1794, established relations between the United States government and the Iroquois; the treaty is still in force, though the Confederacy is no longer effectively an independent nation.
|
|-
|[[File:Flag_of_the_Cherokee_Nation.svg|20px|border]] [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]]
|Originally in the southeastern United States, primarily [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[South Carolina]], and [[North Carolina]], and parts of [[Alabama]] and [[Tennessee]]. Parts of The Nation (and its government structures) ended up in present-day [[Oklahoma]].
|The original Cherokee Nation was unified from an interrelated society of city-states in the late 18th century. They enjoyed relatively peaceful relations with the Spanish, British, French, and later (with the exception of the [[Chickamauga Cherokee|Chickamauga factions]]), to the U.S.
|The modern [[Cherokee Nation]], the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]] and the [[United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians]] are the three federally recognized tribal successors to the original Cherokee Nation, being somewhat autonomous within the United States.
|
|-
|[[File:Flag_of_the_Vermont_Republic.svg|20px|border]] [[Vermont Republic]]
|State of [[Vermont]].
|Organized by [[Moses Robinson]], [[Thomas Chittenden]], and others in 1777 from territory claimed by [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Hampshire]].
|Admitted as a state to the [[United States|United States of America]] in 1791. They were originally a part of [[British North America]] via the newly conquered province of [[Quebec]].
|Originally known as '''Republic of New Connecticut''', it had the first written national constitution in North America.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
|-
|[[State of Franklin]]
|Northeastern part of the [[Washington District, North Carolina]] (easternmost [[Tennessee]]).
|Seceded from [[North Carolina]] 23 August 1784.
|Government was largely abandoned and the area officially re-incorporated into North Carolina in 1789.
|Applied for admission to the United States as a separate state. Whether Franklin considered itself independent of the United States is unclear.
|-
|[[File:Flag_of_the_Creek_Nation.svg|20px|border]] [[State of Muskogee]]
|Western [[Florida]], near [[Tallahassee]], might have claimed parts of [[Georgia (U.S. state)]] and [[Alabama]].
|[[Creek people|Creek]] and [[Seminole]] Indians under English adventurer [[William Augustus Bowles]] declared independence in 1799.
|Annexed by Spain in 1803.
|
|-
|[[File:Bandera_del_Primer_Imperio_Mexicano.svg|20px|border]] [[First Mexican Empire]]
|All of modern-day [[Mexico]], parts of modern-day United States ([[California]], [[Nevada]], [[Arizona]], [[Utah]], [[New Mexico]], [[Texas]] with parts of [[Colorado]], [[Wyoming]], [[Kansas]] and [[Oklahoma]]) and [[Central America]] (without [[Panama]]).
|After independence from the Kingdom of Spain, Mexico decided on a monarchical system of government, backed by Mexican conservatives and some liberals. A European prince was sought, but Spain prohibited any from taking the throne. [[Agustín de Iturbide|Agustín I]], in the meantime, was proclaimed emperor of Mexico in 1821.
|In December 1822, Generals [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] and [[Guadalupe Victoria]] wrote and signed the [[Plan of Casa Mata]], an agreement between the two generals, amongst other Mexican generals, governors, and high-ranking governmental officials, to abolish the monarchy and replace it with the [[United Mexican States]], which was done in 1823.
|Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], head of the [[Second Mexican Empire]], adopted Agustin's grandsons. Their descendants live in exile.
