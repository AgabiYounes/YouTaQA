'''ECHELON''', originally a secret government [[code name]], is a [[surveillance]] program ([[signals intelligence]]/SIGINT collection and analysis network) operated by the United States with the aid of four other signatory states to the [[UKUSA Agreement|UKUSA Security Agreement]]:&lt;ref name=pronunciation&gt;Given the 5 dialects that use the terms, UKUSA can be pronounced from &quot;You-Q-SA&quot; to &quot;Oo-Coo-SA&quot;, AUSCANNZUKUS can be pronounced from &quot;Oz-Can-Zuke-Us&quot; to &quot;Orse-Can-Zoo-Cuss&quot;.
: From [[Talk:UKUSA Agreement]]: &quot;Per documents officially released by both the [[Government Communications Headquarters]] and the [[National Security Agency]], this agreement is referred to as the UKUSA Agreement. This name is subsequently used by media sources reporting on the story, as written in new references used for the article. The NSA press release provides a pronunciation guide, indicating that &quot;UKUSA&quot; should not be read as two separate entities.{{cite web

The ECHELON program was created in the late 1960s to monitor the [[military]] and [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] communications of the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Eastern Bloc]] allies during the [[Cold War]], and it was formally established in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcechelon1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Q&amp;A: What you need to know about Echelon|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sci/tech/1357513.stm|publisher=BBC|date=29 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nabbali|first=Talitha|author2=Perry, Mark|title=Going for the throat|journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Review|date=March 2004|volume=20|issue=2|pages=84–97|doi=10.1016/S0267-3649(04)00018-4|url=|quote=It wasn't until 1971 that the UKUSA allies began ECHELON}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 20th century, the system referred to as &quot;ECHELON&quot; had evolved beyond its military and diplomatic origins into &quot;a global system for the interception of private and commercial communications&quot; (mass surveillance and [[industrial espionage]]).&lt;ref name=EP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+REPORT+A5-2001-0264+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN&amp;language=EN |title=On the existence of a global system for the interception of private and commercial communications (ECHELON interception system), (2001/2098(INI)) |last=Schmid |first=Gerhard |date=11 July 2001 |format=pdf – 194 pages |publisher=European Parliament: Temporary Committee on the ECHELON Interception System |accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
The [[European Parliament]]'s [[Temporary Committee on the ECHELON Interception System]] stated, &quot;It seems likely, in view of the evidence and the consistent pattern of statements from a very wide range of individuals and organisations, including American sources, that its name is in fact '''ECHELON''', although this is a relatively minor detail&quot;.&lt;ref name=EP/&gt; The US intelligence community uses many code names (''see'', for example, [[CIA cryptonym]]).

Former [[NSA]] employee [[Margaret Newsham]] claims that she worked on the configuration and installation of software that makes up the ECHELON system while employed at [[Lockheed Martin]], from 1974 to 1984 in [[Sunnyvale, California]], in the [[United States]], and in [[Menwith Hill]], [[England]], in the [[UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=ECHELON Was My Baby |last=Elkjær |first=Bo |author2=Kenan Seeberg |work=Ekstra Bladet |url=http://cryptome.org/echelon-baby.htm |date=17 November 1999 |accessdate=17 May 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615202141/http://cryptome.org/echelon-baby.htm |archive-date=15 June 2006 |url-status=dead }} &quot;Unfortunately, I can't tell you all my duties. I am still bound by professional secrecy, and I would hate to go to prison or get involved in any trouble, if you know what I mean. In general, I can tell you that I was responsible for compiling the various systems and programs, configuring the whole thing and making it operational on mainframes&quot;; &quot;[[Margaret Newsham]] worked for the [[NSA]] through her employment at Ford and Lockheed from 1974 to 1984. In 1977 and 1978 Newsham was stationed at the largest listening post in the world at [[Menwith Hill]], [[England]] ... Ekstra Bladet has Margaret Newsham's stationing orders from the US Department of Defense. She possessed the high security classification TOP SECRET CRYPTO.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, according to Newsham, the code name ECHELON was NSA's term for the computer network itself. Lockheed called it ''P415''. The software programs were called ''SILKWORTH'' and ''SIRE''. A [[satellite]] named ''[[Vortex (satellite)|VORTEX]]'' intercepted communications. An image available on the internet of a fragment apparently torn from a job description shows Echelon listed along with several other code names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodwins|first=Rupert|title=Echelon: How it works|url=http://www.zdnet.com/echelon-how-it-works-3002079849/|work=[[ZDNet]]|accessdate=28 January 2014|date=29 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=insideechelon&gt;{{cite web|last==Campbell|first=Duncan|title=Inside Echelon|url=http://www.zdnet.com/echelon-how-it-works-3002079849/|publisher=[[Heise Online]]|accessdate=28 January 2014|date=25 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain's ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper summarized the capabilities of the ECHELON system as follows:

{{quote|A global network of electronic spy stations that can eavesdrop on telephones, faxes and computers. It can even track bank accounts. This information is stored in Echelon computers, which can keep millions of records on individuals.

Officially, however, Echelon doesn't exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perrone|first=Jane|title=The Echelon spy network|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/29/qanda.janeperrone|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=28 January 2014|date=29 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Documents leaked by the former [[NSA]] contractor [[Edward Snowden]] revealed that the ECHELON system's collection of [[satellite]] data is also referred to as '''FORNSAT''' - an abbreviation for &quot;Foreign Satellite Collection&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laura Poitras, Marcel Rosenbach and Holger Stark|title=Friendly Fire: How GCHQ Monitors Germany, Israel and the EU|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/snowden-documents-show-gchq-targeted-european-and-german-politicians-a-940135-2.html|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|quote=A map from the wealth of classified documents obtained by Snowden on the so-called &quot;Fornsat&quot; activities of the technical intelligence cooperation program -- informally known as the Five Eyes -- shows that the system of global satellite surveillance remained in operation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ambinder|first=Marc|title=What's XKEYSCORE?|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/247684/whats-xkeyscore|work=[[The Week]]|accessdate=30 January 2014|date=31 July 2013|quote=FORNSAT simply means &quot;foreign satellite collection,&quot; which refers to NSA tapping into satellites that process data used by other countries.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reporting and disclosures ==

=== Public disclosures (1972–2000) ===
Former [[NSA]] analyst [[Perry Fellwock]], under pseudonym Winslow Peck, first blew the whistle on ECHELON to ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Ramparts |volume=11 |number=2 |date=August 1972 |pages=35–50 |title=U.S. Electronic Espionage: A Memoir |author=David Horowitz }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he gave commentary revealing a global network of listening posts and his experiences working there. [[Perry Fellwock|Fellwock]] also included revelations such as the existence of [[nuclear weapons]] in [[Israel]] in 1972, the widespread involvement of [[CIA]] and [[NSA]] personnel in drugs and human smuggling, and [[CIA]] operatives leading Nationalist Chinese (Taiwan) commandos in burning villages inside [[PRC]] borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cryptome.org/jya/nsa-elint.htm|title=Ramparts interview |date=1988 |accessdate=April 21, 2017|publisher=Cryptome archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, [[James Bamford]], investigative journalist and author wrote ''The Puzzle Palace'', an in-depth look inside the workings of the [[NSA]], then a super-secret agency, and the massive eavesdropping operation under the codename &quot;SHAMROCK&quot;. The [[NSA]] has used many [[code name|codenames]], and SHAMROCK was the [[code name]] used for ECHELON prior to 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bamford |first=James |title=The Puzzle Palace: A Report on America's Most Secret Agency |url=https://archive.org/details/puzzlepalacerepo00bamf |url-access=registration |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=978-0-14-006748-4 |date=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Echelon reference timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cryptome.org/jya/echelon-dc.htm|title=Puzzle Palace excepts|accessdate=April 21, 2017|publisher=Cryptome archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, [[Margaret Newsham]], a [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] employee under [[NSA]] contract, disclosed the ECHELON [[surveillance]] system to members of congress. [[Margaret Newsham|Newsham]] told a member of the [[US Congress]] that the telephone calls of [[Strom Thurmond]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] US senator, were being collected by the [[NSA]]. Congressional investigators determined that &quot;targeting of US political figures would not occur by accident, but was designed into the system from the start.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;duncan1&quot; /&gt;

Also in 1988, an article titled &quot;Somebody's Listening&quot;, written by investigative journalist [[Duncan Campbell (journalist)|Duncan Campbell]] in the ''[[New Statesman]]'', described the [[signals intelligence]] gathering activities of a program code-named &quot;ECHELON&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;duncan1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Campbell |first=Duncan |authorlink=Duncan Campbell (journalist) |title=Somebody's Listening |newspaper=[[New Statesman]] |date=12 August 1988 |url=http://www.duncancampbell.org/menu/journalism/newstatesman/newstatesman-1988/They%27ve%20got%20it%20taped.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614020755/http://www.duncancampbell.org/menu/journalism/newstatesman/newstatesman-1988/They%27ve%20got%20it%20taped.pdf |archive-date=14 June 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Bamford]] describes the system as the software controlling the collection and distribution of civilian [[telecommunications]] traffic conveyed using communication satellites, with the collection being undertaken by ground stations located in the footprint of the downlink leg.&lt;ref name=Bamford&gt;{{cite book |last=Bamford |first=James |title=Body of Secrets |publisher=Anchor |isbn=978-0-385-49908-8 |date=2002 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/bodyofsecretsana0000bamf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed description of ECHELON was provided by the New Zealand journalist [[Nicky Hager]] in his 1996 book ''[[Nicky Hager#Secret Power|Secret Power: New Zealand's Role in the International Spy Network]]''.&lt;ref name=heiseeche&gt;{{cite web|last=Duncan Campbell|title=Echelon Chronology|url=http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/7/7795/1.html|publisher=[[Heise Online]]|accessdate=19 December 2013|date=1 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, [[Nicky Hager|Hager's]] book was cited by the [[European Parliament]] in a report titled &quot;An Appraisal of the Technology of Political Control&quot; (PE 168.184).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Steve|title=An Appraisal of Technologies of Political Control|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/pdf/jadis/2013_12/8.PE4_AP_PV!LIBE.1994_LIBE-199801260050EN.pdf|publisher=[[European Parliament]]|accessdate=28 January 2014|date=6 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1999, for the first time in history, the [[Australian government]] admitted that news reports about the top secret [[UKUSA Agreement]] were true.&lt;ref name=&quot;zdnetduncan&quot; /&gt; [[Martin Brady]], the director of Australia's [[Defence Signals Directorate]] (DSD, now known as Australian Signals Directorate, or ASD) told the [[Australia]]n broadcasting channel [[Nine Network]] that the DSD &quot;does co-operate with counterpart [[signals intelligence]] organisations overseas under the [[UKUSA Agreement|UKUSA relationship]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duncan Campbell and Mark Honigsbaum|title=Britain and US spy on world|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/may/23/duncancampbell.markhonigsbaum|work=[[The Observer]] |accessdate=19 December 2013|date=23 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[R. James Woolsey, Jr.|James Woolsey]], the former Director of the US [[Central Intelligence Agency]], confirmed that US intelligence uses interception systems and keyword searches to monitor [[Europe]]an businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=R.

Lawmakers in the United States feared that the ECHELON system could be used to monitor US citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;echenytimes&quot; /&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the ECHELON system has been &quot;shrouded in such secrecy that its very existence has been difficult to prove.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;echenytimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Niall McKay|title=Lawmakers Raise Questions About International Spy Network|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/05/cyber/articles/27network.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=19 December 2013|date=27 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics said the ECHELON system emerged from the [[Cold War]] as a &quot;Big Brother without a cause&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Suzanne Daley|title=An Electronic Spy Scare Is Alarming Europe|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/02/biztech/articles/24spy.htm l|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=19 December 2013|date=24 February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Parliament investigation (2000–2001)===
[[File:Nicky Hager at European Parliament April 2001b.jpg|thumb|The New Zealand journalist [[Nicky Hager]], who testified before the [[European Parliament]] and provided specific details about the ECHELON [[surveillance]] system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kieren McCarthy|title=This is how we know Echelon exists|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/09/14/this_is_how_we_know/|work=[[The Register]]|accessdate=19 December 2013|date=14 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The program's capabilities and political implications were investigated by a committee of the [[European Parliament]] during 2000 and 2001 with a report published in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;EP&quot;/&gt; In July 2000, the [[Temporary Committee on the ECHELON Interception System]] was established by the [[European parliament]] to investigate the [[surveillance]] network. It was chaired by the Portuguese politician [[Carlos Coelho (politician)|Carlos Coelho]], who was in charge of supervising investigations throughout 2000 and 2001.

In May 2001, as the committee finalised its report on the ECHELON system, a delegation travelled to [[Washington, D.C.]] to attend meetings with US officials from the following agencies and departments:
* US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA)&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcusech&quot;/&gt;
* US [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] (DOC)&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcusech&quot;/&gt;
* US [[National Security Agency]] (NSA)&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcusech&quot;/&gt;

All meetings were cancelled by the US government and the committee was forced to end its trip prematurely.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcusech&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Roxburgh|first=Angus|title=EU investigators 'snubbed' in US|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1325186.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=28 January 2014|date=11 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[BBC]] correspondent in May 2001, &quot;The US Government still refuses to admit that Echelon even exists.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcechelon1&quot;/&gt;

In July 2001, the [[Temporary Committee on the ECHELON Interception System]] released its final report.&lt;ref name=&quot;EUechelon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on the existence of a global system for the interception of private and commercial communications (ECHELON interception system) (2001/2098(INI))|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&amp;reference=A5-2001-0264&amp;format=XML&amp;language=EN|publisher=[[European Parliament]]|date=11 July 2001|accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 September 2001, the [[European Parliament]] voted to accept the committee's report.&lt;ref name=apechelonusa&gt;{{cite news|title=Report: Echelon exists, should be guarded against|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2001-09-05-echelon.htm|accessdate=7 February 2014|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=5 September 2001|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Parliament]] stated in its report that the term ECHELON is used in a number of contexts, but that the evidence presented indicates that it was the name for a [[signals intelligence]] collection system&lt;ref name=&quot;EP&quot; /&gt;. The report concludes that, on the basis of information presented, ECHELON was capable of interception and content inspection of [[telephone]] calls, [[fax]], [[e-mail]] and other data traffic globally through the interception of communication bearers including [[satellite]] transmission, [[public switched telephone network]]s (which once carried most Internet traffic), and [[microwave]] links.&lt;ref name=EP/&gt;

=== Confirmation of ECHELON (2015) ===
Two internal [[NSA]] newsletters from January 2011 and July 2012, published as part of the [[Edward Snowden|Snowden]]-revelations by the website ''[[The Intercept]]'' on 3 August 2015, for the first time confirmed that [[NSA]] used the [[code word]] ECHELON and provided some details about the scope of the program: ECHELON was part of an umbrella program [[code name]]d FROSTING, which was established by the [[NSA]] in 1966 to collect and process data from [[communications satellites]]. FROSTING had two sub-programs:&lt;ref name=yrs&gt;The Northwest Passage, Yakima Research Station (YRS) newsletter: [http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2189960-nwp-nsa.html Volume 2, Issue 1, January 2011] &amp; [http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2189961-nwp2-nsa.html Volume 3, Issue 7, July 2012].&lt;/ref&gt;
* TRANSIENT: for intercepting [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] satellite transmissions
* ECHELON: for intercepting [[Intelsat]] satellite transmissions

==Organization==
{{UKUSA}}
The [[UKUSA Agreement|UKUSA intelligence community]] was assessed by the [[European Parliament]] (EP) in 2000 to include the [[signals intelligence]] agencies of each of the member states:
* the [[Government Communications Headquarters]] of the United Kingdom,
* the [[National Security Agency]] of the United States,
* the [[Communications Security Establishment]] of Canada,
* the [[Australian Signals Directorate]] of Australia, and
* the [[Government Communications Security Bureau]] of New Zealand.
The EP report concluded that it seemed likely that ECHELON is a method of sorting captured signal traffic, rather than a comprehensive analysis tool.&lt;ref name=EP/&gt;

===Likely satellite intercept stations===
In 2001, the [[European Parliament|EP]] report (p.&amp;nbsp;54 ff)&lt;ref name=EP/&gt; listed the following ground stations as likely to have, or to have had, a role in intercepting transmissions from telecommunications satellites&lt;ref name=&quot;EP&quot; /&gt;:

== History and context ==
The ability to intercept communications depends on the medium used, be it [[radio]], [[satellite]], [[microwave]], [[cellular network|cellular]] or [[Optical fiber|fiber-optic]].&lt;ref name = EP/&gt; During [[World War II]] and through the 1950s, [[high frequency|high-frequency]] (&quot;short-wave&quot;) radio was widely used for military and diplomatic communication&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Codebreakers]]'', Ch. 10, 11&lt;/ref&gt; and could be intercepted at great distances.&lt;ref name = EP/&gt; The rise of [[geostationary]] [[communications satellites]] in the 1960s presented new possibilities for intercepting international communications.

In 1964, plans for the establishment of the ECHELON [[Telecommunications network|network]] took off after dozens of countries agreed to establish the [[International Telecommunications Satellite Organisation]] (Intelsat), which would own and operate a global constellation of [[communications satellite]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;zdnetduncan&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Duncan Campbell|title=Echelon: World under watch, an introduction|url=http://www.zdnet.com/echelon-world-under-watch-an-introduction-3002079845/|work=[[ZDNet]]|accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Echelon-yakima-02.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Equipment at the Yakima Research Station (YRS) in the early days of the ECHELON program]]
[[File:Echelon-yakima-01.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Teletype operators at the Yakima Research Station (YRS) in the early days of the ECHELON program]]
In 1966, the first [[Intelsat]] [[satellite]] was launched into orbit. From 1970 to 1971, the [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ) of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] began to operate a secret signal station  at [[Morwenstow]], near [[Bude]] in [[Cornwall]], [[England]]. The station intercepted [[satellite communications]] over the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Indian Ocean]]s. Soon afterwards, the US [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) built a second signal station at [[Yakima, Washington|Yakima]], near [[Seattle]], for the interception of satellite communications over the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name=&quot;zdnetduncan&quot;/&gt;

In 1981, [[GCHQ]] and the [[NSA]] started the construction of the first global [[wide area network]] (WAN). Soon after [[Australia]], [[Canada]], and [[New Zealand]] joined the ECHELON system.&lt;ref name=&quot;zdnetduncan&quot;/&gt; The report to the [[European Parliament]] of 2001 states: &quot;If [[UKUSA]] states operate listening stations in the relevant regions of the earth, in principle they can intercept all [[telephone]], [[fax]], and data traffic transmitted via such satellites.&quot;&lt;ref name = EP/&gt;

Most reports on ECHELON focus on satellite interception. Testimony before the [[European Parliament]] indicated that separate but similar [[UKUSA]] systems are in place to monitor communication through undersea cables, microwave transmissions, and other lines.&lt;ref name=Hager&gt;For example: {{cite web |url=http://cryptome.org/echelon-nh.htm |title=Nicky Hager Appearance before the Euro ean Parliament ECHELON Committee |date=April 2001 |accessdate=2 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report to the [[European Parliament]] points out that interception of private communications by foreign intelligence services is not necessarily limited to the US or British foreign intelligence services.&lt;ref name = EP/&gt;

The role of satellites in point-to-point voice and data communications has largely been supplanted by [[fiber optics]]. In 2006, 99% of the world's long-distance voice and data traffic was carried over [[fiber optics|optical-fiber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.cnet.com/NSA+eavesdropping+How+it+might+work/2100-1028_3-6035910.html | title=NSA eavesdropping: How it might work | work=CNET News.com | accessdate=27 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion of international communications accounted for by [[satellite]] links is said to have decreased substantially to an amount between 0.4% and 5% in Central Europe.&lt;ref name = EP/&gt; Even in less-developed parts of the world, [[communications satellites]] are used largely for point-to-multipoint applications, such as video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.marketresearch.com/map/prod/1117944.html | title=Commercial Geostationary Satellite Transponder Markets for Latin America : Market Research Report | accessdate=27 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the majority of communications can no longer be intercepted by earth stations; they can only be collected by tapping cables and intercepting line-of-sight [[microwave]] signals, which is possible only to a limited extent.&lt;ref name = EP/&gt;

==Concerns==
[[British people|British]] journalist [[Duncan Campbell (investigative journalist)|Duncan Campbell]] and [[New Zealand]] journalist [[Nicky Hager]] asserted in the 1990s that the [[United States]] was exploiting ECHELON traffic for [[industrial espionage]], rather than military and diplomatic purposes.&lt;ref name=Hager/&gt; Examples alleged by the journalists include the gear-less wind turbine technology designed by the [[Germany|German]] firm [[Enercon]]&lt;ref name=EP /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Die Zeit: 40/1999 &quot;''Verrat unter Freunden''{{-&quot;}} (&quot;Treachery among friends&quot;, German), available at {{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/1999/40/199940.nsa_2_.xml |title=Zeit.de |accessdate=2007-08-19 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009044725/http://www.zeit.de/1999/40/199940.nsa_2_.xml |archivedate=9 October 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the speech technology developed by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] firm [[Lernout &amp; Hauspie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daanspeak.com/Hypocratie09.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208113619/http://www.daanspeak.com/Hypocratie09.html |archivedate=8 February 2012 |date=30 March 2002 |title=Amerikanen maakten met Echelon L&amp;H kapot |accessdate=28 March 2008 |publisher=daanspeak.com |url-status=dead |df=dmy }} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=nl&amp;u=http://www.daanspeak.com/Hypocratie09.html&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Google's translation of the article into English]).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the Temporary Committee on the ECHELON Interception System recommended to the [[European Parliament]] that citizens of member states routinely use [[cryptography]] in their communications to protect their privacy, because [[economic espionage]] with ECHELON has been conducted by the US intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name = EP/&gt;

American author [[James Bamford]] provides an alternative view, highlighting that legislation prohibits the use of intercepted communications for commercial purposes, although he does not elaborate on how intercepted communications are used as part of an all-source intelligence process{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}.

In its report, the committee of the [[European Parliament]] stated categorically that the Echelon network was being used to intercept not only military communications, but also private and business ones. In its epigraph to the report, the parliamentary committee quoted [[Juvenal]], &quot;''Sed quis custodiet ipsos custodes''.{{-&quot;}} (&quot;But who will watch the watchers&quot;).&lt;ref name = EP/&gt; [[James Bamford]], in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in May 2001, warned that if Echelon were to continue unchecked, it could become a &quot;cyber secret police, without courts, juries, or the right to a defence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bustillos, Maria (9 June 2013). [http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/06/a-reflection-in-the-nsas-prism.html &quot;Our reflection in the N.S.A.'s PRISM&quot;]. ''The New Yorker''. Retrieved: 2013-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alleged examples of espionage conducted by the members of the &quot;[[Five Eyes]]&quot; include:

* On behalf of the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]], the [[Communications Security Establishment]] allegedly spied on two British cabinet ministers in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thatcher 'spied on ministers'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/655996.stm|publisher=BBC|date=25 February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The US [[National Security Agency]] spied on and intercepted the phone calls of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] right until she died in a [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|Paris car crash with Dodi Fayed]] in 1997. The [[NSA]] currently holds 1,056 pages of classified information about [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]], which has been classified as [[Classified information|top secret]] &quot;because their disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the [[national security]] ... the damage would be caused not by the information about [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana]], but because the documents would disclose 'sources and methods' of US intelligence gathering&quot;.&lt;ref name=Diana01a&gt;{{cite news|last=Vernon Loeb|title=NSA Admits to Spying on Princess Diana|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/dec98/diana12.htm|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=12 December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; An official insisted that &quot;the references to Diana in intercepted conversations were 'incidental',&quot; and she was never a 'target' of the NSA eavesdropping.&lt;ref name=Diana01a/&gt;

* In the early 1990s, the US [[National Security Agency]] intercepted the communications between the [[Europe]]an aerospace company [[Airbus]] and the [[Saudi Arabia]]n national airline.

The first American [[satellite]] ground station for the ECHELON collection program was built in 1971 at a military firing and training center near [[Yakima, Washington]]. The facility, which was codenamed JACKKNIFE, was an investment of ca. 21.3 million dollars and had around 90 people. [[Satellite]] traffic was intercepted by a 30-meter single-dish antenna. The station became fully operational on 4 October 1974. It was connected with [[NSA]] headquarters at Fort Meade by a 75-baud secure Teletype orderwire channel.&lt;ref name=yrs /&gt;

In 1999 the [[Australian Senate]] [[Joint Standing Committee on Treaties]] was told by Professor [[Desmond Ball]] that the [[Pine Gap]] facility was used as a ground station for a satellite-based interception network. The satellites were said to be large radio dishes between 20 and 100 meters in diameter in [[geostationary orbit]]s. The original purpose of the network was to monitor the [[telemetry]] from 1970s [[:Category:Cold War weapons of the Soviet Union|Soviet weapons]], air defence and other radars' capabilities, satellites' ground stations' transmissions and ground-based [[Microwave transmission|microwave communications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/joint/commttee/j2408.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608040058/http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/joint/commttee/j2408.pdf |archive-date=8 June 2011 |title=Pine Gap |url-status=dead |accessdate=19 August 2016}}, Official Committee Hansard, Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, 9 August 1999.

=== Examples of industrial espionage ===
In 1999, Enercon, a [[Germany|German]] company and leading manufacturer of wind energy equipment, developed a breakthrough generator for wind turbines. After applying for a US patent, it had learned that Kenetech, an American rival, had submitted an almost identical patent application shortly before. By the statement of a former [[NSA]] employee, it was later discovered that the NSA had secretly intercepted and monitored [[Enercon]]'s data communications and conference calls and passed information regarding the new generator to Kenetech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/program/process/rapport_echelon_en.pdf|title=Report on the existence of a global system for the interception of private and commercial communications (ECHELON interception system) (2001/2098(INI))|last=Schmid|first=Gerhard|date=2001-07-11|website=|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As German intelligence services are forbidden from engaging in industrial or economic espionage, German companies are frequently complaining that this leaves them defenceless against industrial espionage from the United States. According to Wolfgang Hoffmann, a former manager at [[Bayer]], German intelligence services are aware which companies are being targeted by US intelligence agencies, but refuse to inform the companies involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/electronic-spies-torture-german-firms-1.174447|title=Electronic spies torture German firms|last=Staunton|first=Denis|date=1999-04-16|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-08-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
In the [[video game]] [[Deus Ex (video game)|''Deus Ex'']], ECHELON is a prototype for a distributed [[artificial intelligence]] system that monitors global communications and the progenitor of the AI Daedalus

The television series ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'' made recurring references to ECHELON throughout its run.

The antagonist of the anime series ''[[Digimon Tamers]]'', D-Reaper, was created by ECHELON.

''[[Echelon Conspiracy]]'', inspired by the surveillance system ECHELON, is a 2009 [[action thriller]] film directed by [[Greg Marcks]]. It tells the story of Max Peterson ([[Shane West]]), an American computer specialist who attempts to uncover a secret plot to turn the world into a global [[police state]]. After being chased down by [[NSA]] agent Raymond Burke ([[Martin Sheen]]), Peterson decides to flee to [[Moscow]].

The video game series ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell]]'' also draws inspiration from this. The series features the protagonist, [[Sam Fisher (Splinter Cell)|Sam Fisher]], a trained operative belonging to a fictional branch of the [[National Security Agency]] called Third Echelon (later, in ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist|Splinter Cell: Blacklist]]'', the unit is replaced by the Fourth Echelon).

The 2007 film ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|The Bourne Ultimatum]]'' makes several references to ECHELON. A CIA listening station in London is alerted when ECHELON detects the keyword &quot;Blackbriar&quot; in a cell phone conversation between a journalist and his editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gunn|first=Angela|title=Security goes to the movies: The Bourne Ultimatum|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9029059/Security_goes_to_the_movies_i_The_Bourne_Ultimatum_i_|work=Computerworld|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the film, [[CIA]] Deputy Director Pamela Landy requests an &quot;ECHELON package&quot; on the main character, [[Jason Bourne]].
