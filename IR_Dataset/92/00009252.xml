'''Education''' is the process of facilitating [[learning]], or the acquisition of [[knowledge]], [[skill]]s, [[values]], [[belief]]s, and [[habit (psychology)|habits.]] Educational methods include [[teaching]], [[training]], [[storytelling]], [[discussion]] and directed [[research]]. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also [[autodidacticism|educate themselves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Education can take place in [[Formality|formal]] or [[Informal education|informal]] settings and any [[experience]] that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The [[methodology]] of teaching is called [[pedagogy]].

Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as [[preschool]] or [[kindergarten]], [[primary school]], [[secondary school]] and then [[college]], [[university]], or [[apprenticeship]].

A [[right to education]] has been recognized by some governments and the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ICESCR-art13.1&quot;&gt;Article 13 of the [[United Nations]]' 1966 [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] recognizes a universal right to education. ''ICESCR'', Article 13.1&lt;/ref&gt; In most regions, education is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] up to a certain age. There is a movement for [[education reform]], and in particular for [[evidence-based education]].

==Etymology==
[[Etymologically]], the word &quot;education&quot; is derived from the Latin word ''[[wikt:en:educatio#Latin|ēducātiō]]'' (&quot;A breeding, a bringing up, a rearing&quot;) from ''[[wikt:en:educo#Latin|ēducō]]'' (&quot;I educate, I train&quot;) which is related to the [[homonym]] ''[[wikt:en:educo#Latin|ēdūcō]]'' (&quot;I lead forth, I take out; I raise up, I erect&quot;) from ''[[wikt:en:e-#Latin|ē-]]'' (&quot;from, out of&quot;) and ''[[wikt:en:duco#Latin|dūcō]]'' (&quot;I lead, I conduct&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=educate educate].

Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-[[Literacy|literate]] societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their [[knowledge]] beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Mind of Egypt: History and Meaning in the Time of the Pharaohs | author=Assmann, Jan | year=2002 | page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Ricci Guangqi 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Matteo Ricci]] (left) and [[Xu Guangqi]] (right) in the Chinese edition of ''[[Euclid's Elements]]'' published in 1607]]

[[Plato]] founded the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] in [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], the first institution of higher learning in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Br&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Plato|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Alexandria]] in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of [[Ancient Greece]]. There, the great [[Library of Alexandria]] was built in the 3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; ''A Very Short History of the World''; Penguin Books, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[China]], [[Confucius]] (551–479 BCE), of the [[State of Lu]], was the country's most influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbours like Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his [[Analects]] were written down by followers and have continued to influence education in East Asia into the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/03/150325-confucius-china-asia-philosophy-communist-party-ngbooktalk/|title=Why Is Confucius Still Relevant Today?

The [[Aztecs]] also had a well-developed theory about education, which has an equivalent word in [[Nahuatl]] called ''tlacahuapahualiztli.'' It means &quot;the art of raising or educating a person&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indigenous Education through Dance and Ceremony: A Mexica Palimpsest|last=Colin|first=Ernesto|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2014|isbn=978-1-349-47094-5|location=New York|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;the art of strengthening or bringing up men.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aztec Thought and Culture: A Study of the Ancient Nahuatl Mind|last=León-Portilla|first=Miguel|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-8061-0569-7|location=Norman|pages=134–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a broad conceptualization of education, which prescribed that it begins at home, supported by formal schooling, and reinforced by community living. Historians cite that formal education was mandatory for everyone regardless of social class and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Non-Western Educational Traditions: Alternative Approaches to Educational Thought and Practice|last=Reagan|first=Timothy|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8058-4857-1|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also the word ''neixtlamachiliztli'', which is &quot;the act of giving wisdom to the face.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; These concepts underscore a complex set of educational practices, which was oriented towards communicating to the next generation the experience and intellectual heritage of the past for the purpose of individual development and his integration into the community.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

After the [[Fall of Rome]], the [[Catholic Church]] became the sole preserver of literate scholarship in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.nature.com/soapboxscience/2011/05/18/science-owes-much-to-both-christianity-and-the-middle-ages|title=Science owes much to both Christianity and the Middle Ages : Soapbox Science|website=blogs.nature.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church established [[cathedral schools]] in the Early Middle Ages as centres of advanced education. Some of these establishments ultimately evolved into [[medieval universities]] and forebears of many of Europe's modern universities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; During the High Middle Ages, [[Chartres Cathedral]] operated the famous and influential [[School of Chartres|Chartres Cathedral School]]. The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of inquiry, and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including [[Thomas Aquinas]] of the [[University of Naples]], [[Robert Grosseteste]] of the [[University of Oxford]], an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07037a.htm |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia|title=Robert Grosseteste |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 June 1910 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Saint [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]], a pioneer of biological field research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01264a.htm |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia|title=St. Albertus Magnus |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 March 1907 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1088, the [[University of Bologne]] is considered the first, and the oldest continually operating university.&lt;ref&gt;Nuria Sanz, Sjur Bergan: &quot;The heritage of European universities&quot;, 2nd edition, Higher Education Series No. 7, Council of Europe, 2006, ISBN, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere during the Middle Ages, [[Islamic science]] and [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematics]] flourished under the Islamic [[caliphate]] which was established across the Middle East, extending from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the west to the [[Indus]] in the east and to the [[Almoravid Dynasty]] and [[Mali Empire]] in the south.

[[The Renaissance]] in Europe ushered in a [[Scientific revolution|new age of scientific and intellectual inquiry]] and appreciation of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Around 1450, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The European Age of Empires saw European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences spread out across the globe. Missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from other civilizations&amp;nbsp;– as with the [[Jesuit China missions]] who played a significant role in the transmission of knowledge, science, and culture between China and Europe, translating works from Europe like [[Euclid's Elements]] for Chinese scholars and the thoughts of [[Confucius]] for European audiences. [[The Enlightenment]] saw the emergence of a more secular educational outlook in Europe.

In most countries today, full-time education, whether at school or [[homeschooling|otherwise]], is compulsory for all children up to a certain age. Due to this the proliferation of compulsory education, combined with population growth, [[UNESCO]] has calculated that in the next 30&amp;nbsp;years more people will receive formal education than in all of human history thus far.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, K.: [http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html ''Schools Kill Creativity'']. TED Talks, 2006, Monterey, CA, US.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal education==
Formal education occurs in a [[learning environment|structured environment]] whose explicit purpose is teaching [[student]]s. Usually, formal education takes place in a [[school]] environment with [[classroom]]s of multiple students learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject. Most [[Educational management|school systems]] are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational choices in that system. Such choices include curriculum, [[school organizational models|organizational models]], design of the physical [[learning space]]s (e.g. classrooms), student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment, class size, educational activities, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://enhancinged.wgbh.org/started/what/formal.html|title = Enhancing Education|date = |accessdate = |website = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.competencecentre.eu/index.php/home/74-what-is-the-difference-between-qinformalq-and-qnon-formalq-learning|title =Perspectives Competence Centre, Lifeling Learning Programme|date =|accessdate =|website =|url-status=dead|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20141015103040/http://www.competencecentre.eu/index.php/home/74-what-is-the-difference-between-qinformalq-and-qnon-formalq-learning|archivedate =15 October 2014|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Standard Classification of Education]] (ISCED) was created by [[UNESCO]] as a statistical base to compare education systems.&lt;ref name=ISCED2011&gt; [https://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/international-standard-classification-of-education-isced-2011-en.pdf ISCED 2011 classification]&lt;/ref&gt;In 1997, it defined 7 levels of education and 25 fields, though the fields were later separated out to form a different project. The current version [[ISCED|ISCED 2011]] has 9 rather than 7 levels, created by dividing the tertiary pre-doctorate level into three levels. It also extended the lowest level (ISCED 0) to cover a new sub-category of early childhood educational development programmes, which target children below the age of 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/isced-2011-en.pdf Revision of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)], retrieved 05-04-2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early childhood education===
{{Main|Early childhood education}}
[[File:Parent's day at Eirfan's Kindergarten.jpg|thumb|Young children in a [[kindergarten]] in Japan]]
Education designed to support early development in preparation for participation in school and society. The programmes are designed for children below the age of 3. This is ISCED level 01. &lt;ref name=ISCED2011/&gt; Preschools provide education from ages approximately three to seven, depending on the country when children enter [[primary education]]. The children now readily interact with their peers and the educator.&lt;ref name=ISCED2011/&gt; These are also known as [[nursery schools]] and as [[kindergarten]], except in the US, where the term ''kindergarten'' refers to the earliest levels of primary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecs.org/kindergarten-policies/|title=50-State Comparison: State Kindergarten-Through-Third-Grade Policies|website=www.ecs.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kindergarten &quot;provide[s] a child-centred, preschool curriculum for three- to seven-year-old children that aim[s] at unfolding the child's physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each of them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ross|first=Elizabeth Dale|title=The Kindergarten Crusade: The Establishment of Preschool in the United States|year=1976|publisher=Athens: Ohio University Press|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is ISCED level 02. &lt;ref name=ISCED2011/&gt;

===Primary===
{{Main|Primary education}}
This is ISCED level 1. &lt;ref name=ISCED2011/&gt; Primary (or elementary) education consists of the first four to seven years of formal, structured education. They are typically designed to provide young children with functional [[literacy]] and [[numeracy]] skills and to is guaranteed, solid foundation for most areas of knowledge and personal and social development to support the transition to [[secondary school]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organzation [http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/international-standard-classification-of-education-isced-2011-en.pdf “ISCED 2011”]&lt;/ref&gt; In general, primary education consists of six to eight years of schooling starting at the age of five to seven, although this varies between, and sometimes within, countries. Globally, around 89% of children aged six to twelve are enrolled in primary education, and this proportion is rising.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, Education For All Monitoring Report 2008, Net Enrollment Rate in primary education&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Education For All]] programs driven by [[UNESCO]], most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary education by 2015, and in many countries, it is compulsory. The division between primary and [[secondary education]] is somewhat arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of age. Some education systems have separate [[middle school]]s, with the transition to the final stage of secondary education taking place at around the age of fifteen. Schools that provide primary education, are mostly referred to as ''primary schools ''or ''elementary schools''. Primary schools are often subdivided into [[infant school]]s and [[junior school]].

In India, for example, [[Compulsory education#Variation in countries|compulsory education]] spans over twelve years, with eight years of elementary education, five years of primary schooling and three years of upper primary schooling. Various states in the republic of India provide 12 years of compulsory school education based on a national [[curriculum]] framework designed by the [[National Council of Educational Research and Training]].

===Secondary===
{{Unreferenced|section|date=December 2019}}
{{Main|Secondary education}}
This covers the two ISCED levels, ISCED 2: Lower Secondary Education and ISCED 3: Upper Secondary Education. &lt;ref name=ISCED2011/&gt;

In most contemporary educational systems of the world, secondary education comprises the formal education that occurs during [[adolescence]].  In the United States, Canada, and [[Australia]], primary and secondary education together are sometimes referred to as [[K–12 (education)|K-12]] education, and in New Zealand Year 1–13 is used. The purpose of secondary education can be to give [[common knowledge]], to prepare for [[higher education]], or to train directly in a [[profession]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}

Secondary education in the United States did not emerge until 1910, with the rise of large corporations and advancing technology in factories, which required [[skilled worker]]s. In order to meet this new job demand, [[High school (North America)|high schools]] were created, with a curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for [[White-collar worker|white collar]] or skilled [[Blue-collar worker|blue collar]] work. This proved beneficial for both employers and employees, since the improved human capital lowered costs for the employer, while skilled employees received higher wages.{{cn|date=December 2019}}

Secondary education has a longer history in Europe, where grammar schools or academies date from as early as the 6th century, {{efn|King's School Canterbury has been in continuous existence from 597 AD}} in the form of [[Public education|public schools]], [[fee-paying school]]s, or charitable educational foundations, which themselves date even further back.&lt;!-- needs to be rewritten--&gt;{{cn|date=December 2019}}

It spans the period between the typically universal compulsory, [[primary education]] to the optional, selective [[Tertiary education|tertiary]], &quot;postsecondary&quot;, or &quot;[[Higher education|higher]]&quot; education of ISCED 5 and 6 (e.g. [[university]]), and the ISCED 4 [[Further education]] or [[vocational school]].&lt;ref name=ISCED2011/&gt;

Depending on the system, schools for this period, or a part of it, maybe called secondary or [[high school]]s, [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]], [[lyceum]]s, middle schools, [[college]]s, or vocational schools. The exact meaning of any of these terms varies from one system to another. The exact boundary between primary and secondary education also varies from country to country and even within them but is generally around the seventh to the tenth year of schooling.{{cn|date=December 2019}}

====Lower secondary education====
Programs at  ISCED level 2, lower secondary education are usually organized around a more subject-oriented curriculum; differing from primary education. Teachers typically have
pedagogical training in the specific subjects and, more often than at ISCED level 1, a class of
students will have several teachers, each with specialized knowledge of the subjects they teach.
Programmes at ISCED level 2, aim is to lay the foundation for lifelong learning and human development upon  introducing theoretical concepts across a broad range of subjects which can be developed in future stages.  Some education systems may offer vocational education programs during ISCED level 2 providing skills relevant to employment. &lt;ref name=ISCED2011/&gt;

====Upper secondary education====
Programs at ISCED level 3, or upper secondary education, are typically designed to complete the secondary education process. They lead to skills relevant to employment and the skill necessary to engage in tertiary courses. They offer students more varied, specialized and in-depth instruction. They are more differentiated, with range of options and learning streams. &lt;ref name=ISCED2011/&gt;


[[Community college]]s offer another option at this transitional stage of education. They provide nonresidential junior college courses to people living in a particular area.

===Tertiary (higher)===
{{Unreferenced|section|date=December 2019}}

[[File:Michelle Obama speaking at Peking university.jpg|thumb|Universities often host prominent guest speakers for student audiences, e.g. [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Michelle Obama]] delivering remarks at [[Peking University]], [[Beijing]], [[China]]]]
Higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or postsecondary education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school such as a high school or [[secondary school]]. Tertiary education is normally taken to include [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate education]], as well as [[vocational education|vocational education and training]]. Colleges and universities mainly provide tertiary education. Collectively, these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions. Individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive [[Academic certificate|certificates]], [[diploma]]s, or [[academic degree]]s.

The ISCED distinguishes 4 levels of tertiary education. ISCED 6 is equivalent to a first degree, ISCED 7 is equivalent to a masters or an advanced professional qualification and ISCED 8  is an advanced research qualification, usually concluding with the submission and defence of a substantive dissertation of publishable quality based on original research. &lt;ref name=ISCED&gt;{{cite web|title=International Standard Classification of EducationI S C E D 1997|url=http://www.unesco.org/education/information/nfsunesco/doc/isced_1997.htm|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=2017-03-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319192113/http://www.unesco.org/education/information/nfsunesco/doc/isced_1997.htm|archive-date=2017-03-19|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The category ISCED 5 is reserved for short-cycle courses of requiring degree level study. &lt;ref name=ISCED /&gt;

Higher education typically involves work towards a degree-level or [[foundation degree]] qualification. In most developed countries, a high proportion of the population (up to 50%) now enter higher education at some time in their lives. Higher education is therefore very important to national [[economies]], both as a significant industry in its own right and as a source of trained and educated personnel for the rest of the economy.

University education includes teaching, research, and social services activities, and it includes both the undergraduate level (sometimes referred to as [[tertiary education]]) and the [[graduate student|graduate]] (or postgraduate) level (sometimes referred to as [[graduate school]]). Some universities are composed of several colleges.

One type of university education is a [[liberal arts]] education, which can be defined as a &quot;[[college]] or [[university]] [[curriculum]] aimed at imparting broad general knowledge and developing general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional, [[vocational education|vocational]], or technical curriculum.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Liberal Arts: ''Britannica Concise Encyclopædia''| encyclopedia = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | url= http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9370154/liberal-arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although what is known today as liberal arts education began in [[Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first =Philip | last =Harriman | title = Antecedents of the Liberal Arts College| year =1935|jstor=1975506 | pages =63–71 | volume =6 | issue =2 | journal =The Journal of Higher Education | ref =harv | doi =10.2307/1975506}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term &quot;[[liberal arts college]]&quot; is more commonly associated with institutions in the [[United States]] such as [[Williams College]] or [[Barnard College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Inside Higher Ed|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/04/06/liberalarts|accessdate=2015-01-08|date=2009-04-06|first=Elizabeth|last=Redden|title=A Global Liberal Arts Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vocational===
[[File:Fotothek df n-10 0000828.jpg|thumb|Carpentry is normally learned through [[apprenticeship]] with an experienced carpenter]]
{{Main|Vocational education}}

[[Vocational education]] is a form of education focused on direct and practical training for a specific trade or craft. Vocational education may come in the form of an [[apprenticeship]] or [[internship]] as well as institutions teaching courses such as [[carpentry]], [[agriculture]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]], [[architecture]] and [[the arts]].
{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Post 16 education, [[adult education]] and [[further education]] involve continued study, but a level no different from that found at upper secondary, and are grouped together as ISCED 4, post-secondary non-tertiary education. &lt;ref name=ISCED/&gt;

===Special===
{{Main|Special education}}
In the past, those who were disabled were often not eligible for public education. Children with disabilities were repeatedly denied an education by [[physicians]] or special tutors.  These early physicians (people like [[Itard]], [[Édouard Séguin|Seguin]], [[Samuel Gridley Howe|Howe]], [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet|Gallaudet]]) set the foundation for special education today. They focused on individualized instruction and functional skills.  In its early years, special education was only provided to people with severe disabilities, but more recently it has been opened to anyone who has experienced difficulty learning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Credo Reference&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Special Education|year=2004|publisher=Oxford: Elsevier Science and Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other educational forms==
===Alternative===
{{Unreferenced|section|date=December 2019}}
{{Globalise section|US|date=February 2020}}
{{Main|Alternative education}}
While considered &quot;alternative&quot; today, most alternative systems have existed since ancient times.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}  After the public school system was widely developed beginning in the 19th century, some parents found reasons to be discontented with the new system. [[Alternative education]] developed in part as a reaction to perceived limitations and failings of [[traditional education]]. A broad range of educational approaches emerged, including [[alternative school]]s, [[autodidacticism|self learning]], [[homeschooling]], and [[unschooling]]. Example [[alternative school]]s include [[Montessori method|Montessori schools]], [[Waldorf education|Waldorf schools]] (or [[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner]] schools), [[List of Friends Schools|Friends schools]], [[Sands School]], [[Summerhill School]], [[Walden's Path]], [[The Peepal Grove School]], [[Sudbury Valley School]], [[Jiddu Krishnamurti|Krishnamurti schools]], and [[open classroom]] schools.

In time, some ideas from these experiments and paradigm challenges may be adopted as the norm in education, just as [[Friedrich Fröbel]]'s approach to [[early childhood education]] in 19th-century Germany has been incorporated into contemporary [[kindergarten]] classrooms.

===Indigenous===
[[File:Schoolyard essay2.JPG|thumb|alt=Na Schoolyard.|[[Indigenous education|Teaching indigenous knowledge]], models, and methods in [[Yanyuan County]], [[Sichuan]], China]]
{{Main|Indigenous education}}
[[Indigenous education]] refers to the inclusion of indigenous knowledge, models, methods, and content within formal and non-formal educational systems. Often in a post-colonial context, the growing recognition and use of indigenous education methods can be a response to the erosion and loss of indigenous knowledge and language through the processes of colonialism. Furthermore, it can enable indigenous communities to &quot;reclaim and revalue their languages and cultures, and in so doing, improve the educational success of indigenous students.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=3099875|author1=May, S.  |author2=Aikman, S. |title=Indigenous Education: Addressing Current Issues and Developments|journal=Comparative Education|volume= 39|issue=2 |year=2003|pages= 139–45|doi=10.1080/03050060302549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Informal learning===
{{main|Informal learning}}
'''Informal learning''' is one of three forms of learning defined by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD). Informal learning occurs in a variety of places, such as at [[home]], [[employment|work]], and through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society.  For many learners, this includes [[language acquisition]], [[cultural norm]]s, and [[manners]].

In informal learning, there is often a reference person, a peer or expert, to guide the learner.  If learners have a personal interest in what they are informally being taught, learners tend to expand their existing knowledge and conceive new ideas about the topic being learned.&lt;ref name=Rogoff&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3102/0091732X16680994 | volume=40 | title=The Organization of Informal Learning | year=2016 | journal=Review of Research in Education | pages=356–401 | last1 = Rogoff | first1 = Barbara | last2 = Callanan | first2 = Maureen | last3 = Gutiérrez | first3 = Kris D. | last4 = Erickson | first4 = Frederick}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a museum is traditionally considered an informal learning environment, as there is room for free choice, a diverse and potentially non-standardized range of topics, flexible structures, socially rich interaction, and no externally imposed assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1017/cbo9781139519526.028 | title=Informal Learning in Museums | journal=The Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences | pages=461–478 | last1 = Crowley | first1 = Kevin | last2 = Pierroux | first2 = Palmyre | last3 = Knutson | first3 = Karen| year=2014 | isbn=978-1-139-51952-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While informal learning often takes place outside educational [[school|establishments]] and does not follow a specified curriculum, it can also occur within educational settings and even during formal learning situations. Educators can structure their lessons to directly utilize their students informal learning skills within the education setting.&lt;ref name=Rogoff/&gt;

In the late 19th century, education through play began to be recognized as making an important contribution to child development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first =GH | last =Mead | title = The Relation of Play to Education| journal = University Record| year =1896| pages =141–45 | volume =1 | url=http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/Mead/pubs/Mead_1896.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, the concept was broadened to include young adults but the emphasis was on physical activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first =GE | last =Johnson | title = Education through recreation| publisher = Cleveland Foundation, Ohio| year =1916|  url=https://archive.org/stream/educationthrough00johnuoft#page/n5/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[L.P. Jacks]], also an early proponent of lifelong learning, described education through recreation: &quot;A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play, his labour and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself, he always seems to be doing both. Enough for him that he does it well.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =LP | last =Jacks | title = Education through recreation| publisher = New York: Harper and Brothers| year =1932| pages =1–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Education through recreation is the opportunity to learn in a seamless fashion through all of life's activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullah 2012 165–170&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | first =Sha | last =Ullah | title =Learning surgically oriented anatomy in a student-run extracurricular club: an education through recreation initiative | journal =Anat Sci Educ | year =2012 | pages =165–70 | volume =5 | pmid =22434649 | doi =10.1002/ase.1273 | url =http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=1&amp;article=1175&amp;context=vivianmcalister&amp;type=additional | last2 =Bodrogi | first2 =Andrew | last3 =Cristea | first3 =Octav | last4 =Johnson | first4 =Marjorie | last5 =McAlister | first5 =Vivian C. | issue =3 | access-date =3 January 2013 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130402202832/http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=1&amp;article=1175&amp;context=vivianmcalister&amp;type=additional | archive-date =2 April 2013 | url-status =dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been revived by the [[University of Western Ontario]] to teach [[anatomy]] to medical students.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullah 2012 165–170&quot;/&gt;

===Self-directed learning===
{{Main|Autodidacticism}}
[[Autodidacticism]] (also autodidactism) is self-directed learning. One may become an autodidact at nearly any point in one's life. [[List of autodidacts|Notable autodidacts]] include [[Abraham Lincoln]] (U.S. president), [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] (mathematician), [[Michael Faraday]] (chemist and physicist), [[Charles Darwin]] (naturalist), [[Thomas Alva Edison]] (inventor), [[Tadao Ando]] (architect), [[George Bernard Shaw]] (playwright), [[Frank Zappa]] (composer, recording engineer, film director), and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (engineer, scientist, mathematician).{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

===Evidence-based education===
{{Main|Evidence-based education}}
Evidence-based education is the use of well designed scientific studies to determine which education methods work best. It consists of evidence-based teaching and evidence-based learning. [[Evidence-based learning]] methods such as [[spaced repetition]] can increase rate of learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smolen |first1=Paul |last2=Zhang |first2=Yili |last3=Byrne |first3=John H. |title=The right time to learn: mechanisms and optimization of spaced learning |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |date=25 January 2016 |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=77–88 |doi=10.1038/nrn.2015.18 |pmid=26806627 |pmc=5126970 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence-based education movement has its roots in the larger movement towards [[Evidence-based practice|evidence-based-practices]].{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

===Open education and electronic technology===
{{main|Open education|Educational technology}}

Many large university institutions are now starting to offer free or almost free full courses such as [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] teaming up to form [[edX]]. Other universities offering open education are prestigious private universities such as [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Duke University|Duke]], [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]], the [[University of Pennsylvania|University of Pennylvania]], and [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], as well as notable public universities including [[Tsinghua University|Tsinghua]], [[Peking University|Peking]], [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], [[University of Michigan]], and [[University of Virginia]].

The conventional merit-system degree is currently not as common in open education as it is in campus universities, although some [[open universities]] do already offer conventional degrees such as the [[Open University]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Presently, many of the major open education sources offer their own form of certificate. Due to the popularity of open education, these new kind of academic certificates are gaining more respect and equal &quot;[[Academic capital|academic value]]&quot; to traditional degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.good.is/posts/is-the-certificate-the-new-college-degree |title=Is the Certificate the New College Degree?  |publisher=Good.is |date=8 June 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education sector ==
[[File:北师大西门.jpg|thumb|[[Beijing Normal University]], which is governed directly by the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Ministry of Education]], is an example of collaboration between different entities in the education sector]]
The education sector or education system is a group of institutions (ministries of education, local educational authorities, teacher training institutions, schools, universities, etc.) whose primary purpose is to provide education to children and young people in educational settings. It involves a wide range of people ([[curriculum]] developers, inspectors, school principals, teachers, school nurses, students, etc.). These institutions can vary according to different contexts.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002447/244756e.pdf|title=Out in the Open: Education sector responses to violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression|last=UNESCO|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100150-5|location=|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools deliver education, with support from the rest of the education system through various elements such as [[Education policy|education policies]] and guidelines – to which school policies can refer – curricula and learning materials, as well as pre- and in-service teacher training programmes. The school environment – both physical (infrastructures) and psychological (school climate) – is also guided by school policies that should ensure the well-being of students when they are in school.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] has found that schools tend to perform best when principals have full authority and responsibility for ensuring that students are proficient in core subjects upon graduation. They must also seek feedback from students for quality-assurance and improvement. Governments should limit themselves to monitoring student proficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* national leadership and ownership should be the touchstone of any intervention;
* strategies must be context relevant and context specific;
* plans should employ an integrated set of complementary interventions, though implementation may need to proceed in steps;
* partners should commit to a long-term investment in capacity development while working towards some short-term achievements;
* outside intervention should be conditional on an impact assessment of national capacities at various levels;
* a certain percentage of students should be removed for improvisation of academics (usually practiced in schools, after 10th grade).

===Internationalization===
Nearly every country now has [[universal primary education]].

Similarities – in systems or even in ideas – that schools share internationally have led to an increase in international student exchanges. The European [[Erasmus Programme|Socrates-Erasmus Programme]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erasmus.ac.uk |title=Socrates-Erasmus Program |publisher=Erasmus.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; facilitates exchanges across European universities. The [[Soros Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soros.org/ |title=Soros Foundation |publisher=Soros.org |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides many opportunities for students from central Asia and eastern Europe. Programs such as the [[International Baccalaureate]] have contributed to the internationalization of education. The global campus online, led by American universities, allows free access to class materials and lecture files recorded during the actual classes.

The [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] and the [[International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement]] objectively monitor and compare the proficiency of students from a wide range of different nations.

The internationalization of education is sometimes equated by critics with the westernization of education. These critics say that the internationalization of education leads to the erosion of local education systems and indigenous values and norms, which are replaced with Western systems and cultural and ideological values and orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sperduti|first1=Vanessa|date= 2017 |title=Internationalization as Westernization in Higher Education |url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59de47487131a5734282c4b7/t/5b86e96788251bfd43570fba/1535568231967/VSperduti+Spring+2017.pdf|journal= Comparative &amp; International Education 9 (2017)|volume= 9 |pages= 9–12|accessdate=2018-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding in developing countries===
A survey of literature of the research into low-cost private schools (LCPS)  found that over 5 year period to July 2013, debate around LCPSs to achieving [[Education for All]] (EFA) objectives was polarized and finding growing coverage in international policy.&lt;ref name=eldis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eldis.org/go/display&amp;type=Document&amp;id=65993|title=Low-cost private schools: evidence, approaches and emerging issues|publisher=Eldis|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The polarization was due to disputes around whether the schools are affordable for the poor, reach disadvantaged groups, provide quality education, support or undermine equality, and are financially sustainable. The report examined the main challenges encountered by development organizations which support LCPSs.&lt;ref name=eldis/&gt; Surveys suggest these types of schools are expanding across Africa and Asia. This success is attributed to excess demand. These surveys found concern for:
* Equity: This concern is widely found in the literature, suggesting the growth in low-cost private schooling may be exacerbating or perpetuating already existing inequalities in developing countries, between urban and rural populations, lower- and higher-income families, and between girls and boys. The report findings suggest that girls may be under represented and that LCPS are reaching low-income families in smaller numbers than higher-income families.&lt;ref name=eldis/&gt;
* Quality and educational outcomes: It is difficult to generalize about the quality of private schools. While most achieve better results than government counterparts, even after their social background is taken into account, some studies find the opposite. Quality in terms of levels of teacher absence, teaching activity, and pupil to teacher ratios in some countries are better in LCPSs than in government schools.&lt;ref name=eldis/&gt;
* Choice and affordability for the poor: Parents can choose private schools because of perceptions of better-quality teaching and facilities, and an English language instruction preference. Nevertheless, the concept of 'choice' does not apply in all contexts, or to all groups in society, partly because of limited affordability (which excludes most of the poorest) and other forms of exclusion, related to caste or social status.&lt;ref name=eldis/&gt;
* Cost-effectiveness and financial sustainability: There is evidence that private schools operate at low cost by keeping teacher salaries low, and their financial situation may be precarious where they are reliant on fees from low-income households.&lt;ref name=eldis/&gt;

The report showed some cases of successful voucher where there was an oversupply of quality private places and an efficient administrative authority and  of subsidy programs. Evaluations of the effectiveness of international support to the sector are rare.&lt;ref name=eldis/&gt;Addressing regulatory ineffectiveness is a key challenge. Emerging approaches stress the importance of understanding the political economy of the market for LCPS, specifically how relationships of power and accountability between users, government, and private providers can produce better education outcomes for the poor.&lt;ref name=eldis/&gt;

===Educational psychology===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}
{{Main|Educational psychology}}
[[Educational psychology]] is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the [[social psychology]] of [[school]]s as [[organization]]s.  The terms &quot;educational psychology&quot; and &quot;school psychology&quot; are often used interchangeably.  Educational psychology is concerned with the processes of educational attainment in the general population and in sub-populations such as [[gifted]] children and those with specific [[disabilities]].
[[File:2013. Донецк 336.jpg|thumb|Knowledge Day in [[Donetsk]], [[Ukraine]], 2013]]
Educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. It is informed primarily by [[psychology]], bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between [[medicine]] and [[biology]]. Educational psychology, in turn, informs a wide range of specialties within educational studies, including [[instructional design]], [[educational technology]], curriculum development, [[organizational learning]], [[special education]] and [[classroom management]]. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to [[cognitive science]] and the [[learning sciences]]. In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks (Lucas, Blazek, &amp; Raley, 2006).

===The intelligence–education relationship===
{{Main|Psychology of education}}
[[Intelligence]] is an important factor in how the individual responds to education. Those who have higher intelligence tend to perform better at school and go on to higher levels of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butler | first1 = S. | last2 = Marsh | first2 = H. | last3 = Sheppard | first3 = J. | year = 1985 | title = Seven year longitudinal study of the early prediction of reading achievement | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 77 | issue = 3| pages = 349–61 | doi=10.1037/0022-0663.77.3.349}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is also observable in the opposite direction, in that education increases measurable intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baltes | first1 = P. | last2 = Reinert | first2 = G. | year = 1969 | title = Cohort effects in cognitive development in children as revealed by cross sectional sequences | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 169–77 | doi=10.1037/h0026997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that while educational attainment is important in predicting intelligence in later life, intelligence at 53 is more closely correlated to intelligence at 8 years old than to educational attainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richards | first1 = M. | last2 = Sacker | first2 = A. | year = 2003 | title = Lifetime Antecedents of Cognitive Reserve | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology | volume = 25 | issue = 5| pages = 614–24 | doi=10.1076/jcen.25.5.614.14581| pmid = 12815499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning modalities===
There has been much interest in learning modalities and styles over the last two decades. The most commonly employed learning modalities are:&lt;ref&gt;Swassing, R. H., Barbe, W. B., &amp; Milone, M. N. (1979). ''The Swassing-Barbe Modality Index: Zaner-Bloser Modality Kit''. Columbus, OH: Zaner-Bloser.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Visual]]: learning based on observation and seeing what is being learned.
* [[Hearing (sense)|Auditory]]: learning based on listening to instructions/information.
* [[Kinesthetic]]: learning based on movement, e.g. hands-on work and engaging in activities.

Other commonly employed modalities include [[music]]al, [[interpersonal]], [[Verbal reasoning|verbal]], [[logical]], and [[intrapersonal]].

[[Howard Gardner]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomasarmstrong.com/multiple_intelligences.htm Thomas Armstrong's website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321191627/http://www.thomasarmstrong.com/multiple_intelligences.htm |date=21 March 2009 }} detailing Multiple Intelligences&lt;/ref&gt; identified a wide range of modalities in his [[Multiple Intelligences]] theories. The [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]] and [[Keirsey Temperament Sorter]], based on the works of [[Jung]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keirsey.com/ |title=Keirsey web-site |publisher=Keirsey.com | accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; focus on understanding how people's personality affects the way they interact personally, and how this affects the way individuals respond to each other within the learning environment. The work of [[David Kolb]] and [[Anthony Gregorc]]'s Type Delineator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.algonquincollege.com/edtech/gened/styles.html |title=Type Delineator description |publisher=Algonquincollege.com |accessdate=2009-04-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301064219/http://algonquincollege.com/edtech/gened/styles.html |archivedate=1 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; follows a similar but more simplified approach.

Some theories propose that all individuals benefit from a variety of learning modalities, while others suggest that individuals may have preferred learning styles, learning more easily through visual or kinesthetic experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Barbe, W. B., &amp; Swassing, R. H., with M. N. Milone. (1979). ''Teaching through modality strengths: Concepts and practices''. Columbus, OH: Zaner-Bloser&lt;/ref&gt; A consequence of the latter theory is that effective teaching should present a variety of teaching methods which cover all three learning modalities so that different students have equal opportunities to learn in a way that is effective for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C005704/content_hwl_learningmodalities.php3 |title=Learning modality description from the Learning Curve website |publisher=Library.thinkquest.org |accessdate=2010-06-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404234142/http://library.thinkquest.org/C005704/content_hwl_learningmodalities.php3 |archivedate=4 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guy Claxton has questioned the extent that [[learning styles]] such as Visual, Auditory and Kinesthetic(VAK) are helpful, particularly as they can have a tendency to label children and therefore restrict learning.&lt;ref name=&quot;titleGuy Claxton speaking on What's The Point of School&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dystalk.com/talks/49-whats-the-point-of-school |title=Guy Claxton speaking on What's The Point of School?|publisher=dystalk.com |accessdate=2009-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Learner%20Responsibility.pdf | title = Learner Responsibility in Management Education, or Ventures into Forbidden Research (with Comments) | author = J.

===Philosophy===
[[File:LockeEducation1693.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[John Locke]]'s work ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'' was written in 1693 and still reflects traditional education priorities in the Western world.]]
{{Main|Philosophy of education}}
As an academic field, philosophy of education is &quot;the philosophical study of education and its problems&amp;nbsp;(...) its central subject matter is education, and its methods are those of [[philosophy]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=NoddingsPOE&gt;{{Cite book| last = Noddings| first = Nel| title = Philosophy of Education| publisher = Westview Press| year = 1995| location = Boulder, CO| isbn = 978-0-8133-8429-0| page = [https://archive.org/details/philosophyofeduc00nodd/page/1 1]| ref = harv| url = https://archive.org/details/philosophyofeduc00nodd/page/1}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The philosophy of education may be either the philosophy of the process of education or the philosophy of the discipline of education. That is, it may be part of the discipline in the sense of being concerned with the aims, forms, methods, or results of the process of educating or being educated; or it may be metadisciplinary in the sense of being concerned with the concepts, aims, and methods of the discipline.&quot;&lt;ref name=POEE&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Frankena | first1 = William K. | last2 = Raybeck | first2 = Nathan | last3 = Burbules | first3 = Nicholas | contribution = Philosophy of Education | year = 2002 | title = Encyclopedia of Education, 2nd edition | editor-last = Guthrie | editor-first = James W. | place = New York, NY | publisher = Macmillan Reference | isbn= 978-0-02-865594-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it is both part of the field of education and a field of [[applied philosophy]], drawing from fields of [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[axiology]] and the philosophical approaches (speculative, prescriptive or [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]]) to address questions in and about [[pedagogy]], [[education policy]], and [[curriculum]], as well as the process of [[learning theory (education)|learning]], to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Noddings|1995|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it might study what constitutes upbringing and education, the values and norms revealed through upbringing and educational practices, the limits and legitimization of education as an academic discipline, and the relation between [[education theory]] and practice.

===Purpose of education===
There is no broad consensus as to what education's chief aim or aims are or should be. Different places, and at different times, have used educational systems for different purposes.  The [[Prussian education system]] in the 19th century, for example, wanted to turn boys and girls into adults who would serve the state's political goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eEOLV_TtNfQC|title=Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600-1947|last=Clark|first=Christopher|date=2007-09-06|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=978-0-14-190402-3|location=|pages=|language=en|quote=The emancipated citizens who emerged from every level of Humboldt's educational system were expected to take an active part in the political life of the Prussian state.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mommsen|first=Peter|date=Winter 2019|title=The Community of Education|url=https://www.plough.com/en/topics/community/education/editors-letter-issue-19|journal=Plough Quarterly|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors stress its value to the individual, emphasizing its potential for positively influencing students' personal development, promoting autonomy, forming a cultural identity or establishing a career or occupation. Other authors emphasize education's contributions to societal purposes, including good citizenship, shaping students into productive members of society, thereby promoting society's general economic development, and preserving cultural values.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Winch and John Gingell, ''Philosophy of Education: The Key Concepts'' (2nd edition). London:Routledge, 2008. pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of education in a given time and place affects who is taught, what is taught, and how the education system behaves.  For example, in the 21st century, many countries treat education as a [[positional good]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=March 2016|editor-last=Park|editor-first=Hyunjoon|editor2-last=Shavit|editor2-first=Yossi|title=Special Issue: Education as a Positional Good|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/research-in-social-stratification-and-mobility/vol/43/suppl/C|journal=Research in Social Stratification and Mobility|volume=43 (supplement)|pages=1–70|issn=0276-5624|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this competitive approach, people want their own students to get a better education than other students.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;  This approach can lead to unfair treatment of some students, especially those from disadvantaged or marginalized groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;  For example, in this system, a city's school system may draw school district boundaries so that nearly all the students in one school are from low-income families, and that nearly all the students in the neighboring schools come from more affluent families, even though concentrating low-income students in one school results in worse educational achievement for the entire school system.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

===Curriculum===
{{Main|Curriculum|Curriculum theory|List of academic disciplines}}
In formal education, a [[curriculum]] is the set of courses and their content offered at a [[school]] or [[university]]. As an idea, '''curriculum''' stems from the [[Latin]] word for ''[[race course]]'', referring to the course of [[wikt:deed|deeds]] and experiences through which [[child]]ren grow to become mature [[adult]]s. A curriculum is prescriptive and is based on a more general [[syllabus]] which merely specifies what topics must be understood and to what level to achieve a particular grade or standard.

An [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]] is a branch of knowledge which is formally taught, either at the university – or via some other such method. Each discipline usually has several sub-disciplines or branches, and distinguishing lines are often both arbitrary and ambiguous. Examples of broad areas of academic disciplines include the [[natural science]]s, [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[social science]]s, [[humanities]] and [[applied science]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk/Default.htm |title=Examples of subjects |publisher=Curriculumonline.gov.uk |accessdate=2009-04-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821105825/http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk/default.htm |archivedate=21 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instruction===
Instruction is the facilitation of another's learning. Instructors in primary and secondary institutions are often called [[teacher]]s, and they direct the education of [[student]]s and might draw on many [[course (education)|subjects]] like [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[writing]], [[mathematics]], [[science]] and [[history]]. Instructors in post-secondary institutions might be called [[teacher]]s, instructors, or [[professor]]s, depending on the type of institution; and they primarily teach only their specific discipline. Studies {{which|date=October 2019}}from the United States suggest that the quality of teachers is the single most important factor affecting student performance, and that countries which score highly on international tests have multiple policies in place to ensure that the teachers they employ are as effective as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Winters |first=Marcus |title=Teachers Matter: Rethinking How Public Schools Identify, Reward, and Retain Great Educators |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |page=160 |isbn=978-1-4422-1077-6|year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WRS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mckinsey.com/App_Media/Reports/SSO/Worlds_School_Systems_Final.pdf |title=How the world's best-performing school systems come out on top |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927092821/http://www.mckinsey.com/App_Media/Reports/SSO/Worlds_School_Systems_Final.pdf |archive-date=27 September 2011 |website=mckinsey.com |date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the passing of NCLB in the United States (No Child Left Behind), teachers must be highly qualified.&lt;!-- A popular way to gauge teaching performance is to use student evaluations of teachers (SETS), but these evaluations have been criticized for being counterproductive to learning and inaccurate due to student bias.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113 |title=Natural Learning in Higher Education |author=J.

It has been argued that high rates of education are essential for countries to be able to achieve high levels of [[economic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Eric A.

However, [[technology transfer]] requires knowledgeable managers and engineers who are able to operate new machines or production practices borrowed from the leader in order to close the gap through imitation.

The emphasis is therefore shifting to teaching the skills of learning: to picking up new knowledge quickly and in as agile a way as possible.{{cn|date=December 2019}}  Finnish schools have even begun to move away from the regular subject-focused curricula, introducing instead developments like phenomenon-based learning, where students study concepts like [[climate change education|climate change]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oph.fi/english/curricula_and_qualifications/basic_education/curricula_2014|title=Finnish National Agency for Education - Curricula 2014|website=www.oph.fi|access-date=1 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901112205/http://www.oph.fi/english/curricula_and_qualifications/basic_education/curricula_2014|archive-date=1 September 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also active [[Educational interventions for first-generation students|educational interventions]] to implement programs and paths specific to non-traditional students, such as [[First-generation college students in the United States|first generation students]].

Education is also becoming{{when|date=February 2020}} a commodity no longer reserved for children.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}  Adults need it too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sitra.fi/en/articles/for-many-people-flexibility-at-work-can-be-a-liberation-matthew-taylor-chief-executive-royal-society-of-arts/|title=For many people, flexibility at work can be a liberation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some governmental bodies, like the Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra in Finland, have even proposed compulsory lifelong education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sitra.fi/en/articles/compulsory-education-last-lifetime/|title=Could compulsory education last a lifetime? - Sitra}}&lt;/ref&gt;
