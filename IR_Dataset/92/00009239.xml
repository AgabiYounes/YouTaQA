'''Europe''' is a [[continent]] located entirely in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and mostly in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]].  It comprises the westernmost part of [[Eurasia]] and is bordered by the [[Arctic Ocean]] to the north, the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west, the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south, and [[Asia]] to the east. The eastern border comprises a long and mixed line of mountain ranges and waterways that would normally define a subcontinent. However, Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of history and tradition. It is the 6th largest continent in the world.
Europe is commonly considered to be [[Borders of the continents#Europe and Asia|separated from Asia]] by the [[drainage divide|watershed divides]] of the [[Ural Mountains|Ural]] and [[Caucasus Mountains]], the [[Ural River]], the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea|Black]] Seas and the waterways of the [[Turkish Straits]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NatlGeoAtlas&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=National Geographic Atlas of the World|edition=7th|year=1999|location=Washington, DC|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|isbn=978-0-7922-7528-2}} &quot;Europe&quot; (pp. 68–69); &quot;Asia&quot; (pp. 90–91): &quot;A commonly accepted division between Asia and Europe&amp;nbsp;... is formed by the Ural Mountains, Ural River, Caspian Sea, Caucasus Mountains, and the Black Sea with its outlets, the Bosporus and Dardanelles.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Europe covers about {{convert|10,180,000|km2|sqmi}}, or 2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of land area). Politically, Europe is divided into about [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe|fifty sovereign states]] of which [[Russia]] is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population. Europe had a [[Demographics of Europe|total population]] of about 741 million (about 11% of the [[world population]]) {{As of|{{UN_Population|Year}}|lc=y}}.{{UN_Population|ref}} The [[European climate]] is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent, even at [[latitudes]] along which the climate in Asia and [[North America]] is severe. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast.

Europe, in particular [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], was the birthplace of [[Western civilization|Western civilisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Wigen|1997|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kim Covert|title=Ancient Greece: Birthplace of Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KVMYJNvUiYkC&amp;pg=PP5|year=2011|publisher=Capstone|isbn=978-1-4296-6831-6|page=5|quote=Ancient Greece is often called the cradle of western civilization. ...

[[Renaissance humanism]], [[Renaissance exploration|exploration]], [[Renaissance art|art]] and [[Renaissance science|science]] led to the [[modern era]]. Since the [[Age of Discovery]] started by [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]] and [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], Europe played a predominant role in global affairs. Between the 16th and 20th centuries, [[List of former European colonies|European powers controlled]] at various times the [[Americas]], almost all of Africa and [[Oceania]] and the majority of Asia.

The [[Age of Enlightenment]], the subsequent [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] shaped the continent culturally, politically and economically from the end of the 17th century until the first half of the 19th century. The [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] at the end of the 18th century, gave rise to radical economic, cultural and social change in [[Western Europe]] and eventually the wider world. Both [[world war]]s took place for the most part in Europe, contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] took prominence.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 534&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 534.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Cold War]], Europe was divided along the [[Iron Curtain]] between [[NATO]] in the West and the [[Warsaw Pact]] in the East, until the [[revolutions of 1989]] and [[Berlin Wall#Fall of the Wall|fall of the Berlin Wall]].

In 1949 the [[Council of Europe]] was founded with the idea of unifying Europe to achieve common goals. Further [[European integration]] by some states led to the formation of the [[European Union]] (EU), a separate political entity that lies between a [[confederation]] and a [[federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ies.ee/iesp/No11/articles/03_Gabriel_Hazak.pdf|title=The European union—a federation or a confederation?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU originated in Western Europe but has been [[Enlargement of the European Union|expanding eastward]] since the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. The currency of most countries of the European Union, the [[euro]], is the most commonly used among Europeans; and the EU's [[Schengen Area]] abolishes border and immigration controls between most of its member states.

In classical [[Greek mythology]], [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] ({{lang-grc|Εὐρώπη}}, ''Eurṓpē'') was a [[Phoenicia]]n princess. The word Europe is derived from her name. The name contains the elements εὐρύς (''eurús''), &quot;wide, broad&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Deu%29ru%2Fs εὐρύς], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus.&lt;/ref&gt; and ὤψ (''ōps'', gen. ὠπός, ''ōpós'') &quot;eye, face, countenance&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dw%29%2Fy ὤψ], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus.&lt;/ref&gt; hence their composite ''Eurṓpē'' would mean &quot;wide-gazing&quot; or &quot;broad of aspect&quot;. ''Broad'' has been an [[epithet]] of Earth herself in the reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] and the poetry devoted to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=M.L. West |title=Indo-European poetry and myth |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2007 |pages=178–179 |isbn=978-0-19-928075-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been attempts to connect ''Eurṓpē'' to a Semitic term for &quot;west&quot;, this being either [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''erebu'' meaning &quot;to go down, set&quot; (said of the sun) or [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] '' 'ereb'' &quot;evening, west&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Europe &quot;Europe&quot;] in the ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; which is at the origin of Arabic [[Maghreb]] and Hebrew ''ma'arav''. [[Michael A. Barry]], professor in [[Princeton University]]'s Near Eastern Studies Department, finds the mention of the word ''Ereb'' on an [[Assyria]]n [[stele]] with the meaning of &quot;night, [the country of] sunset&quot;, in opposition to ''Asu'' &quot;[the country of] sunrise&quot;, i.e. Asia. The same naming motive according to &quot;cartographic convention&quot; appears in Greek Ἀνατολή (''Anatolḗ'' &quot;[sun] rise&quot;, &quot;east&quot;, hence [[Anatolia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Barry: &quot;L'Europe et son mythe : à la poursuite du couchant&quot;. In: ''Revue des deux Mondes'' (November/December 1999) p. 110. {{ISBN|978-2-7103-0937-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Litchfield West]] stated that &quot;phonologically, the match between Europa's name and any form of the Semitic word is very poor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=M.L. West |title=The east face of Helicon: west Asiatic elements in Greek poetry and myth |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |year=1997 |page=451 |isbn=978-0-19-815221-7 |oclc= |doi=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Next to these hypotheses there is also a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;regʷos'', meaning &quot;darkness&quot;, which also produced Greek ''[[Erebus]]''.

Most major world languages use words derived from ''Eurṓpē'' or ''Europa'' to refer to the continent. Chinese, for example, uses the word ''Ōuzhōu'' (歐洲/欧洲); a similar Chinese-derived term {{nihongo||欧州|Ōshū}} is also sometimes used in Japanese such as in the Japanese name of the European Union, {{nihongo||欧州連合|Ōshū Rengō}}, despite the [[katakana]] {{nihongo||ヨーロッパ|Yōroppa}} being more commonly used. In some Turkic languages the originally Persian name ''[[Frangistan]]'' (&quot;land of the [[Franks]]&quot;) is used casually in referring to much of Europe, besides official names such as ''Avrupa'' or ''Evropa''.&lt;ref name=&quot;davison&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Davidson, Roderic H. |title=Where is the Middle East?|jstor=20029452 |journal=Foreign Affairs |volume=38|issue=4 |pages=665–675 |year=1960|doi=10.2307/20029452 |ref=harv|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b0f99025d232494803f84f1a4578d7a11dcf1be2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevalent definition of Europe as a geographical term has been in use since the mid-19th century.
Europe is taken to be bounded by large bodies of water to the north, west and south; Europe's limits to the far east are usually taken to be the Urals, the [[Ural River]], and the [[Caspian Sea]]; to the southeast, including the [[Caucasus Mountains]], the [[Black Sea]] and the waterways connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encarta&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopaedia 2007 |title=Europe |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopaedia_761570768/Europe.html |accessdate=27 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028013857/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570768/Europe.html |archivedate=28 October 2009 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islands are generally grouped with the nearest continental landmass, hence [[Iceland]] is considered to be part of Europe, while the nearby island of [[Greenland]] is usually assigned to [[North America]], although politically belonging to [[Denmark]]. Nevertheless, there are some exceptions based on sociopolitical and cultural differences. [[Cyprus]] is closest to [[Anatolia|Anatolia (or Asia Minor)]], but is considered part of Europe politically and it is a member state of the EU. [[Malta]] was considered an island of [[Northwest Africa]] for centuries, but now it is considered to be part of Europe as well.&lt;ref&gt;Falconer, William; Falconer, Thomas. [https://books.google.com/books?id=B3Q29kWRdtgC&amp;pg=PA50 ''Dissertation on St. Paul's Voyage''], BiblioLife (BiblioBazaar), 1872. (1817.), p. 50, {{ISBN|1-113-68809-2}} ''These islands Pliny, as well as Strabo and Ptolemy, included in the African sea''&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;Europe&quot; as used specifically in [[British English]] may also refer to [[Continental Europe]] exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=europe|title=Europe&amp;nbsp;— Noun|publisher=Princeton University|accessdate=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;continent&quot; usually implies the [[physical geography]] of a large land mass completely or almost completely surrounded by water at its borders. However the Europe-Asia part of the border is somewhat arbitrary and inconsistent with this definition because of its partial adherence to the Ural and Caucasus Mountains rather than a series of partly joined waterways suggested by cartographer [[Herman Moll]] in 1715. These water divides extend with a few relatively small interruptions (compared to the aforementioned mountain ranges) from the Turkish straits running into the Mediterranean Sea to the upper part of the [[Ob River]] that drains into the [[Arctic Ocean]]. Prior to the adoption of the current convention that includes mountain divides, the border between Europe and Asia had been redefined several times since its first conception in [[classical antiquity]], but always as a series of rivers, seas, and straits without mountains that were believed to extend an unknown distance east and north from the Mediterranean Sea.

The current division of Eurasia into two continents now reflects [[East–West dichotomy|East-West]] cultural, linguistic and ethnic differences which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. The geographic border between Europe and Asia does not follow any state boundaries and now only follows a few bodies of water. [[Turkey]] is generally considered a [[list of transcontinental countries|transcontinental country]] divided entirely by water, while [[Russia]] and [[Kazakhstan]] are only partly divided by waterways. [[France]], [[Portugal]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom]] are also transcontinental (or more properly, intercontinental, when oceans or large seas are involved) in that their main land areas are in Europe while pockets of their territories are located in other [[continents]] separated from Europe by large bodies of water.  [[Spain]], for example, has territories south of the Mediterranean Sea namely [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] which are parts of [[Africa]] and share a border with [[Morocco]].  According to the current convention, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] are transcontinental countries where waterways have been completely replaced by mountains as the divide between continents.

===History of the concept===
[[File:T and O map Guntherus Ziner 1472.jpg|thumb|A medieval [[T and O map]] printed by [[Günther Zainer]] in 1472, showing the three continents as domains of the sons of [[Noah]] — Asia to Sem ([[Shem]]), Europe to Iafeth ([[Japheth]]), and Africa to Cham ([[Ham, son of Noah|Ham]])]]

====Early history====
The first recorded usage of ''Eurṓpē'' as a geographic term is in the [[Homeric Hymn]] to [[Delian Apollo]], in reference to the western shore of the [[Aegean Sea]]. As a name for a part of the known world, it is first used in the 6th century BC by [[Anaximander]] and [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]]. Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (the modern [[Rioni River]] on the territory of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) in the Caucasus, a convention still followed by [[Herodotus]] in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 4.38. C.f. James Rennell, ''The geographical system of Herodotus examined and explained'', Volume 1, Rivington 1830, [https://books.google.com/books?id=enQ-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA244 p. 244]&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts, Europe, Asia, and Libya (Africa), with the [[Nile]] and the Phasis forming their boundaries—though he also states that some considered the [[Don River (Russia)|River Don]], rather than the Phasis, as the boundary between Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, 4:45&lt;/ref&gt; Europe's eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer [[Strabo]] at the River Don.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo ''Geography 11.1''&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Jubilees|Book of Jubilees]]'' described the continents as the lands given by [[Noah]] to his three sons; Europe was defined as stretching from the [[Pillars of Hercules]] at the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], separating it from [[Northwest Africa]], to the Don, separating it from Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Genesis and the Jewish antiquities of Flavius Josephus|first= Thomas W.|last= Franxman|publisher=Pontificium Institutum Biblicum|year= 1979|isbn=978-88-7653-335-8|pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention received by the [[Middle Ages]] and surviving into modern usage is that of the [[Roman era]] used by Roman era authors such as [[Posidonius]],&lt;ref&gt;W. Theiler, ''Posidonios. Die Fragmente'', vol. 1. Berlin: De Gruyter, 1982, fragm. 47a.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]]&lt;ref&gt;I. G. Kidd (ed.), ''Posidonius: The commentary'', Cambridge University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-521-60443-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_iXs1aCr1ckC&amp;pg=PA738 p. 738].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ptolemy]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' 7.5.6 (ed. Nobbe 1845, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vHMCAAAAQAAJ vol. 2], p. 178) {{lang|grc|Καὶ τῇ Εὐρώπῃ δὲ συνάπτει διὰ τοῦ μεταξὺ αὐχένος τῆς τε Μαιώτιδος λίμνης καὶ τοῦ Σαρματικοῦ Ὠκεανοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς διαβάσεως τοῦ Τανάϊδος ποταμοῦ. }}
&quot;And [Asia] is connected to Europe by the land-strait between Lake Maiotis and the Sarmatian Ocean where the river Tanais crosses through.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
who took the Tanais (the modern Don River) as the boundary.

The term &quot;Europe&quot; is first used for a cultural sphere in the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] of the 9th century. From that time, the term designated the sphere of influence of the [[Western Church]], as opposed to both the [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches and to the [[Islamic world]].

A cultural definition of Europe as the lands of [[Christendom|Latin Christendom]] coalesced in the 8th century, signifying the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of Germanic traditions and Christian-Latin culture, defined partly in contrast with [[Byzantium]] and [[Islam]], and limited to northern [[Iberia]], the British Isles, France, Christianised western Germany, the Alpine regions and northern and central Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman F. Cantor]], ''The Civilization of the Middle Ages'', 1993, &quot;&quot;Culture and Society in the First Europe&quot;, pp185ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is one of the lasting legacies of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]: ''Europa'' often{{dubious|date=October 2016}}&lt;!--inflated from &quot;once or twice&quot;--&gt; figures in the letters of Charlemagne's court scholar, [[Alcuin]].&lt;ref&gt;Noted by Cantor, 1993:181.&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of defining a precise eastern boundary of Europe arises in the Early Modern period, as the eastern extension of [[Muscovy]] began to include [[Northern Asia]].

Throughout the Middle Ages and into the 18th century, the traditional division of the landmass of [[Eurasia]] into two continents, Europe and Asia, followed Ptolemy, with the boundary following the [[Turkish Straits]], the [[Black Sea]], the [[Kerch Strait]], the [[Sea of Azov]] and the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] (ancient [[Tanais]]). But maps produced during the 16th to 18th centuries tended to differ in how to continue the boundary beyond the Don bend at [[Kalach-na-Donu]] (where it is closest to the Volga, now joined with it by the [[Volga–Don Canal]]), into territory not described in any detail by the ancient geographers.  Around 1715, [[Herman Moll]] produced a map showing the northern part of the [[Ob River]] and the [[Irtysh River]], a major tributary of the former, as components of a series of partly-joined waterways taking the boundary between Europe and Asia from the Turkish Straits and the Don River all the way to the Arctic Ocean.  In 1721, he produced a more up to date map that was easier to read.  However, his idea to use major rivers almost exclusively as the line of demarcation was never taken up by the Russian Empire.

Four years later, in 1725, [[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]] was the first to depart from the classical Don boundary by proposing that mountain ranges could be included as boundaries between continents whenever there were deemed to be no suitable waterways, the Ob and Irtysh Rivers notwithstanding.  He drew a new line along the [[Volga River|Volga]], following the Volga north until the [[Samara Bend]], along [[Obshchy Syrt]] (the [[drainage divide]] between Volga and [[Ural River|Ural]]) and then north along [[Ural Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Das Nord-und Ostliche Theil von Europa und Asia|author=Philipp Johann von Strahlenberg|year=1730|language=German|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was adopted by the Russian Empire, and introduced the convention that would eventually become commonly accepted, but not without criticism by many modern analytical geographers like [[Halford Mackinder]] who saw little validity in the Ural Mountains as a boundary between continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrVW9W9eiYMC&amp;pg=PA8 |title=Europe: A History |page=8 |publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2010|isbn=978-0-19-820171-7|date=1996|last1=Davies|first1=Norman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mapmakers continued to differ on the boundary between the lower Don and Samara well into the 19th century. The [[:commons:Category:Atlas of Russian Empire. 1745 year|1745 atlas]] published by the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] has the boundary follow the Don beyond Kalach as far as [[Serafimovich (town)|Serafimovich]] before cutting north towards [[Arkhangelsk]], while other 18th- to 19th-century mapmakers such as [[John Cary]] followed Strahlenberg's prescription. To the south, the [[Kuma–Manych Depression]] was identified circa 1773 by a German naturalist, [[Peter Simon Pallas]], as a valley that once connected the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea,&lt;ref name=&quot;oren-icn.ru&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oren-icn.ru/index.php/discussmenu/retrospectiva/685-eagraniza |title=Boundary of Europe and Asia along Urals |language=Russian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108153922/http://oren-icn.ru/index.php/discussmenu/retrospectiva/685-eagraniza |archivedate=8 January 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Simon Pallas, ''Journey through various provinces of the Russian Empire'', vol. 3 (1773)&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently was proposed as a natural boundary between continents.

By the mid-19th century, there were three main conventions, one following the Don, the [[Volga–Don Canal]] and the Volga, the other following the Kuma–Manych Depression to the Caspian and then the Ural River, and the third abandoning the Don altogether, following the [[Greater Caucasus watershed]] to the Caspian. The question was still treated as a &quot;controversy&quot; in geographical literature of the 1860s, with [[Douglas Freshfield]] advocating the Caucasus crest boundary as the &quot;best possible&quot;, citing support from various &quot;modern geographers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas W. Freshfield, &quot;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ips8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA71 Journey in the Caucasus]&quot;, ''Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society'', Volumes 13–14, 1869.

In [[Russia]] and the [[Soviet Union]], the boundary along the Kuma–Manych Depression was the most commonly used as early as 1906.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlib.rsl.ru/view.php?path=/rsl01004000000/rsl01004103000/rsl01004103489/rsl01004103489.pdf#?page=163 &quot;Europe&quot;]{{dead link|date=August 2016}}, ''[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]]'', 1906&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, the Soviet Geographical Society formally recommended that the boundary between the Europe and Asia be drawn in textbooks from [[Baydaratskaya Bay]], on the [[Kara Sea]], along the eastern foot of Ural Mountains, then following the [[Ural River]] until the [[Mugodzhar Hills]], and then the [[Emba River]]; and Kuma–Manych Depression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://velikijporog.narod.ru/st_evraz_gran.htm|title=Do we live in Europe or in Asia?|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus placing the Caucasus entirely in Asia and the Urals entirely in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-u.ru/biblio/archive/orlenok_fisicheskaja/06.aspx |title=Physical Geography |year=1998 |author=Orlenok V. |language=Russian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016212930/http://www.i-u.ru/biblio/archive/orlenok_fisicheskaja/06.aspx |archivedate=16 October 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most geographers in the Soviet Union favoured the boundary along the Caucasus crest&lt;ref&gt;E.M.

The [[European Neolithic]] period—marked by the cultivation of crops and the raising of livestock, increased numbers of settlements and the widespread use of pottery—began around 7000 BC in [[Greece]] and the [[Balkans]], probably influenced by earlier farming practices in [[Anatolia]] and the [[Near East]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Borza&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Borza | first = E.N. | title = In the Shadow of Olympus: The Emergence of Macedon | page = 58 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=614pd07OtfQC&amp;pg=PA58 | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1992| isbn = 978-0691008806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It spread from the Balkans along the valleys of the [[Danube]] and the [[Rhine]] ([[Linear Pottery culture]]) and along the [[Mediterranean coast]] ([[Cardial Ware|Cardial culture]]).

Expanding from their base in central Italy beginning in the 3rd century BC, the Romans gradually expanded to eventually rule the entire [[Mediterranean Basin]] and Western Europe by the turn of the millennium.

During the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], Europe entered a long period of change arising from what historians call the &quot;[[Age of Migrations]]&quot;. There were numerous invasions and migrations amongst the [[Goths]], [[Vandals]], [[Huns]], [[Franks]], [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], [[Slavs]], [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], [[Bulgars]] and, later on, the [[Vikings]], [[Pechenegs]], [[Cumans]] and [[Magyars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mieawl&quot;/&gt; [[Renaissance]] thinkers such as [[Petrarch]] would later refer to this as the &quot;Dark Ages&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 4, No. 1. (Jan. 1943), pp. 69–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Isolated monastic communities were the only places to safeguard and compile written knowledge accumulated previously; apart from this very few written records survive and much literature, philosophy, mathematics, and other thinking from the classical period disappeared from Western Europe though they were preserved in the east, in the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Cantor|Norman F. Cantor]], ''The Medieval World 300 to 1300''.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Roman empire in the west continued to decline, Roman traditions and the Roman state remained strong in the predominantly Greek-speaking [[Eastern Roman Empire]], also known as the [[Byzantine Empire]]. During most of its existence, the Byzantine Empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Emperor [[Justinian I]] presided over Constantinople's first golden age: he established a [[Code of Justinian|legal code]] that forms the basis of many modern legal systems, funded the construction of the [[Hagia Sophia]], and brought the Christian church under state control.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 135&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 135.&lt;/ref&gt; He [[Vandalic War|reconquered North Africa]], southern Spain, and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Corbishley |first1=Mike |title=Illustrated Encyclopedia of Ancient Rome |page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]], which sought to preserve Roman culture and adopt its values, later changed course and became anti-Constantinople, so Justinian [[Gothic War (535–554)|waged war]] against the [[Ostrogoths]] for 30 years and destroyed much of urban life in Italy, and reduced agriculture to subsistence farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Martin |first1=Michael |title=City of the Sun: Development and Popular Resistance in the Pre-Modern West |date=2017 |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 7th century onwards, as the Byzantines and neighbouring [[Sasanids|Sasanid Persians]] were severely weakened due the protracted, centuries-lasting and frequent [[Byzantine–Sasanian wars]], the Muslim Arabs began to make inroads into historically Roman territory, taking the Levant and North Africa and making inroads into [[Asia Minor]]. In the mid 7th century AD, following the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], Islam penetrated into the [[Caucasus]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |quote=(..)

Between 711 and 726, the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|conquered]] the [[Visigothic Kingdom]], which occupied the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and [[Septimania]] (southwestern France). The unsuccessful [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)|second siege of Constantinople]] (717) weakened the Umayyad dynasty and reduced their prestige. The Umayyads were then defeated by the [[Frankish Empire|Frankish]] leader [[Charles Martel]] at the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] in 732, which ended their northward advance. In the remote regions of north-western Iberia and the middle Pyrenees the power of the Muslims in the south was scarcely felt. It was here that the foundations of the Christian kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]], [[Kingdom of Leon|Leon]] and [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]] were laid and from where the reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula would start. However, no coordinated attempt would be made to drive the [[Moors]] out. The Christian kingdoms were mainly focussed on their own internal power struggles. As a result, the [[Reconquista]] took the greater part of eight hundred years, in which period a long list of Alfonsos, Sanchos, Ordoños, Ramiros, Fernandos and Bermudos would be fighting their Christian rivals as much as the Muslim invaders.

One of the biggest threats during the Dark Ages were the Vikings, [[Norsemen|Norse]] seafarers who raided, raped, and pillaged across the [[Western world]]. Many Vikings died in battles in continental Europe, and in 844 they lost many men and ships to King [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro]] in [[Viking raid on Galicia and Asturias|northern Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haywood |first1=John |title=Northmen: The Viking Saga, AD 793–1241 |date=2015 |page=166 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGmoCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT189#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, another fleet [[Viking raid on Seville|took Seville]], only to be driven off with further heavy losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brink |first1=Stefan |last2=Price |first2=Neil |title=The Viking World |date=2008 |publisher=Routledge |page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 911, the Vikings attacked Paris, and the Franks decided to give the Viking king Rollo land along the English Channel coast in exchange for peace. This land was named &quot;Normandy&quot; for the Norse &quot;Northmen&quot;, and the Norse settlers became known as &quot;[[Normans]]&quot;, adopting the French culture and language and becoming French [[vassal]]s. In 1066, the Normans went on to [[Norman conquest of England|conquer England]] in the first successful cross-Channel invasion since Roman times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grant |first1=R.G. |title=Battle at Sea: 3,000 Years of Naval Warfare |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AE8dQ8gvow8C&amp;pg=PT82&amp;lpg=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Dark Ages, the [[Western Roman Empire]] fell under the control of various tribes. The Germanic and Slav tribes established their domains over Western and Eastern Europe respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 143&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 143–145.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the Frankish tribes were united under [[Clovis&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 162&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; In 507, Clovis defeated the [[Visigoths]] at the [[Battle of Vouillé]], slaying King [[Alaric II]] and conquering southern [[Gaul]] for the Franks. His conquests laid the foundation for the Frankish kingdom. [[Charlemagne]], a Frankish king of the [[Carolingian]] dynasty who had conquered most of Western Europe, was anointed &quot;[[Holy Roman Emperor]]&quot; by the Pope in 800. This led in 962 to the founding of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which eventually became centred in the German principalities of central Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 166&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[East Central Europe]] saw the creation of the first Slavic states and the adoption of [[Christianity]] (circa 1000 AD). The powerful [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] state of [[Great Moravia]] spread its territory all the way south to the Balkans, reaching its largest territorial extent under [[Svatopluk I of Moravia|Svatopluk I]] and causing a series of armed conflicts with [[East Francia]]. Further south, the first [[South Slavs|South Slavic states]] emerged in the late 7th and 8th century and adopted [[Christianity]]: the [[First Bulgarian Empire]], the [[Principality of Serbia (early medieval)|Serbian Principality]] (later [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Kingdom]] and [[Serbian Empire|Empire]]), and the [[Duchy of Croatia]] (later [[Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)|Kingdom of Croatia]]). To the East, the [[Kievan Rus]] expanded from its capital in [[Kiev]] to become the largest state in Europe by the 10th century. In 988, [[Vladimir the Great]] adopted [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] as the religion of state.{{sfn|Bulliet|Crossley|Headrick|Hirsch|2011|page=250}}{{sfn|Brown|Anatolios|Palmer|2009|page=66}} Further East, [[Volga Bulgaria]] became an Islamic state in the 10th century, but was eventually absorbed into Russia several centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Mako, &quot;The Islamization of the Volga Bulghars: A Question Reconsidered&quot;, Archivum Eurasiae Medii Aevi 18, 2011, 199–223.&lt;/ref&gt;

===High and Late Middle Ages===
{{Main|High Middle Ages|Late Middle Ages|Middle Ages}}
{{See also|Medieval demography}}
The period between the year 1000 and 1300 is known as the [[High Middle Ages]], during which the population of Europe experienced significant growth, culminating in the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]]. Economic growth, together with the lack of safety on the mainland trading routes, made possible the development of major commercial routes along the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Baltic Sea]]s. The growing wealth and independence acquired by some coastal cities gave the [[Maritime Republics]] a leading role in the European scene.

[[File:Philip II and Tancred meeting in Messina - British Library Royal MS 16 G vi f350r (detail).jpg|thumbnail|upright=0.9|[[Tancred of Sicily]] and [[Philip II of France]], during the [[Third Crusade]] (1189–1192)]]

The Middle Ages on the mainland were dominated by the two upper echelons of the social structure: the nobility and the clergy. [[Feudalism]] developed in [[France]] in the Early Middle Ages and soon spread throughout Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 158&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; A struggle for influence between the [[nobility]] and the [[monarchy]] in England led to the writing of the [[Magna Carta]] and the establishment of a [[parliament]].&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 186&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 186.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary source of culture in this period came from the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Through monasteries and cathedral schools, the Church was responsible for education in much of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 158&quot;/&gt;

The [[Papacy]] reached the height of its power during the High Middle Ages. An [[East-West Schism]] in 1054 split the former Roman Empire religiously, with the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the Roman Catholic Church in the former Western Roman Empire. In 1095 [[Pope Urban II]] called for a [[Crusades|crusade]] against [[Muslims]] occupying [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Holy Land]].&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 192&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 192.&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe itself, the Church organised the [[Inquisition]] against heretics. In the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the [[Reconquista]] concluded with the [[Granada War#Last stand at Granada|fall of Granada in 1492]], ending over seven centuries of Islamic rule in the south-western peninsula.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 199&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the east a resurgent Byzantine Empire recaptured Crete and Cyprus from the Muslims and reconquered the Balkans. Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe from the 9th to the 12th centuries, with a population of approximately 400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laiou|Morisson|2007|pp=130–131}}; {{harvnb|Pounds|1979|p=124}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Empire was weakened following the defeat at [[Battle of Manzikert|Manzikert]] and was weakened considerably by the [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|sack of Constantinople in 1204]], during the [[Fourth Crusade]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DuikerSpielvogel2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=William J.

In parallel, the [[Eastern Question]] grew more complex ever since the Ottoman defeat in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)]]. As the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire seemed imminent, the [[Great Power]]s struggled to safeguard their strategic and commercial interests in the Ottoman domains. The [[Russian Empire]] stood to benefit from the decline, whereas the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] perceived the preservation of the Ottoman Empire to be in their best interests.

Economic instability, caused in part by debts incurred in the First World War and 'loans' to Germany played havoc in Europe in the late 1920s and 1930s.

Later that year, following the [[Munich Agreement]] signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy, Germany annexed the [[Sudetenland]], which was a part of [[Czechoslovakia]] inhabited by ethnic Germans, and in early 1939, the remainder of Czechoslovakia was split into the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], controlled by Germany, and the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak Republic]].

After the staggering [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in 1943, the German offensive in the Soviet Union turned into a continual fallback. The [[Battle of Kursk]], which involved the largest [[Battle of Prokhorovka|tank battle]] in history, was the last major German offensive on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. In June 1944, British and American forces invaded France in the [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings]], the largest seaborne invasion in history.

World War I and especially World War II diminished the eminence of Western Europe in world affairs. After World War II the map of Europe was redrawn at the [[Yalta Conference]] and divided into two blocs, the Western countries and the communist Eastern bloc, separated by what was later called by [[Winston Churchill]] an &quot;[[Iron Curtain]]&quot;. The United States and Western Europe
established the [[NATO]] alliance and later the Soviet Union and Central Europe established the [[Warsaw Pact]].&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 530&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 530.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two new [[superpower]]s, the United States and the Soviet Union, became locked in a fifty-year-long Cold War, centred on [[nuclear proliferation]]. At the same time [[decolonisation]], which had already started after World War I, gradually resulted in the independence of most of the European colonies in Asia and Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 534&quot;/&gt; In the 1980s the [[glasnost|reforms]] of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement in Poland accelerated the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the end of the Cold War. Germany was reunited, after the symbolic [[Berlin Wall#Fall of the Wall|fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989, and the maps of Central and Eastern Europe were redrawn once more.&lt;ref name=&quot;hobsbawn&quot;/&gt;

[[European integration]] also grew after World War II. In 1949 the [[Council of Europe]] was founded, following a speech by Sir [[Winston Churchill]], with the idea of unifying Europe to achieve common goals. It includes all European states except for [[Belarus]] and [[Vatican City]]. The [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957 established the [[European Economic Community]] between six Western European states with the goal of a unified economic policy and common market.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 536&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 536.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 the EEC, [[European Coal and Steel Community]] and [[Euratom]] formed the [[European Community]], which in 1993 became the [[European Union]]. The EU established a [[European Parliament|parliament]], [[European Court of Justice|court]] and [[European Central Bank|central bank]] and introduced the [[euro]] as a unified currency.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 537&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 537.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2004 and 2013, more Central and Eastern European countries began joining, [[Enlargement of the European Union|expanding the EU]] to its current size of 28 European countries, and once more making Europe a major economical and political centre of power.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 535&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 535.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in June 2016 the people of the United Kingdom, in a [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|non-binding referendum]] on EU membership voted to [[Brexit|leave the European Union]].

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Europe}}
[[File:Europe topography map en.png|thumb|Relief map of Europe and surrounding regions]]

Europe makes up the western fifth of the [[Eurasia]]n landmass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encarta&quot;/&gt; It has a higher ratio of coast to landmass than any other continent or subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Cuper |first = Simon |date = 23 May 2014 |title = Why Europe works |url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/51dd9432-db03-11e3-8273-00144feabdc0.html |newspaper = [[Financial Times|ft.com]] |accessdate = 28 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its maritime borders consist of the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean, Black, and Caspian Seas to the south.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195686/Europe Europe]. Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt;
Land relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions are more mountainous, while moving north the terrain descends from the high [[Alps]], [[Pyrenees]], and [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], through hilly uplands, into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. This extended lowland is known as the [[Great European Plain]], and at its heart lies the [[North German Plain]]. An arc of uplands also exists along the north-western seaboard, which begins in the western parts of the islands of Britain and Ireland, and then continues along the mountainous, fjord-cut spine of Norway.

This description is simplified. Sub-regions such as the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and the [[Italian Peninsula]] contain their own complex features, as does mainland Central Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. Sub-regions like [[Iceland]], Britain, and Ireland are special cases. The former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean which is counted as part of Europe, while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off.

Europe lies mainly in the [[temperate]] climate zones, being subjected to [[prevailing westerlies]]. The climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the [[Gulf Stream]].&lt;ref name=&quot;climate&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbook.com/wb/Students?content_spotlight/climates/european_climate |title=European Climate |website=World Book |accessdate=16 June 2008 |publisher=World Book, Inc |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109230709/http://www.worldbook.com/wb/Students?content_spotlight%2Fclimates%2Feuropean_climate |archivedate=9 November 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gulf Stream is nicknamed &quot;Europe's central heating&quot;, because it makes Europe's climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be. The Gulf Stream not only carries warm water to Europe's coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the Atlantic Ocean.

Therefore, the average temperature throughout the year of Naples is {{convert|16|°C}}, while it is only {{convert|12|°C}} in New York City which is almost on the same latitude. Berlin, Germany; Calgary, Canada; and Irkutsk, in the Asian part of Russia, lie on around the same latitude; January temperatures in Berlin average around {{convert|8|C-change}} higher than those in Calgary, and they are almost {{convert|22|C-change}} higher than average temperatures in Irkutsk.&lt;ref name=&quot;climate&quot;/&gt; Similarly, northern parts of Scotland have a temperate marine climate. The yearly average temperature in city of Inverness is {{convert|9.05|C|F}}. However, Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, is on roughly the same latitude and has an average temperature of {{convert|-6.5|C|F}}, giving it a nearly subarctic climate.

In general, Europe is not just colder towards the north compared to the south, but it also gets colder from the west towards the east. The climate is more oceanic in the west, and less so in the east. This can be illustrated by the following table of average temperatures at locations roughly following the 60th, 55th, 50th, 45th and 40th [[latitudes]]. None of them is located at high altitude; most of them are close to the sea. (location, approximate latitude and longitude, coldest month average, hottest month average and annual average temperatures in degrees C)

===Geology===
{{Main|Geology of Europe|Geological history of Europe}}
[[File:Mount Elbrus May 2008.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mount Elbrus]] in [[Russia]] is the highest mountain in Europe.]]

The geological history of Europe traces back to the formation of the [[Baltic Shield]] (Fennoscandia) and the [[Sarmatian craton]], both around 2.25&amp;nbsp;billion years ago, followed by the [[Volgo–Uralia]] shield, the three together leading to the [[East European craton]] (≈ [[Baltica]]) which became a part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]]. Around 1.1&amp;nbsp;billion years ago, Baltica and Arctica (as part of the [[Laurentia]] block) became joined to [[Rodinia]], later resplitting around 550&amp;nbsp;million years ago to reform as Baltica. Around 440&amp;nbsp;million years ago [[Euramerica]] was formed from Baltica and Laurentia; a further joining with [[Gondwana]] then leading to the formation of [[Pangea]]. Around 190&amp;nbsp;million years ago, Gondwana and [[Laurasia]] split apart due to the widening of the Atlantic Ocean. Finally, and very soon afterwards, Laurasia itself split up again, into Laurentia (North America) and the Eurasian continent. The land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time, via [[Greenland]], leading to interchange of animal species. From around 50&amp;nbsp;million years ago, rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of Europe, and its connections with continents such as Asia. Europe's present shape dates to the late [[Tertiary period]] about five million years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106055 |title=Europe |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |year=2007 |accessdate=10 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204015044/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106055 |archivedate=4 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gibraltar-Europa-Point-LH-from-the-sea.jpg|thumb|Europa Point as seen from the [[Strait of Gibraltar]].]]
The geology of Europe is hugely varied and complex, and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent, from the [[Scottish Highlands]] to the rolling [[plain]]s of Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/jpg/eurogy.jpg|title=Geology map of Europe|year=1967|publisher=University of Southampton|accessdate=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europe's most significant feature is the dichotomy between highland and mountainous [[Southern Europe]] and a vast, partially underwater, northern plain ranging from Ireland in the west to the [[Ural Mountains]] in the east. These two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the [[Pyrenees]] and [[Alps]]/[[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]]. The northern plains are delimited in the west by the [[Scandinavian Mountains]] and the mountainous parts of the British Isles. Major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the [[Celtic Sea]], the [[North Sea]], the [[Baltic Sea]] complex and [[Barents Sea]].

The northern plain contains the old geological continent of [[Baltica]], and so may be regarded geologically as the &quot;main continent&quot;, while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in the south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents. Most of the older geology of western Europe existed as part of the ancient [[microcontinent]] [[Avalonia]].

===Flora===

Having lived side-by-side with agricultural peoples for millennia, Europe's animals and plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of man. With the exception of [[Fennoscandia]] and northern Russia, few areas of untouched wilderness are currently found in Europe, except for various [[national park]]s.

[[File:Europe land use map.png|thumb|left|Land use map of Europe with arable farmland (yellow), forest (dark green), pasture (light green), and tundra or bogs in the north (dark yellow)]]

The main natural vegetation cover in Europe is mixed [[forest]]. The conditions for growth are very favourable. In the north, the [[Gulf Stream]] and [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]] warm the continent. Southern Europe could be described as having a warm, but mild climate. There are frequent summer droughts in this region. Mountain ridges also affect the conditions. Some of these ([[Alps]], [[Pyrenees]]) are oriented east–west and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior. Others are oriented south–north ([[Scandinavian Mountains]], [[Dinaric Alps|Dinarides]], [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]) and because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented towards the sea, forests grow well on this side, while on the other side, the conditions are much less favourable. Few corners of mainland Europe have not been grazed by [[livestock]] at some point in time, and the cutting down of the pre-agricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems.

[[File:Floristic regions in Europe (english).png|thumb|Floristic regions of Europe and neighbouring areas, according to Wolfgang Frey and Rainer Lösch]]

Probably 80 to 90 percent of Europe was once covered by forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saveamericasforests.org/europages/history&amp;geography.htm|title=History and geography|publisher=Save America's Forest Funds|accessdate=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arctic Ocean. Although over half of Europe's original forests disappeared through the centuries of [[deforestation]], Europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest, such as the [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|broadleaf and mixed]] forests, [[taiga]] of Scandinavia and Russia, mixed [[rainforest]]s of the Caucasus and the [[Cork oak]] forests in the western Mediterranean. During recent times, deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted. However, in many cases monoculture [[plantation]]s of [[Pinophyta|conifers]] have replaced the original mixed natural forest, because these grow quicker. The plantations now cover vast areas of land, but offer poorer habitats for many European forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure. The amount of natural forest in Western Europe is just 2–3% or less, in European Russia 5–10%. The country with the smallest percentage of forested area is [[Iceland]] (1%), while the most forested country is Finland (77%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcpfe.net/system/files/u1/publications/pdf/state_of_europes_forests_2007.pdf |title=State of Europe's Forests 2007: The MCPFE report on sustainable forest management in Europe |publisher=EFI Euroforest Portal |page=182 |accessdate=9 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624190612/http://www.mcpfe.net/system/files/u1/publications/pdf/state_of_europes_forests_2007.pdf |archivedate=24 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In temperate Europe, mixed forest with both [[flowering plant|broadleaf]] and coniferous trees dominate. The most important species in central and western Europe are [[beech]] and [[oak]]. In the north, the taiga is a mixed [[spruce]]–[[pine]]–[[birch]] forest; further north within Russia and extreme northern Scandinavia, the taiga gives way to [[tundra]] as the Arctic is approached. In the Mediterranean, many [[olive]] trees have been planted, which are very well adapted to its arid climate; [[Cupressus sempervirens|Mediterranean Cypress]] is also widely planted in southern Europe. The semi-arid Mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest. A narrow east–west tongue of Eurasian [[grassland]] (the [[steppe]]) extends eastwards from [[Ukraine]] and southern Russia and ends in Hungary and traverses into taiga to the north.

===Fauna===
{{main|Fauna of Europe}}
[[File:Europe biogeography countries.svg|thumb|left|[[Biogeography|Biogeographic regions]] of Europe and bordering regions]]

Glaciation during the [[Quaternary glaciation|most recent ice age]] and the presence of man affected the distribution of [[Fauna of Europe|European fauna]]. As for the animals, in many parts of Europe most large animals and top [[predator]] species have been hunted to extinction. The [[woolly mammoth]] was extinct before the end of the [[Neolithic]] period. Today [[wolf|wolves]] ([[carnivore]]s) and [[bear]]s ([[omnivore]]s) are endangered. Once they were found in most parts of Europe. However, deforestation and hunting caused these animals to withdraw further and further. By the [[Middle Ages]] the bears' habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover. Today, the [[European brown bear|brown bear]] lives primarily in the [[Balkan|Balkan peninsula]], Scandinavia, and Russia; a small number also persist in other countries across Europe (Austria, Pyrenees etc.), but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat. In addition, [[polar bear]]s may be found on [[Svalbard]], a Norwegian archipelago far north of Scandinavia. The [[Eurasian wolf|wolf]], the second largest predator in Europe after the brown bear, can be found primarily in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] and in the Balkans, with a handful of packs in pockets of [[Western Europe]] (Scandinavia, Spain, etc.).

European wild cat, foxes (especially the red fox), jackal and different species of martens, hedgehogs, different species of reptiles (like snakes such as vipers and grass snakes) and amphibians, different birds (owls, hawks and other birds of prey).

Important European herbivores are snails, larvae, fish, different birds, and mammals, like rodents, deer and roe deer, boars, and living in the mountains, marmots, steinbocks, chamois among others. A number of insects, such as the [[small tortoiseshell]] butterfly, add to the biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, S., Thomas, C. and Bale, J.

The extinction of the [[Cretan Dwarf Hippopotamus|dwarf hippos]] and [[dwarf elephant]]s has been linked to the earliest arrival of humans on the islands of the [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/3096/palaeol.html|title=Paleolithic Man and his Environment in Malta|last1=Savona-Ventura|first1=C.|last2=Mifsud|first2=A.|date=9 April 1997|accessdate=19 July 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018195453/http://geocities.com/RainForest/3096/palaeol.html|archivedate=18 October 2009|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sea creatures are also an important part of European flora and fauna. The sea flora is mainly [[phytoplankton]].

The political map of Europe is substantially derived from the re-organisation of Europe following the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815. The prevalent form of government in Europe is [[parliamentary democracy]], in most cases in the form of [[Republic]]; in 1815, the prevalent form of government was still the [[Monarchies in Europe|Monarchy]]. Europe's remaining eleven monarchies&lt;ref&gt;not counting the microstate of [[Vatican City]]&lt;/ref&gt; are [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional]].

[[European integration]] is the process of political, legal, economic (and in some cases social and cultural) integration of European states as it has been pursued by the powers sponsoring the [[Council of Europe]] since the end of [[World War II]]
The [[European Union]] has been the focus of economic integration on the continent since its foundation in 1993. More recently, the [[Eurasian Economic Union]] has been established as a counterpart comprising former Soviet states.

27 European states are members of the politico-economic European Union, 26 of the border-free [[Schengen Area]] and 19 of the monetary union [[Eurozone]]. Among the smaller European organisations are the [[Nordic Council]], the [[Benelux]], the [[Baltic Assembly]] and the [[Visegrád Group]].

Several dependencies and similar territories with broad autonomy are also found within or in close proximity to Europe. This includes Åland (a [[region of Finland]]), two constituent countries of the Kingdom of Denmark (other than Denmark itself), three [[Crown dependencies]], and two [[British Overseas Territories]]. Svalbard is also included due to its unique status within Norway, although it is not autonomous. Not included are the three [[countries of the United Kingdom]] with devolved powers and the two [[Autonomous Regions of Portugal]], which despite having a unique degree of autonomy, are not largely self-governing in matters other than international affairs. Areas with little more than a unique tax status, such as [[Heligoland]] and the [[Canary Islands]], are also not included for this reason.

As a continent, the economy of Europe is currently the largest on Earth and it is the richest region as measured by assets under management with over $32.7&amp;nbsp;trillion compared to North America's $27.1&amp;nbsp;trillion in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fineman |first=Josh |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/world |title=Bloomberg.com |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=15 September 2009 |accessdate=23 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128110049/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/world |archivedate=28 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Europe remained the wealthiest region. Its $37.1 trillion in assets under management represented one-third of the world's wealth. It was one of several regions where wealth surpassed its precrisis year-end peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pr-inside.com/global-wealth-stages-a-strong-comeback-r1942019.htm |title=Global Wealth Stages a Strong Comeback |publisher=Pr-inside.com |date=10 June 2010 |accessdate=23 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520174617/http://www.pr-inside.com/global-wealth-stages-a-strong-comeback-r1942019.htm |archivedate=20 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other continents, Europe has a large variation of wealth among its countries. The richer states tend to be in the [[Western Europe|West]]; some of the [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an economies are still emerging from the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] and the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]].

The European Union, a political entity composed of 28 European states, comprises the [[List of countries by GDP|largest single economic area]] in the world. 19 EU [[Eurozone|countries]] share the [[euro]] as a common currency.
Five European countries rank in the top ten of the world's largest [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|national economies in GDP (PPP)]]. This includes (ranks according to the [[The CIA World Factbook|CIA]]): Germany (5), the UK (6), Russia (7), France (8), and Italy (10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html|title=The CIA World Factbook – GDP (PPP)|date=15 July 2008|accessdate=19 July 2008|publisher=[[CIA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is huge disparity between many European countries in terms of their income. The richest in terms of GDP per capita is Monaco with its US$172,676 per capita (2009) and the poorest is [[Moldova]] with its GDP per capita of US$1,631 (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://databank.worldbank.org/ddp/home.do?Step=12&amp;id=4&amp;CNO=2|title=The World Bank DataBank |website=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monaco]] is the richest country in terms of GDP per capita in the world according to the World Bank report.

As a whole, Europe's GDP per capita is US$21,767 according to a 2016 International Monetary Fund assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Some data refers to IMF staff estimates but some are actual figures for the year 2017, made in 12 April 2017.

===Economic history===
;Industrial growth (1760–1945)
Capitalism has been dominant in the Western world since the end of feudalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com-archive-online.eu/EBchecked/topic/93927/capitalism Capitalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517172857/http://www.britannica.com-archive-online.eu/EBchecked/topic/93927/capitalism |date=17 May 2014 }}. ''Encyclopædia Britannica.''&lt;/ref&gt; From Britain, it gradually spread throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Industrialism: A Dictionary of Sociology|author=Scott, John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Industrial Revolution]] started in Europe, specifically the United Kingdom in the late 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/lecture17a.html|title=The Origins of the Industrial Revolution in England|publisher=The History Guide|author=Steven Kreis|date=11 October 2006|accessdate=1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 19th century saw Western Europe industrialise. Economies were disrupted by World War I but by the beginning of World War II they had recovered and were having to compete with the growing economic strength of the United States. World War II, again, damaged much of Europe's industries.

;Cold War (1945–1991)
[[File:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|right|Fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989.]]
After World War II the economy of the UK was in a state of ruin,&lt;ref&gt;Dornbusch, Rudiger; Nölling, Wilhelm P.; Layard, Richard G. ''Postwar Economic Reconstruction and Lessons for the East Today'', p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to suffer relative economic decline in the following decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking International Organisation: Deregulation and Global Governance|last=Emadi-Coffin|first=Barbara|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-19540-9|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy was also in a poor economic condition but regained a high level of growth by the 1950s. West Germany [[Wirtschaftswunder|recovered quickly]] and had doubled production from pre-war levels by the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Dornbusch, Rudiger; Nölling, Wilhelm P.; Layard, Richard G. ''Postwar Economic Reconstruction and Lessons for the East Today'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; France also staged a remarkable comeback enjoying rapid growth and modernisation; later on Spain, under the leadership of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]], also recovered, and the nation recorded huge unprecedented economic growth beginning in the 1960s in what is called the [[Spanish miracle]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrop, Martin. ''Power and Policy in Liberal Democracies'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an states came under the control of the [[Soviet Union]] and thus were members of the [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (COMECON).&lt;ref name=&quot;loc-cs&quot;&gt;&quot;Germany (East)&quot;, Library of Congress Country Study, [http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/germany_east/gx_appnb.html Appendix B: The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]&lt;/ref&gt;

The states which retained a [[free-market]] system were given a large amount of aid by the United States under the [[Marshall Plan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/marshall-plan|title=Marshall Plan|publisher=US Department of State Office of the historian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The western states moved to link their economies together, providing the basis for the EU and increasing cross border trade. This helped them to enjoy rapidly improving economies, while those states in COMECON were struggling in a large part due to the cost of the [[Cold War]]. Until 1990, the [[European Community]] was expanded from 6 founding members to 12. The emphasis placed on resurrecting the West German economy led to it overtaking the UK as Europe's largest economy.

;Reunification (1991–present)
[[File:Carte zone euro.svg|thumb| [[Eurozone]] (blue colour)]]
With the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1991, the post-socialist states began free market reforms.

After [[East Germany|East]] and West Germany were reunited in 1990, the economy of West Germany struggled as it had to support and largely rebuild the infrastructure of East Germany.

By the millennium change, the EU dominated the economy of Europe comprising the five largest European economies of the time namely Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Spain. In 1999, 12 of the 15 members of the EU joined the [[Eurozone]] replacing their former national currencies by the common euro.

In 2017, the population of Europe was estimated to be 742 million according to {{UN_Population|source}}, which is slightly more than one-ninth of the world's population. This number includes Asian Russia (Siberia, about 36 million people) but excludes the European part of Turkey, Cyprus and the Transcaucasian countries.
A century ago, Europe had nearly a quarter of the [[world population|world's population]].&lt;ref name=&quot;World Population Growth, 1950–2050&quot;&gt;[http://www.prb.org/Educators/TeachersGuides/HumanPopulation/PopulationGrowth.aspx?p=1 World Population Growth, 1950–2050].

Most of Europe is in a mode of [[Sub-replacement fertility]], which means that each new(-born) generation is being less populous than the older.
The most densely populated country in Europe (and in the world) is the [[microstate]] of [[Monaco]].

Today, [[European diaspora|large populations of European descent]] are found on every continent. European ancestry predominates in North America, and to a lesser degree in South America (particularly in [[Uruguay]], [[Argentina]], [[Chile]] and [[Brazil]], while most of the other [[Latin America]]n countries also have a considerable [[White Latin American|population of European origins]]). [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] have large European derived populations. Africa has no countries with European-derived majorities (or with the exception of [[Cape Verde]] and probably [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], depending on context), but there are significant minorities, such as the [[White South African]]s. In Asia, European-derived populations predominate in [[Northern Asia]] (specifically [[Russians]]) and some parts of Northern [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Greenall, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4420922.stm Russians left behind in Central Asia], [[BBC News]], 23 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Europe}}
[[File:Simplified Languages of Europe map.svg|thumb|right|Distribution of major [[languages of Europe]]]]
Europe has about 225 indigenous languages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://edl.ecml.at/LanguageFun/LanguageFacts/tabid/1859/Default.aspx Language facts – European day of languages], Council of Europe. Retrieved 30 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; mostly falling within three [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language groups: the [[Romance languages]], derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] of the [[Roman Empire]]; the [[Germanic languages]], whose ancestor language came from southern Scandinavia; and the [[Slavic languages]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;/&gt; Slavic languages are mostly spoken in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe. Romance languages are spoken primarily in Western and Southern Europe as well as in [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]] in Eastern Europe. Germanic languages are spoken in Western and Northern Europe and parts of Central Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;/&gt; Languages in adjacent areas show significant overlaps (such as in [[English (language)|English]], for example).  Other Indo-European languages outside the three main groups include the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] group ([[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]), the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] group ([[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scots Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]], [[Manx language|Manx]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], and [[Breton language|Breton]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;/&gt;), [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], and [[Albanian language|Albanian]].

A distinct non-Indo-European family of [[Uralic languages]] ([[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Erzya language|Erzya]], [[Komi language|Komi]], [[Mari language|Mari]], [[Moksha language|Moksha]], and [[Udmurt language|Udmurt]]) is spoken mainly in [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Hungary]], and parts of Russia. [[Turkic languages]] include [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], in addition to smaller languages in Eastern and Southeast Europe ([[Balkan Gagauz Turkish]], [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]], [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]], [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]], [[Karachay-Balkar language|Karachay-Balkar]], [[Kumyk language|Kumyk]], [[Nogai language|Nogai]], and [[Tatar language|Tatar]]). [[Kartvelian languages]] ([[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]], and [[Svan language|Svan]]) are spoken primarily in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Two other language families reside in the North Caucasus (termed [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian]], most notably including [[Chechen language|Chechen]], [[Avar language|Avar]], and [[Lezgian language|Lezgin]]; and [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]], most notably including [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]]). [[Maltese language|Maltese]] is the only [[Semitic language]] that is official within the EU, while [[Basque language|Basque]] is the only European [[language isolate]].

Multilingualism and the protection of regional and minority languages are recognised political goals in Europe today. The [[Council of Europe]] [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]] and the Council of Europe's [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] set up a legal framework for language rights in Europe.

{{Main|Culture of Europe}}
{{further|European folklore|European art}}
&quot;Europe&quot; as a cultural concept is substantially derived from the shared heritage of the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Culture of ancient Rome|its culture]].
The boundaries of Europe were historically understood as those of [[Christendom]] (or more specifically [[Latin Christendom]]), as established or defended throughout the medieval and early modern history of Europe, especially [[Islamic conquests|against Islam]], as in the [[Reconquista]] and the [[Ottoman wars in Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilarie Belloc]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8442 Europe and the Faith], Chapter I&lt;/ref&gt;

This shared cultural heritage is combined by overlapping indigenous national cultures and folklores, roughly divided into [[Slavic Europe|Slavic]], [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin (Romance)]] and [[Germanic Europe|Germanic]], but with several components not part of either of these group (notably [[Greek culture|Greek]] and [[Celtic Europe|Celtic]]).
Cultural contact and mixtures characterise much of European regional cultures; Kaplan (2014) describes Europe as &quot;embracing maximum cultural diversity at minimal geographical distances&quot;.{{clarify|date=October 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Andreas M.

There are six patron saints of Europe venerated in Roman Catholicism, five of them so declared by Pope John Paul II between 1980–1999: Saints Cyril and Methodius, Saint Bridget of Sweden, Catherine of Siena and Saint Teresa Benedicta of the Cross (Edith Stein).
