The '''British thermal unit''' ('''Btu''' or '''BTU''') is a non-[[SI]], traditional unit of [[heat]]; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one [[pound (mass)|pound]] of water by one degree [[Fahrenheit]]. It is also part of the [[United States customary units]].&lt;ref&gt;In a short note, Woledge notes that the actual technical term &quot;British thermal unit&quot; apparently originated in the United States, and was subsequently adopted in Great Britain. See {{cite journal |title = History of the British Thermal Unit |first1 = G. |last1 = Woledge |journal=Nature |number = 149 |date = 30 May 1942 |doi = 10.1038/149613c0 |page = 613 |bibcode = 1942Natur.149..613W |volume=149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its counterpart in the old [[metric system]] is the [[calorie]], which is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree [[Celsius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Does the history of food energy units suggest a solution to 'Calorie confusion'? |last=Hargrove |first=James L. |date=2007 |work=Nutrition Journal |doi=10.1186/1475-2891-6-44 |volume=6 |page=44 |url=http://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2891-6-44 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801153801/https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2891-6-44 |archivedate=1 August 2017 |df=dmy-all |pmc=2238749 |pmid=18086303 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heat is now known to be equivalent to energy, for which the [[SI]] unit is the [[joule]]; one BTU is about 1055 joules. While units of heat are often supplanted by energy units in scientific work, they are still used in many fields. As examples, in the United States the [[Natural gas prices|price of natural gas]] is quoted in dollars per million BTUs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration |url=https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/rngwhhdm.htm |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801191040/https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/rngwhhdm.htm |archivedate=1 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HenryHub /&gt;

== Definitions ==
A BTU was originally defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 [[avoirdupois]] pound of liquid water by 1 degree Fahrenheit at a constant pressure of one [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]].&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics |edition=6 |last1=Smith |first1=J.

This reflects the fact that the temperature change of a mass of water due to the addition of a specific amount of heat (calculated in energy units, usually joules) depends slightly upon the water's initial temperature. As seen in the table below, definitions of the BTU based on different water temperatures vary by up to 0.5%.

| Originally, the thermochemical BTU was defined as the heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water from its freezing point to its boiling point, divided by the temperature difference (180&amp;nbsp;°F). The similar, ''thermochemical [[calorie]]'' was defined as the heat required to raise the temperature of one gram of water from freezing to boiling divided by the temperature difference in Celsius (100&amp;nbsp;°C). The International Standards Organization now redefines the thermochemical calorie as exactly 4.184&amp;nbsp;J.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt; The thermochemical BTU is then defined using the conversions from grams to pounds and from Celsius to Fahrenheit.&lt;ref name=convert&gt;The pound is now defined as 453.59237 grams; see {{Cite web

| An early effort to define heat units directly in terms of energy units, and hence to remove the direct association with the properties of water, was taken by the International Steam Table Conferences. These conferences originally adopted the simplified definition that 860 &quot;IT&quot; calories corresponded to exactly 1 international watt-hour (not the same as a modern watt-hour). This definition ultimately became the statement that 1 IT calorie is exactly 4.1868&amp;nbsp;J.&lt;ref name=Smith /&gt;&lt;ref name=Koch&gt;

===Prefixes===
Units kBtu are used in building energy use tracking and heating system sizing. Energy Use Index (EUI) represents kBtu per square foot of conditioned floor area. &quot;k&quot; stands for 1,000.

The units '''MBtu''' and '''MMBtu''' are used in the natural gas and other industries to indicate 1,000 and 1,000,000 BTUs, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;EIA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Price&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Price |first=Gary D. |title=Power Systems and Renewable Energy: Design, Operation, and Systems Analysis |publisher=Momentum Press |date=2014 |page=98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=skICBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an ambiguity in that the metric system uses the prefix &quot;M&quot; to indicate one million (1,000,000), and &quot;MBtu&quot; is also used to indicate one million BTUs.&lt;ref name=&quot;APS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Energy Units |url=https://www.aps.org/policy/reports/popa-reports/energy/units.cfm |publisher=[[American Physical Society]] |access-date=2016-12-26 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231123621/http://www.aps.org/policy/reports/popa-reports/energy/units.cfm |archivedate=31 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this ambiguity, some authors have deprecated the use of MBtu.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price&quot; /&gt;

Energy analysts accustomed to the metric &quot;k&quot; for 1,000 are more likely to use MBtu to represent one million, especially in documents where M represents one million in other energy or cost units, such as MW, MWh and $.

The unit ''[[therm]]'' is used to represent 100,000 (or 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;nbsp;BTUs.&lt;ref name=&quot;EIA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=45&amp;t=8 |title=What are Mcf, Btu, and therms?

The unit ''[[quad (unit)|quad]]'' is commonly used to represent one quadrillion (10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;) BTUs.&lt;ref name=&quot;APS&quot; /&gt;

== Conversions ==
One Btu is approximately:
* 1.054 to 1.060 kJ (kilo[[joule]]s)
* 0.2931 W⋅h ([[Kilowatt hour|watt hours]])
* 252 to 253&amp;nbsp;cal ([[calorie]]s)
* 0.25 kcal (kilocalories)
* 25,031 to 25,160&amp;nbsp;ft⋅pdl ([[foot-poundal]])
* 778 to 782&amp;nbsp;ft⋅lbf ([[foot-pound (energy)|foot-pounds-force]])
* 5.40395 (lbf/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)⋅ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
* 1.730735 W/(m⋅K)

A Btu can be approximated as the heat produced by burning a single wooden kitchen match or as the amount of energy it takes to lift a {{convert|1|lb|spell=in|adj=on}} weight {{Convert|778|ft|m|0}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;RistinenKraushaar2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ristinen|first1=Robert A. |last2=Kraushaar|first2=Jack J. |title=Energy and the Environment|url=https://archive.org/details/energyenvironmen00rist|url-access=registration|year=2006|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-73989-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/energyenvironmen00rist/page/13 13]–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For natural gas ===
{{main|Natural gas prices}}
* In [[natural gas]] pricing, the Canadian definition is that {{val|1000000|u=Btu}} ≡ {{val|1.054615|u=GJ}}.&lt;ref name=Alberta&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.energy.gov.ab.ca/about_us/1132.asp | title=Energy Measurements | access-date=2017-01-07 | publisher=Government of Alberta Province | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120191331/http://www.energy.gov.ab.ca/About_Us/1132.asp | archivedate=20 January 2017 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The energy content (high or low heating value) of a volume of natural gas varies with the composition of the natural gas, which means there is no universal conversion factor for energy to volume. {{convert|1|ft3|l|abbr=off}} of average natural gas yields ≈ 1030&amp;nbsp;Btu (between 1010&amp;nbsp;Btu and 1070&amp;nbsp;Btu, depending on quality, when burned)
* As a coarse approximation, {{convert|1000|ft3|m3}} of natural gas yields ≈ {{val|1000000|u=Btu}} ≈ {{val|1|u=GJ}}.
* For natural gas price conversion {{val|1000|u=m3}} ≈ 36.9&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;Btu and {{val|1000000|u=Btu}} ≈ {{val|27.1|u=m3}}

=== As a unit of power ===
When used as a unit of [[Power (physics)|power]] for heating and cooling systems, Btu ''per hour'' (Btu/h) is the correct unit, though this is often abbreviated to just &quot;Btu&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Masonry Heaters: Designing, Building, and Living with a Piece of the Sun|author=Ken Matesz|p=148|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''MBH''—thousands of Btus per hour—is also common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/11156/what-is-difference-between-btu-and-mbh-for-house-furnaces|title=What is difference between BTU and MBH for house furnaces?|website=Home Improvement Stack Exchange|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1 [[watt]] is approximately {{convert|1|W|Btu/h|disp=out|sigfig=7}}&lt;ref&gt;[&lt;!-- http://knovel.com/web/portal/browse/display?_EXT_KNOVEL_DISPLAY_bookid=2554&amp;VerticalID=0 --&gt;{{cite web|url=http://app.knovel.com/web/toc.v/cid:kpASHRAE22/viewerType:toc/root_slug:ashrae-handbook-fundamentals/url_slug:ashrae-handbook-fundamentals/|title=2009 ASHRAE Handbook - Fundamentals (I-P Edition)|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017172515/http://app.knovel.com/web/toc.v/cid:kpASHRAE22/viewerType:toc/root_slug:ashrae-handbook-fundamentals/url_slug:ashrae-handbook-fundamentals/|archivedate=17 October 2015|accessdate=2015-09-21|df=dmy-all}}? 2009 ASHRAE Handbook – Fundamentals (I-P Edition)].

* 1000&amp;nbsp;Btu/h is approximately {{convert|1000|Btu/h|W|disp=out|sigfig=4}}
* 1 [[horsepower]] is approximately {{convert|1|hp|Btu/h|disp=out|sigfig=4}}

== Associated units ==
* 1 ''[[Ton of refrigeration|ton of cooling]]'', a common unit in North American refrigeration and air conditioning applications, is {{convert|12,000|Btu/h|kW|2|abbr=on}}. It is the rate of heat transfer needed to freeze {{convert|1|ST|kg|0}} of water into ice in 24 hours.
* In the United States and Canada, the [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] that describes the performance of thermal insulation is typically quoted in square foot degree Fahrenheit hours per British thermal unit (ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;⋅°F⋅h/Btu). For one square foot of the insulation, one BTU per hour of heat flows across the insulator for each degree of temperature difference across it.
* 1 ''[[therm]]'' is defined in the United States and European Union as 100,000&amp;nbsp;Btu—but the U.S. uses the Btu&lt;sub&gt;59&amp;nbsp;°F&lt;/sub&gt; while the EU uses the Btu&lt;sub&gt;IT&lt;/sub&gt;. United Kingdom regulations were amended to replace therms with joules with effect from January 1, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1995/1804/made|title=The Units of Measurement Regulations 1995|access-date=November 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2013}} the therm is still used in natural gas pricing in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/gas/wholesale-market/gb-gas-wholesale-market|publisher=[[Office of Gas and Electricity Markets]]|title=The GB gas wholesale market|quote=The wholesale gas market in Britain has one price for gas irrespective of where the gas comes from.

* 1 ''[[Quad (unit)|quad]]'' (short for [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1015|quadrillion]]&amp;nbsp;Btu) is 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Btu, which is about 1 exajoule ({{val|1.055|e=18|u=J}}). Quads are used in the United States for representing the annual energy consumption of large economies: for example, the U.S. economy used 99.75 quads in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Husher |first1=John Durbin |title=Crises of the 21st Century: Start Drilling-The Year 2020 Is Coming Fast |publisher=iUniverse |date=2009 |page=376 |oclc=610004375 |isbn=9781440140549}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One quad/year is about 33.43 gigawatts.

The Btu should not be confused with the [[Kilowatt hour|Board of Trade Unit]] (B.O.T.U.), an obsolete UK synonym for kilowatt hour ({{convert|1|kW.h|Btu|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}).

The Btu is often used to express the conversion-efficiency of heat into electrical energy in power plants. Figures are quoted in terms of the quantity of heat in Btu required to generate 1&amp;nbsp;kW⋅h of electrical energy. A typical coal-fired power plant works at {{convert|10500|Btu/kWh|kWh/kWh|abbr=on}}, an efficiency of 32–33%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npc.org/Study_Topic_Papers/4-DTG-ElectricEfficiency.pdf |title=Electric Generation Efficiency |publisher=[[National Petroleum Council (US)|National Petroleum Council]] (NPC) |editor1-first=David K. |editor1-last=Bellman |date=July 18, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120094040/http://www.npc.org/Study_Topic_Papers/4-DTG-ElectricEfficiency.pdf |archivedate=20 November 2008 |df=dmy-all |access-date=30 March 2012 }} Working Document of the NPC Global Oil &amp; Gas Study.&lt;/ref&gt;

The centigrade heat unit (CHU) is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree [[Celsius]]. It is equal to 1.8&amp;nbsp;BTU or 1899 joules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.diracdelta.co.uk/science/source/c/e/centigrade%20heat%20unit/source.html |title=Centigrade Heat Unit |access-date=10 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225090911/http://www.diracdelta.co.uk/science/source/c/e/centigrade%20heat%20unit/source.html |archive-date=25 December 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This unit was sometimes used in the United Kingdom as an alternative to BTU but is now obsolete.
