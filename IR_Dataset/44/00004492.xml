'''Baghdad''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|g|d|æ|d|,_|b|ə|g|ˈ|d|æ|d}}; {{lang-ar|بغداد}} {{IPAc-ar|AUD|Baghdad.ogg|b|a|gh|ˈ|d|aa|d}}) is the capital of [[Iraq]] and the [[list of largest cities in the Arab world|second-largest city]] in the [[Arab world]] after [[Cairo]]. Located along the [[Tigris|Tigris River]], the city was founded in the 8th century and became the capital of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. Within a short time of its inception, Baghdad evolved into a significant cultural, commercial, and intellectual center of the [[Muslim world]]. This, in addition to housing several key academic institutions, including the [[House of Wisdom]], as well as hosting a multiethnic and multireligious environment, garnered the city a worldwide reputation as the &quot;Centre of Learning&quot;.

Baghdad was the largest city in the world for much of the Abbasid era during the [[Islamic Golden Age]], peaking at a population of more than a million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm |title=Largest Cities Through History |publisher=Geography.about.com |date=6 April 2011 |accessdate=19 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050527095609/http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm |archive-date=27 May 2005 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was largely [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|destroyed]] at the hands of the [[Mongol Empire]] in 1258, resulting in a decline that would linger through many centuries due to frequent plagues and multiple successive empires. With the recognition of Iraq as an independent state (formerly the [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia]]) in 1932, Baghdad gradually regained some of its former prominence as a significant center of [[Arabic culture]], with a population variously estimated at 6 or over 7 million.{{refn|group=note|name=population|Estimates of total population differ substantially.

In contemporary times, the city has often faced severe infrastructural damage, most recently due to the [[United States]]-led  [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], and the subsequent [[Iraq War]] that lasted until December 2011. In recent years, the city has been frequently subjected to [[Iraqi insurgency (2003–2011)|insurgency]] attacks. The war had resulted in a [[Archaeological looting in Iraq|substantial loss of cultural heritage and historical artifacts]] as well. {{As of|2018}}, Baghdad was listed as one of the least hospitable places in the world to live, ranked by [[Mercer (consulting firm)|Mercer]] as the worst major city for quality of life in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mercer-ranking/vienna-unbeatable-as-worlds-most-liveable-city-baghdad-still-worst-idUSKBN1GW00T Vienna unbeatable as world's most liveable city, Baghdad still worst].

==Etymology==
The name Baghdad is pre-Islamic, and its origin is disputed.&lt;ref name=EI2 /&gt; The site where the city of Baghdad developed has been populated for millennia. By the 8th century AD, several villages had developed there, including a Persian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Baghdad|title=Baghdad, Foundation and early growth|quote=[...] the site located between present-day Al-Kāẓimiyyah and Al-Karkh and occupied by a Persian village called Baghdad, was selected by al-Manṣūr, the second caliph of the Abbāsid dynasty, for his capital.|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=21 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009070155/http://www.britannica.com/place/Baghdad|archive-date=9 October 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Le Strange, G.

Arab authors, realizing the pre-Islamic origins of Baghdad's name, generally looked for its roots in Persian.&lt;ref name=EI2&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Duri, A.A. |title=Bag̲h̲dād| year= 2012 |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition= 2nd|publisher=Brill |editor=P.

A few authors have suggested older origins for the name, in particular the name ''Bagdadu'' or ''Hudadu'' that existed in Old Babylonian (spelled with a sign that can represent both ''bag'' and ''hu''), and the Babylonian Talmudic name of a place called &quot;Baghdatha&quot;.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John B.

When the Abbasid caliph, [[al-Mansur]], founded a completely new city for his capital, he chose the name [[Round City of Baghdad|Madinat al-Salaam]] or ''City of Peace''. This was the official name on coins, weights, and other official usage, although the common people continued to use the old name.&lt;ref name=&quot;ما معنى اسم مدينة بغداد ومن سماه ؟&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seenjeem.maktoob.com/question?category_id=4&amp;level=L2&amp;question_id=9510 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120713093613/http://seenjeem.maktoob.com/question?category_id=4&amp;level=L2&amp;question_id=9510 |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 July 2012 |title=ما معنى اسم مدينة بغداد ومن سماه ؟ |publisher=Seenjeem.maktoob.com |accessdate=27 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ejabat.google.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ejabat.google.com/ejabat/thread?tid=6981074380f32f74|website=[[Google Questions and Answers|Google Ejabat]]|accessdate=27 April 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229160415/http://ejabat.google.com/ejabat/thread?tid=6981074380f32f74|archivedate=29 December 2013|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2017}} By the 11th century, &quot;Baghdad&quot; became almost the exclusive name for the world-renowned metropolis.

[[File:PARSONS(1808) p008 View of Bagdad on the Persian side of the Tigris.jpg|thumb|A view of Baghdad from the print collection in Travels in Asia and Africa, etc. (ed. J. P. Berjew, British Library)]]
After the fall of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], the first Muslim dynasty, the victorious [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] rulers wanted their own capital from which they could rule. They chose a site north of the [[Sassanid]] capital of [[Ctesiphon]] (and also just north of where ancient [[Babylon]] had once stood), and on 30 July 762&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[caliph]] [[Al-Mansur]] commissioned the construction of the city. It was built under the supervision of the [[Barmakids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
|title=Times History of the World
|publisher=Times Books

Mansur loved the site so much he is quoted saying: &quot;This is indeed the city that I am to found, where I am to live, and where my descendants will reign afterward&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The city's growth was helped by its excellent location, based on at least two factors: it had control over strategic and trading routes along the [[Tigris]], and it had an abundance of water in a dry climate. Water exists on both the north and south ends of the city, allowing all households to have a plentiful supply, which was very uncommon during this time.

Baghdad eclipsed Ctesiphon, the capital of the Sassanians, which was located some {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the southeast. Today, all that remains of Ctesiphon is the shrine town of [[Salman Pak]], just to the south of Greater Baghdad. Ctesiphon itself had replaced and absorbed [[Seleucia]], the first capital of the [[Seleucid Empire]], which had earlier replaced the city of Babylon.

According to the traveler [[Ibn Battuta]], Baghdad was one of the largest cities, not including the damage it has received. The residents are mostly [[Hanbali|Hanbal]]. Baghdad is also home to the grave of [[Abu Hanifa]] where there is a cell and a mosque above it. The Sultan of Baghdad, [[Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan|Abu Said Bahadur Khan]], was a Tatar king who embraced Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Battuta, pg. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

In its early years, the city was known as a deliberate reminder of an expression in the [[Qur'an]], when it refers to [[Paradise]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiet, pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt; It took four years to build (764–768). Mansur assembled engineers, surveyors, and art constructionists from around the world to come together and draw up plans for the city. Over 100,000 construction workers came to survey the plans; many were distributed salaries to start the building of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Corzine|first=Phyllis|title=The Islamic Empire|year=2005|publisher=Thomson Gale|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; July was chosen as the starting time because two [[Astrology|astrologers]], [[Naubakht|Naubakht Ahvazi]] and [[Mashallah ibn Athari|Mashallah]], believed that the city should be built under the sign of the [[Mesopotamian lion|lion]], [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiet, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Leo is associated with fire and symbolises productivity, pride, and expansion.

The bricks used to make the city were {{convert|18|in|mm}} on all four sides. [[Abu Hanifa]]h was the counter of the bricks and he developed a canal, which brought water to the work site for both human consumption and the manufacture of the bricks. Marble was also used to make buildings throughout the city, and marble steps led down to the river's edge.

[[File:Baghdad 150 to 300 AH.gif|thumb|upright|The [[Round city of Baghdad]] between 767 and 912&amp;nbsp;AD]]
{{Confusing|reason=The city can't be both 19 km and 2 km wide. It's also unclear what a &quot;framework&quot; is in this context.|date=March 2019}}
The basic framework of the city consists of two large semicircles about {{convert|19|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter. The city was designed as a circle about {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} in diameter, leading it to be known as the &quot;Round City&quot;. The original design shows a single ring of residential and commercial structures along the inside of the city walls, but the final construction added another ring inside the first.&lt;ref name=&quot;ox&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamicceramics.ashmol.ox.ac.uk/Abbasid/baghdad.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030325090348/http://islamicceramics.ashmol.ox.ac.uk/Abbasid/baghdad.htm |archivedate=25 March 2003 |url-status=dead |title=Abbasid Ceramics: Plan of Baghdad |accessdate=5 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the city there were many parks, gardens, villas, and promenades.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Yakut: Baghdad under the Abbasids, c. 1000CE&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In the center of the city lay the [[mosque]], as well as headquarters for guards. The purpose or use of the remaining space in the center is unknown. The circular design of the city was a direct reflection of the traditional Persian Sasanian [[urban planning|urban design]]. The Sasanian city of [[Firuzabad, Fars|Gur]] in [[Fars Province|Fars]], built 500 years before Baghdad, is nearly identical in its general circular design, radiating avenues, and the government buildings and temples at the centre of the city. This style of urban planning contrasted with Ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] urban planning, in which cities are designed as squares or rectangles with streets intersecting each other at right angles.

;Surrounding walls
{{see also|Gates of Baghdad}}
The four surrounding walls of Baghdad were named [[Kufa]], [[Basra]], [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], and [[Syria]]; named because their gates pointed in the directions of these destinations. The distance between these gates was a little less than {{convert|1.5|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Each gate had double doors that were made of iron; the doors were so heavy it took several men to open and close them. The wall itself was about 44&amp;nbsp;m thick at the base and about 12&amp;nbsp;m thick at the top. Also, the wall was 30&amp;nbsp;m high, which included [[merlon]]s, a solid part of an embattled parapet usually pierced by [[embrasure]]s.

;Golden Gate Palace
The Golden Gate Palace, the residence of the caliph and his family, was in the middle of Baghdad, in the central square. In the central part of the building, there was a green dome that was 39&amp;nbsp;m high. Surrounding the palace was an [[esplanade]], a waterside building, in which only the caliph could come riding on horseback. In addition, the palace was near other mansions and officer's residences. Near the Gate of Syria, a building served as the home for the guards. It was made of brick and marble. The palace governor lived in the latter part of the building and the commander of the guards in the front. In 813, after the death of caliph [[Al-Amin]], the palace was no longer used as the home for the caliph and his family.&lt;ref&gt;Wiet, pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the notable features of Baghdad during this period were its exceptional libraries. Many of the Abbasid caliphs were patrons of learning and enjoyed collecting both ancient and contemporary literature. Although some of the princes of the previous Umayyad dynasty had begun to gather and translate Greek scientific literature, the Abbasids were the first to foster Greek learning on a large scale. Many of these libraries were private collections intended only for the use of the owners and their immediate friends, but the libraries of the caliphs and other officials soon took on a public or a semi-public character.&lt;ref name=mackensen&gt;Mackensen, Ruth Stellhorn . (1932). Four Great Libraries of Medieval Baghdad. ''The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy'', Vol. 2, No. 3 (July 1932), pp. 279-299. University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Four great libraries were established in Baghdad during this period. The earliest was that of the famous [[Al-Ma'mun]], who was caliph from 813 to 833. Another was established by [[Sabur ibn Ardashir]] in 991 or 993 for the literary men and scholars who frequented his academy.&lt;ref name=mackensen/&gt; Unfortunately, this second library was plundered and burned by the Seljuks only seventy years after it was established. This was a good example of the sort of library built up out of the needs and interests of a literary society.&lt;ref name=mackensen/&gt; The last two were examples of ''madrasa'' or theological college libraries. The [[Nezamiyeh]] was founded by the Persian [[Nizam al-Mulk]], who was vizier of two early Seljuk sultans.&lt;ref name=mackensen/&gt; It continued to operate even after the coming of the Mongols in 1258. The [[Mustansiriya Madrasah|Mustansiriyah ''madrasa'']], which owned an exceedingly rich library, was founded by [[Al-Mustansir (Baghdad)|Al-Mustansir]], the second last Abbasid caliph, who died in 1242.&lt;ref name=mackensen/&gt; This would prove to be the last great library built by the caliphs of Baghdad.

Schellinger|year=1996|publisher=[[Taylor and Francis]]|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baghdad's early meteoric growth eventually slowed due to troubles within the [[Caliphate]], including relocations of the capital to [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]] (during 808–819 and 836–892), the loss of the western and easternmost provinces, and periods of political domination by the [[Iran]]ian [[Buwayhid]]s (945–1055) and [[Seljuk Turks]] (1055–1135).

The [[Seljuks]] were a clan of the [[Oghuz Turks]] from Central Asia that converted to the [[Sunni]] branch of Islam. In 1040, they destroyed the [[Ghaznavids]], taking over their land and in 1055, [[Tughril Beg]], the leader of the Seljuks, took over Baghdad. The Seljuks expelled the [[Buyid dynasty]] of Shiites that had ruled for some time and took over power and control of Baghdad. They ruled as [[Sultans]] in the name of the Abbasid caliphs (they saw themselves as being part of the Abbasid regime). Tughril Beg saw himself as the protector of the Abbasid Caliphs.&lt;ref&gt;''Atlas of the Medieval World'' pg. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

Sieges and wars in which Baghdad was involved are listed below:

In 1058, Baghdad was captured by the [[Fatimids]] under the Turkish general Abu'l-Ḥārith Arslān al-Basasiri, an adherent of the [[Ismailis]] along with the 'Uqaylid Quraysh.&lt;ref&gt;Virani, Shafique N. ''The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation'', (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Not long before the arrival of the Saljuqs in Baghdad, al-Basasiri petitioned to the Fatimid Imam-Caliph [[Al-Mustansir Billah|al-Mustansir]] to support him in conquering Baghdad on the Ismaili Imam's behalf. It has recently come to light that the famed Fatimid ''[[da'i]]'', al-Mu'ayyad al-Shirazi, had a direct role in supporting al-Basasiri and helped the general to succeed in taking [[Mosul|Mawṣil]], [[Wasit, Iraq|Wāsit]] and [[Kufa]].

In 1534, Baghdad was [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1532–55)|captured]] by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]]. Under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], Baghdad continued into a period of decline, partially as a result of the enmity between its rulers and Iranian Safavids, which did not accept the Sunni control of the city.

During the 1970s, Baghdad experienced a period of prosperity and growth because of a sharp increase in the [[price of petroleum]], Iraq's main export. New infrastructure including modern sewerage, water, and highway facilities were built during this period. The masterplans of the city (1967, 1973) were delivered by the Polish planning office Miastoprojekt-Kraków, mediated by Polservice.&lt;ref&gt;Stanek, L., Miastoprojekt goes abroad: the transfer of architectural labour from socialist Poland to Iraq (1958–1989), The Journal of Architecture, Volume 17, Issue 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Iran–Iraq War]] of the 1980s was a difficult time for the city, as money was diverted by [[Saddam Hussein]] to the army and thousands of residents were killed. Iran launched a number of missile attacks against Baghdad in retaliation for Saddam Hussein's continuous bombardments of Tehran's residential districts.

In 1991 and 2003, the [[Gulf War]] and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] caused [[Damage to Baghdad during the Iraq War|significant damage]] to Baghdad's transportation, [[Electricity generation|power]], and sanitary infrastructure as the US-led coalition forces launched massive aerial assaults in the city in the two wars.  Also in 2003, the minor riot in the city (which took place on 21 July) caused some disturbance in the population.

The historic &quot;Assyrian Quarter&quot; of the city, [[Dora, Baghdad|Dora]], which boasted a population of 150,000 [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]]s in 2003, made up over 3% of the capital's Assyrian population then. The community has been subject to kidnappings, death threats, vandalism, and house burnings by [[Al-Qaeda]] and other insurgent groups. As of the end of 2014, only 1,500 Assyrians remained in Dora.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/11307515/Iraq-crisis-The-last-Christians-of-Dora.html |title=Iraq crisis: The last Christians of Dora |access-date=5 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413063147/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/11307515/Iraq-crisis-The-last-Christians-of-Dora.html |archive-date=13 April 2018 |url-status=live  |date=22 December 2014 |last1=Spencer |first1=Richard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Points of interest include the '''[[National Museum of Iraq]]''' whose priceless collection of artifacts was looted during the 2003 invasion, and the iconic Hands of Victory arches. Multiple Iraqi parties are in discussions as to whether the arches should remain as historical monuments or be dismantled. Thousands of ancient manuscripts in the [[Iraq National Library and Archive|National Library]] were destroyed under [[Saddam]]'s command.

===Mutanabbi Street===
{{Main|Mutanabbi Street}}

Mutanabbi Street (Arabic: شارع المتنبي) is located near the old quarter of Baghdad; at Al Rasheed Street. It is the historic center of Baghdadi book-selling, a street filled with bookstores and outdoor book stalls. It was named after the 10th-century classical Iraqi poet [[Al-Mutanabbi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes2008&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Then and Now: A New Chapter for Baghdad Book Market |url=http://baghdadbureau.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/then-and-now-a-new-chapter-for-baghdad-book-market/?hp |work=The New York Times |first=Eric |last=Owles |date=18 December 2008 |accessdate=19 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221035319/http://baghdadbureau.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/then-and-now-a-new-chapter-for-baghdad-book-market/?hp |archive-date=21 December 2008 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This street is well established for bookselling and has often been referred to as the heart and soul of the Baghdad literacy and intellectual community.

===Baghdad Zoo===
{{Main|Baghdad Zoo}}

The [[zoological park]] used to be the largest in the [[Middle East]]. Within eight days following the 2003 invasion, however, only 35 of the 650 animals in the facility survived. This was a result of theft of some animals for human food, and starvation of caged animals that had no food. [[South Africa]]n [[Lawrence Anthony]] and some of the zoo keepers cared for the animals and fed the carnivores with [[donkey]]s they had bought locally.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC radio 4, zoo&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Grand Festivities Square===
[[Grand Festivities Square]] is the main square where public celebrations are held and is also the home to three important monuments commemorating Iraqi's fallen soldiers and victories in war; namely Al-Shaheed Monument, the [[Victory Arch]] and the [[The Monument to the Unknown Soldier|Unknown Soldier's Monument]].&lt;ref&gt;Makiya, K. and Al-Khalilm S., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Saddam Hussein's Iraq,'' p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al-Shaheed Monument===
[[Al-Shaheed Monument]] ({{lang-ar|نصب الشهيد}}), also known as the Martyr's Memorial, is a monument dedicated to the Iraqi soldiers who died in the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. However, now it is generally considered by Iraqis to be for all of the martyrs of Iraq, especially those allied with Iran and Syria currently fighting ISIS, not just of the Iran–Iraq War. The Monument was opened in 1983, and was designed by the Iraqi architect Saman Kamal and the Iraqi sculptor and artist [[Ismail Fatah Al Turk]]. During the 1970s and 1980s, [[Saddam Hussein]]'s government spent a lot of money on new monuments, which included the al-Shaheed Monument.&lt;ref name=&quot;Global Security&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=GlobalSecurity.org|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/baghdad-monuments.htm|access-date=16 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225151850/https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/baghdad-monuments.htm|archive-date=25 December 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative divisions==
{{see also|List of neighborhoods and districts in Baghdad}}
[[File:Bagdad-sat.JPG|thumb|Baghdad as seen from the [[International Space Station]]]]
Administratively, Baghdad Governorate is divided into [[Kaza|districts]] which are further divided into [[nahiyah|sub-districts]].  Municipally, the governorate is divided into 9 municipalities, which have responsibility for local issues.  Regional services, however, are coordinated and carried out by a mayor who oversees the municipalities.  There is no single [[city council]] that singularly governs Baghdad at a municipal level.  The governorate council is responsible for the governorate-wide policy.

These official subdivisions of the city served as administrative centres for the delivery of municipal services but until 2003 had no political function. Beginning in April 2003, the U.S. controlled [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] (CPA) began the process of creating new functions for these. The process initially focused on the election of neighbourhood councils in the official neighbourhoods, elected by neighbourhood caucuses.

The CPA convened a series of meetings in each neighbourhood to explain local government, to describe the caucus election process and to encourage participants to spread the word and bring friends, relatives and neighbours to subsequent meetings. Each neighbourhood process ultimately ended with a final meeting where candidates for the new neighbourhood councils identified themselves and asked their neighbours to vote for them.

Once all 88 (later increased to 89) neighbourhood councils were in place, each neighbourhood council elected representatives from among their members to serve on one of the city's nine district councils. The number of neighbourhood representatives on a district council is based upon the neighbourhood's population. The next step was to have each of the nine district councils elect representatives from their membership to serve on the 37 member Baghdad City Council. This three tier system of local government connected the people of Baghdad to the central government through their representatives from the neighbourhood, through the district, and up to the city council.

The same process was used to provide representative councils for the other communities in Baghdad Province outside of the city itself. There, local councils were elected from 20 neighbourhoods (Nahia) and these councils elected representatives from their members to serve on six district councils (Qada). As within the city, the district councils then elected representatives from among their members to serve on the 35 member Baghdad Regional Council.

The first step in the establishment of the system of local government for Baghdad Province was the election of the Baghdad Provincial Council. As before, the representatives to the Provincial Council were elected by their peers from the lower councils in numbers proportional to the population of the districts they represent. The 41 member Provincial Council took office in February 2004 and served until national elections held in January 2005, when a new Provincial Council was elected.

This system of 127 separate councils may seem overly cumbersome; however, Baghdad Province is home to approximately seven million people. At the lowest level, the neighbourhood councils, each council represents an average of 75,000 people.

==Geography==
The city is located on a vast plain bisected by the [[Tigris]] river. The Tigris splits Baghdad in half, with the eastern half being called &quot;[[Al-Rusafa, Iraq|Risafa]]&quot; and the Western half known as &quot;[[Karkh]]&quot;. The land on which the city is built is almost entirely flat and low-lying, being of [[alluvium|alluvial]] origin due to the periodic large floods which have occurred on the river.

{{wide image|Tigris River in Baghdad (2016).jpg|1000px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view of the Tigris as it flows through Baghdad}}

===Climate===
Baghdad has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BWh''), featuring extremely hot, dry summers and mild winters.

In the summer, from June through August, the average maximum temperature is as high as {{convert|44|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, accompanied by blazing sunshine. Rainfall has, in fact, been recorded on fewer than half a dozen occasions at this time of year and has never exceeded {{convert|1|mm|in|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knmi.nl/~oldenbor/|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120711043252/http://www.knmi.nl/~oldenbor/|url-status=dead|title=Geert Jan van Oldenborgh @ KNMI|date=11 July 2012|archivedate=11 July 2012|website=archive.is|accessdate=20 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even at night temperatures in summer are seldom below {{convert|24|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Baghdad's record highest temperature of 51 degrees Celsius (124 degrees Fahrenheit) was reached in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/weather/iranian-city-just-hit-world-record-temps-that-feel-like-163-degrees/ar-BBlh7k7] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150802172014/http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/weather/iranian-city-just-hit-world-record-temps-that-feel-like-163-degrees/ar-BBlh7k7 |date=2 August 2015 }} Accessed 31 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[humidity]] is typically under 50% in summer due to Baghdad's distance from the marshy southern Iraq and the coasts of [[Persian Gulf]], and [[dust storm]]s from the deserts to the west are a normal occurrence during the summer.

Winter temperatures are typical of [[hot desert climate]]s. From December through February, Baghdad has maximum temperatures averaging {{convert|15.5|to|18.5|C|F}}, though highs above {{convert|21|C|F}} are not unheard of. Lows below freezing occur a couple of times per year on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldweather.wmo.int/en/city.html?cityId=1464|title=World Weather Information Service|date=26 October 2016|website=worldweather.wmo.int|access-date=26 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027054505/http://worldweather.wmo.int/en/city.html?cityId=1464|archive-date=27 October 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
[[File:Guru Nanak Shrine in Iraq.jpg|thumb|right|225px|[[Guru Nanak]] Shrine in western Baghdad, [[Iraq]]]]
{{More citations needed section|date=June 2019}}
Baghdad's population was estimated at 7.22 million in 2015. The city historically had a predominantly [[Sunni]] population, but by the early 21st century around 82% of the city's population were [[Shia Islam in Iraq|Iraqi Shia]]. At the beginning of the 21st century, some 1.5 million people migrated to Baghdad, most of them Shiites and a few Sunnis. Sunni Muslims make up 23% of Iraq's population and they are still a majority in west and north Iraq.

As early as 2003, about 20 percent of the population of the city was the result of mixed marriages between Shi'ites and Sunnis: they are often referred to as &quot;Sushis&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-36528536 |title='Sushi' children defy Sunni-Shia divide |access-date=21 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010175830/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-36528536 |archive-date=10 October 2018 |url-status=live  |work=BBC News |date=18 June 2016 |last1=Kamal |first1=Nesrine }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Sectarian violence in Iraq (2006–07)|sectarian violence in Iraq]] between the Sunni and Shia militia groups during the U.S. occupation of Iraq, the city's population became overwhelmingly Shia. Despite the government's promise to resettle Sunnis displaced by the violence, little has been done to bring this about. The [[Iraqi Civil War (2014–2017)|Iraqi Civil War following ISIS' invasion]] in 2014 caused hundreds of thousands of Iraqi internally displaced people to flee to the city. The city currently has Sunni, Shia, Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriacs, Armenians and mixed neighborhoods.

The city was also home to a large [[Jewish]] community and regularly visited by [[Sikh]] pilgrims.

===Reconstruction efforts===

Most [[Reconstruction of Iraq|Iraqi reconstruction]] efforts have been devoted to the restoration and repair of badly damaged urban infrastructure. More visible efforts at reconstruction through private development, like architect and urban designer [[Hisham N. Ashkouri]]'s [[Reconstruction of Iraq#Proposed Baghdad Renaissance Plan|Baghdad Renaissance Plan]] and the [[Sindbad Hotel Complex and Conference Center]] have also been made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arcadd.com/baghdad-cbd.htm ARCADD] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220055610/http://www.arcadd.com/baghdad-cbd.htm |date=20 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A plan was proposed by a Government agency to rebuild a tourist island in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/world/middleeast/21tourism.html?n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fT%2fTravel%20and%20Vacations&amp;_r=0|title=The New York Times|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=5 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006120152/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/world/middleeast/21tourism.html?n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fT%2fTravel%20and%20Vacations&amp;_r=0|archive-date=6 October 2014|url-status=live|newspaper=The New York Times|date=20 September 2008|last1=Goode|first1=Erica|last2=Mohammed|first2=Riyadh}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2009, a construction plan was proposed to rebuild the heart of Baghdad, but the plan was never realized because corruption was involved in it.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/world/middleeast/30baghdad.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=The New York Times|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=5 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006200141/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/world/middleeast/30baghdad.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|archive-date=6 October 2014|url-status=live|newspaper=The New York Times|date=29 December 2009|last1=Mohammed|first1=Riyadh|last2=Leland|first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iraq's Tourism Board is also seeking investors to develop a &quot;romantic&quot; island on the River Tigris in Baghdad that was once a popular honeymoon spot for newlywed Iraqis. The project would include a six-star hotel, spa, an 18-hole golf course and a country club. In addition, the go-ahead has been given to build numerous architecturally unique skyscrapers along the Tigris that would develop the city's financial centre in Kadhehemiah.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc.msn.com/id/26425911&quot;/&gt;

In October 2008, the [[Baghdad Metro]] resumed service. It connects the center to the southern neighborhood of [[Dora, Baghdad|Dora]].

Baghdad has always played a significant role in the broader [[Arab culture|Arab cultural sphere]], contributing several significant writers, musicians and visual artists. Famous [[Arab]] poets and singers such as [[Nizar Qabbani]], [[Umm Kulthum]], [[Fairuz]], [[Salah Al-Hamdani]], [[Ilham al-Madfai]] and others have performed for the city.

The dialect of [[Baghdad Arabic|Arabic spoken in Baghdad]] today differs from that of other large urban centres in Iraq, having features more characteristic of nomadic Arabic dialects (Versteegh, ''The Arabic Language''). It is possible that this was caused by the repopulating of the city with rural residents after the multiple sackings of the late [[Middle Ages]].

Baghdad joined the [[Creative Cities Network|UNESCO Creative Cities Network]] as a City of Literature in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iinanews.org/page/public/news_details.aspx?id=138171&amp;NL=True|title=Baghdad selected as new member of 'UNESCO Creative Cities Network'|access-date=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the important cultural institutions in the city include the [[National Theater (Iraq)|National Theater]], which was looted during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], but efforts are underway to restore the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csmonitor.com/2003/0716/p01s04b-woiq.htm Five women confront a new Iraq | csmonitor.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828071929/http://csmonitor.com/2003/0716/p01s04b-woiq.htm |date=28 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The live theatre scene received a boost during the 1990s, when UN [[Economic sanctions|sanctions]] limited the import of foreign films. As many as 30 movie theatres were reported to have been converted to live stages, producing a wide range of [[Comedy|comedies]] and dramatic productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0102-04.htm |title=In Baghdad, Art Thrives As War Hovers |publisher=Commondreams.org |date=2 January 2003 |accessdate=27 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627162352/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0102-04.htm |archivedate=27 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutions offering cultural education in Baghdad include [[The Music and Ballet School of Baghdad]] and the Institute of Fine Arts Baghdad. The [[Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra]] is a government funded symphony orchestra in Baghdad. The INSO plays primarily classical European music, as well as original compositions based on Iraqi and Arab instruments and music. Baghdad is also home to a number of museums which housed [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and relics of [[ancient civilization]]; many of these were stolen, and the museums looted, during the widespread chaos immediately after United States forces entered the city.

During the [[History of Iraq (2003–11)|2003 occupation of Iraq]], [[AFN Iraq]] (&quot;Freedom Radio&quot;) broadcast news and entertainment within Baghdad, among other locations. There is also a private radio station called &quot;Dijlah&quot; (named after the Arabic word for the Tigris River) that was created in 2004 as Iraq's first independent talk radio station. Radio Dijlah offices, in the [[Jamia]] neighborhood of Baghdad, have been attacked on several occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dinarrvnews.net/gunmen-iraq-media-attacked/ |title=Gunmen storm independent radio station in latest attack against media in Iraq |work=International Herald Tribune |date=29 March 2009 |accessdate=30 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010060435/http://dinarrvnews.net/gunmen-iraq-media-attacked/ |archive-date=10 October 2017 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Destruction of cultural heritage===
Priceless collection of artifacts in the [[National Museum of Iraq]] was looted during the 2003 US-led invasion. Thousands of ancient manuscripts in the [[Iraq National Library and Archive|National Library]] were destroyed under [[Saddam]]'s command and because of neglect by the occupying coalition forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/634kfc.htm |title=Occupation and international humanitarian law: Questions and answers - ICRC |access-date=16 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004110213/https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/634kfc.htm |archive-date=4 October 2017 |url-status=live  |date=4 August 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
Baghdad is home to some of the most successful [[Association football|football (soccer)]] teams in Iraq, the biggest being [[Al-Shorta SC|Al-Shorta]] (Police), [[Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya]] (Airforce club), [[Al-Zawra'a SC|Al-Zawra'a]], and [[Talaba SC|Talaba]] (Students). The largest stadium in Baghdad is [[Al-Shaab Stadium]], which was opened in 1966.

The city has also had a strong tradition of [[horse racing]] ever since [[World War I]], known to Baghdadis simply as 'Races'. There are reports of pressures by the Islamists to stop this tradition due to the associated gambling.{{cn|date=February 2020}}
