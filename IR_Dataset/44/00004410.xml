As almost any cereal containing certain sugars can undergo [[spontaneous fermentation]] due to wild yeasts in the air, it is possible that beer-like beverages were independently developed throughout the world soon after a tribe or culture had domesticated cereal. Chemical tests of ancient pottery jars reveal that beer was produced as far back as about 7,000 years ago in what is today Iran. This discovery reveals one of the earliest known uses of fermentation and is the earliest evidence of brewing to date. In Mesopotamia, the oldest evidence of beer is believed to be a 6,000-year-old Sumerian tablet depicting people drinking a beverage through reed straws from a [[communal bowl]]. A 3900-year-old Sumerian poem honouring [[Ninkasi]], the patron goddess of brewing, contains the oldest surviving beer recipe, describing the production of [[beer]] from barley via bread. The invention of bread and beer has been argued to be responsible for humanity's ability to develop technology and build civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&amp;articleID=E699E9C7-E7F2-99DF-38A7329520CF67D6&amp;colID=15|journal=[[Scientific American]]|volume=296|issue=5|pages=102|date=May 2007|title=Ale's Well with the World|author=Steve Mirsky|accessdate=4 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016205228/http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&amp;articleID=E699E9C7-E7F2-99DF-38A7329520CF67D6&amp;colID=15|archive-date=16 October 2007|url-status=dead|bibcode=2007SciAm.296e.102M|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0507-102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Horst Dornbusch|url=http://www.aina.org/ata/20060827151956.htm|title=Beer: The Midwife of Civilization|publisher=Assyrian International News Agency|date=27 August 2006|accessdate=4 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327184922/http://www.aina.org/ata/20060827151956.htm|archive-date=27 March 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beer-pages.com/stories/complete-guide-beer.htm|author=Roger Protz|title=The Complete Guide to World Beer|year=2004|quote=When people of the ancient world realised they could make bread and beer from grain, they stopped roaming and settled down to cultivate cereals in recognisable communities.|author-link=Roger Protz|access-date=18 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425062158/http://www.beer-pages.com/stories/complete-guide-beer.htm|archive-date=25 April 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest chemically confirmed barley beer to date was discovered at [[Godin Tepe]] in the central [[Zagros Mountains]] of Iran, where fragments of a jug, at least 5,000 years old was found to be coated with [[beerstone]], a by-product of the brewing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penn.museum/sites/biomoleculararchaeology/?page_id=84|title=Barley Beer|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]]|accessdate=21 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008123537/http://www.penn.museum/sites/biomoleculararchaeology/?page_id=84|archive-date=8 October 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beer may have been known in [[Neolithic Europe]] as far back as 5,000 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/000123.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712080128/http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/000123.html |date=12 July 2017 }} ''Prehistoric brewing: the true story'', 22 October 2001, Archaeo News.

Ale produced before the [[Industrial Revolution]] continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale, although by the 7th century AD beer was also being produced and sold by European [[monasteries]].

;Water
Beer is composed mostly of water. Regions have water with different mineral components; as a result, different regions were originally better suited to making certain types of beer, thus giving them a regional character.&lt;ref name=&quot;geot&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brewconductor.com/brewing/ingredients/water-for-brewing/ |title=Water For Brewing |accessdate=18 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817203048/http://brewconductor.com/brewing/ingredients/water-for-brewing/ |archive-date=17 August 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Dublin]] has [[hard water]] well suited to making [[stout]], such as [[Guinness]]; while [[Plzeň|Pilsen]] has soft water well suited to making [[pale lager]], such as [[Pilsner Urquell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;geot&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/aug04/resources.html|title=Geology and Beer|work=Geotimes|date=August 2004|accessdate=5 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200414/http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/aug04/resources.html|archive-date=27 September 2007|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The waters of [[Beer in England#Burton upon Trent|Burton]] in England contain [[gypsum]], which benefits making [[pale ale]] to such a degree that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as [[Burtonisation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000098.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619014900/http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000098.html |date=19 June 2010 }} Michael Jackson, BeerHunter, 19 October 1991, ''Brewing a good glass of water''.

;Starch source
{{Main|Malt|Mash ingredients}}
The starch source in a beer provides the fermentable material and is a key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer. The most common starch source used in beer is malted grain. Grain is malted by soaking it in water, allowing it to begin [[germination]], and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln. Malting grain produces enzymes that will allow conversion from starches in the grain into fermentable sugars during the mash process.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:en:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Brewing/Chemistry|Wikisource]] 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Brewing/Chemistry. Retrieved 29 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain. Darker malts will produce darker beers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farm-direct.co.uk/farming/stockcrop/barley/malt.html Farm-direct] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814221734/http://www.farm-direct.co.uk/farming/stockcrop/barley/malt.html |date=14 August 2009 }} Oz, ''Barley Malt'', 6 February 2002. Retrieved 29 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all beer includes barley malt as the majority of the starch. This is because of its fibrous husk, which is important not only in the sparging stage of brewing (in which water is washed over the [[Mashing|mashed]] barley grains to form the [[wort]]) but also as a rich source of [[amylase]], a [[digestion|digestive]] [[enzyme]] that facilitates conversion of starch into sugars. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and [[rye]], and, less frequently, maize (corn) and sorghum) may be used. In recent years, a few brewers have produced [[gluten-free beer]] made with sorghum with no barley malt for people who cannot digest [[gluten]]-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Carolyn Smagalski| year=2006| url=http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art39558.asp| title=CAMRA &amp; The First International Gluten Free Beer Festival| publisher=Carolyn Smagalski, Bella Online| access-date=14 July 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101002170600/http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art39558.asp| archive-date=2 October 2010| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yeast is the [[microorganism]] that is responsible for fermentation in beer.

;Clarifying agent
{{Main|Finings}}
Some brewers add one or more [[clarifying agent]]s to beer, which typically [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] (collect as a solid) out of the beer along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts in the finished product. This process makes the beer appear [[Bright beer|bright]] and clean, rather than the cloudy appearance of ethnic and older styles of beer such as [[wheat beer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000717.html |title=Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter&amp;nbsp;– A pint of cloudy, please |publisher=Beerhunter.com |accessdate=28 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926132813/http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000717.html |archive-date=26 September 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mashing]] converts the starches released during the malting stage into sugars that can be fermented. The milled grain is mixed with hot water in a large vessel known as a [[mash tun]]. In this vessel, the grain and water are mixed together to create a cereal mash. During the mash, naturally occurring enzymes present in the malt convert the starches (long chain carbohydrates) in the grain into smaller molecules or simple sugars (mono-, di-, and tri-saccharides). This &quot;conversion&quot; is called [[saccharification]] which occurs between the temperatures 140 - 158 degrees F.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=John Palmer |url=http://howtobrew.com/book/section-3/the-methods-of-mashing/single-temperature-infusion |title=Single Temperature Infusion |publisher=How to Brew |date= |accessdate=2018-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217023955/http://howtobrew.com/book/section-3/the-methods-of-mashing/single-temperature-infusion |archive-date=17 February 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of the mashing process is a sugar-rich liquid or [[Wort (brewing)|&quot;wort&quot;]], which is then strained through the bottom of the mash tun in a process known as [[lautering]]. Prior to lautering, the mash temperature may be raised to about {{convert|75|–|78|C|F}} (known as a mashout) to free up more starch and reduce mash viscosity. Additional water may be sprinkled on the grains to extract additional sugars (a process known as [[Sparging (beer)|sparging]]).&lt;ref name=ref-21&gt;{{Cite book|author=Ted Goldammer|title=The Brewer's Handbook: The Complete Book To Brewing Beer |publisher=Apex |edition= 2nd |isbn=978-0-9675212-3-7 |date=1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wort is moved into a large tank known as a &quot;copper&quot; or [[kettle]] where it is boiled with [[hops]] and sometimes other ingredients such as herbs or sugars. This stage is where many chemical reactions take place, and where important decisions about the flavour, colour, and aroma of the beer are made.&lt;ref name=Fosters&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fosters.com.au/enjoy/beer/history_of_beer.htm |title=History of Beer |publisher=Foster's Group |date=July 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216203039/http://www.fosters.com.au/enjoy/beer/history_of_beer.htm |archivedate=16 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The boiling process serves to terminate enzymatic processes, [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] proteins, [[isomerization|isomerize]] hop [[resin]]s, and concentrate and [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilize]] the wort. Hops add flavour, [[odor|aroma]] and [[Bitter (taste)|bitterness]] to the beer. At the end of the boil, the hopped wort settles to clarify in a vessel called a &quot;whirlpool&quot;, where the more solid particles in the wort are separated out.&lt;ref name=ref-2&gt;{{Cite book|author=I. Hornsey |title=A History of Beer and Brewing |edition= 1st|location=Washington D.C. |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |isbn=978-0-85404-630-0 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the whirlpool, the wort is drawn away from the compacted hop trub, and rapidly cooled via a [[heat exchanger]] to a temperature where yeast can be added. A variety of heat exchanger designs are used in breweries, with the most common a plate-style. Water or glycol run in channels in the opposite direction of the wort, causing a rapid drop in temperature. It is very important to quickly cool the wort to a level where yeast can be added safely as yeast is unable to grow in very high temperatures, and will start to die in temperatures above {{Convert|60|°C}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref-4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oKDNAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41|page=41|title=The Oxford Handbook of Food Fermentations|author1=Charles W.

Mashing is the process of combining a mix of milled grain (typically [[malt]]ed [[barley]] with [[Adjuncts|supplementary grains]] such as [[Maize|corn]], [[sorghum]], [[rye]] or wheat), known as the &quot;grist&quot; or &quot;grain bill&quot;, and water, known as &quot;liquor&quot;, and heating this mixture in a vessel called a &quot;mash tun&quot;. Mashing is a form of steeping,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yjLqQPU_DzYC&amp;pg=PT197#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= The Illustrated Guide to Brewing Beer |author= Matthew Schaefer |page= 197 |publisher= Skyhorse Publishing Inc. |date= 15 February 2012 |accessdate= 13 November 2012 |isbn= 9781616084639 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160629172405/https://books.google.com/books?id=yjLqQPU_DzYC&amp;pg=PT197#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archive-date= 29 June 2016 |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and defines the act of brewing, such as with making tea, [[sake]], and [[soy sauce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=mb0SZIYCXREC&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Alcohol in Popular Culture: An Encyclopedia |author= Rachel Black |page= 41 |publisher= ABC-CLIO |date= 14 October 2010 |accessdate= 13 November 2012 |isbn= 9780313380488 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160624101218/https://books.google.com/books?id=mb0SZIYCXREC&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archive-date= 24 June 2016 |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Technically, wine, [[cider]] and [[mead]] are not brewed but rather [[vinified]], as there is no steeping process involving solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TlYFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA120#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|journal=The Saturday Magazine|page=120|author=The Saturday Magazine|title=The Useful Arts No. X|date=September 1835|accessdate=13 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503074345/https://books.google.com/books?id=TlYFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA120#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archive-date=3 May 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mashing allows the [[enzyme]]s in the malt to break down the [[starch]] in the grain into sugars, typically [[maltose]] to create a malty liquid called [[wort]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Foods and Nutrition Encyclopedia  |author=Audrey Ensminger|page= 188|publisher= [[CRC Press]]|year= 1994| isbn=978-0-8493-8980-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main methods – [[infusion]] mashing, in which the grains are heated in one vessel; and [[decoction]] mashing, in which a proportion of the grains are boiled and then returned to the mash, raising the temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Dan Rabin|title=The Dictionary of Beer and Brewing|publisher= [[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|page=180|year= 1998| isbn= 978-1-57958-078-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mashing involves pauses at certain temperatures (notably {{convert|45|-|62|-|73|C|F|disp=or}}), and takes place in a &quot;mash tun&quot; – an insulated brewing vessel with a [[false bottom]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;&quot;Abdijbieren.

Mashing usually takes 1 to 2 hours, and during this time the various temperature rests activate different enzymes depending upon the type of malt being used, its modification level, and the intention of the brewer. The activity of these enzymes convert the starches of the grains to [[dextrin]]s and then to fermentable sugars such as [[maltose]]. A mash rest from {{convert|49|-|55|C|F}} activates various [[protease]]s, which break down proteins that might otherwise cause the beer to be hazy. This rest is generally used only with undermodified (i.e. undermalted) malts which are decreasingly popular in Germany and the Czech Republic, or non-malted grains such as [[maize|corn]] and rice, which are widely used in North American beers. A mash rest at {{convert|60|°C|°F|abbr=on}} activates β-[[glucanase]], which breaks down gummy β-glucans in the mash, making the sugars flow out more freely later in the process. In the modern mashing process, commercial fungal based β-glucanase may be added as a supplement. Finally, a mash rest temperature of {{convert|65|-|71|C|F}} is used to convert the starches in the malt to sugar, which is then usable by the yeast later in the brewing process. Doing the latter rest at the lower end of the range favours [[β-amylase]] enzymes, producing more low-order sugars like [[maltotriose]], [[maltose]], and [[glucose]] which are more fermentable by the [[yeast]]. This in turn creates a beer lower in body and higher in alcohol. A rest closer to the higher end of the range favours [[α-amylase]] enzymes, creating more higher-order sugars and [[dextrin]]s which are less fermentable by the yeast, so a fuller-bodied beer with less alcohol is the result. Duration and [[pH]] variances also affect the sugar composition of the resulting wort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Wolfgang Kunze|date=2004|title=Technology Brewing and Malting|publisher= [[VLB Berlin]]|isbn =3-921690-49-8|pages= 214–218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lautering===
[[File:Brasserie Ratz - 20140926 - Cuve à mélanger.jpg|thumb|Lauter tun]]
{{Main|Lautering}}

Lautering is the separation of the [[wort]] (the liquid containing the sugar extracted during mashing) from the grains.&lt;ref name=HuiSmith&gt;{{Cite book|authors=Yiu H. Hui, J. Scott Smith|title= Food Processing: Principles and Applications|publisher= [[Wiley-Blackwell]]|date= 2004|isbn=978-0-8138-1942-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done either in a mash tun outfitted with a false bottom, in a lauter tun, or in a mash filter. Most separation processes have two stages: first wort run-off, during which the extract is separated in an undiluted state from the spent grains, and [[Lautering#Sparging|sparging]], in which extract which remains with the grains is rinsed off with hot water. The lauter tun is a tank with holes in the bottom small enough to hold back the large bits of grist and hulls (the ground or milled cereal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beer-brewing.com/beer-brewing/wort_separation/lauter_tun.htm |title=Lauter Tun Use in Brewing Beer |publisher=beer-brewing.com |accessdate=31 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411074046/http://www.beer-brewing.com/beer-brewing/wort_separation/lauter_tun.htm |archive-date=11 April 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bed of grist that settles on it is the actual filter. Some lauter tuns have provision for rotating [[mash rake|rakes]] or knives to cut into the bed of grist to maintain good flow. The knives can be turned so they push the grain, a feature used to drive the spent grain out of the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= T. Goldhammer|date=2008|title= The Brewer's Handbook, 2nd edition|publisher= Apex| isbn=978-0-9675212-3-7|page= 181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mash filter is a plate-and-frame filter. The empty frames contain the mash, including the spent grains, and have a capacity of around one hectoliter. The plates contain a support structure for the filter cloth. The plates, frames, and filter cloths are arranged in a carrier frame like so: frame, cloth, plate, cloth, with plates at each end of the structure. Newer mash filters have bladders that can press the liquid out of the grains between spargings. The grain does not act like a filtration medium in a mash filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beer-brewing.com/beer-brewing/wort_separation/mash_filters.htm |title=Mash Filter Use in Brewing Beer |publisher=beer-brewing.com |accessdate=31 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617230127/http://www.beer-brewing.com/beer-brewing/wort_separation/mash_filters.htm |archive-date=17 June 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boiling==

After mashing, the beer [[wort]] is boiled with [[hops]] (and other flavourings if used) in a large tank known as a &quot;copper&quot; or brew kettle – though historically the mash vessel was used and is still in some small breweries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7eYLjJp0y7UC&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Beer in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance |page= 5 |author= Richard W.

===Brew kettle or copper===
[[File:Brasserie La Choulette 12-11-2006.jpg|thumb|Brew kettles at Brasserie La Choulette in France]]

Copper is the traditional material for the boiling vessel, because copper transfers heat quickly and evenly, and because the bubbles produced during boiling, and which would act as an insulator against the heat, do not cling to the surface of copper, so the wort is heated in a consistent manner.&lt;ref name=Brew272&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cr9Pv0gefCQC&amp;pg=PA272&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Brewing |page=272 |author1=Michael Lewis |author2=Tom W.

These can produce a vigorous and favourable boil, but are also apt to scorch the wort where the flame touches the kettle, causing caramelisation and making cleanup difficult. Most breweries use a steam-fired kettle, which uses steam jackets in the kettle to boil the wort.&lt;ref name=Bamforth/&gt; Breweries usually have a boiling unit either inside or outside of the kettle, usually a tall, thin cylinder with vertical tubes, called a calandria, through which wort is pumped.&lt;ref name=Cal&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gYVLHMmplRcC&amp;pg=PA201#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Oxford Companion to Beer|page=201|author=Tim Hampson|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=9 September 2011|isbn=9780195367133|access-date=19 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502054817/https://books.google.com/books?id=gYVLHMmplRcC&amp;pg=PA201#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archive-date=2 May 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whirlpool===

At the end of the boil, solid particles in the hopped wort are separated out, usually in a vessel called a &quot;whirlpool&quot; or &quot;settling tank&quot;.&lt;ref name=ref-2/&gt;&lt;ref name=whirl/&gt;  The whirlpool was devised by Henry Ranulph Hudston while working for the [[Molson Brewery]] in 1960 to utilise the so-called [[tea leaf paradox]] to force the denser solids known as &quot;trub&quot; (coagulated proteins, vegetable matter from hops) into a cone in the centre of the whirlpool tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = W.

===Wort cooling===
{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2019}}
After the whirlpool, the wort must be brought down to fermentation temperatures {{convert|20|-|26|C|F}}&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; before yeast is added. In modern breweries this is achieved through a plate [[heat exchanger]]. A plate heat exchanger has many ridged plates, which form two separate paths. The wort is pumped into the heat exchanger, and goes through every other gap between the plates. The cooling medium, usually water, goes through the other gaps. The ridges in the plates ensure turbulent flow. A good heat exchanger can drop {{Convert|95|°C}} wort to {{Convert|20|°C}} while warming the cooling medium from about {{Convert|10|°C}} to {{Convert|80|°C}}. The last few plates often use a cooling medium which can be cooled to below the [[freezing point]], which allows a finer control over the wort-out temperature, and also enables cooling to around {{Convert|10|°C}}. After cooling, oxygen is often dissolved into the wort to revitalize the yeast and aid its reproduction. Some of the craft brewery, particularly those wanting to create [[steam beer]], utilize [[coolship]] instead.

While boiling, it is useful to recover some of the energy used to boil the wort. On its way out of the brewery, the steam created during the boil is passed over a coil through which unheated water flows. By adjusting the rate of flow, the output temperature of the water can be controlled. This is also often done using a plate heat exchanger. The water is then stored for later use in the next mash, in equipment cleaning, or wherever necessary.&lt;ref name=Kunze&gt;{{cite book|author=Wolfgang Kunze |date=2004|title= Technology Brewing and Malting|publisher=VLB Berlin|isbn=3-921690-49-8|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common method of energy recovery takes place during the wort cooling. When cold water is used to cool the wort in a heat exchanger, the water is significantly warmed. In an efficient brewery, cold water is passed through the heat exchanger at a rate set to maximize the water's temperature upon exiting. This now-hot water is then stored in a hot water tank.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kunze&quot;/&gt;

[[Fermentation]] takes place in fermentation vessels which come in various forms, from enormous cylindroconical vessels, through open stone vessels, to wooden vats.&lt;ref name=ferm1&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oWQdjnVo2B0C&amp;pg=PA347&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Oxford Companion to Beer|chapter=Fermentation vessels|author=Anders Brinch Kissmeyer |author2=Garrett Oliver|pages=347–351|publisher=Oxford University Press|date= 9 Sep 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ferm2&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uWXcajHd3W0C&amp;pg=PA236&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=236|title=Encyclopaedia of Brewing|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|date=20 May 2013|author=Chris Boulton|isbn=9781118598122|access-date=19 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508235440/https://books.google.com/books?id=uWXcajHd3W0C&amp;pg=PA236&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archive-date=8 May 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ferm3&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QpDVsu-vaBcC&amp;pg=PT294&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=294|title=Brewing Yeast and Fermentation|author=Chris Boulton|author2=David Quain|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|date=25 Apr 2013|isbn=9781118685341|access-date=19 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528201954/https://books.google.com/books?id=QpDVsu-vaBcC&amp;pg=PT294&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archive-date=28 May 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the wort is cooled and [[aerated]] – usually with [[Asepsis|sterile]] air – yeast is added to it, and it begins to ferment. It is during this stage that sugars won from the [[malt]] are converted into alcohol and [[carbon dioxide]], and the product can be called beer for the first time.

Most breweries today use cylindroconical vessels, or CCVs, which have a conical bottom and a cylindrical top. The cone's [[aperture]] is typically around 60°, an angle that will allow the yeast to flow towards the cone's apex, but is not so steep as to take up too much vertical space. CCVs can handle both fermenting and conditioning in the same tank. At the end of fermentation, the yeast and other solids which have fallen to the cone's apex can be simply flushed out of a port at the apex. Open fermentation vessels are also used, often for show in brewpubs, and in Europe in wheat beer fermentation. These vessels have no tops, which makes harvesting top-fermenting yeasts very easy. The open tops of the vessels make the risk of infection greater, but with proper cleaning procedures and careful protocol about who enters fermentation chambers, the risk can be well controlled. Fermentation tanks are typically made of stainless steel. If they are simple cylindrical tanks with beveled ends, they are arranged vertically, as opposed to conditioning tanks which are usually laid out horizontally. Only a very few breweries still use wooden vats for fermentation as wood is difficult to keep clean and infection-free and must be repitched more or less yearly.&lt;ref name=ferm1/&gt;&lt;ref name=ferm2/&gt;&lt;ref name=ferm3/&gt;

===Fermentation methods===
{{See also|Beer style}}
[[File:Black Sheep Brewery Tour.jpg|thumb|right|Open vessels showing fermentation taking place]]

There are three main fermentation methods, [[#Warm fermentation|warm]], [[#Cool fermentation|cool]] and [[#Spontaneous fermentation|wild or spontaneous]]. Fermentation may take place in open or closed vessels. There may be a secondary fermentation which can take place in the brewery, in the [[cask ale|cask]] or in the [[#Bottle conditioning|bottle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ga4MYyZq-RMC&amp;pg=PA346|page=346|author=George Philliskirk|title=The Oxford Companion to Beer|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2011|isbn=9780195367133|access-date=26 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202093529/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ga4MYyZq-RMC&amp;pg=PA346|archive-date=2 December 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brewing yeasts are traditionally classed as &quot;top-cropping&quot; (or &quot;top-fermenting&quot;) and &quot;bottom-cropping&quot; (or &quot;bottom-fermenting&quot;); the yeasts classed as top-fermenting are generally used in warm fermentations, where they ferment quickly, and the yeasts classed as bottom-fermenting are used in cooler fermentations where they ferment more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TIYbNdrIsPEC&amp;pg=PA86#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Handbook of Brewing |page= 84 |author1= F.

Thus the method of collection no longer implies a species association. There are a few remaining breweries who collect yeast in the top-cropping method, such as Samuel Smiths brewery in Yorkshire, Marstons in Staffordshire and several German hefeweizen producers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tom Colicchio 2011&quot;/&gt;

For both types, yeast is fully distributed through the beer while it is fermenting, and both equally [[yeast flocculation|flocculate]] (clump together and precipitate to the bottom of the vessel) when fermentation is finished. By no means do all top-cropping yeasts demonstrate this behaviour, but it features strongly in many English yeasts that may also exhibit chain forming (the failure of budded cells to break from the mother cell), which is in the technical sense different from true flocculation. The most common top-cropping brewer's yeast, ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'', is the same species as the common baking yeast. However, baking and brewing yeasts typically belong to different strains, cultivated to favour different characteristics: baking yeast strains are more aggressive, in order to carbonate [[dough]] in the shortest amount of time; brewing yeast strains act slower, but tend to tolerate higher alcohol concentrations (normally 12–15% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]] is the maximum, though under special treatment some ethanol-tolerant strains can be coaxed up to around 20%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=oWQdjnVo2B0C&amp;pg=PA331#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page= 331 |author1= Charles W.

As such, the yeasts involved in what has been typically called top-cropping or top-fermenting ale may be both ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' and complex hybrids of ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' and ''Saccharomyces kudriavzevii''. Three notable ales, [[Chimay Brewery|Chimay]], [[Orval Brewery#Beers|Orval]] and [[Westmalle Brewery|Westmalle]], are fermented with these hybrid strains, which are identical to wine yeasts from Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;González, Sara S., Eladio Barrio, and Amparo Querol. &quot;Molecular characterization of new natural hybrids of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. kudriavzevii in brewing.&quot; Applied and Environmental Microbiology 74.8 (2008): 2314–2320.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Timmermans.jpg|thumb|200px|Spontaneous fermentation at [[Timmermans Brewery|Timmermans]] in Belgium]]
Brewers in [[Bavaria]] had for centuries been selecting cold-fermenting yeasts by storing (&quot;lagern&quot;) their beers in cold alpine caves. The process of natural selection meant that the wild yeasts that were most cold tolerant would be the ones that would remain actively fermenting 
in the beer that was stored in the caves. A sample of these Bavarian yeasts was sent from the Spaten brewery in Munich to the Carlsberg brewery in Copenhagen in 1845 who began brewing with it. In 1883 Emile Hansen completed a study on pure yeast culture isolation and the pure strain obtained from Spaten went into industrial production in 1884 as Carlsberg yeast No 1. Another specialized pure yeast production plant was installed at the Heineken Brewery in Rotterdam the following year and together they began the supply of pure cultured yeast to brewers across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Meussdoerffer, Franz G. &quot;A comprehensive history of beer brewing.&quot; Handbook of brewing: processes, technology, markets (2009): 1–42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boulton, Christopher, and David Quain.

The beer is usually transferred into a second container, so that it is no longer exposed to the dead yeast and other debris (also known as &quot;trub&quot;) that have settled to the bottom of the primary fermenter. This prevents the formation of unwanted flavours and harmful compounds such as [[acetaldehyde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TIYbNdrIsPEC&amp;pg=PA308#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Handbook of Brewing |page= 308 |author1= F.

;Kräusening
Kräusening is a conditioning method in which fermenting [[wort]] is added to the finished beer.&lt;ref name=krause&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ga4MYyZq-RMC&amp;pg=PA521#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Oxford Companion to Beer |author=Keith Thomas |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=7 October 2011 |accessdate=16 July 2012 |isbn=9780195367133 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517000817/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ga4MYyZq-RMC&amp;pg=PA521#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archive-date=17 May 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The active yeast will restart fermentation in the finished beer, and so introduce fresh carbon dioxide; the conditioning tank will be then sealed so that the carbon dioxide is dissolved into the beer producing a lively &quot;condition&quot; or level of carbonation.&lt;ref name=krause/&gt; The kräusening method may also be used to condition bottled beer.&lt;ref name=krause/&gt;

;Lagering
[[Lager]]s are stored at cellar temperature or below for 1–6 months while still on the yeast.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, D.E.; Boulton, C.A.; Brookes, P. A.; and Stevens, R. ''Brewing'', 2004, CRC. {{ISBN|0-8493-2547-1}} p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The process of storing, or conditioning, or maturing, or aging a beer at a low temperature for a long period is called &quot;lagering&quot;, and while it is associated with lagers, the process may also be done with ales, with the same result – that of cleaning up various chemicals, acids and compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ga4MYyZq-RMC&amp;pg=PA533#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= The Oxford Companion to Beer|chapter=Lagering|author=Horst Dornbusch |pages= 533–534 |publisher= Oxford University Press|date= 9 September 2011 |accessdate= 8 April 2013 |isbn= 9780195367133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Secondary fermentation{{anchor|Brewing#Secondary fermentation}}
During secondary fermentation, most of the remaining yeast will settle to the bottom of the second fermenter, yielding a less hazy product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TIYbNdrIsPEC&amp;pg=PA86#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Handbook of Brewing |page= 532 |author1= F.

They are bottled with a viable yeast population in suspension. If there is no residual fermentable sugar left, sugar or wort or both may be added in a process known as priming. The resulting fermentation generates [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] that is trapped in the bottle, remaining in solution and providing natural carbonation. Bottle-conditioned beers may be either filled unfiltered direct from the fermentation or conditioning tank, or filtered and then reseeded with yeast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uWXcajHd3W0C&amp;pg=PA80#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopaedia of Brewing|page=80|author=Christopher M.

;Barrel-ageing
{{Main|Barrel-aged beer}}

Barrel-ageing ([[American English|US:]] Barrel aging) is the process of ageing beer in [[barrel|wooden barrels]] to achieve a variety of effects in the final product. [[Sour beer]]s such as [[lambic]]s are fully fermented in wood, while other beers are aged in barrels which were previously used for maturing [[wine]]s or [[distilled beverage|spirits]]. In 2016 &quot;Craft Beer and Brewing&quot; wrote: &quot;Barrel-aged beers are so trendy that nearly every taphouse and beer store has a section of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://beerandbrewing.com/single-barrel-double-barrel-no-barrel/ |title=Craft Beer and Brewing.

Filtering the beer stabilizes the flavour, and gives beer its polished shine and brilliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ga4MYyZq-RMC&amp;pg=PA352#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Oxford Companion to Beer|page=352|author=Jeff S.

When tax determination is required by local laws, it is typically done at this stage in a calibrated tank. There are several forms of filters, they may be in the form of sheets or &quot;candles&quot;, or they may be a fine powder such as [[diatomaceous earth]], also called kieselguhr. The powder is added to the beer and recirculated past screens to form a filtration bed.

Filters range from rough filters that remove much of the yeast and any solids (e.g., hops, grain particles) left in the beer, to filters tight enough to strain colour and body from the beer. Filtration ratings are divided into rough, fine, and sterile. Rough filtration leaves some cloudiness in the beer, but it is noticeably clearer than unfiltered beer. Fine filtration removes almost all cloudiness. Sterile filtration removes almost all microorganisms.

;Sheet (pad) filters
These filters use sheets that allow only particles smaller than a given size to pass through. The sheets are placed into a filtering frame, sanitized (with boiling water, for example) and then used to filter the beer. The sheets can be flushed if the filter becomes blocked. The sheets are usually disposable and are replaced between filtration sessions. Often the sheets contain powdered filtration media to aid in filtration.

Pre-made filters have two sides. One with loose holes, and the other with tight holes. Flow goes from the side with loose holes to the side with the tight holes, with the intent that large particles get stuck in the large holes while leaving enough room around the particles and filter medium for smaller particles to go through and get stuck in tighter holes.

Sheets are sold in nominal ratings, and typically 90% of particles larger than the nominal rating are caught by the sheet.
;Kieselguhr filters

Filters that use a powder medium are considerably more complicated to operate, but can filter much more beer before regeneration. Common media include [[diatomaceous earth]] and [[perlite]].
