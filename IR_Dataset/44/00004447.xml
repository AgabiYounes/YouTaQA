The '''Book of Joel''' is part of the [[Hebrew Bible]], one of twelve prophetic books known as the [[Twelve Minor Prophets]]. (The term indicates the short length of the text in relation to longer prophetic texts known as the [[Major Prophets]].)

== Content ==
After a superscription ascribing the prophecy to [[Joel (prophet)|Joel]] (son of Pethuel), the book may be broken down into the following sections:
* Lament over a great [[locust]] plague and a severe drought (1:1–2:17).
** The effects of these events on agriculture, farmers, and on the supply of agricultural offerings for the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], interspersed with a call to national lament (1:1–20).
** A more [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] passage comparing the locusts to an army, and revealing that they are God's army (2:1–11).
** A call to national repentance in the face of God's judgment (2:12–17).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Promise of future blessings (2:18–32 or 2:18–3:5).
** Banishment of the locusts and restoration of agricultural productivity as a divine response to national penitence (2:18–27).
** Future prophetic gifts to all God's people, and the safety of God's people in the face of cosmic cataclysm (2:28–32 or 3:1–5).
* Coming judgment on the [[Kingdom of Judah]]'s enemies: the [[Philistines]], the [[Kingdom of Edom]], and the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Kingdom of Egypt]] (3:1–21 or 4:1–21).

==Chapters==
The Book of Joel's division into [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|chapters and verses]] differs widely between editions of the Bible; some editions have three chapters, others four.&lt;ref name=&quot;oyc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Christine |last=Hayes |authorlink=Christine Hayes |year=2006 |url=http://oyc.yale.edu/religious-studies/rlst-145/lecture-23 |website=[[Open Yale Courses]] |publisher=[[Yale University]] |title=Introduction to the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible) – Lecture 23 – Visions of the End: Daniel and Apocalyptic Literature}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translations with four chapters include:
*[[Jewish Publication Society]]'s version of the Hebrew Bible (1917) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et1404.htm Joel 4 - JPS Version]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jerusalem Bible]] (1966)
*[[New American Bible Revised Edition|New American Bible]] (Revised Edition, 1970)
*[[Complete Jewish Bible]] (1998)
*[[Tree of Life Version]] (2015) &lt;ref&gt;[[BibleGateway.com]], [https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Joel%204:1 Joel 4:1]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1611 [[King James Bible]], the Book of Joel is formed by three chapters: the second one has 32 verses, and it is equivalent to the union of the chapter 2 (with 26 verses) and chapter 3 (with 5 verses) of other editions of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Ioel_2_1611/ | title = 1611 King James Bible. book of Joele | language = en | website = kingjamesbibleonline.org | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130209125407/https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Ioel_2_1611/ | archive-date = February 9, 2013 | url-status = live | access-date = February 23, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical context ==
As there are no explicit references in the book to datable persons or events, scholars have assigned a wide range of dates to the book. The main positions are:&lt;ref&gt;Outlined by Allen (pp. 19–25), who himself favours the fourth position, with the second position (early eight century) added from Patterson (pp. 231–32).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ninth century BC, particularly in the reign of [[Jehoash of Judah|Joash]] – a position especially popular among nineteenth-century scholars (making Joel one of the earliest [[Literary prophets|writing prophets]])
* Early eighth century BC, during the reign of [[Uzziah]] (contemporary with [[Hosea]], [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]], and [[Jonah]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Patterson|first1=Richard D.|title=The Expositor's Bible Commentary, vol. 7|publisher=Zondervan}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* c. 630–587 BC, in the last decades of the kingdom of Judah (contemporary with [[Jeremiah]], [[Ezekiel]], [[Habakkuk]])
* c. 520–500 BC, contemporary with the return of the exiles and the careers of [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]] and [[Haggai]].
* The decades around 400 BC, during the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] period (making him one of the latest writing prophets)

Evidence produced for these positions includes allusions in the book to the wider world, similarities with other prophets, and linguistic details. Some commentators, such as [[John Calvin]],&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Allen, p. 19, although Calvin did lean toward a later dating&lt;/ref&gt; attach no great importance to the precise dating.

Joel 1 and 2 are preserved in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], in fragmentary manuscripts 4Q78, 4Q82, and the Scroll [[Wadi Murabba'at|Wadi Muraba’at]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dssenglishbible.com/joel%201.htm Joel 1] - Dead Sea Scrolls Bible Translations&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of interpretation ==
[[File:Tissot Joel.jpg|thumb|150px|Joel (watercolor circa 1896–1902 by [[James Tissot]])]]
The [[Masoretic text]] places Joel between [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]] and [[Book of Amos|Amos]] (the order inherited by the Tanakh and Old Testament), while the [[Septuagint]] order is Hosea–Amos–[[Book of Micah|Micah]]–Joel–[[Book of Obadiah|Obadiah]]–[[Book of Jonah|Jonah]]. The Hebrew text of Joel seems to have suffered little from [[Textual criticism|scribal transmission]], but is at a few points supplemented by the Septuagint, [[Peshitta|Syriac]], and [[Vulgate]] versions, or by [[conjectural emendation]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen 36&lt;/ref&gt; While the book purports to describe a plague of locusts, some ancient Jewish opinion saw the locusts as [[allegory|allegorical]] interpretations of Israel's enemies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Targum]] at 2:25; also margin of [[Septuagint|LXX]] manuscript Q, mid-6th century AD&lt;/ref&gt; This allegorical interpretation was applied to the church by many [[church fathers]]. Calvin took a literal interpretation of chapter 1, but allegorical view of chapter 2, a position echoed by some modern interpreters. Most modern interpreters, however, see Joel speaking of a literal locust plague given a prophetic/ [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;See Allen 29–31&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional ascription of the whole book to the prophet Joel was challenged in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by a theory of a three-stage process of composition: 1:1–2:27 were from the hand of Joel, and dealt with a contemporary issue; 2:28–3:21/3:1–4:21 were ascribed to a continuator with an apocalyptic outlook. Mentions in the first half of the book to the [[day of the Lord]] were also ascribed to this continuator. 3:4–8/4:4–8 could be seen as even later. Details of exact ascriptions differed between scholars.

This splitting of the book's composition began to be challenged in the mid-twentieth century, with scholars defending the unity of the book, the plausibility of the prophet combining a contemporary and apocalyptic outlook, and later additions by the prophet.  The authenticity of 3:4–8 has presented more challenges, although a number of scholars still defend it.&lt;ref&gt;See Allen 25–29 for details and arguments.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biblical quotes and allusions ==
[[Image:Joel-prophet.jpg|thumb|[[Russia]]n [[icon]] of the prophet Joel ([[Iconostasis]] of [[Kizhi]] monastery, c. 1700–1725)]]

There are many parallels of language between Joel and other Old Testament prophets. They may represent Joel's literary use of other prophets, or vice versa.

In the [[New Testament]], his prophecy of the outpouring of God's [[Holy Spirit (Judaism)|Holy Spirit]] upon all people was notably quoted by [[Saint Peter]] in his [[Pentecost]] sermon.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Acts|2|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joel 3:10 / 4:10 is a rare reversed reference to [[swords to plowshares]].
