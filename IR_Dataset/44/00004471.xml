Thornton had his first break when he co-wrote and starred in the 1992 thriller ''[[One False Move]]'', and received international attention after writing, directing, and starring in the [[independent film|independent]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (1996), for which he won an [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]] and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].

Thornton's first screen role was in 1980's ''[[South of Reno]]'', where he played a small role as a counter man in a restaurant. He also made an appearance as a pawn store clerk in the 1987 ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'' episode &quot;The Photographer&quot;. Another one of his early screen roles was as a cast member on the CBS sitcom Hearts Afire and in 1989 he appeared as an angry heckler in Adam Sandler's debut film ''[[Going Overboard]]''. His role as the villain in 1992's ''[[One False Move]]'', which he also co-wrote, brought him to the attention of critics.

=== Health problems ===
During his early years in Los Angeles, Thornton was admitted to a hospital and diagnosed with [[myocarditis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/billy-bob-thornton.html Billy Bob Thornton Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011125714/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/billy-bob-thornton.html |date=October 11, 2010 }} TheBiographyChannel.co.uk. Retrieved March 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He has since said that he follows a [[Veganism|vegan]] diet and is &quot;extremely healthy&quot;, eating no junk food as he is allergic to wheat and dairy.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20825558,00.html Who Got Billy Bob Thornton To Dress Up as A Ladybug]&quot;, ''People'', June 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thornton suffers from [[obsessive–compulsive disorder|OCD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ann|last=Curry|title=Billy Bob Thornton opens up |publisher=NBC News |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4654882 |date=April 2, 2004 |accessdate=December 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various idiosyncratic behaviors have been well documented in interviews with Thornton; among these is a [[phobia]] of antique furniture, a disorder shared by [[Dwight Yoakam]]'s character Doyle Hargraves in the Thornton-penned ''Sling Blade'' and by Thornton's own character in the 2001 film ''Bandits''.&lt;ref name=&quot;cinema.com&quot; /&gt; Additionally, he has stated that he has a fear of certain types of silverware, a trait assumed by his character in 2001's ''Monster's Ball'', in which Grotowski insists on a plastic spoon for his daily bowl of ice cream.&lt;ref name=&quot;cinema.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Cinema.com |title=Billy Bob's Fear Of Spoons |url=http://www.cinema.com/news/item/5656/billy-bobs-fear-of-spoons.phtml |accessdate=September 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Script-o-rama.com |title=Monster's Ball screenplay transcript |url=http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/m/monsters-ball-script-transcript-halle.html |accessdate=May 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2004 interview with ''[[The Independent]]'', Thornton explained, &quot;It's just that I won't use real silver. You know, like the big, old, heavy-ass forks and knives, I can't do that. It's the same thing as the antique furniture. I just don't like old stuff. I'm creeped out by it, and I have no explanation why ... I don't have a phobia about American antiques, it's mostly French—you know, like the big, old, gold-carved chairs with the velvet cushions. The [[Louis XIV]] type. That's what creeps me out. I can spot the imitation antiques a mile off. They have a different vibe. Not as much dust.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Independent.co.uk |title=Interview with Billy Bob Thornton: Acting very strange |date=September 3, 2004 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/film-and-tv/features/billy-bob-thornton-acting-very-strange-550994.html |accessdate=May 30, 2008 | location=London | first=Tiffany | last=Rose}}&lt;/ref&gt;
