The '''Booker Prize for Fiction''', formerly known as the '''Booker–McConnell Prize''' (1969–2001) and the '''Man Booker Prize''' (2002–2019), is a [[Literary award|literary prize]] awarded each year for the best original novel written in the [[English language]] and published in the United Kingdom. The winner of the Booker Prize is generally assured international renown and success; therefore, the prize is of great significance for the book trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2008/10/booker-prize-british-literary |title=The Booker's Big Bang |author= Sutherland, John |work=[[New Statesman]] |date=9 October 2008 |accessdate=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its inception, only novels written by [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], Irish, and South African (and later Zimbabwean) citizens were eligible to receive the prize; in 2014 it was widened to any English-language novel—a change that proved controversial.&lt;ref name=judges2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_rulechange2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title='A surprise and a risk': Reaction to Booker Prize upheaval |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24126882 |work=BBC News |accessdate=19 September 2013 |date=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A high-profile literary award in [[British culture]], the Booker Prize is greeted with anticipation and fanfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bob |last=Hoover |url=http://old.post-gazette.com/pg/08041/855698-44.stm|title='Gathering' storm clears for prize winner Enright |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=10 February 2008 |accessdate=10 February 2008 |quote=In America, literary prizes are greeted with the same enthusiasm as a low Steelers draft choice. Not so in the British Isles, where the $98,000 Man Booker Fiction Prize can even push Amy Winehouse off the front page – at least for a day. The atmosphere around the award approaches sports-championship proportions, with London bookies posting the ever-changing odds on the nominees. Then, in October when the winner is announced live on the BBC TV evening news, somebody always gets ticked off.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a mark of distinction for authors to be selected for inclusion in the [[Short list|shortlist]] or even to be nominated for the &quot;longlist&quot;.

==History and administration==
The prize was originally established as the Booker–McConnell Prize, after the company [[Booker Group|Booker, McConnell Ltd]] began sponsoring the event in 1969;&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/oct/18/booker-prize-history-controversy-criticism |title=Man Booker Prize: a history of controversy, criticism and literary greats |first =Katy |last=Stoddard|work=The Guardian |publisher= |date=18 October 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; it became commonly known as the &quot;Booker Prize&quot; or simply &quot;the Booker&quot;.

When administration of the prize was transferred to the Booker Prize Foundation in 2002, the title sponsor became the investment company [[Man Group]], which opted to retain &quot;Booker&quot; as part of the official title of the prize.  The foundation is an independent registered charity funded by the entire profits of Booker Prize Trading Ltd, of which it is the sole shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themanbookerprize.com/legal |title=Booker Prize: legal information |work=bookerprize.com |accessdate=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize money awarded with the Booker Prize was originally £21,000, and was subsequently raised to £50,000 in 2002 under the sponsorship of the Man Group, making it one of the [[List of the world's richest literary prizes|world's richest literary prizes]].

===1969–1979===

In 1970, [[Bernice Rubens]] became the first woman to win the Booker Prize, for ''[[The Elected Member]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kidd, James (5 March 2006), [http://www.scmp.com/article/539083/brief-history-man-booker-prize &quot;A Brief History of The Man Booker Prize&quot;], ''South China Morning Post''.&lt;/ref&gt; The rules of the Booker changed in 1971; previously, it had been awarded retrospectively to books published prior to the year in which the award was given.  In 1971 the year of eligibility was changed to the same as the year of the award; in effect, this meant that books published in 1970 were not considered for the Booker in either year. The Booker Prize Foundation announced in January 2010 the creation of a special award called the &quot;[[Lost Man Booker Prize]]&quot;, with the winner chosen from a longlist of 22 novels published in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themanbookerprize.com/news/stories/1317 |title=The Lost Man Booker Prize announced |work=bookerprize.com |accessdate=31 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202172535/http://themanbookerprize.com/news/stories/1317 |archivedate=2 December 2010 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alice Munro]]'s ''[[Who Do You Think You Are? (book)|The Beggar Maid]]'' was shortlisted in 1980, and remains the only short story collection to be shortlisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/13/big-novels-2012|title=Dear Life: Stories by Alice Munro (Chatto &amp; Windus, November) |work=The Guardian |publisher= |date=13 July 2012 |accessdate=13 July 2012 |quote=As the only writer to sneak on to the Booker shortlist for a collection of short stories (with ''The Beggar Maid'' in 1980), Alice Munro easily deserves to end our list of the year's best fiction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Sutherland (author)|John Sutherland]], who was a judge for the 1999 prize, has said: {{quote|There is a well-established London literary community. [[Salman Rushdie|Rushdie]] doesn't get shortlisted now because he has attacked that community. That is not a good game plan if you want to win the Booker. [[Norman Mailer]] has found the same thing in the US – you have to &quot;be a citizen&quot; if you want to win prizes. The real scandal is that [Martin] [[Martin Amis|Amis]] has never won the prize. In fact, he has only been shortlisted once and that was for ''[[Time's Arrow (novel)|Time's Arrow]]'', which was not one of his strongest books. That really is suspicious. He pissed people off with ''[[Dead Babies (novel)|Dead Babies]]'' and that gets lodged in the culture. There is also the feeling that he has always looked towards America.&lt;ref name=booker_fixed&gt;{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Moss |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/sep/18/bookerprize2001.thebookerprize |title=Is the Booker fixed? |work=The Guardian |publisher= |date=18 September 2001 |accessdate=18 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1972, winning writer [[John Berger]], known for his [[Marxism|Marxist]] worldview, protested during his acceptance speech against Booker McConnell. He blamed Booker's 130 years of sugar production in the Caribbean for the region's modern poverty.&lt;ref name=white/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;John Berger on the Booker Prize (1972)&quot;&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otu4tjqrOk0 &quot;John Berger on the Booker Prize (1972)&quot;], YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt;  Berger donated half of his £5,000 prize to the [[Black Panther Party#Groups and movements inspired by the Black Panthers|British Black Panther movement]], because it had a socialist and revolutionary perspective in agreement with his own.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref name=white&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=White |url=http://archive.guardian.co.uk/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=R1VBLzE5NzIvMTEvMjUjQXIwMTEwMA==&amp;Mode=Gif&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom |title=Berger's black bread |work=The Guardian |publisher= |date=25 November 1972}} p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Speech by John Berger on accepting the Booker Prize for Fiction at the Café Royal in London on 23 November 1972&quot;&gt;[http://gostbustere.tumblr.com/post/17158444595/speech-by-john-berger-on-accepting-the-booker-prize-for Speech by John Berger on accepting the Booker Prize for Fiction] at the Café Royal in London on 23 November 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980–1999===

In 1980, [[Anthony Burgess]], writer of ''[[Earthly Powers]]'', refused to attend the ceremony unless it was confirmed to him in advance whether he had won.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; His was one of two books considered likely to win, the other being ''[[Rites of Passage (novel)|Rites of Passage]]'' by [[William Golding]]. The judges decided only 30 minutes before the ceremony, giving the prize to Golding. Both novels had been seen as favourites to win leading up to the prize, and the dramatic &quot;literary battle&quot; between two senior writers made front-page news.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.guardian.co.uk/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=R1VBLzE5ODAvMTAvMjIjQXIwMDEwNA==&amp;Mode=Gif&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom |title=Lord of the novel wins the Booker prize |first= W. L. |last=Webb|work=The Guardian |publisher= |date=22 October 1980}} p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, nominee [[John Banville]] wrote a letter to ''[[The Guardian]]'' requesting that the prize be given to him so that he could use the money to buy every copy of the longlisted books in Ireland and donate them to libraries, &quot;thus ensuring that the books not only are bought but also read&amp;nbsp;— surely a unique occurrence.&quot;&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.guardian.co.uk/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=R1VBLzE5ODEvMTAvMTUjQXIwMTQwMg==&amp;Mode=Gif&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom &quot;A novel way of striking a 12,000 Booker Prize bargain&quot;], ''The Guardian'', 14 October 1981, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Judging for the 1983 award produced a draw between [[J. M. Coetzee]]'s ''[[Life &amp; Times of Michael K]]'' and [[Salman Rushdie]]'s ''[[Shame (Rushdie novel)|Shame]]'', leaving chair of judges [[Fay Weldon]] to choose between the two. According to Stephen Moss in ''The Guardian'', &quot;Her arm was bent and she chose Rushdie,&quot; only to change her mind as the result was being phoned through.&lt;ref name=booker_fixed/&gt;

In 1992, the jury split the prize between [[Michael Ondaatje]]'s ''[[The English Patient]]'' and [[Barry Unsworth]]'s ''[[Sacred Hunger]]''. This prompted the foundation to draw up a rule that made it mandatory for the appointed jury to make the award to just a single author/book.

In 1993, two of the judges threatened to walk out when ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'' appeared on the longlist; [[Irvine Welsh]]'s novel was pulled from the shortlist to satisfy them. The novel would later receive critical acclaim, and is now considered Welsh's masterpiece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alan |last=Bissett |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2012/jul/27/booker-prize-bias-english?intcmp=239|title=The unnoticed bias of the Booker prize |work=The Guardian |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of [[James Kelman]]'s book ''[[How Late It Was, How Late]]'' as 1994 Booker Prize winner proved to be one of the most controversial in the award's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Winder |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/highly-literary-and-deeply-vulgar-if-james-kelmans-booker-novel-is-rude-it-is-in-good-company-argues-1442639.html |title=Highly literary and deeply vulgar: If James Kelman's Booker novel is rude, it is in good company, argues Robert Winder |work=The Independent |date=13 October 1994 |quote=James Kelman's victory in the Booker Prize on Tuesday night has already provoked a not altogether polite discussion...}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rabbi]] [[Julia Neuberger]], one of the judges, declared it &quot;a disgrace&quot; and left the event, later deeming the book to be &quot;crap&quot;; [[WHSmith]]'s marketing manager called the award &quot;an embarrassment to the whole book trade&quot;; [[Waterstones|Waterstone's]] in [[Glasgow]] sold a mere 13 copies of Kelman's book the following week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Maeve |last=Walsh |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/it-was-five-years-ago-today-how-controversial-it-was-how-controversial-1081947.html |title=It was five years ago today: How controversial it was, how controversial |work=The Independent |date=21 March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, ''The Guardian''{{'}}s literary editor [[Richard Gott]], citing the lack of objective criteria and the exclusion of American authors, described the prize as &quot;a significant and dangerous iceberg in the sea of British culture that serves as a symbol of its current malaise.&quot;&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.guardian.co.uk/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=R1VBLzE5OTQvMDkvMDUjQXIwMjIwMQ==&amp;Mode=Gif&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom |title=Novel way to run a lottery |last=Gott |first= Richard|work=The Guardian |page=22|publisher= |date=5 September 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the decision to award [[Arundhati Roy]]'s ''[[The God of Small Things]]'' proved controversial. [[Carmen Callil]], chair of the previous year's Booker judges, called it an &quot;execrable&quot; book and said on television that it should not even have been on the shortlist. Booker Prize chairman [[Martyn Goff]] said Roy won because nobody objected, following the rejection by the judges of [[Bernard MacLaverty]]'s shortlisted book due to their dismissal of him as &quot;a wonderful short-story writer and that ''[[Grace Notes]]'' was three short stories strung together.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Glaister |url=http://www.sawnet.org/news/news220.html |title=Popularity pays off for Roy |work=The Guardian |date=14 October 1997 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050227170112/http://sawnet.org/news/news220.html |archivedate=27 February 2005 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000–present===

Before 2001, each year's longlist of nominees was not publicly revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Emma |last=Yates |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/aug/15/bookerprize2001.thebookerprize |title=Booker Prize longlist announced for first time |work=The Guardian |publisher= |date=15 August 2001 |accessdate=15 August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, [[A. L. Kennedy]], who was a judge in 1996, called the prize &quot;a pile of crooked nonsense&quot; with the winner determined by &quot;who knows who, who's sleeping with who, who's selling drugs to who, who's married to who, whose turn it is&quot;.&lt;ref name=booker_fixed/&gt;

The Booker Prize created a permanent home for the archives from 1968 to present at [[Oxford Brookes University]] Library. The Archive, which encompasses the administrative history of the Prize from 1968 to date, collects together a diverse range of material, including correspondence, publicity material, copies of both the Longlists and the Shortlists, minutes of meetings, photographs and material relating to the awards dinner (letters of invitation, guest lists, seating plans). Embargoes of ten or twenty years apply to certain categories of material; examples include all material relating to the judging process and the Longlist prior to 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.brookes.ac.uk/library/special-collections/publishing-and-literary-prizes/booker-prize-archive/ |title=Booker Prize Archive |publisher=Oxford Brookes University |accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2005 and 2008, the Booker Prize alternated between writers from Ireland and India. &quot;Outsider&quot; [[John Banville]] began this trend in 2005 when his novel ''[[The Sea (novel)|The Sea]]'' was selected as a surprise winner:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Ezard|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/oct/11/books.bookerprize2005?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487|title=Irish stylist springs Booker surprise|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 October 2005|accessdate=11 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boyd Tonkin]], literary editor of ''[[The Independent]]'', famously condemned it as &quot;possibly the most perverse decision in the history of the award&quot; and rival novelist [[Tibor Fischer]] poured scorn on Banville's victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sarah|last=Crown|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culturevultureblog/2005/oct/10/banvillescoops1?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Banville scoops the Booker|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 October 2005|accessdate=10 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kiran Desai]] of India won in 2006. [[Anne Enright]]'s 2007 victory came about due to a jury badly split over [[Ian McEwan]]'s novel ''[[On Chesil Beach]]''. The following year it was India's turn again, with [[Aravind Adiga]] narrowly defeating Enright's fellow Irishman [[Sebastian Barry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Charlotte|last=Higgins|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2009/jan/28/costabookaward-poetry|title=How Adam Foulds was a breath away from the Costa book of the year award|newspaper=The Guardian|date=28 January 2009|accessdate=28 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the winner of the Booker Prize had been required to be a citizen of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the Republic of Ireland, or Zimbabwe. It was announced on 18 September 2013 that future Booker Prize awards would consider authors from anywhere in the world, so long as their work was in [[English language|English]] and published in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[[Will Gompertz|Gompertz, Will]] (18 September 2013), [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24145501 &quot;Global expansion for Booker Prize&quot;], BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt; This change proved controversial in literary circles. Former winner [[A. S. Byatt]] and former judge [[John Mullan]] said the prize risked diluting its identity, whereas former judge A. L. Kennedy welcomed the change.&lt;ref name=judges2014&gt;{{cite web |title=Meet The Man Booker Prize 2014 Judges |url=http://themanbookerprize.com/news/2013/12/12/meet-man-booker-prize-2014-judges |date=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_rulechange2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sian&gt;{{cite news|first=Sian|last=Cain|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/02/publishers-call-on-man-booker-prize-to-drop-american-authors|title=Publishers call on Man Booker prize to drop American authors|work=The Guardian|date=2 February 2018|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this expansion, the first winner not from the Commonwealth, Ireland, or Zimbabwe was American [[Paul Beatty]] in 2016. Another American, [[George Saunders]], won the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/17/man-booker-prize-2017-second-american-author-george-saunders-lincoln-in-the-bardo |title=Man Booker prize goes to second American author in a row|first=Sian|last=Cain|work=The Guardian|date=17 October 2017|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, publishers sought to reverse the change, arguing that the inclusion of American writers would lead to homogenisation, reducing diversity and opportunities everywhere, including in America, to learn about &quot;great books that haven't already been widely heralded.&quot;&lt;ref name=Sian/&gt;

[[Man Group]] announced in early 2019 that the year's prize would be the last of eighteen under their sponsorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Caroline|last=Davies|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/27/booker-prize-trustees-search-for-new-sponsor-after-funding-dropped|title=Booker prize trustees search for new sponsor after Man Group exit|work=The Guardian|date=27 January 2019|accessdate=27 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new sponsor, [[Michael Moritz#Philanthropy|Crankstart]]&amp;nbsp;– a [[charitable foundation]] run by [[Michael Moritz|Sir Michael Moritz]] and his wife, Harriet Heyman&amp;nbsp;– then announced it would sponsor the award for five years, with the option to renew for another five years. The award title was changed to simply &quot;The Booker Prize&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alison|last=Flood|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/28/booker-prize-silicon-valley-billionaire-takes-over-as-new-sponsor|title=Booker Prize: Silicon Valley Billionaire Takes Over as New Sponsor|work=The Guardian|date=28 February 2019|accessdate=28 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, despite having been unequivocally warned against doing so, the foundation’s jury – under the chair [[Peter Florence]] – split the prize, awarding it to two authors, in breach of a rule established in 1993. Florence justified the decision, saying: &quot;We came down to a discussion with the director of the Booker Prize about the rules. And we were told quite firmly that the rules state that you can only have one winner...and as we have managed the jury all the way through on the principle of consensus, our consensus was that it was our decision to flout the rules and divide this year’s prize to celebrate two winners.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebookseller.com/news/booker-prize-split-between-atwood-and-evaristo-judges-rebel-against-rules-1098761|title=Booker double welcomed by booksellers {{!}} The Bookseller|website=www.thebookseller.com|access-date=2020-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judging==
The selection process for the winner of the prize commences with the formation of an advisory committee, which includes a writer, two publishers, a literary agent, a bookseller, a librarian, and a chairperson appointed by the Booker Prize Foundation. The advisory committee then selects the judging panel, the membership of which changes each year, although on rare occasions a judge may be selected a second time. Judges are selected from amongst leading literary critics, writers, academics and leading public figures.

The Booker judging process and the very concept of a &quot;best book&quot; being chosen by a small number of literary insiders is controversial for many. ''[[The Guardian]]'' introduced the &quot;Not the Booker Prize&quot; voted for by readers partly as a reaction to this.&lt;ref name=&quot;notthebooker&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/not-the-booker-prize | title=Not the Booker prize | newspaper= The Guardian | date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Author [[Amit Chaudhuri]] wrote: &quot;The idea that a 'book of the year' can be assessed annually by a bunch of people – judges who have to read almost a book a day – is absurd, as is the idea that this is any way of honouring a writer.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bookercrit&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/16/booker-prize-bad-for-writing-alternative-celebrate-literature | title=My fellow authors are too busy chasing prizes to write about what matters |first= Amit |last=Chaudhuri|newspaper=The Guardian | date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The winner is usually announced at a ceremony in London's [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]], usually in early October.

| In 1971, the nature of the Prize was changed so that it was awarded to novels published in that year instead of in the previous year; therefore, no novel published in 1970 could win the Booker Prize. This was rectified in 2010 by the awarding of the &quot;[[Lost Man Booker Prize]]&quot; to J. G. Farrell's ''Troubles''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|last=Melvern |first=Jack|title=J G Farrell wins Booker prize for 1970, 30-year after his death|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article7131357.ece|accessdate=23 December 2010|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=20 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special awards==
In 1993, to mark the prize's 25th anniversary, a ''&quot;Booker of Bookers&quot; Prize'' was given. Three previous judges of the award, [[Malcolm Bradbury]], David Holloway and W. L. Webb, met and chose [[Salman Rushdie]]'s ''[[Midnight's Children]]'', the 1981 winner, as &quot;the best novel out of all the winners&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Mullan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jul/12/saturdayreviewsfeatres.guardianreview31|title=Lives &amp; letters, Where are they now?|work=The Guardian|publisher=|date=12 July 2008|accessdate=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the Man Booker Prize set up a &quot;Best of Beryl&quot; prize, for the author [[Beryl Bainbridge]], who had been nominated five times and yet failed to win once. The prize is said to count as a Booker Prize. The nominees were ''[[An Awfully Big Adventure (novel)|An Awfully Big Adventure]]'', ''[[Every Man for Himself (novel)|Every Man for Himself]]'', ''[[The Bottle Factory Outing]]'', ''[[The Dressmaker (Bainbridge novel)|The Dressmaker]]'' and ''[[Master Georgie]]'', which won.

Similarly, [[The Best of the Booker]] was awarded in 2008 to celebrate the prize's 40th anniversary. A shortlist of six winners was chosen and the decision was left to a public vote; the winner was again ''Midnight's Children''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michelle| last=Pauli|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,2258500,00.html|title=Best of the Booker|work=The Guardian|publisher=|date=21 February 2008|accessdate=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7499495.stm|title=Rushdie wins Best of Booker prize|work=BBC News|date=10 July 2008|accessdate=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, to celebrate the 50th anniversary, the Golden Man Booker was awarded. One book from each decade was selected by a panel of judges: Naipaul's ''[[In a Free State]]'' (the 1971 winner), Lively's ''[[Moon Tiger]]'' (1987), Ondaatje's ''[[The English Patient]]'' (1992), Mantel's ''[[Wolf Hall]]'' and Saunders' ''[[Lincoln in the Bardo]]''. The winner, by popular vote, was ''The English Patient''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://themanbookerprize.com/goldenmanbooker/news/english-patient-michael-ondaatje-wins-golden-man-booker-prize|title=The English Patient by Michael Ondaatje wins the Golden Man Booker Prize|publisher=The Booker Prizes|date=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomination==
Since 2014, each publisher's imprint may submit a number of titles based on their longlisting history (previously they could submit two). Non-longlisted publishers can submit one title, publishers with one or two longlisted books in the previous five years can submit two, publishers with three or four longlisted books are allowed three submissions, and publishers with five or more longlisted books can have four submissions.

In addition, previous winners of the prize are automatically considered if they enter new titles. Books may also be called in: publishers can make written representations to the judges to consider titles in addition to those already entered. In the 21st century the average number of books considered by the judges has been approximately 130.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Man Booker Prize reveals criteria changes {{!}} The Bookseller |url=https://www.thebookseller.com/news/man-booker-prize-reveals-criteria-changes |website=www.thebookseller.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Global expansion for Booker Prize |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24145501 |date=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related awards==
A separate prize for which any living writer in the world may qualify, the [[Man Booker International Prize]] was inaugurated in 2005. Until 2015, it was given every two years to a living author of any nationality for a body of work published in English or generally available in English translation. In 2016, the award was significantly reconfigured, and is now given annually to a single book in English translation, with a £50,000 prize for the winning title, shared equally between author and translator.

A Russian version of the Booker Prize was created in 1992 called the [[Booker-Open Russia Literary Prize]], also known as the Russian Booker Prize. In 2007, Man Group plc established the [[Man Asian Literary Prize]], an annual literary award given to the best novel by an Asian writer, either written in English or translated into English, and published in the previous calendar year.

As part of ''[[The Times]]''' [[Cheltenham Literature Festival|Literature Festival]] in [[Cheltenham]], a Booker event is held on the last Saturday of the festival. Four guest speakers/judges debate a shortlist of four books from a given year from before the introduction of the Booker prize, and a winner is chosen. Unlike the real Man Booker (1969 through 2014), writers from outside the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] are also considered. In 2008, the winner for 1948 was [[Alan Paton]]'s ''[[Cry, the Beloved Country]]'', beating [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''[[The Naked and the Dead]]'', [[Graham Greene]]'s ''[[The Heart of the Matter]]'' and [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s ''[[The Loved One]]''. In 2015, the winner for 1915 was [[Ford Madox Ford]]'s ''[[The Good Soldier]]'', beating ''[[The Thirty-Nine Steps]]'' ([[John Buchan]]), ''[[Of Human Bondage]]'' ([[W. Somerset Maugham]]), ''[[Psmith, Journalist]]'' ([[P. G. Wodehouse]]) and ''[[The Voyage Out]]'' ([[Virginia Woolf]]).&lt;ref&gt;Haslam, Sara (13 October 2015), [http://www.fordmadoxfordsociety.org/blog/fords-the-good-soldier-wins-the-cheltenham-booker-1915-at-2015-festival &quot;Ford's The Good Soldier Wins The Cheltenham Booker 1915 at 2015 Festival&quot;].
