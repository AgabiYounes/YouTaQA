The '''Book of Obadiah''' is an oracle concerning the divine judgment of [[Edom]] and the restoration of [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, M. ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context.'' Oxford University Press, New York (2009) p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; The text consists of a single chapter, divided into 21 verses, making it the shortest book in the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;Nelson's Compact Illustrated Bible Dictionary, Thomas Nelson Publishers, 1978, p. 191, {{ISBN|0-8407-5636-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], its authorship is attributed to a [[prophet]] who lived in the [[Assyria]]n Period and named himself in the first verse, [[Obadiah]]. His name means &quot;servant of [[Yahweh]]&quot;.

In Judaism, Obadiah is considered a &quot;later prophet&quot;, one of the &quot;Twelve Prophets&quot; in the final section of [[Nevi'im]], the second main division of the [[Tanakh]].

In Christianity, the Book of Obadiah is classified as a [[minor prophet]] of the [[Old Testament]], due to its short length.

== Content ==

The book of Obadiah is based on a prophetic vision concerning the fall of [[Edom]],{{Bibleref2c|Obadiah|1:1,4,18|NKJV|v.1,4,18}} a mountain dwelling nation{{Bibleref2c|Obadiah|1:8,9,19,21|NKJV|v.8,9,19,21}} whose founding father was [[Esau]].{{Bibleref2c|Obadiah|1:6|NKJV|v.6}}{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|36:9|NKJV|Genesis 36:9}}
Obadiah describes an encounter with [[Yahweh|God]], who addresses Edom's arrogance and charges them for their violent actions against their brother nation, the House of [[Jacob]] (Israel).{{Bibleref2c|Obadiah|1:10|NKJV|v.10}}

The western half of ancient Edom is the [[Negev]] desert all the way to Eilat, all part of modern Israel. The eastern half is possessed by the Hashemite kingdom of Jordan.  In the days of Obadiah, the Edomites lived along the cliffs and mountaintops of the arid land south of the Dead Sea, all the way to the Gulf of Aqaba on the Red Sea. There was very little in the way of arable land, so the Edomites made their living supporting (and controlling) the main caravan route between [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Babylon]] that passed through their whole land.

Throughout most of the history of Judah, Edom was controlled absolutely from Jerusalem as a vassal state. 
Among the region's great powers, Edom was held in low regard. Obadiah said that the high elevation of their dwelling place in the mountains of Seir had gone to their head, and they had puffed themselves up in pride. &quot;'Though you soar like the eagle and make your nest among the stars, from there I will bring you down,' declares the Lord&quot; ({{bibleref2|Obadiah|1:4|NIV}}, NIV).

In 597 BCE, [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] sacked Jerusalem, carted away the King of Judah, and installed a puppet ruler. The Edomites helped the Babylonians loot the city.  Obadiah, writing this prophecy around 590 BCE, suggests the Edomites should have remembered that blood was thicker than water. '&quot;On the day you stood aloof while strangers carried off his wealth and foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem, you were like one of them... You should not march through the gates of my people in the day of their disaster, nor gloat over them in their calamity in the day of their disaster, nor seize their wealth in the day of their disaster.&quot;' ({{bibleref2|Obadiah|1:11, 13|NIV}} NIV)

Obadiah said in  judgement God would wipe out the house of Esau forever, and not even a remnant would remain. The Edomites' land would be possessed by Egypt and they would cease to exist as a people. But the Day of the Lord was at hand for all nations, and someday the children of Israel would return from their exile and possess the land of Edom.

== Scholarly issues ==

===Dating Obadiah===
The date of composition is disputed and is difficult to determine due to the lack of personal information about Obadiah, his family, and his historical milieu. The date of composition must therefore be determined based on the prophecy itself. [[Edom]] is to be destroyed due to its lack of defense for its brother nation, Israel, when it was under attack. There are two major historical contexts within which the Edomites could have committed such an act. These are during 853 – 841 BC when [[Jerusalem]] was invaded by Philistines and Arabs during the reign of [[Jehoram of Judah]] (recorded in [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] {{bibleverse-nb|2 Kings|8:20–22|KJV}} and [[Books of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] {{bibleverse-nb|2 Chronicles|21:8–20|KJV}} in the Christian [[Old Testament]]) and 607 – 586 BC when [[Jerusalem]] was attacked by [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] of [[Babylon]], which led to the Babylonian exile of [[Israel]] (recorded in [[Psalm 137]]). The earlier period would place Obadiah as a contemporary of the prophet [[Elijah]]. 

The later date would place Obadiah as a contemporary of the prophet [[Jeremiah]]. A sixth-century date for Obadiah is a &quot;near consensus&quot; position among scholars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dykehouse2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Jason C. Dykehouse|title=An Historical Reconstruction of Edomite Treaty Betrayal in the Sixth Century B.C.E. Based on Biblical, Epigraphic, and Archaeological Data|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YBOXDwRPK7sC&amp;pg=PA11 |year=2008 |publisher=ProQuest |isbn=978-0-549-59500-7|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{bibleverse|Obadiah|1-9|KJV}} contains parallels to [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] {{bibleverse-nb|Jeremiah|49:7-22|KJV}}. The passage in [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] dates from the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim (604 BC), and therefore {{bibleverse|Obadiah|11-14|KJV}} seems to refer to the destruction of [[Jerusalem]] by [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] (586 BC). It is more likely that Obadiah and [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] together were drawing on a common source presently unknown to us than [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] drawing on previous writings of Obadiah as his source.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zvi1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Ehud Ben Zvi|title=A Historical-Critical Study of the Book of Obadiah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-VIjAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA104|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-080963-3|pages=104–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also much material found in {{bibleverse|Obadiah|10-21|KJV}} which [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] does not quote, and which, had he had it laid out before him, would have suited his purpose admirably.

===Contrast with Amos===
According to Obadiah 18, after judgment, &quot;There will be no survivors from the house of Esau&quot; (NIV). So, according to Obadiah there will not remain even a remnant after [[Edom]]’s judgment. This is in contrast to [[Book of Amos|Amos]] 9:12, where Amos refers to such a remnant; however, it is stated that their possession will be given to [[Israel]].

===Sepharad===
{{main|Sepharad}}
The identity of the land of &quot;Sepharad&quot;, mentioned only here in this verse in the Bible, {{Bibleref2|Obadiah|1:20|NIV|Obadiah 1:20}}, is currently unknown. It is also unknown whether or not Sepharad is a city, district or territory. [[Persia]]n inscriptions refer to two places called &quot;[[Saparda]]&quot;: one area in [[Medes|Media]] and another in [[Asia Minor]], arguably [[Sardis]].

== Scriptural parallels ==

The exact expression &quot;the Day of the Lord”, from {{bibleverse|Obadiah|1:15|KJV}}, has been used by other authors throughout the ''Old'' and ''New Testaments'', as follows:

'''[[Old Testament]]:'''
* [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] [[Isaiah 2|2,]][[Isaiah 13|13]][[Isaiah 34|, 34]][[Isaiah 58|, 58]], [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] {{bibleverse-nb|Jeremiah|46:10|KJV}}, [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] {{bibleverse-nb|Lamentations|2:22|KJV}}, [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] {{bibleverse-nb|Ezekiel|13:5|KJV}}, [[Book of Joel|Joel]] [[Joel 1|1]], [[Joel 2|2]], [[Joel 3|3]], [[Book of Amos|Amos]] {{bibleverse-nb|Amos|5:18|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb|Amos|5:20|KJV}}, [[Book of Zephaniah|Zephaniah]] [[Zephaniah 1|1]], [[Zephaniah 2|2]], [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] {{bibleverse-nb|Zechariah|14:1|KJV}}, [[Book of Malachi|Malachi]] [[Malachi 4#Verse 5|4:5]]

'''[[New Testament]]:'''
* [[1 Thessalonians 5#Verse 2|1 Thessalonians 5:2]], {{bibleverse|2 Peter|3:10|KJV}}, [[Acts 2:20]], {{bibleverse|1 Corinthians|5:5|KJV}}, {{bibleverse|2 Corinthians|1:14|KJV}}

For other parallels, compare {{bibleverse|Obadiah|1:1–8|KJV}} with {{bibleverse|Jeremiah|49:7–16|KJV}}.

== Protestant view ==

The overwhelming theme found in Obadiah is the destruction of the enemies of God's people{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}. Unlike other prophets who call the hearers to repent before they fall under [[divine judgement|judgment]], Obadiah's message is one of inevitable [[destiny|doom]] as a consequence of previous actions. A [[Christians|Christian]] with a knowledge of the [[New Testament]] of the [[Bible]] would say that although God's grace and forgiveness abound in such situations, because [[God]] is [[Justice|just]] there are consequences for opposing [[God]] and God's people. Obadiah shows that judgment falls even within the family of God, as [[Israel]] and [[Edom]] descended from twin brothers, Jacob and Esau. His purpose{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} was to make it known that according to his God, if members of the same family were to treat each other in the same manner as [[Edom]] treated the Israelites, they too may be subject to the wrath of God.

In relating to theme of [[Obadiah]], it is important to underscore the “punishment” theme this book outlines against Edom. W.J. Deane and J.R. Thomson write this conclusion, “The Book of Obadiah is occupied with one subject – the punishment of Edom for its cruel and unbrotherly conduct towards Judah...”&lt;ref&gt;Deane, W.J. &amp; Thomson, J.R., The Book of Obadiah, The Pulpit Commentary, Vol. 14 Amos – Malachi. Eds. Spence, H.D.M. &amp; Exell, Joseph S., Eerdmans: Grand Rapids (1981). p.1&lt;/ref&gt; One can link this idea of punishment to one of the major prophets “[[Ezekiel]]” who “...interprets the exile to Babylon and the destruction of Jerusalem as deserved punishments for the sins of those who themselves committed them.”&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, M.“A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context. Oxford University Press, New York (2009) p. 319&lt;/ref&gt;  Verses {{bibleverse-nb|Obadiah|3–7|KJV}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Obadiah+1 |title=oremus Bible Browser : Obadiah 1 |publisher=Bible.oremus.org |date=2011-02-10 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Obadiah explain to the reader the reason for the punishment theme, “Confidence in one’s power, intelligence, allies, or the topographical features of one’s territory is often mentioned as an attribute of those who foolishly confront the Lord and are consequently punished.”&lt;ref&gt;Henshaw, R.A. (revised by Zvi, Ehud Ben), The HarperCollins Study Bible. Ed. Attridge, H.W., HarperOne; New York. p. 1230&lt;/ref&gt; Although destruction is vital to understanding Obadiah, it is of note to understand the destruction being a consequence of action.
