A '''bean''' is the seed of one of several [[genus|genera]] of the [[flowering plant]] [[family (biology)|family]] [[Fabaceae]], which are used as vegetables for human or animal food. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.choosemyplate.gov/eathealthy/vegetables/vegetables-beans-and-peas|title=Beans and peas are unique foods {{!}} ChooseMyPlate|website=www.choosemyplate.gov|access-date=2020-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;They can be cooked in many different ways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Clark |first1=Mellisa |title=How to Cook Beans |url=https://cooking.nytimes.com/guides/21-how-to-cook-beans |website=New York Times Cooking |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=3 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; including boiling, frying, and baking, and are used in several traditional dishes throughout the world.

== Terminology ==
The word &quot;bean&quot; and its Germanic [[cognate]]s (e.g. [[German language|German]] ''[[wikt:Bohne#Noun|Bohne]]'') have existed in common use in [[West Germanic languages]] since before the 12th century,&lt;ref name=&quot;MW_Collegiate&quot;&gt;{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to [[Vicia faba|broad beans]], [[chickpeas]], and other pod-borne seeds. This was long before the [[New World]] genus ''[[Phaseolus]]'' was known in Europe. After Columbian-era contact between Europe and the Americas, use of the word was extended to pod-borne seeds of ''Phaseolus'', such as the [[common bean]] and the [[runner bean]], and the related genus ''[[Vigna]]''. The term has long been applied generally to many other seeds of similar form,&lt;ref name=&quot;MW_Collegiate&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AHD&quot;&gt;{{Citation |author=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |url=https://ahdictionary.com/ |postscript=. |access-date=3 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925104737/https://ahdictionary.com/ |archive-date=25 September 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as Old World [[soybean]]s, [[pea]]s, other [[Vicia|vetches]], and [[Lupinus|lupins]], and even to those with slighter resemblances, such as [[coffee bean]]s, [[vanilla|vanilla beans]], [[Ricinus|castor beans]], and [[cocoa bean]]s. Thus the term &quot;bean&quot; in general [[usage]] can refer to a host of different species.&lt;ref name=FAOdef&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition And Classification Of Commodities (See Chapter 4)|publisher=FAO, United Nations|year=1994|url=http://www.fao.org/es/faodef/faodefe.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bean Local Bhote.jpg|thumb|Local bean from Nepal.]]
Seeds called &quot;beans&quot; are often included among the crops called &quot;pulses&quot; ([[legume]]s),&lt;ref name=&quot;MW_Collegiate&quot;/&gt; although a narrower [[linguistic prescription|prescribed]] sense of &quot;pulses&quot; reserves the word for leguminous crops harvested for their dry grain. The term ''bean'' usually excludes legumes with tiny seeds and which are used exclusively for [[forage]], [[hay]], and [[silage]] purposes (such as [[clover]] and [[alfalfa]]). The United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] defines &quot;BEANS, DRY&quot; (item code 176)&lt;ref name=FAOdef/&gt; as applicable only to species of ''Phaseolus''. However, in the past, several species, including ''Vigna angularis'' (adzuki bean), ''V. mungo'' ([[black gram]]), ''V. radiata'' ([[green gram]]), and ''V. aconitifolia'' ([[moth bean]]), were classified as ''Phaseolus'' and later reclassified and general [[usage]] is not governed by that definition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Merriam-Webster]] [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bean BEAN]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia Britannica]] [https://www.britannica.com/plant/bean Bean]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Cultivation==
[[File:Field beans near Pendomer - geograph.org.uk - 1463701.jpg|thumb|right|Field beans (broad beans, ''[[Vicia faba]]''), ready for harvest]]
Unlike the closely related pea, beans are a summer crop that needs warm temperatures to grow. Maturity is typically 55–60 days from planting to harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zWW4AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA452&amp;dq=bean+maturity+55%E2%80%9360+days#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Early Named Soybean Varieties in the United States and Canada: Extensively Annotated Bibliography and Sourcebook|first1=William|last1=Shurtleff|first2=Akiko|last2=Aoyagi|date=1 October 2013|publisher=Soyinfo Center|accessdate=18 November 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9781928914600}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the bean pods mature, they turn yellow and dry up, and the beans inside change from green to their [[Phaseolus vulgaris|mature colour]].{{Clarify|date=November 2017}} As a vine, bean plants need external support, which may take the form of special &quot;bean cages&quot; or poles. Native Americans customarily grew them along with corn and squash (the so-called [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three Sisters]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6O4sOoTqV60C&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=native+americans+corn+beans+squash#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=New York Yesterday &amp; Today|first=Meg|last=Schneider|publisher=Voyageur Press|accessdate=18 November 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9781616731267}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the tall [[plant stem|cornstalks]] acting as support for the beans.

In more recent times, the so-called &quot;bush bean&quot; has been developed which does not require support and has all its pods develop simultaneously (as opposed to pole beans which develop gradually).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/artdec13macro/Gerhardt_Final.pdf|title=The Germination Of a Bean|website=Microscopy-uk.org.uk|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the bush bean more practical for commercial production.

Beans are one of the longest-cultivated plants. [[Broad beans]], also called fava beans, in their wild state the size of a small fingernail, were gathered in [[Afghanistan]] and the Himalayan foothills.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, pp. 27 ff&lt;/ref&gt; In a form improved from naturally occurring types, they were grown in Thailand from the early seventh millennium BCE, predating ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17742735|year=1969|last1=Gorman|first1=CF|title=Hoabinhian: A pebble-tool complex with early plant associations in southeast Asia|volume=163|issue=3868|pages=671–3|doi=10.1126/science.163.3868.671|journal=Science|bibcode=1969Sci...163..671G}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were deposited with the dead in [[ancient Egypt]]. Not until the second millennium BCE did cultivated, large-seeded broad beans appear in the Aegean, Iberia and transalpine Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Zohary and Maria Hopf ''Domestication of Plants in the Old World'' Oxford University Press, 2012, {{ISBN|0199549060}}, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Iliad]]'' (8th century BCE) there is a passing mention of beans and [[chickpea]]s cast on the threshing floor.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;And as in some great threshing-floor go leaping From a broad pan the black-skinned beans or peas.&quot; (''Iliad'' xiii, 589).&lt;/ref&gt;

Beans were an important source of [[Protein in nutrition|protein]] throughout Old and New World history, and still are today.

The oldest-known domesticated beans in the Americas were found in [[Guitarrero Cave]], an archaeological site in [[Peru]], and dated to around the second millennium BCE.&lt;ref name=Chazan/&gt; However, genetic analyses of the common bean ''Phaseolus'' show that it originated in [[Mesoamerica]], and subsequently spread southward, along with maize and squash, traditional companion crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mesoamerican origin of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is revealed by sequence data|first1=Elena|last1=Bitocchi|first2=Laura|last2=Nanni|first3=Elisa|last3=Bellucci|first4=Monica|last4=Rossi|first5=Alessandro|last5=Giardini|first6=Pierluigi Spagnoletti|last6=Zeuli|first7=Giuseppina|last7=Logozzo|first8=Jens|last8=Stougaard|first9=Phillip|last9=McClean|first10=Giovanna|last10=Attene|first11=Roberto|last11=Papa|date=3 April 2012|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=109|issue=14|pages=E788–E796|doi=10.1073/pnas.1108973109|pmid=22393017|pmc=3325731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the kinds commonly eaten fresh or dried, those of the genus ''Phaseolus'', come originally from the Americas, being first seen by a European when [[Christopher Columbus]], while exploring what may have been the [[Bahamas]], found them growing in fields. Five kinds of ''[[Phaseolus]]'' beans were domesticated&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, p. 30: Domestication, besides involving selection for larger seed size, also involved selection for pods that did not curl and open when ripe, scattering the beans they contained..&lt;/ref&gt; by pre-Columbian peoples: common beans (''[[Phaseolus vulgaris|P. vulgaris]]'') grown from Chile to the northern part of what is now the United States, and lima and sieva beans (''[[Phaseolus lunatus|P. lunatus]]''), as well as the less widely distributed teparies (''[[Phaseolus acutifolius|P. acutifolius]]''), scarlet runner beans (''[[Phaseolus coccineus|P. coccineus]]'') and polyanthus beans (''[[Phaseolus polyanthus|P. polyanthus]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; One especially famous use of beans by pre-Columbian people as far north as the Atlantic seaboard is the &quot;[[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three Sisters]]&quot; method of [[companion plant]] cultivation:

:In the New World, many tribes would grow beans together with [[maize]] (corn), and [[Squash (plant)|squash]]. The corn would not be planted in rows as is done by European agriculture, but in a checkerboard/hex fashion across a field, in separate patches of one to six stalks each.

:Beans would be planted around the base of the developing stalks, and would vine their way up as the stalks grew. All American beans at that time were vine plants, &quot;bush beans&quot; having been bred only more recently. The cornstalks would work as a [[Trellis (agriculture)|trellis]] for the beans, and the beans would provide much-needed [[nitrogen]] for the corn.

:Squash would be planted in the spaces between the patches of corn in the field. They would be provided slight shelter from the sun by the corn, would shade the soil and reduce evaporation, and would deter many animals from attacking the corn and beans because their coarse, hairy vines and broad, stiff leaves are difficult or uncomfortable for animals such as deer and raccoons to walk through, crows to land on, etc.

Dry beans come from both Old World varieties of broad beans (fava beans) and New World varieties (kidney, black, cranberry, pinto, navy/haricot).

Beans are a [[heliotropic]] plant, meaning that the leaves tilt throughout the day to face the sun. At night, they go into a folded &quot;sleep&quot; position.

==Health concerns==

===Toxins===
{{Main|Phytohaemagglutinin|Soybean agglutinin}}
Some kinds of raw beans contain a harmful, tasteless toxin: the [[lectin]] [[phytohaemagglutinin]], which must be removed by cooking. Red [[kidney bean]]s are particularly toxic, but other types also pose risks of [[food poisoning]]. A recommended method is to boil the beans for at least ten minutes; undercooked beans may be more toxic than raw beans.&lt;ref name=FDA&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United States [[Food and Drug Administration]]|accessdate=11 July 2009 |url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodborneIllness/FoodborneIllnessFoodbornePathogensNaturalToxins/BadBugBook/ucm071092.htm |title=Foodborne Pathogenic Microorganisms and Natural Toxins Handbook: Phytohaemagglutinin |work= [[Bad Bug Book]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090709183309/https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodborneIllness/FoodborneIllnessFoodbornePathogensNaturalToxins/BadBugBook/ucm071092.htm| archivedate= 9 July 2009 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooking beans, without bringing them to a boil, in a [[slow cooker]] at a temperature well below boiling may not destroy toxins.&lt;ref name=FDA /&gt; A case of poisoning by [[Lima bean|butter beans]] used to make [[falafel]] was reported; the beans were used instead of traditional [[broad bean]]s or [[chickpea]]s, soaked and ground without boiling, made into patties, and [[Shallow frying|shallow fried]].&lt;ref name=falafel&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/beware-of-the-beans-how-beans-can-be-a-surprising-source-of-food-poisoning-931862.html |title=Beware of the beans: How beans can be a surprising source of food poisoning |newspaper=The Independent |date=15 September 2008  |author=Vicky Jones |accessdate= 23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bean poisoning is not well known in the medical community, and many cases may be misdiagnosed or never reported; figures appear not to be available. In the case of the UK [[National Poisons Information Service]], available only to health professionals, the dangers of beans other than red beans were not flagged {{As of|2008|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=falafel/&gt;

[[Fermentation (food)|Fermentation]] is used in some parts of Africa to improve the nutritional value of beans by removing toxins. Inexpensive fermentation improves the nutritional impact of flour from dry beans and improves digestibility, according to research co-authored by Emire Shimelis, from the Food Engineering Program at Addis Ababa University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shimelis|first=Emire Admassu|last2=Rakshit|first2=Sudip Kumar|date=2008|title=Influence of natural and controlled fermentations on α-galactosides, antinutrients and protein digestibility of beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)|journal=International Journal of Food Science &amp; Technology|language=en|volume=43|issue=4|pages=658–665|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.2006.01506.x|issn=1365-2621}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beans are a major source of dietary [[protein (nutrient)|protein]] in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.&lt;ref&gt;Summary: [http://www.scidev.net/fr/climate-change-and-energy/tsunami/news/actualit-s-d-afrique-sub-saharienne-en-bref-du-25-.html Fermentation 'improves nutritional value of beans'] (Sub Saharan Africa page, Science and Development Network website).

===Bacterial infection from bean sprouts===
It is common to make [[beansprout]]s by letting some types of bean, often [[mung bean]]s, germinate in moist and warm conditions; beansprouts may be used as ingredients in cooked dishes, or eaten raw or lightly cooked. There have been many [[Beansprout#health concerns|outbreaks of disease]] from bacterial contamination, often by ''[[salmonella]]'', ''[[listeria]]'', and ''[[Escherichia coli]]'',  of beansprouts not thoroughly cooked,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/types/fruits/sprouts.html |title=Sprouts: What You Should Know |newspaper=Foodsafety.gov |date=  |accessdate= 23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; some causing significant mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/activities/sciadvice/_layouts/forms/Review_DispForm.aspx?ID=602&amp;List=a3216f4c%2Df040%2D4f51%2D9f77%2Da96046dbfd72|title=Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC): Update on outbreak in the EU (27 July 2011, 11:00)|website=European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control|date=2011-07-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315061038/http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/activities/sciadvice/_layouts/forms/Review_DispForm.aspx?ID=602&amp;List=a3216f4c%2Df040%2D4f51%2D9f77%2Da96046dbfd72|archive-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antinutrients===
Many types of bean {{specify|date=August 2016}} contain significant amounts of [[antinutrient]]s that inhibit some enzyme processes in the body. [[Phytic acid]] and phytates, present in grains, nuts, seeds and beans, interfere with bone growth and interrupt [[vitamin D]] metabolism. Pioneering work on the effect of phytic acid was done by [[Edward Mellanby]] from 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1264631 | pmid=16747083 | volume=33 | issue=10 | title=Phytic acid and the rickets-producing action of cereals | date=October 1939 | journal=Biochem.

==Nutrition==
Beans are high in [[protein (nutrient)|protein]], [[Oligosaccharide|complex carbohydrates]], [[folate]], and [[iron]].&lt;ref name=mayo/&gt; Beans also have significant amounts of fiber and [[soluble fiber]], with one cup{{clarify|reason=how many grams in a cup?|date=March 2017}} of cooked beans providing between nine and 13&amp;nbsp;grams of fiber.&lt;ref name=mayo&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/healthy-recipes/NU00410 Mixed Bean Salad] (information and recipe) from [http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/healthy-recipes The Mayo Clinic Healthy Recipes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015142849/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/healthy-recipes/ |date=15 October 2008 }}.

==Flatulence==
{{seealso|Baked beans#Flatulence}}
Many edible beans, including broad beans, navy beans, kidney beans and soybeans, contain [[oligosaccharide]]s (particularly [[raffinose]] and [[stachyose]]), a type of sugar molecule also found in [[cabbage]]. An anti-oligosaccharide [[enzyme]] is necessary to properly digest these sugar molecules. As a normal human digestive tract does not contain any anti-oligosaccharide enzymes, consumed oligosaccharides are typically digested by [[bacteria]] in the large intestine. This digestion process produces gases such as methane as a byproduct, which are then released as [[flatulence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Harold McGee | title = Food and Cooking | page = 486 | quote = Many legumes, especially soy, navy and lima beans, cause a sudden increase in bacterial activity and gas production a few hours after they're consumed. This is because they contain large amounts of carbohydrates that human digestive enzymes can't convert into absorbable sugars. These carbohydrates therefore leave the upper intestine unchanged and enter the lower reaches, where our resident bacterial population does the job we are unable to do.|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year= 2003|isbn=978-0684843285}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Peter Barham | title = The Science of Cooking | page = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9783540674665/page/14 14] | quote = we do not possess any enzymes that are capable of breaking down larger sugars, such as raffinose etc. These 3, 4 and 5 ring sugars are made by plants especially as part of the energy storage system in seeds and beans. If these sugars are ingested, they can't be broken down in the intestines; rather, they travel into the colon, where various bacteria digest them – and in the process produce copious amounts of carbon dioxide gas | year = 2001 | publisher = Springer | isbn = 978-3-540-67466-5 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9783540674665/page/14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
