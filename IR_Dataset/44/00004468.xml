'''Buddhist philosophy''' refers to the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] investigations and systems of inquiry that developed among various [[Buddhist schools]] in [[India]] following the [[parinirvana]] (i.e. death) of the [[Buddha]] and later spread throughout Asia. The Buddhist path combines both philosophical reasoning and meditation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Siderits, Mark 2007, page 6&quot;&gt;Siderits, Mark. Buddhism as philosophy, 2007, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist traditions present a multitude of [[Buddhist paths to liberation]], and Buddhist thinkers in India and subsequently in [[East Asia]] have covered topics as varied as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[ethics]], [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], [[logic]] and [[philosophy of time]] in their analysis of these paths.

[[Early Buddhism]] was based on [[empirical evidence]] gained by the sense organs (''[[ayatana]]'')&lt;ref&gt;David Kalupahana, ''Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism.'' The University Press of Hawaii, 1975, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Buddha seems to have retained a [[Skepticism|skeptical]] distance from [[The unanswered questions|certain metaphysical questions]], refusing to answer them because they were not conducive to liberation but led instead to further speculation. A recurrent theme in Buddhist philosophy has been the [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]] of concepts, and the subsequent return to the Buddhist [[Middle Way]].{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994}}&lt;ref&gt;David Kalupahana, ''Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna.'' Motilal Banarsidass, 2006, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Particular points of Buddhist philosophy have often been the subject of disputes between different schools of Buddhism. These elaborations and disputes gave rise to [[Early Buddhist schools|various schools in early Buddhism]] of [[Abhidharma]], and to the [[Mahayana]] traditions such as [[Prajnaparamita]], [[Madhyamaka]], [[Buddha-nature]] and [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]].

==Historical phases of Buddhist philosophy==

[[Edward Conze]] splits the development of Indian Buddhist philosophy into three phases.

The first phase concerns questions of the original doctrines derived from oral traditions that originated during the life of the Buddha, and are common to all later sects of Buddhism.

The second phase concerns non-Mahayana &quot;scholastic&quot; Buddhism, as evident in the Abhidharma texts beginning in the third century BCE that feature scholastic reworking and schematic classification of material in the sutras.

The third phase of development of Indian Buddhist philosophy concerns Mahayana &quot;metaphysical&quot; Buddhism, beginning in the late first century CE, which emphasizes monastic life and the path of a bodhisattva. Various elements of these three phases are incorporated and/or further developed in the philosophy and world view of the various sects of Buddhism that then emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Conze, Edward. Buddhist thought in India: Three phases of Buddhist philosophy. Vol. 4. Routledge, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical orientation==
[[Indian philosophy|Philosophy in India]] was aimed mainly at [[moksha|spiritual liberation]] and had [[soteriology|soteriological]] goals. In his study of Mādhyamaka Buddhist philosophy in India, Peter Deller Santina writes:&lt;ref&gt;Santina, Peter Della. ''Madhyamaka Schools in India: A Study of the Madhyamaka Philosophy and of the Division of the System into the Prasangika and Svatantrika Schools.'' 2008. p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Attention must first of all be drawn to the fact that philosophical systems in India were seldom, if ever, purely speculative or descriptive. Virtually all the great philosophical systems of India: [[Sāṅkhya]], [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaitavedānta]], Mādhyamaka and so forth, were preeminently concerned with providing a means to liberation or salvation. It was a tacit assumption with these systems that if their philosophy were correctly understood and assimilated, an [[Nirvana|unconditioned state]] free of suffering and limitation could be achieved. [...] If this fact is overlooked, as often happens as a result of the propensity engendered by formal [[western philosophy|Occidental philosophy]] to consider the philosophical enterprise as a purely descriptive one, the real significance of Indian and Buddhist philosophy will be missed.}}

For the Indian Buddhist philosophers, the teachings of the Buddha were not meant to be taken on faith alone, but to be confirmed by logical analysis (''[[pramana]]'') of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Siderits, Mark 2007, page 6&quot;/&gt; The early Buddhist texts mention that a person becomes a follower of the Buddha's teachings after having pondered them over with wisdom and the gradual training also requires that a disciple &quot;investigate&quot; (''upaparikkhati'') and &quot;scrutinize&quot; (''tuleti'') the teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Douglas; Whitaker, Justin; Reading the Buddha as a philosopher, Philosophy east and west, volume 66, April 2016, pp. 515–538, University of Hawaii Press, http://buddhism.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/phil551854.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919160302/http://buddhism.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/phil551854.pdf |date=19 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha also expected his disciples to approach him as a teacher in a critical fashion and scrutinize his actions and words, as shown in the ''[[Vīmaṃsaka Sutta]].''

==The Buddha and early Buddhism==
{{Main|Presectarian Buddhism}}
[[File:Bodleian MS. Burm. a. 12 Life of the Buddha 13-14.jpg|thumbnail|right|Gautama Buddha surrounded by followers, from an 18th-century Burmese watercolour]]

===The Buddha===
Scholarly opinion varies as to whether the Buddha himself was engaged in philosophical inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Douglass, and Justin Whitaker. &quot;Reading the Buddha as a Philosopher.&quot; Philosophy East and West 66, no. 2 (2016): 515–538.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Buddha]] (c. 5th century BCE) was a north Indian [[sramana]] (wandering ascetic) from [[Magadha]]. He cultivated various yogic techniques and ascetic practices and taught throughout north India, where his teachings took hold. These teachings are preserved in the Pali [[Nikayas]] and in the [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Agamas]] as well as in other surviving fragmentary textual collections (collectively known as the [[Early Buddhist Texts]]). Dating these texts is difficult, and there is disagreement on how much of this material goes back to a single religious founder. While the focus of the Buddha's teachings are about attaining the highest good of nirvana, they also contain an analysis of the source of human [[suffering]], the nature of [[personal identity]], and the process of acquiring knowledge about the world.

===The Middle Way===
{{Main|Middle Way}}
The Buddha defined his teaching as &quot;[[Middle Way|the middle way]]&quot; ([[Pali language|Pali]]: ''Majjhimāpaṭipadā''). In the ''[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta]]'', this is used to refer to the fact that his teachings steer a middle course between the extremes of [[asceticism]] and bodily denial (as practiced by the [[Jains]] and other ascetic groups) and sensual [[hedonism]] or indulgence. Many sramanas of the Buddha's time placed much emphasis on a denial of the body, using practices such as [[fasting]], to liberate the mind from the body. The Buddha, however, realized that the mind was embodied and causally dependent on the body, and therefore that a malnourished body did not allow the mind to be trained and developed.&lt;ref&gt;Panjvani, Cyrus; Buddhism: A Philosophical Approach (2013), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Buddhism's main concern is not with luxury or poverty, but instead with the human response to circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Swearer, Donald K. Ethics, wealth, and salvation: A study in Buddhist social ethics. Edited by Russell F. Sizemore. Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1990. (from the introduction)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic teachings===
{{Main|Pre-sectarian Buddhism}}

Certain basic teachings appear in many places throughout these early texts, so older studies by various scholars conclude that the Buddha must at least have taught some of these key teachings:&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, ''Buddhism'', Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 34 and table of contents&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Middle Way]]
* The [[Four Noble Truths]]
* The [[Noble Eightfold Path|The Noble Eightfold Path]]
* The [[Three marks of existence]]
* The [[Skandha|five aggregates of clinging]]
* [[Pratītyasamutpāda|Dependent origination]]
* [[Karma in Buddhism|Karma]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]
* [[Nirvana]]

Critical studies by [[Lambert Schmithausen|Schmithausen]], [[Tilmann|Vetter]], [[Johannes Bronkhorst|Bronkhorst]], [[Richard Gombrich|Gombrich]] and others have adjusted this list of basic teachings, and revealed a more nuanced genesis of the Buddhist teachings. According to Vetter, the description of the Buddhist path may initially have been as simple as the term &quot;the middle way&quot;.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} In time, this short description was elaborated, resulting in the description of the eightfold path.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} Vetter argues that the eightfold path constitutes a body of practices which prepare one, and lead up to, the practice of ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyana]]''.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxx}} According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, ''dhyana'' constituted the original &quot;liberating practice&quot;,{{sfn|Vetter|1988|pp=xxi–xxii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Cousins|1996|p=58}} while discriminating insight into transiency as a separate path to liberation was a later development.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|pp=xxxiv–xxxvii}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=131}}

According to Bronkhorst, the four truths may not have been formulated in earliest Buddhism, and did not serve in earliest Buddhism as a description of &quot;liberating insight&quot;.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=107}} Lambert Schmithausen concluded that the four truths were a later development in early Buddhism.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} Carol Anderson, following Lambert Schmithausen and [[K. R. Norman|K.R. Norman]], notes that the four truths are missing in critical passages in the canon,{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=viii}} and states:
{{quote|... the four noble truths were probably not part of the earliest strata of what came to be recognized as Buddhism, but that they emerged as a central teaching in a slightly later period that still preceded the final redactions of the various Buddhist canons.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=21}}}}

According to both Bronkhorst and Anderson, the four truths became a substitution for prajña, or &quot;liberating insight&quot;, in the suttas{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=99–100, 102–111}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999}} in those texts where &quot;liberating insight&quot; was preceded by the four jhanas.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=108}}

According to some scholars, the philosophical outlook of earliest Buddhism was primarily negative, in the sense that it focused on what doctrines to ''reject'' more than on what doctrines to ''accept''.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|See for example Thanissaro Bhikkhu's commentary on the Mulapariyaya Sutta, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.001.than.html].}} Only knowledge that is useful in achieving [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] is valued. According to this theory, the cycle of philosophical upheavals that in part drove the diversification of Buddhism into its many schools and sects only began once Buddhists began attempting to make explicit the implicit philosophy of the Buddha and the early texts.

===The noble truths and causation===
{{Main|Four Noble Truths}}
The four noble truths or &quot;truths of the noble one&quot; are a central feature of the teachings and are put forth in the ''[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta]]''. The first truth of [[dukkha]], often translated as ''suffering'', is the inherent unsatisfactoriness of life. This unpleasantness is said to be not just physical pain, but also a kind of existential unease caused by the inevitable facts of our mortality and ultimately by the impermanence of all phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark. Buddhism as philosophy, 2007, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; It also arises because of contact with unpleasant events, and due to not getting what one desires. The second truth is that this unease arises out of conditions, mainly 'craving' ([[Taṇhā|tanha]]) and ignorance ([[Avidyā (Buddhism)|avidya]]). The third truth is then the fact that if you let go of craving and remove ignorance through knowledge, dukkha ceases ([[nirodha]]). The fourth is the [[Eightfold Path|eightfold path]] which are eight practices that end suffering. They are: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right [[mindfulness]] and right [[samadhi]] (mental unification, meditation). The goal taught by the Buddha, nirvana, literally means 'extinguishing' and signified &quot;the complete extinguishing of greed, hatred, and delusion (i.e. ignorance), the forces which power ''[[Saṃsāra|samsara]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams, Paul 2011, page 48&quot;&gt;Williams, Paul; Tribe, Anthony; Wynne, Alexander; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, 2011, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Nirvana also means that after an enlightened being's death, there is no further rebirth. In early Buddhism, the concept of [[Pratitya-samutpada|dependent origination]] was most likely limited to processes of mental conditioning and not to all physical phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Shulman, Eviatar. &quot;Early meanings of dependent-origination.&quot; Journal of Indian Philosophy 36, no. 2 (2008): 297–317.&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha understood the world in procedural terms, not in terms of things or substances.&lt;ref&gt;Gunnar Skirbekk, Nils Gilje, ''A history of Western thought: from ancient Greece to the twentieth century.'' 7th edition published by Routledge, 2001, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; His theory posits a flux of events arising under certain conditions which are interconnected and dependent, such that the processes in question at no time are considered to be static or independent. Craving, for example, is always dependent on, and caused by sensations. Sensations are always dependent on contact with our surroundings. Buddha's causal theory is simply descriptive: &quot;This existing, that exists; this arising, that arises; this not existing, that does not exist; this ceasing, that ceases.&quot; This understanding of causation as &quot;impersonal lawlike causal ordering&quot; is important because it shows how the processes that give rise to suffering work, and also how they can be reversed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams, Paul 2011, page 48&quot;/&gt;

The removal of suffering, then, requires a deep understanding of the nature of reality ([[prajña]]). While philosophical analysis of arguments and concepts is clearly necessary to develop this understanding, it is not enough to remove our unskillful mental habits and deeply ingrained prejudices, which require [[meditation]], paired with understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark. Buddhism as philosophy, 2007, p.  25&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Buddha of the early texts, we need to train the mind in meditation to be able to truly see the nature of reality, which is said to have the marks of suffering, impermanence and not-self. Understanding and meditation are said to work together to 'clearly see' ([[vipassana]]) the nature of human experience and this is said to lead to liberation.

===Anatta===
{{PancaKhandha}}
{{main|Anatta}}
The Buddha argued that compounded entities lacked essence, correspondingly the self is without essence. This means there is no part of a person which is unchanging and essential for continuity, and it means that there is no individual &quot;part of the person that accounts for the identity of that person over time&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Siderits, Mark 2007, page 33&quot;&gt;Siderits, Mark. Buddhism as philosophy, 2007, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; This is in opposition to the [[Upanishads|Upanishadic]] concept of an unchanging [[Atman (Hinduism)|ultimate self]] (Atman) and any view of an eternal [[soul]]. The Buddha held that attachment to the appearance of a permanent self in this world of change is the cause of suffering, and the main obstacle to [[Moksha|liberation]].

The most widely used argument that the Buddha employed against the idea of an unchanging ego is an empiricist one, based on the observation of the five aggregates that make up a person and the fact that these are always changing. This argument can be put in this way:&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark. Buddhism as philosophy, 2007, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

#All psycho-physical processes ([[skandhas]]) are impermanent.
#If there were a self it would be permanent.
::IP [There is no more to the person than the five skandhas.] 
::∴ There is no self.

This argument requires the implied premise that the five aggregates are an exhaustive account of what makes up a person, or else the self could exist outside of these aggregates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Siderits, Mark 2007, page 33&quot;/&gt; This premise is affirmed in other suttas, such as [[Saṃyutta Nikāya|SN]] 22.47 which states: &quot;whatever ascetics and brahmins regard various kinds of things as self, all regard the five grasping aggregates, or one of them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://suttacentral.net/sn22.47/en/sujato|title=SN 22.47 – SuttaCentral|last=Bhikku|first=Sujato|date=2018|website=SuttaCentral|access-date=10 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This argument is famously expounded in the ''[[Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta|Anattalakkhana Sutta]]''. According to this text, the apparently fixed self is merely the result of identification with the [[skandhas|temporary aggregates]], the changing processes making up an individual human being. In this view a 'person' is only a convenient nominal designation on a certain grouping of processes and characteristics, and an 'individual' is a conceptual construction overlaid upon a stream of experiences just like a [[chariot]] is merely a conventional designation for the parts of a chariot and how they are put together. The foundation of this argument is [[empiricist]], for it is based on the fact that all we observe is subject to change, especially everything observed when looking inwardly in meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Panjvani, Cyrus; Buddhism: A Philosophical Approach (2013), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another argument for 'non-self', the 'argument from lack of control',&lt;ref&gt;Cyrus Panjvani, Buddhism: A Philosophical Approach, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; is based on the fact that we often seek to change certain parts of ourselves, that the 'executive function' of the mind is that which finds certain things unsatisfactory and attempts to alter them. Furthermore, it is also based on the Indian 'Anti Reflexivity Principle' which states an entity cannot operate on or control itself (a knife can cut other things but not itself, a finger can point at other things but not at itself, etc.). This means then, that the self could never desire to change itself and could not do so (another reason for this is that in most Indian traditions besides Buddhism, the true self or Atman is perfectly blissful and does not suffer). The Buddha uses this idea to attack the concept of self. This argument could be structured thus:&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark, &quot;Buddha&quot;, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/buddha/&lt;/ref&gt;

#If the self existed it would be the part of the person that performs the executive function, the &quot;controller.&quot;
#The self could never desire that it be changed (anti-reflexivity principle).
#Each of the five kinds of psycho-physical element is such that one can desire that it be changed.
::IP [There is no more to the person than the five skandhas.]
::∴ There is no self.

This argument then denies that there is one permanent &quot;controller&quot; in the person. Instead it views the person as a set of constantly changing processes which include volitional events seeking change and an awareness of that desire for change. According to Mark Siderits:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;What the Buddhist has in mind is that on one occasion one part of the person might perform the executive function, on another occasion another part might do so. This would make it possible for every part to be subject to control without there being any part that always fills the role of controller (and so is the self). On some occasions a given part might fall on the controller side, while on other occasions it might fall on the side of the controlled. This would explain how it's possible for us to seek to change any of the skandhas while there is nothing more to us than just those skandhas.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark. Buddhism as philosophy, 2007, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As noted by K.R. Norman and Richard Gombrich, the Buddha extended his [[anatta]] critique to the Brahmanical belief expounded in the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'' that the Self (Atman) was indeed the whole world, or [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;Gombrich; Recovering the Buddha's Message © The Buddhist Forum, Vol I, Seminar Papers 1987–1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman, KR; A note on Attā in the Alagaddupama Sutta – 1981&lt;/ref&gt; This is shown by the ''Alagaddupama Sutta'', where the Buddha argues that an individual cannot experience the suffering of the entire world. He used the example of someone carrying off and burning grass and sticks from the Jeta grove and how a monk would not sense or consider themselves harmed by that action. In this example the Buddha is arguing that we do not have direct experience of the entire world, and hence the Self cannot be the whole world. {{refn|group=lower-alpha|MN 22, Alagaddupama Sutta, &quot;Bhikkhus, what do you think? If people carried off the grass, sticks, branches, and leaves in this Jeta Grove, or burned them, or did what they liked with them, would you think: ‘People are carrying us off or burning us or doing what they like with us’?&quot;{{snd}}&quot;No, venerable sir. Why not? Because that is neither our self nor what belongs to our self.&quot; [https://suttacentral.net/en/mn22/69-70].}} In this sutta (as well as in the ''Soattā Sutta'') the Buddha outlines six wrong views about Self:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;There are six wrong views: An unwise, untrained person may think of the body, ‘This is mine, this is me, this is my self’; he may think that of feelings; of perceptions; of volitions; or of what has been seen, heard, thought, cognized, reached, sought or considered by the mind. The sixth is to identify the world and self, to believe: ‘At death I shall become permanent, eternal, unchanging, and so remain forever the same; and that is mine, that is me, that is my self.’ A wise and well-trained person sees that all these positions are wrong, and so he is not worried about something that does not exist.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, the Buddha argues that the world can be observed to be a cause of suffering (Brahman was held to be ultimately blissful) and that since we cannot control the world as we wish, the world cannot be the Self. The idea that &quot;this cosmos is the self&quot; is one of the [[View (Buddhism)|views]] rejected by the Buddha &lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu [trans], MN 22 PTS: M i 130 Alagaddupama Sutta: The Water-Snake Simile, 2004, http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.than.html&lt;/ref&gt; along with the related [[Monism|Monistic]] theory that held that &quot;everything is a Oneness&quot; (SN 12.48 ''Lokayatika Sutta'').&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu [trans], SN 12.48 PTS: S ii 77 CDB i 584 Lokayatika Sutta: The Cosmologist, 1999;  http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.048.than.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha also held that understanding and seeing the truth of not-self led to un-attachment, and hence to the cessation of suffering, while ignorance about the true nature of personality led to further suffering.

===Epistemology===
{{See also|Epistemology}}

All schools of [[Indian philosophy]] recognize various sets of valid justifications for knowledge, or ''[[pramana]]'' and many see the [[Vedas]] as providing access to truth. The Buddha denied the authority of the Vedas, though, like his contemporaries, he affirmed the soteriological importance of having a proper understanding of reality ([[Noble Eightfold Path#Right view|right view]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi; The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha, p. 117; AN 1.307 &quot;Bhikkhus, I do not see even a single thing on account of
which unarisen wholesome qualities arise and arisen wholesome qualities increase
and expand so much as right view.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; However, this understanding was not conceived primarily as metaphysical and cosmological knowledge, but as a knowledge into the arising and cessation of suffering in human experience.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel, Steven M (editor); A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy, 2013, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the Buddha's epistemic project is different than that of modern philosophy; it is primarily a solution to the fundamental human spiritual/existential problem.

The Buddha's epistemology has been compared to [[empiricism]], in the sense that it was based on experience of the world through the senses.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel, Steven M (editor); A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy, 2013, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha taught that empirical observation through the six sense fields ([[ayatanas]]) was the proper way of verifying any knowledge claims. Some suttas go further, stating that &quot;the All&quot;, or everything that exists (''sabbam''), are these six sense spheres (SN 35.23, Sabba Sutta) &lt;ref&gt;D. J. Kalupahana, A Buddhist tract on empiricism, https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kk3n/80-300/kalupahana1969.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and that anyone who attempts to describe another &quot;All&quot; will be unable to do so because &quot;it lies beyond range&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;SN 35.23 PTS: S iv 15 CDB ii 1140
Sabba Sutta: The All, translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu © 2001, http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.023.than.html&lt;/ref&gt; This sutta seems to indicate that for the Buddha, things in themselves or [[noumena]], are beyond our epistemological reach (''avisaya'').&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Sue. 2000. Early Buddhism: a New Approach: the I of the Beholder. Richmond, Surrey:
Curzon&lt;/ref&gt;{{opinion|date=January 2019}}

Furthermore, in the [[Kesamutti Sutta|Kalama Sutta]] the Buddha tells a group of confused villagers that the only proper reason for one's beliefs is verification in one's own personal experience (and the experience of the wise) and denies any verification which stems from personal authority, sacred tradition (''anussava'') or any kind of [[rationalism]] which constructs metaphysical theories (''takka'').&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, pp. 177, 206.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Tevijja Sutta (DN 13), the Buddha rejects the personal authority of Brahmins because none of them can prove they have had personal experience of [[Brahman]]. The Buddha also stressed that experience is the only criterion for verification of the truth in this passage from the [[Majjhima Nikaya]] (MN.I.265):

::&quot;Monks, do you only speak that which is known by yourselves seen by yourselves, found by yourselves?&quot; 
::&quot;Yes, we do, sir.&quot; 
::&quot;Good, monks, That is how you have been instructed by me in this timeless doctrine which can be realized and verified, that leads to the goal and can be understood by those who are intelligent.&quot;

Furthermore, the Buddha's standard for personal verification was a pragmatic and salvific one, for the Buddha a belief counts as truth only if it leads to successful Buddhist practice (and hence, to the destruction of craving). In the &quot;Discourse to Prince Abhaya&quot; (MN.I.392–4) the Buddha states this pragmatic maxim by saying that a belief should only be accepted if it leads to wholesome consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel, Steven M (editor); A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy, 2013, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency of the Buddha to see what is true as what was useful or 'what works' has been called by scholars such as [[Caroline Augusta Foley Rhys Davids|Mrs Rhys Davids]] and [[Charles Jean de la Vallée-Poussin|Vallée-Poussin]] a form of [[Pragmatism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Poussin; Bouddhisme, Third Edition, Paris, 1925, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[K. N. Jayatilleke]] argues the Buddha's epistemology can also be taken to be a form of [[correspondence theory]] (as per the 'Apannaka Sutta') with elements of [[Coherentism]] &lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, pp. 352–353.&lt;/ref&gt; and that for the Buddha, it is causally impossible for something which is false to lead to cessation of suffering and evil.

The Buddha discouraged his followers from indulging in intellectual disputation for its own sake, which is fruitless, and distracts one from the goal of awakening. Only philosophy and discussion which has pragmatic value for liberation from suffering is seen as important. According to the [[Pali Canon|scriptures]], during his lifetime the Buddha remained silent when asked several [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[The unanswered questions|questions]] which he regarded as the basis for &quot;unwise reflection&quot;. These 'unanswered questions' (avyākata) regarded issues such as whether the universe is eternal or non-eternal (or whether it is finite or infinite), the unity or separation of the body and the [[Atman (Buddhism)|self]], the complete inexistence of a person after [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]] and death, and others. The Buddha stated that thinking about these imponderable ([[Acinteyya]]) issues led to &quot;a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views&quot; (Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta).

One explanation for this pragmatic suspension of judgment or epistemic [[Epoché]] is that such questions distract from activity that is practical to realizing [[bodhi|enlightenment]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 72 [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.072.than.html (Thanissaro, 1997)]. For further discussion of the context in which these statements was made, see [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn44/sn44.intro.than.html Thanissaro (2004)].&lt;/ref&gt; and bring about the danger of substituting the experience of liberation by conceptual understanding of the doctrine or by religious faith. According to the Buddha, the Dharma is not an ultimate end in itself or an explanation of all metaphysical reality, but a pragmatic set of teachings. The Buddha used two parables to clarify this point, the 'Parable of the raft' and the [[Parable of the Poisoned Arrow]].&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dharma is like a raft in the sense that it is only a pragmatic tool for attaining nirvana (&quot;for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of holding onto&quot;, MN 22); once one has done this, one can discard the raft. It is also like medicine, in that the particulars of how one was [[Parable of the Poisoned Arrow|injured by a poisoned arrow]] (i.e. metaphysics, etc.) do not matter in the act of removing and curing the arrow wound itself (removing suffering). In this sense, the Buddha was often called 'the great physician' because his goal was to cure the human condition of suffering first and foremost, not to speculate about metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul; Tribe, Anthony; Wynne, Alexander; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, 2011, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having said this, it is still clear that resisting (even refuting) a false or slanted doctrine can be useful to extricate the interlocutor, or oneself, from error; hence, to advance in the way of liberation. Witness the Buddha's confutation of several doctrines by Nigantha Nataputta and other purported sages which sometimes had large followings (e.g., Kula Sutta, Sankha Sutta, Brahmana Sutta). This shows that a virtuous and appropriate use of dialectics can take place. By implication, reasoning and argument shouldn't be disparaged by Buddhists.

After the Buddha's death, some Buddhists such as [[Dharmakirti]] went on to use the sayings of the Buddha as sound evidence equal to perception and inference.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The [[Theravada|Theravāda]] commentary, ascribed to [[Dhammapala]], on the ''[[Nettipakarana|Nettipakaraṇa]]'', says (Pāli ''pamāṇa'' is equivalent to Sanskrit ''pramana''): &quot;''na hi pāḷito aññaṃ pamāṇataraṃ atthi'' (quoted in [[Pāli Text Society]] edition of the Nettipakaraṇa, 1902, p. xi) which Nanamoli translates as: &quot;for there is no other criterion beyond a text&quot; (''The Guide'', Pāli Text Society, 1962, p. xi).}}

===Transcendence===
Another possible reason why the Buddha refused to engage in [[metaphysics]] is that he saw ultimate reality and nirvana as devoid of sensory mediation and conception and therefore language itself is ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' inadequate to explain it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagao&quot;&gt;Gadjin M. Nagao, ''Madhyamika and Yogacara.'' Leslie S. Kawamura, translator, SUNY Press, Albany 1991, pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Buddha's silence does not indicate [[misology]] or disdain for philosophy. Rather, it indicates that he viewed the answers to these questions as not understandable by the unenlightened.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagao&quot;/&gt; [[Pratītyasamutpāda|Dependent arising]] provides a framework for analysis of reality that is not based on metaphysical assumptions regarding existence or non-existence, but instead on direct cognition of phenomena as they are presented to the mind in meditation.

The Buddha of the earliest Buddhists texts describes Dharma (in the sense of &quot;truth&quot;) as &quot;beyond reasoning&quot; or &quot;transcending logic&quot;, in the sense that reasoning is a subjectively introduced aspect of the way unenlightened humans perceive things, and the conceptual framework which underpins their cognitive process, rather than a feature of things as they really are. Going &quot;beyond reasoning&quot; means in this context penetrating the nature of reasoning from the inside, and removing the causes for experiencing any future stress as a result of it, rather than functioning outside the system as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Sue Hamilton, ''Early Buddhism''. Routledge, 2000, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meta-ethics===
{{main|Buddhist ethics}}
The Buddha's ethics are based on the [[soteriological]] need to eliminate suffering and on the premise of the law of [[karma]]. Buddhist ethics have been termed eudaimonic (with their goal being well-being) and also compared to [[virtue ethics]] (this approach began with Damien Keown).&lt;ref&gt;Damien Keown, The Nature of Buddhist Ethics, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Keown writes that Buddhist [[Nirvana]] is analogous to the Aristotelian [[Eudaimonia]], and that Buddhist moral acts and virtues derive their value from how they lead us to or act as an aspect of the nirvanic life.

The Buddha outlined [[five precepts]] (no killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, or drinking alcohol) which were to be followed by his disciples, lay and monastic. There are various reasons the Buddha gave as to why someone should be ethical.

First, the universe is structured in such a way that if someone intentionally commits a misdeed, a bad karmic fruit will be the result (and vice versa). Hence, from a pragmatic point of view, it is best to abstain from these negative actions which bring forth negative results. However, the important word here is ''intentionally'': for the Buddha, karma is nothing else but intention/volition, and hence unintentionally harming someone does not create bad karmic results. Unlike the [[Jains]] who believed that karma was a quasi-physical element, for the Buddha karma was a volitional mental event, what Richard Gombrich calls ‘an ethicised consciousness’.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul; Tribe, Anthony; Wynne, Alexander; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, 2011, pp. 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea leads into the second moral justification of the Buddha: intentionally performing negative actions reinforces and propagates mental defilements which keep persons bound to the cycle of rebirth and interfere with the process of liberation, and hence intentionally performing good karmic actions is participating in mental purification which leads to [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]], the highest happiness. This perspective sees immoral acts as unskillful (''akusala'') in our quest for happiness, and hence it is pragmatic to do good.

The third meta-ethical consideration takes the view of not-self and our natural desire to end our suffering to its logical conclusion. Since there is no self, there is no reason to prefer our own welfare over that of others because there is no ultimate grounding for the differentiation of &quot;my&quot; suffering and someone else's. Instead, an enlightened person would just work to end suffering ''tout court'', without thinking of the conventional concept of persons.&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark. Buddhism as philosophy, 2007, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this argument, anyone who is selfish does so out of ignorance of the true nature of personal identity and irrationality.

==Buddhist schools and Abhidharma==
{{main|Abhidharma}}
The main Indian Buddhist philosophical schools practiced a form of analysis termed ''[[Abhidharma]]'' which sought to systematize the teachings of the early Buddhist discourses (sutras). Abhidharma analysis broke down human experience into momentary phenomenal events or occurrences called &quot;''[[Abhidharma#The dharma theory|dharmas]]''&quot;. Dharmas are impermanent and dependent on other causal factors, they arise and pass as part of a web of other interconnected dharmas, and are never found alone. The Abhidharma schools held that the teachings of the Buddha in the sutras were merely conventional, while the Abhidharma analysis was ultimate truth (paramattha sacca), the way things really are when seen by an enlightened being. The Abhidharmic project has been likened as a form of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] or [[process philosophy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nyanaponika page 35&quot;&gt;Nyanaponika, Abhidhamma studies, page 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronkin, Noa; Early Buddhist metaphysics&lt;/ref&gt; Abhidharma philosophers not only outlined what they believed to be an exhaustive listing of ''dharmas'', or phenomenal events, but also the causal relations between them. In the Abhidharmic analysis, the only thing which is ultimately real is the interplay of dharmas in a causal stream; everything else is merely conceptual (''paññatti'') and nominal.

This view has been termed &quot;[[Mereology|mereological]] reductionism&quot; by Mark Siderits because it holds that only impartite entities are real, not wholes.&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, 105&lt;/ref&gt; Abhidharmikas such as Vasubandhu argued that conventional things (tables, persons, etc.) &quot;disappear under analysis&quot; and that this analysis reveals only a causal stream of phenomenal events and their relations. The mainstream Abhidharmikas defended this view against their main Hindu rivals, the [[Nyaya]] school, who were substance theorists and posited the existence of [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]].&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, 117-118&lt;/ref&gt; Some Abhidharmikas such as the [[Prajñaptivāda]] were also strict [[nominalists]], and held that all things - even dharmas - were merely conceptual.

===Competing Abhidharma schools===
[[File:Nava Jetavana Temple - Shravasti - 014 King Asoka at the Third Council (9241725897).jpg|thumb|Indian Emperor [[Asoka|Aśoka]] and the elder [[Moggaliputta-Tissa]], who is seen as a key thinker of the [[Vibhajyavāda]] tradition (and thus, of [[Theravada]]).]]

An important Abhidhamma work from the [[Theravāda]] school is the [[Kathāvatthu]] (&quot;Points of controversy&quot;), attributed to the Indian scholar-monk [[Moggaliputta-Tissa]] (ca.327–247 BCE). This text is important because it attempts to refute several philosophical views which had developed after the death of the Buddha, especially the theory that 'all exists' (''sarvāstivāda''), the theory of momentariness (''khāṇavāda'') and the personalist view (''[[pudgalavada]]'')&lt;ref name=&quot;Kalupahana, David page 128&quot;&gt;Kalupahana, David; A history of Buddhist philosophy, continuities and discontinuities, page 128.&lt;/ref&gt; These were the major philosophical theories which divided the Buddhist Abhidharma schools in India. After being brought to [[Sri Lanka]] in the first century BCE, the Theravada Pali language Abhidhamma tradition was heavily influenced by the works of [[Buddhaghosa]] (4-5th century AD), the most important philosopher and commentator of the [[Theravada]] school. The Theravada philosophical enterprise was mostly carried out in the genre of [[Atthakatha]], commentaries (as well as [[Subcommentaries, Theravada|sub-commentaries]]) on the Pali Abhidhamma, but also included short summaries and compendiums.

The [[Sarvāstivāda]] was one of the major Buddhist philosophical schools in India, and they were so named because of their belief that dharmas exist in all three times: past, present and future. Though the Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma system began as a mere categorization of mental events, their philosophers and exegetes such as Dharmatrata and Katyāyāniputra (the compiler of the [[Mahavibhasa]], a central text of the school) eventually refined this system into a robust [[Philosophical realism|realism]], which also included a type of [[essentialism]]. This realism was based on a quality of dharmas, which was called [[svabhava]] or 'intrinsic existence'.&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana, David; A History of Buddhist Philosophy: Continuities and Discontinuities, page 128&lt;/ref&gt; Svabhava is a sort of [[essence]], though it is not a completely independent essence, since all dharmas were said to be causally dependent. The Sarvāstivāda system extended this realism across time, effectively positing a type of [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]] with regards to time; hence, the name of their school means &quot;the view that everything exists&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kalupahana, David page 128&quot;/&gt;

Other Buddhist schools such as the Prajñaptivadins ('nominalists'), the Purvasailas and the Vainasikas refused to accept the concept of [[svabhava]].&lt;ref&gt;Shì hùifēng, &quot;Dependent Origination = Emptiness&quot;—Nāgārjuna’s Innovation? An Examination of the Early and Mainstream Sectarian Textual Sources&lt;/ref&gt; The main topic of the [[Tattvasiddhi]] Śāstra by Harivarman (3-4th century AD), an influential Abhidharma text, is the emptiness ([[shunyata]]) of dharmas.&lt;ref&gt;Skilton, Andrew. A Concise History of Buddhism. 2004. pp. 91-92&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buddhaghosa_with_three_copies_of_Visuddhimagga.jpg|thumbnail|[[Buddhaghosa]] (c. 5th century), the most important Abhidharma scholar of [[Theravāda]] Buddhism, presenting three copies of the [[Visuddhimagga]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana, David; A history of Buddhist philosophy, continuities and discontinuities, page 206.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Theravādins and other schools such as the [[Sautrantika|Sautrāntikas]] attacked the realism of the Sarvāstivādins, especially their theory of time. A major figure in this argument was the scholar [[Vasubandhu]], an ex-Sarvāstivādin, who critiqued the theory of all exists and argued for [[philosophical presentism]] in his comprehensive treatise, the [[Abhidharmakosa]]. This work is the major Abhidharma text used in Tibetan and East Asian Buddhism today. The Theravāda also holds that dharmas only exist in the present, and are thus also [[Philosophical presentism|presentists]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams, Paul 2011, page 124&quot;&gt;Williams, Paul; Tribe, Anthony; Wynne, Alexander; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, 2011, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The Theravādin presentation of Abhidharma is also not as concerned with ontology as the Sarvāstivādin view, but is more of a phenomenology&lt;ref name=&quot;Nyanaponika page 35&quot;/&gt; and hence the concept of svabhava for the Theravādins is more of a certain characteristic or dependent feature of a dharma, than any sort of essence or metaphysical grounding. According to [[Y Karunadasa]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the Pali tradition it is only for the sake of definition and description that each dhamma is postulated as if it were a separate entity; but in reality it is by no means a solitary phenomenon having an existence of its own...If this Abhidhammic view of existence, as seen from its doctrine of dhammas, cannot be interpreted as a radical pluralism, neither can it be interpreted as an out-and-out monism. For what are called dhammas -- the component factors of the universe, both within us and outside us -- are not fractions of an absolute unity but a multiplicity of co-ordinate factors. They are not reducible to, nor do they emerge from, a single reality, the fundamental postulate of monistic metaphysics. If they are to be interpreted as phenomena, this should be done with the proviso that they are phenomena with no corresponding [[noumena]], no hidden underlying ground. For they are not manifestations of some mysterious metaphysical substratum, but processes taking place due to the interplay of a multitude of conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Dr. Y. Karunadasa, THE DHAMMA THEORY, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An important theory held by some Sarvāstivādins, Theravādins and Sautrāntikas was the theory of &quot;momentariness&quot; (Skt., kṣāṇavāda, Pali, khāṇavāda). This theory held that dhammas only last for a minute moment (''ksana'') after they arise. The Sarvāstivādins saw these 'moments' in an atomistic way, as the smallest length of time possible (they also developed a material atomism). Reconciling this theory with their eternalism regarding time was a major philosophical project of the [[Sarvāstivāda]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronkin, Noa, &quot;Abhidharma&quot;, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/abhidharma/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The Theravādins initially rejected this theory, as evidenced by the Khaṇikakathā of the [[Kathavatthu]] which attempts to refute the doctrine that &quot;all phenomena (dhamma) are as momentary as a single mental entity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Von Rospatt, Alexander; The Buddhist Doctrine of Momentariness: A Survey of the Origins and Early Phase of This Doctrine up to Vasubandhu, page 18.&lt;/ref&gt; However, momentariness with regards to mental dhammas (but not physical or [[rūpa]] dhammas) was later adopted by the Sri Lankan Theravādins, and it is possible that it was first introduced by the scholar [[Buddhagosa]].&lt;ref&gt;Von Rospatt, Alexander; The Buddhist Doctrine of Momentariness: A Survey of the Origins and Early Phase of This Doctrine up to Vasubandhu, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

All Abhidharma schools also developed complex theories of causation and conditionality to explain how dharmas interacted with each other. Another major philosophical project of the Abhidharma schools was the explanation of [[perception]]. Some schools such as the Sarvastivadins explained perception as a type of phenomenalist realism while others such as the Sautrantikas preferred [[representationalism]] and held that we only perceive objects indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;Ronkin, Noa, &quot;Abhidharma&quot;, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/abhidharma/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The major argument used for this view by the Sautrāntikas was the &quot;time lag argument.&quot; According to Mark Siderits: &quot;The basic idea behind the argument is that since there is always a tiny gap between when the sense comes in contact with the external object and when there is sensory awareness, what we are aware of can't be the external object that the senses were in contact with, since it no longer exists.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, 132&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to the theory of extreme momentariness.

One major philosophical view which was rejected by all the schools mentioned above was the view held by the [[Pudgalavadin]] or 'personalist' schools. They seemed to have held that there was a sort of 'personhood' in some ultimately real sense which was not reducible to the five aggregates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams, Paul 2011, page 124&quot;/&gt; This controversial claim was in contrast to the other Buddhists of the time who held that a personality was a mere conceptual construction (prajñapti) and only conventionally real.

==Indian Mahāyāna philosophy==
{{main|Mahāyāna}}
From about the 1st century BCE, a new textual tradition began to arise in Indian Buddhist thought called [[Mahāyāna]] (Great Vehicle), which would slowly come to dominate Indian Buddhist philosophy. Buddhist philosophy thrived in large monastery-university complexes such as [[Nalanda]] and [[Vikramasila]], which became centres of learning in North India. Mahāyāna philosophers continued the philosophical projects of Abhidharma while at the same time critiquing them and introducing new concepts and ideas. Since the Mahāyāna held to the [[Pragmatism|pragmatic concept of truth]]&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Mahayana Buddhism'', Routledge, 1989, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; which states that doctrines are regarded as conditionally &quot;true&quot; in the sense of being spiritually beneficial, the new theories and practices were seen as 'skillful means' ([[Upaya]]). The Mahayana also promoted the [[Bodhisattva]] ideal, which included an attitude of compassion for all sentient beings. The Bodhisattva is someone who chooses to remain in ''[[Saṃsāra|samsara]]'' (the cycle of birth and death) to benefit all other beings who are suffering.

Major Mahayana philosophical schools and traditions include the [[Prajnaparamita]], [[Madhyamaka]], [[Tathagatagarbha]], the Epistemological school of Dignaga, [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]], [[Huayan school|Huayan]], [[Tiantai]] and the Chan/[[Zen]] schools.

===Prajñāpāramitā and Madhyamaka===
{{main|Madhyamaka}}
[[File:Nagardjuna.jpg|thumb|Nagarjuna, protected by the [[Nāga|Nagas]] snake spirits who are said to be the guardians of the Prajnaparamita sutras.]]
The earliest [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā-sutras]] (1st century BC) emphasize the emptiness ([[Shunyata]]) of phenomena or dhammas. The 'perfection of insight' (Prajñāpāramitā) is said to be true knowledge of the nature of ultimate reality, which is illusory and empty of essence. The ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'' states that: 
{{quote|All conditioned phenomena&lt;br /&gt;
 Are like a dream, an illusion, a bubble, a shadow,&lt;br /&gt;
 Like dew or a flash of lightning;&lt;br /&gt;
 Thus we shall perceive them.”&lt;ref name=&quot;chungtai&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Diamond of Perfect Wisdom Sutra |url=http://ctzen.org/sunnyvale/enUS/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=141&amp;Itemid=57|publisher=Chung Tai Translation Committee|accessdate=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''[[Heart Sutra]]'' famously affirms the emptiness or voidness ([[shunyata]]) of phenomena:
{{quote|&quot;Oh, Sariputra, Form Does not Differ From the Void,&lt;br /&gt;
And the Void Does Not Differ From Form.&lt;br /&gt;
Form is Void and Void is Form;&lt;br /&gt;
The Same is True For Feelings,&lt;br /&gt;
Perceptions, Volitions and Consciousness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/heartstr.htm The Heart Sutra Prajna Paramita Hrydaya Sutra]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Prajñāpāramitā teachings are associated with the work of the Buddhist philosopher [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]] (c. AD 150 – c. 250) and the [[Madhyamaka]] (Middle way) school. Nāgārjuna was one of the most influential Indian Buddhist thinkers; he gave the classical arguments for the empty nature of [[phenomena]] and attacked the Sarvāstivāda and Pudgalavada schools' essentialism in his magnum opus, ''[[Mulamadhyamakakarika|The Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way]]'' (''Mūlamadhyamakakārikā'').&lt;ref&gt;Randall Collins, ''The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change.'' Harvard University Press, 2000, pp. 221–222.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Mūlamadhyamakakārikā'', Nagarjuna relies on [[reductio ad absurdum]] arguments to refute various theories which assume an inherent [[essence]] or &quot;own being&quot; ([[svabhava]]). In this work, he covers topics such as causation, motion, and the sense faculties.&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, pp. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nagarjuna]] asserted a direct connection between, even identity of, [[dependent origination]], selflessness (''[[anatta]]''), and emptiness (''[[śūnyatā]]''). He pointed out that implicit in the early Buddhist concept of dependent origination is the lack of any substantial being (''anatta'') underlying the participants in origination, so that they have no independent existence, a state identified as emptiness (''śūnyatā''), or emptiness of a nature or essence (''[[svabhāva]] sunyam'').

Later philosophers of the Madhyamaka school built upon Nagarjuna's analysis and defended Madhyamaka against their opponents. These included [[Āryadeva]] (3rd century CE), Nāgārjuna's pupil; [[Candrakīrti]] (600–c. 650), who wrote an important commentary on the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā; and [[Shantideva]] (8th century). [[Buddhapālita]] (470–550) has been understood as the originator of the 'prāsaṅgika' approach which is based on critiquing essentialism only through ''reductio ad absurdum'' arguments. He was criticized by [[Bhāvaviveka]] (c. 500 – c. 578), who argued for the use of syllogisms &quot;to set one's own doctrinal stance&quot;. These two approaches were later termed the Prāsaṅgika and the Svātantrika approaches to Madhyamaka by Tibetan philosophers and commentators.

Influenced by the work of [[Dignaga]], [[Bhāvaviveka]]'s Madhyamika philosophy makes use of Buddhist epistemology. [[Candrakīrti]], on the other hand, critiqued Bhāvaviveka's adoption of the epistemological (''[[pramana]]'') tradition on the grounds that it contained a subtle essentialism. He quotes Nagarjuna's famous statement in the ''Vigrahavyavartani'' which says &quot;I have no thesis&quot; for his rejection of positive epistemic Madhyamaka statements.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, Jay; Edelglass, William; The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; [[Candrakīrti]] held that a true Madhyamika could only use &quot;consequence&quot; (''[[Prasaṅgika|prasanga]]''), in which one points out the inconsistencies of their opponent's position without asserting an &quot;autonomous inference&quot; (''[[Svatantrika|svatantra]]''), for no such inference can be ultimately true from the point of view of Madhyamaka.

In China, the Madhyamaka school (known as [[East Asian Mādhyamaka|Sānlùn]]) was founded by [[Kumārajīva]] (344–413 CE), who translated the works of Nagarjuna to Chinese. Other Chinese Madhymakas include [[Kumārajīva]] 's pupil [[Sengzhao]], [[Jizang]] (549–623), who wrote over 50 works on Madhyamaka, and [[Hyegwan]], a Korean monk who brought Madhyamaka teachings to Japan.

===Yogācāra===
{{main|Yogācāra}}
[[File:Seshin Vasubandhu Kofukuji.jpg|thumbnail|[[Vasubandhu]]  wrote in defense of Vijñapti-matra (appearance only) as well as writing a massive work on [[Abhidharma]], the [[Abhidharmakosa]].]]
The [[Yogācāra|Yogācāra school]] (''Yoga practice'') was a Buddhist philosophical tradition which arose in between the 2nd century CE and the 4th century CE and is associated with the philosophers [[Asanga]] and [[Vasubandhu]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Siderits, Mark pp 147&quot;&gt;Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, pp 147&lt;/ref&gt; and with various sutras such as the [[Sandhinirmocana Sutra]] and the [[Lankavatara Sutra]]. The central feature of Yogācāra thought is the concept of ''Vijñapti-mātra'', often translated as &quot;impressions only&quot; or &quot;appearance only&quot; and this has been interpreted as a form of [[Idealism]] or as a form of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]]. Other names for the Yogacara school are 'Vijñanavada' (the doctrine of consciousness) and 'Cittamatra' (mind-only).&lt;ref name=&quot;Siderits, Mark pp 147&quot;/&gt;

Yogacara thinkers like [[Vasubandhu]] argued against the existence of external objects by pointing out that we only ever have access to our own mental impressions, and hence our inference of the existence of external objects is based on faulty logic. Vasubandhu's ''Vijnaptimatratasiddhi'', or &quot;The Proof that There Are Only Impressions&quot; (20 verses), begins thus:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I. This [world] is nothing but impressions, since it manifests itself as an unreal object, 
Just like the case of those with cataracts seeing unreal hairs in the moon and the like.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Siderits, Mark pp 149&quot;&gt;Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, pp 149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to [[Vasubandhu]] then, all our experiences are like seeing hairs on the moon when we have cataracts, that is, we project our mental images into something &quot;out there&quot; when there are no such things. Vasubandhu then goes on to use the [[dream argument]] to argue that mental impressions do not require external objects to (1) seem to be spatio-temporally located, (2) to seem to have an inter-subjective quality, and (3) to seem to operate by causal laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;Siderits, Mark pp 149&quot; /&gt; The fact that purely mental events can have causal efficacy and be [[Intersubjectivity|intersubjective]] is proved by the event of a [[wet dream]] and by the mass or shared [[hallucinations]] created by the karma of certain types of beings.&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, pp 156&lt;/ref&gt;

After having argued that impressions-only is a theory which can explain our everyday experience, Vasubandhu then appeals to [[wikt:Parsimony|parsimony]] - since we do not need the concept of external objects to explain reality, then we can do away with those superfluous concepts altogether as they are most likely just mentally superimposed on our concepts of reality by the mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Siderits, Mark pp 158&quot;&gt;Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, pp 158&lt;/ref&gt; Inter-subjective reality for Vasubandhu is then the causal interaction between various [[Mindstream|mental streams]] and their [[karma]], and does not include any external physical objects. The soteriological importance of this theory is that, by removing the concept of an external world, it also weakens the 'internal' sense of self as observer which is supposed to be separate from the external world. To dissolve the dualism of inner and outer is also to dissolve the sense of self and other. The later Yogacara commentator [[Sthiramati]] explains this thus:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;There is a grasper if there is something to be grasped, but not in the absence of what is to be grasped. Where there is no thing to be grasped, the absence of a grasper also follows, there is not just the absence of the thing to be grasped. Thus there arises the extra-mundane non-conceptual cognition that is alike without object and without cognizer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, pp. 176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Vasubandhu also attacked the realist theories of [[Buddhist atomism]] and the Abhidharma theory of [[svabhava]]. He argued that atoms as conceived by the atomists (un-divisible entities) would not be able to come together to form larger aggregate entities, and hence that they were illogical concepts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Siderits, Mark pp 158&quot;/&gt;

Later Yogacara thinkers include [[Dharmapala of Nalanda]], Sthiramati, [[Chandragomin]] (who debated Candrakirti), and [[Śīlabhadra]]. Yogacarins such as [[Paramartha]] and [[Guṇabhadra]] brought the school to China and translated Yogacara works there, where it is known as [[East Asian Yogācāra|Wéishí-zōng or Fǎxiàng-zōng]]. An important contribution to East Asian Yogācāra is [[Xuanzang]]'s ''Cheng Weishi Lun'', or &quot;Discourse on the Establishment of Consciousness Only&quot;.

===Yogācāra-Mādhyamika synthesis===
[[Jñānagarbha]] (8th century) and his student [[Śāntarakṣita]] (725–788) brought together Yogacara, Madhyamaka and the Dignaga school of epistemology into a philosophical synthesis known as the ''Yogācāra-Svatantrika-Mādhyamika''. Śāntarakṣita was also instrumental in the introduction of Buddhism and the Sarvastivadin monastic ordination lineage to Tibet, which was conducted at Samye. [[Śāntarakṣita]]'s disciples included [[Haribhadra (Buddhist philosopher)|Haribhadra]] and [[Kamalaśīla]]. This philosophical tradition is influential in Tibetan Buddhist thought.

===Tathagatagarbha===
{{main|Tathagatagarbha}}

The ''[[Tathagatagarbha|tathāgathagarbha sutras]]'', in a departure from mainstream Buddhist language, insist that the potential for awakening is inherent to every sentient being. They marked a shift from a largely apophatic (negative) philosophical trend within Buddhism to a decidedly more [[cataphatic]] (positive) modus.

Prior to the period of these scriptures, Mahāyāna [[metaphysics]] had been dominated by teachings on [[emptiness]] in the form of [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy. The language used by this approach is primarily negative, and the ''tathāgatagarbha'' genre of sutras can be seen as an attempt to state orthodox Buddhist teachings of [[dependent origination]] using positive language instead, to prevent people from being turned away from Buddhism by a false impression of nihilism.

In these sutras, the perfection of the wisdom of not-self is stated to be the true self; the ultimate goal of the path is then characterized using a range of positive language that had been used previously in Indian philosophy by essentialist philosophers, but which was now transmuted into a new Buddhist vocabulary to describe a being who has successfully completed the Buddhist path.&lt;ref&gt;Sallie B. King (1997),[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927131119/http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/nlarc/pdf/Pruning%20the%20bodhi%20tree/Pruning%209.pdf  ''The Doctrine of Buddha Nature is Impeccably Buddhist'']. In: Jamie Hubbard (ed.), Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism, Univ of Hawaii Press 1997, pp. 174–192. {{ISBN|0824819497}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word &quot;self&quot; (''atman'') is used in a way idiosyncratic to these sutras; the &quot;true self&quot; is described as the perfection of the wisdom of [[anatta|not-self]] in the ''Buddha-Nature Treatise'', for example.&lt;ref name=&quot;nanzan-u.ac.jp&quot; /&gt; Language that had previously been used by essentialist non-Buddhist philosophers was now adopted, with new definitions, by Buddhists to promote orthodox teachings.

The ''tathāgatagarbha'' does not, according to some scholars, represent a substantial self; rather, it is a positive language expression of [[sunyata|emptiness]] and represents the potentiality to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist practices. In this interpretation, the intention of the teaching of ''tathāgatagarbha'' is [[soteriology|soteriological]] rather than theoretical.&lt;ref name=&quot;nanzan-u.ac.jp&quot;&gt;Sallie B. King (1997),[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927131119/http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/nlarc/pdf/Pruning%20the%20bodhi%20tree/Pruning%209.pdf  ''The Doctrine of Buddha Nature is Impeccably Buddhist'']. In: Jamie Hubbard (ed.), Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism, Univ of Hawaii Press 1997, pp. 174–192. {{ISBN|0824819497}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heng-Ching Shih, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130807082256/http://budsas.org/ebud/ebdha191.htm The Significance Of 'Tathagatagarbha' -- A Positive Expression Of 'Sunyata']&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Tathagatagarbha|tathāgathagarbha]]'', the [[Theravada|Theravāda]] doctrine of ''[[bhavanga|bhavaṅga]]'', and the [[Yogachara|Yogācāra]] [[store consciousness]] were all identified at some point with the [[luminous mind]] of the Nikāyas.

In the Mahayana ''[[Mahaparinirvana Sutra]]'', the Buddha insists that while pondering upon Dharma is vital, one must then relinquish fixation on words and letters, as these are utterly divorced from liberation and the [[Buddha-nature]].

==The Dignāga school of Pramāṇa==
[[File:Dignaga.jpg|180 × 240px|thumbnail|Dignāga in formal debating stance]]
{{main|Buddhist logico-epistemology}}
[[Dignāga]] (c. 480–540) and [[Dharmakīrti]] (c. 6-7th century) were Buddhist philosophers who developed a system of epistemology ([[pramana]]) and [[Buddhist logic|logic]] in their debates with the Brahminical philosophers in order to defend Buddhist doctrine. This tradition is called &quot;those who follow reasoning&quot; ([[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]]: ''rigs pa rjes su ‘brang ba''); in modern literature it is sometimes known by the Sanskrit '''pramāṇavāda''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', or &quot;the Epistemological School.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tillemans, Tom, &quot;Dharmakīrti&quot;, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/dharmakiirti/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; They were associated with the [[Yogacara]] and [[Sautrantika]] schools, and defended theories held by both of these schools.&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark, Buddhism as philosophy, page 208-209&lt;/ref&gt; Dignaga's influence was profound and led to an &quot;epistemological turn&quot; among all Buddhist and also all Sanskrit language philosophers in India after his death. In the centuries following Dignaga's work, Sanskrit philosophers became much more focused on defending all of their propositions with fully developed theories of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence J. McCrea, and Parimal G. Patil. Buddhist Philosophy of Language in India: Jnanasrimitra on Exclusion. New York: Columbia University Press, 2010. p 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;School of Dignāga&quot; includes later philosophers and commentators like Santabhadra, [[Dharmottara]] (8th century), [[Jñanasrimitra]] (975–1025), [[Ratnakīrti]] (11th century) and Samkarananda. The [[epistemology]] they developed defends the view that there are only two 'instruments of knowledge' or 'valid cognitions' (''pramana''): &quot;perception&quot; ([[Pramana#Hinduism|pratyaksa]]) and &quot;inference&quot; ([[anumāṇa]]). Perception is a non-conceptual awareness of particulars which is bound by causality, while inference is reasonable, linguistic and conceptual.&lt;ref name=tillemanssep&gt;Tom Tillemans (2011), [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dharmakiirti/ Dharmakirti], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

These Buddhist philosophers argued in favor of the theory of momentariness, the Yogacara &quot;awareness only&quot; view, the reality of particulars (svalakṣaṇa), atomism, nominalism and the self-reflexive nature of consciousness ([[svasaṃvedana]]). They attacked Hindu theories of God ([[Ishvara|Isvara]]), universals, the authority of the Vedas, and the existence of a permanent soul (''atman'').

==Tantra==
The tradition associated with a group of texts known as the [[Buddhist Tantras]], known as [[Vajrayana]], developed by the eighth century in North India. By this time Tantra was a key feature of Indian Buddhism, and Indian Tantric scholars developed philosophical defenses, [[hermeneutics]] and explanations of the Buddhist tantric systems, especially through commentaries on key tantras such as the [[Guhyasamāja Tantra]] and the [[Guhyagarbha Tantra]].

While the view of the Vajrayana was based on [[Madhyamaka]], [[Yogacara]] and [[Buddha-nature]] theories,&lt;ref&gt;Wayman, Alex; The Buddhist Tantras: Light on Indo-Tibetan Esotericism, 2013, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Snellgrove, David. (1987) Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: Indian Buddhists and their Tibetan successors. pp 125.&lt;/ref&gt; it saw itself as being a faster vehicle to liberation containing many skillful methods ([[upaya]]) of tantric ritual. The need for an explication and defense of the Tantras arose out of the unusual nature of the rituals associated with them, which included the use of secret [[mantras]], alcohol, [[Karmamudrā|sexual yoga]], complex visualizations of [[mandalas]] filled with [[wrathful deities]] and other practices and injunctions which were discordant with or at least novel in comparison to traditional Buddhist thought. The Guhyasamāja Tantra, for example, states: &quot;you should kill living beings, speak lying words, take things that are not given and have sex with many women&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Damien Keown, Charles S. Prebish (editors) Encyclopedia of Buddhism, Guhyasamaja tantra and Guhyagarbha tantra&lt;/ref&gt; Other features of tantra included a focus on the physical body as the means to liberation and a reaffirmation of feminine elements, feminine deities and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Bibhuti Baruah; Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism, pp. 154-162&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense of these practices is based on the theory of transformation which states that negative mental factors and physical actions can be cultivated and transformed in a ritual setting. The [[Hevajra tantra]] states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those things by which evil men are bound, others turn into means and gain thereby release from the bonds of existence. By passion the world is bound, by passion too it is released, but by heretical Buddhists this practice of reversals is not known.&lt;ref&gt;Snellgrove, David. (1987) Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: Indian Buddhists and their Tibetan successors. pp 125-126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another hermeneutic of Buddhist Tantric commentaries such as the [[Vimalaprabha]] of Pundarika (a commentary on the Kalacakra Tantra) is one of interpreting taboo or unethical statements in the Tantras as metaphorical statements about tantric practice. For example, in the Vimalaprabha, &quot;killing living beings&quot; refers to stopping the [[prana]] at the top of the head. In the Tantric Candrakirti's ''Pradipoddyotana'', a commentary to the Guhyasamaja Tantra, killing living beings is glossed as &quot;making them void&quot; by means of a &quot;special [[samadhi]]&quot; which according to Bus-ton is associated with [[completion stage]] tantric practice.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, Donald (editor); Buddhist Hermeneutics, page 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas Duckworth notes that Vajrayana philosophical outlook is one of embodiment, which sees the physical and cosmological body as already containing wisdom and divinity. Liberation ([[nirvana]]) and [[Buddhahood]] are not seen as something outside or an event in the future, but as imminently present and accessible right now through unique tantric practices like [[deity yoga]], and hence Vajrayana is also called the &quot;resultant vehicle&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Duckworth, Douglas; Tibetan Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna in &quot;A companion to Buddhist philosophy&quot;, page 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Duckworth names the philosophical view of Vajrayana as a form of [[pantheism]], by which he means the belief that every existing entity is in some sense divine and that all things express some form of unity.&lt;ref&gt;Duckworth, Douglas; Tibetan Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna in &quot;A companion to Buddhist philosophy&quot;, page 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Major Indian Tantric Buddhist philosophers such as [[Buddhaguhya]], Padmavajra (author of the ''Guhyasiddhi''), Nagarjuna (7th-century disciple of [[Saraha]]), [[Indrabhuti]] (author of the ''Jñānasiddhi''), Anangavajra, Dombiheruka, Durjayacandra, [[Ratnākaraśānti]] and [[Abhayakaragupta]] wrote tantric texts and commentaries systematizing the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman (ed.), Davidson (ed.); Tibetan Buddhism: Reason and Revelation, page 109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharyya, Benoytosh; An Introduction to Buddhist Esoterism, pp. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as [[Vajrabodhi]] and [[Śubhakarasiṃha]] brought Tantra to Tang China (716 to 720), and tantric philosophy continued to be developed in Chinese and Japanese by thinkers such as [[Yi Xing]] and [[Kūkai]]. In [[Tibet]], philosophers such as [[Sakya Pandita]] (1182-28 – 1251), [[Longchenpa]] (1308–1364) and [[Tsongkhapa]] (1357–1419) continued the tradition of Buddhist Tantric philosophy in Tibetan.

==Tibetan Buddhist philosophy==
{{main|Tibetan Buddhism}}
Tibetan Buddhist philosophy is mainly a continuation and refinement of the Indian traditions of Madhyamaka, Yogacara and the Dignaga-Dharmakīrti school of epistemology or &quot;reliable cognition&quot; (Sanskrit: ''[[pramana]]'', Tib. ''tshad ma''). The initial efforts of [[Śāntarakṣita]] and [[Kamalaśīla]] brought their eclectic scholarly tradition to Tibet. Other influences include Buddhist Tantras and the Buddha nature texts.

The initial work of early Tibetan Buddhist philosophers was in translation of classical Indian philosophical treatises and the writing of commentaries. This initial period is from the 8th to the 10th century. Early Tibetan commentator philosophers were heavily influenced by the work of [[Dharmakirti]] and these include Ngok Lo-dza-wa (1059-1109) and Cha-ba (1182-1251). Their works are now lost.&lt;ref&gt;Dreyfus, Georges B. J. Recognizing Reality: Dharmakirti's Philosophy and Its Tibetan Interpretations (Suny Series in Buddhist Studies), 1997, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The 12th and 13th centuries saw the translation of the works of [[Chandrakirti]], the promulgation of his views in Tibet by scholars such as [[Patsab Nyima Drakpa]], Kanakavarman&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, Donald; A study of Svatantrika, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; and Jayananda (12th century) and the development of the Tibetan debate between the [[prasangika]] and [[svatantrika]] views which continues to this day among Tibetan Buddhist schools.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, Jay; Edelglass, William; The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; The main disagreement between these views is the use of reasoned argument. For [[Śāntarakṣita]], [[Kamalaśīla]] and their defenders, reason is useful in establishing arguments that lead one to a correct understanding of emptiness, then, through the use of meditation, one can reach non-conceptual [[gnosis]] that does not rely on reason. For Chandrakirti, however, this is wrong, because meditation on emptiness cannot possibly involve any object. Reason's role here is to negate any essence or essentialist views, and then eventually negate itself along with any [[Conceptual proliferation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Garfield, Jay p. 217&quot;&gt;Garfield, Jay; Edelglass, William; The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various Tibetan Buddhist schools or monastic orders. According to Georges B.J. Dreyfus, within Tibetan thought, the [[Sakya]] school holds a mostly [[anti-realist]] philosophical position, while the [[Gelug]] school tends to defend a form of [[Philosophical realism|realism]]. The [[Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] schools also tend to follow Sakya anti-realism (with some differences).&lt;ref name=&quot;Dreyfus, Georges B. J 1997, page 2&quot;&gt;Dreyfus, Georges B. J. Recognizing Reality: Dharmakirti's Philosophy and Its Tibetan Interpretations (Suny Series in Buddhist Studies), 1997, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shengtong and Buddha nature===
The 14th century saw increasing interest in the [[Buddha nature]] texts and doctrines. This can be seen in the work of the third Kagyu Karmapa [[Rangjung Dorje]] (1284-1339), especially his treatise &quot;Profound Inner Meaning&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garfield, Jay p. 256&quot;&gt;Garfield, Jay; Edelglass, William; The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; This treatise describes ultimate nature or [[suchness]] as Buddha nature which is the basis for nirvana and samsara, radiant in nature and empty in essence, surpassing thought.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garfield, Jay p. 256&quot;/&gt;

[[Dolpopa]] (''Dol-bo-ba'', 1292–1361), founder of the [[Jonang]] school, developed a view called [[shentong]] (Wylie: gzhan {{nat|stong}}) (other empty), which is closely tied to [[Yogacara]] and Buddha-nature theories. This view holds that the qualities of Buddhahood or [[Buddha nature]] are already present in the mind, and that it is empty of all conventional reality which occludes its own nature as Buddhahood or [[Dharmakaya]]. According to Dolpopa, all beings are said to have Buddha nature, which is real, unchanging, permanent, non-conditioned, eternal, blissful and compassionate. Dolpopa's shentong view taught that ultimate reality was truly a &quot;Great Self&quot; or &quot;Supreme Self&quot; referring to works such as the ''[[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]]'', the ''[[Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra]]'' and the ''[[Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra]].''&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Jeffrey, ''Mountain Doctrine'', 2006 passim&lt;/ref&gt; This view had an influence on philosophers of other schools, such as [[Nyingma]] and [[Kagyu]] thinkers, and was also widely criticized in some circles as being similar to the Hindu notions of [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]].&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, Jay; Edelglass, William; The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; The Shentong philosophy was also expounded in Tibet and Mongolia by the later Jonang scholar [[Tāranātha]] (1575–1634).

In the late 17th century, the Jonang order and its teachings came under attack by the [[5th Dalai Lama]], who converted the majority of their monasteries in [[Tibet]] to the [[Gelug]] order, although several survived in secret.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stearns&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stearns|first1=Cyrus|title=The Buddha from Dolpo : a study of the life and thought of the Tibetan master Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen|date=2002|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|location=Delhi|isbn=978-8120818330}}, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gelug===
[[File:Tsongkapa, thangka from Tibet in the 15th-century, painting on cloth - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Tsongkapa, 15th-century painting, [[Rubin Museum of Art]] ]]
[[Je Tsongkhapa]] (Dzong-ka-ba) (1357–1419) founded the [[Gelug]] school of Tibetan Buddhism, which came to dominate the country through the office of the [[Dalai Lama]] and is the major defender of the [[Prasaṅgika]] Madhyamaka view. His work is influenced by the philosophy of [[Candrakirti]] and [[Dharmakirti]]. Tsongkhapa's magnum opus is ''The Ocean of Reasoning'', a Commentary on Nagarjuna's [[Mulamadhyamakakarika]]. Gelug philosophy is based upon study of Madhyamaka texts and Tsongkhapa's works as well as formal debate (rtsod pa).

Tsongkhapa defended Prasangika [[Madhyamaka]] as the highest view and critiqued the [[Svatantrika]]. Tsongkhapa argued that, because the Svatantrika conventionally establish things by their own characteristics, they fail to completely understand the [[Shunyata|emptiness]] of phenomena and hence do not achieve the same realization.&lt;ref&gt;Shantarakshita and Ju Mipham (2005) The Adornment of the Middle Way Padmakara Translation, pp. 21-24&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on Chandrakirti, Tsongkhapa rejected the Yogacara teachings, even as a provisional stepping point to the Madhyamaka view.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garfield, Jay p. 217&quot;/&gt; Tsongkhapa was also critical of the Shengtong view of Dolpopa, which he saw as dangerously absolutist and hence outside the middle way. Tsongkhapa identified two major flaws in interpretations of Madhyamika, under-negation (of [[svabhava]] or own essence), which could lead to Absolutism, and over-negation, which could lead to Nihilism. Tsongkhapa's solution to this dilemma was the promotion of the use of inferential reasoning only within the conventional realm of the [[two truths]] framework, allowing for the use of reason for ethics, conventional monastic rules and promoting a conventional epistemic realism &lt;ref&gt;Garfield, Jay; Edelglass, William; The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;, while holding that, from the view of ultimate truth (''paramarthika satya''), all things (including [[Buddha nature]] and [[Nirvana]]) are empty of inherent existence ([[svabhava]]), and that true enlightenment is this realization of emptiness.

Sakya scholars such as Rongtön and [[Gorampa]] disagreed with Tsongkhapa, and argued that the prasangika svatantrika distinction was merely pedagogical. Gorampa also critiqued Tsongkhapa's realism, arguing that the structures which allow an empty object to be presented as conventionally real eventually dissolve under analysis and are thus unstructured and non-conceptual (spros bral). Tsongkhapa's students Gyel-tsap, Kay-drup, and Ge-dun-drup set forth an epistemological realism against the Sakya scholars' anti-realism.

===Sakya===
[[Sakya Pandita]] (1182–1251) was a 13th-century head of the [[Sakya]] school and ruler of Tibet. He was also one of the most important Buddhist philosophers in the Tibetan tradition, writing works on logic and epistemology and promoting [[Dharmakirti]]'s ''[[Pramanavarttika]]'' (Commentary on Valid Cognition) as central to scholastic study. Sakya Pandita's 'Treasury of Logic on Valid Cognition' (''Tshad ma rigs pa'i gter'') set forth the classic Sakya epistemic anti-realist position, arguing that concepts such as [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] are not known through valid cognition and hence are not real objects of knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dreyfus, Georges B. J 1997, page 2&quot;/&gt; Sakya Pandita was also critical of theories of sudden enlightenment, which were held by some teachers of the &quot;Chinese Great Perfection&quot; in Tibet.

Later Sakyas such as [[Gorampa]] (1429–1489) and [[Sakya Chokden]] (1428–1507) would develop and defend Sakya anti-realism, and they are seen as the major interpreters and critics of Sakya Pandita's philosophy. [[Sakya Chokden]] also critiqued Tsongkhapa's interpretation of Madhyamaka and Dolpopa's Shentong. In his ''Definite ascertainment of the middle way'', Chokden criticized Tsongkhapa's view as being too logo-centric and still caught up in conceptualization about the ultimate reality which is beyond language.&lt;ref&gt;Leaman, Oliver [ed.]; Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy; Sakya Chokden&lt;/ref&gt; Sakya Chokden's philosophy attempted to reconcile the views of the Yogacara and Madhyamaka, seeing them both as valid and complementary perspectives on ultimate truth. Madhyamaka is seen by Chokden as removing the fault of taking the unreal as being real, and Yogacara removes the fault of the denial of Reality.&lt;ref&gt;Hookham, SK. The Buddha Within: Tathagatagarbha Doctrine According to the Shentong Interpretation of the Ratnagotravibhaga, SUNY pres, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the Shentong and Rangtong views are seen as complementary by Sakya Chokden; Rangtong negation is effective in cutting through all clinging to wrong views and conceptual rectification, while Shentong is more amenable for describing and enhancing meditative experience and realization.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl; Luminous Heart: The Third Karmapa on Consciousness, Wisdom, and Buddha Nature, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, for Sakya Chokden, the same realization of ultimate reality can be accessed and described in two different but compatible ways.

===Nyingma and Rimé===
[[File:MiphamNew.jpg|thumb|Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso.]]
The Nyingma school is strongly influenced by the view of [[Dzogchen]] (Great Perfection) and the Dzogchen Tantric literature. [[Longchenpa]] (1308–1364) was a major philosopher of the [[Nyingma]] school and wrote an extensive number of works on the Tibetan practice of [[Dzogchen]] and on Buddhist [[Tantra]]. These include the ''[[Seven Treasuries|Seven Treasures]]'', the ''[[Trilogy of Natural Ease]]'', and his ''[[Trilogy of Dispelling Darkness]]''. Longchenpa's works provide a philosophical understanding of Dzogchen, a defense of Dzogchen in light of the sutras, as well as practical instructions.&lt;ref&gt;D. Germano, The Tantric Philosophical Prose and Poetry of Longchenpa, Religion and the Literary in Tibet, AAR, 7 November 2012, https://tiblit.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/germano_aartiblit2012_combined.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; For Longchenpa, the ground of reality is luminous clarity, [[rigpa]], or [[Buddha nature]], and this ground is also the bridge between sutra and [[tantra]].&lt;ref&gt;Duckworth, Douglas, Jamgon Mipam his life and teachings, pp 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Longchenpa's philosophy sought to establish the positive aspects of Buddha nature thought against the totally negative theology of Madhyamika without straying into the absolutism of Dolpopa. For Longchenpa, the basis for Dzogchen and Tantric practice in Vajrayana is the &quot;Ground&quot; (''gzhi''), the immanent Buddha nature, &quot;the primordially luminous reality that is unconditioned and spontaneously present&quot; which is &quot;free from all elaborated extremes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, Jay; Edelglass, William; The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy, pp. 256–257&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century saw the rise of the [[Rimé movement]] (non-sectarian, unbiased) which sought to push back against the politically dominant Gelug school's criticisms of the Sakya, Kagyu, Nyingma and [[Bon]] philosophical views, and develop a more eclectic or universal system of textual study. [[Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo]] (1820-1892) and [[Jamgön Kongtrül]] (1813-1899) were the founders of Rimé. The Rimé movement came to prominence at a point in Tibetan history when the religious climate had become partisan.&lt;ref name=GKLT-I&gt;Callahan, Elizabeth (2007).

Introduction, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the movement was &quot;a push towards a middle ground where the various views and styles of the different traditions were appreciated for their individual contributions rather than being refuted, marginalized, or banned.&quot;&lt;ref name=GKLT-I/&gt; Philosophically, [[Jamgön Kongtrül]] defended [[Shentong]] as being compatible with Madhyamaka while another Rimé scholar [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso]] (1846–1912) criticized Tsongkhapa from a [[Nyingma]] perspective. Mipham argued that the view of the middle way is Unity (zung 'jug), meaning that from the ultimate perspective the duality of sentient beings and Buddhas is also dissolved. Mipham also affirmed the view of ''rangtong'' (self emptiness).&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel, Steven M. (Ed.); A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; The later Nyingma scholar Botrul (1894–1959) classified the major Tibetan Madhyamaka positions as shentong (other emptiness), Nyingma rangtong (self emptiness) and Gelug bdentong (emptiness of true existence). The main difference between them is their &quot;object of negation&quot;; shengtong states that inauthentic experience is empty, rangtong negates any conceptual reference and bdentong negates any true existence.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel, Steven M. (Ed.); A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[14th Dalai Lama]] was also influenced by this eclectic approach. Having studied under teachers from all major Tibetan Buddhist schools, his philosophical position tends to be that the different perspectives on emptiness are complementary:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a tradition of making a distinction between two different perspectives on the nature of emptiness: one is when emptiness is presented within a philosophical analysis of the ultimate reality of things, in which case it ought to be understood in terms of a non-affirming negative phenomena. On the other hand, when it is discussed from the point of view of experience, it should be understood more in terms of an affirming negation – 14th Dalai Lama&lt;ref&gt;The 14th Dalai Lama, Dzogchen: The Heart Essence of the Great Perfection, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Sramana Zhiyi.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|Painting of Śramaṇa [[Zhiyi]] of the Tiantai school.]]

===Tiantai===

{{main|Tiantai}}

The schools of Buddhism that had existed in China prior to the emergence of the Tiantai are generally believed to represent direct transplantations from India, with little modification to their basic doctrines and methods. The Tiantai school, founded by [[Zhiyi]] (538–597),&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;JeeLoo Liu, Tian-tai Metaphysics vs. Hua-yan Metaphysics A Comparative Study&lt;/ref&gt; was the first truly unique Chinese Buddhist philosophical school. The doctrine of Tiantai was based on the [[ekayana]] or &quot;one vehicle&quot; doctrine taught in the [[Lotus sutra]] and sought to bring together all Buddhist teachings and texts into a comprehensively inclusive hierarchical system, which placed the Lotus sutra at the top of this hierarchy.

Tiantai's metaphysics is an immanent [[holism]], which sees every phenomenon, moment or event as conditioned and manifested by the whole of reality. Every instant of experience is a reflection of every other, and hence, suffering and nirvana, good and bad, Buddhahood and evildoing, are all &quot;inherently entailed&quot; within each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;plato.stanford.edu&quot;&gt;Ziporyn, Brook, &quot;Tiantai Buddhism&quot;, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/buddhism-tiantai/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Each moment of consciousness is simply the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] itself, infinitely immanent and self reflecting.

This metaphysics is entailed in the Tiantai teaching of the &quot;three truths&quot;, which is an extension of the Mādhyamaka [[two truths]] doctrine. The three truths are: the conventional truth of appearance, the truth of emptiness ([[shunyata]]) and the third truth of 'the exclusive Center' (但中 ''danzhong'') or middle way, which is beyond conventional truth and emptiness. This third truth is the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] and expressed by the claim that nothing is &quot;Neither-Same-Nor-Different&quot; than anything else, but rather each 'thing' is the absolute totality of all things manifesting as a particular, everything is mutually contained within each thing. Everything is a reflection of 'The Ultimate Reality of All Appearances'(諸法實相 zhufashixiang) and each thought &quot;contains three thousand worlds&quot;. This perspective allows the Tiantai school to state such seemingly paradoxical things as &quot;evil is ineradicable from the highest good, [[Buddhahood]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;plato.stanford.edu&quot;/&gt; Moreover, in Tiantai, nirvana and samsara are ultimately the same; as Zhiyi writes, &quot;A single, unalloyed reality is all there is – no entities whatever exist outside of it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Though Zhiyi did write &quot;One thought contains three thousand worlds&quot;, this does not entail idealism. According to Zhiyi, &quot;The objects of the [true] aspects of reality are not something produced by Buddhas, gods, or men. They exist inherently on their own and have no beginning&quot; (The Esoteric Meaning, 210). This is then a form of realism, which sees the mind as real as the world, interconnected with and inseparable from it.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; In Tiantai thought, ultimate reality is simply the phenomenal world of interconnected events or dharmas.

Other key figures of Tiantai thought are [[Zhanran]] (711–782) and [[Siming Zhili]] (960–1028). Zhanran developed the idea that non-sentient beings have [[Buddha nature]], since they are also a reflection of the Absolute. In Japan, this school was known as [[Tendai]] and was first brought to the island by [[Saicho]].

===Huayan===

[[File:Indrasnet.jpg|thumb|right|230px|A 3D rendering of [[Indra's net]].]]
{{main|Huayan school}}

The [[Huayan school|Huayan]] developed the doctrine of &quot;interpenetration&quot; or &quot;coalescence&quot; (Wylie: ''zung-'jug''; Sanskrit: ''yuganaddha''),&lt;ref&gt;Neville, Robert C. (1987).[http://buddhism.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/neville.htm New metaphysics for eternal experience], Journal of Chinese Philosophy 14, 357-370&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/zung_'jug&lt;/ref&gt; based on the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avataṃsaka Sūtra]]'' (Flower Garland sutra), a Mahāyāna scripture. Huayan holds that all phenomena (Sanskrit: ''[[dharmas]]'') are deeply interconnected, mutually arising and that every phenomenon contains all other phenomena. Various metaphors and images are used to illustrate this idea. The first is known as [[Indra's net]]. The net is set with jewels which have the extraordinary property that they reflect all of the other jewels, while the reflections also contain every other reflection, ad infinitum. The second image is that of the world text. This image portrays the world as consisting of an enormous text which is as large as the universe itself. The words of the text are composed of the phenomena that make up the world. However, every atom of the world contains the whole text within it. It is the work of a Buddha to let out the text so that beings can be liberated from suffering.

[[Fazang]] (Fa-tsang, 643–712), one of the most important Huayan thinkers, wrote 'Essay on the Golden Lion' and 'Treatise on the Five Teachings', which contain other metaphors for the interpenetration of reality. He also used the metaphor of a [[House of mirrors]]. Fazang introduced the distinction of &quot;the Realm of Principle&quot; and &quot;the Realm of Things&quot;. This theory was further developed by [[Chengguan (monk)|Cheng-guan]] (738–839) into the major Huayan thesis of &quot;the fourfold [[Dharmadhatu]]&quot; (dharma realm): the Realm of Principle, the Realm of Things, the Realm of the Noninterference between Principle and Things, and the Realm of the Noninterference of All Things.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; The first two are the universal and the particular, the third is the interpenetration of universal and particular, and the fourth is the interpenetration of all particulars. The third truth was explained by the metaphor of a golden lion: the gold is the universal and the particular is the shape and features of the lion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taigen Dan Leighton 2006&quot;&gt;Taigen Dan Leighton, Huayan Buddhism and the Phenomenal Universe of the Flower Ornament Sutra, &quot;Buddhadharma&quot; magazine (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
While both Tiantai and Huayan hold to the interpenetration and interconnection of all things, their metaphysics have some differences. Huayan metaphysics is influenced by Yogacara thought and is closer to [[idealism]]. The Avatamsaka sutra compares the phenomenal world to a dream, an illusion, and a magician's conjuring. The sutra states nothing has true reality, location, beginning and end, or substantial nature. The Avatamsaka also states that &quot;The triple world is illusory – it is only made by one mind&quot;, and Fazang echoes this by writing, &quot;outside of mind there is not a single thing that can be apprehended.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, according to Huayan thought, each mind creates its own world &quot;according to their mental patterns&quot;, and &quot;these worlds are infinite in kind&quot; and constantly arising and passing away.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; However, in Huayan, mind is not real either, but also empty. The true reality in Huayan, the noumenon, or &quot;Principle&quot;, is likened to a mirror, while phenomena are compared to reflections in the mirror. It is also compared to the ocean, and phenomena to waves.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

In [[Korea]], this school was known as [[Hwaeom]] and is represented in the work of [[Wonhyo]] (617–686), who also wrote about the idea of [[Essence-Function|essence-function]], a central theme in Korean Buddhist thought. In [[Japan]], Huayan is known as [[Kegon]] and one of its major proponents was [[Myōe]], who also introduced Tantric practices.

===Chan and Japanese Buddhism===

The philosophy of Chinese [[Chan Buddhism]] and Japanese [[Zen]] is based on various sources; these include Chinese Madhyamaka (''[[East Asian Mādhyamaka|Sānlùn]]''), Yogacara (''[[East Asian Yogācāra|Wéishí]]''), the [[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]], and the [[Buddha-nature|Buddha nature]] texts. An important issue in Chan is that of [[subitism]] or &quot;sudden enlightenment&quot;, the idea that enlightenment happens all at once in a flash of insight. This view was promoted by [[Shenhui]] and is a central issue discussed in the [[Platform Sutra]], a key [[Zen scriptures|Chan scripture]] composed in China.

[[Huayan]] philosophy also had an influence on Chan. The theory of the Fourfold Dharmadhatu influenced the [[Five Ranks]] of [[Dongshan Liangjie]] (806-869), the founder of the [[Caodong]] Chan lineage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taigen Dan Leighton 2006&quot;/&gt; [[Guifeng Zongmi]], who was also a patriarch of Huayan Buddhism, wrote extensively on the philosophy of Chan and on the Avatamsaka sutra.

[[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhism]] during the 6th and 7th centuries saw an increase in the proliferation of new schools and forms of thought, a period known as the six schools of Nara (''[[Nanto Rokushū]]''). The [[Kamakura period|Kamakura Period]] (1185–1333) also saw another flurry of intellectual activity. During this period, the influential figure of [[Nichiren]] (1222–1282) made the practice and universal message of the [[Lotus Sutra]] more readily available to the population. He is of particular importance in the history of thought and religion, as his teachings constitute a separate sect of Buddhism, one of the only major sects to have originated in Japan &lt;ref name=&quot;Yampolsky1990&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/selectedwritings00nich|title=Selected writings of Nichiren|date=1990|publisher=Columbia University Press|others=Yampolsky, Philip B.

Also during the Kamakura period, the founder of [[Soto Zen]], [[Dogen]] (1200–1253), wrote many works on the philosophy of Zen, and the ''[[Shobogenzo]]'' is his magnum opus. In Korea, [[Chinul]] was an important exponent of [[Korean Seon|Seon Buddhism]] at around the same time.

===Esoteric Buddhism===

[[File:Taizokai.jpg|thumb|right|228px|The ''[[Garbhadhatu]]'' [[mandala]]. The center square represents the young stage of [[Vairocana]] Buddha.]]
[[Tantric Buddhism]] arrived in China in the 7th century, during the [[Tang Dynasty]]. In China, this form of Buddhism is known as Mìzōng (密宗), or &quot;Esoteric School&quot;,  and ''Zhenyan'' (true word, Sanskrit: [[Mantrayana]]). [[Kūkai]]  (AD774–835) is a major Japanese Buddhist philosopher and the founder of the Tantric [[Shingon]] (true word) school in Japan. He wrote on a wide variety of topics such as public policy, language, the arts, literature, music and religion. After studying in China under [[Huiguo]], Kūkai brought together various elements into a cohesive philosophical system of Shingon.

Kūkai's philosophy is based on the [[Mahavairocana Tantra]] and the [[Vajrasekhara Sutra]] (both from the seventh century). His ''Benkenmitsu nikkyôron'' (Treatise on the Differences Between Esoteric and Exoteric Teachings) outlines the difference between exoteric, mainstream [[Mahayana Buddhism]] (kengyô) and esoteric [[Tantric Buddhism]] (mikkyô).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Krummel, John, &quot;Kûkai&quot;, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/kukai/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Kūkai provided the theoretical framework for the esoteric Buddhist practices of Mantrayana, bridging the gap between the doctrine of the sutras and tantric practices. At the foundation of Kūkai's thought is the [[Trikaya]] doctrine, which holds there are three &quot;bodies of the Buddha&quot;.

According to Kūkai, esoteric Buddhism has the [[Dharmakaya]] (Jpn: ''hosshin'', embodiment of truth) as its source, which is associated with [[Vairocana]] Buddha (Dainichi). Hosshin is embodied absolute reality and truth. Hosshin is mostly ineffable but can be experienced through esoteric practices such as [[mudras]] and [[mantras]]. While Mahayana is taught by the historical Buddha (nirmankaya), it does not have ultimate reality as its source or the practices to experience the esoteric truth. For Shingon, from an enlightened perspective, the whole phenomenal world itself is also the teaching of Vairocana.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; The body of the world, its sounds and movements, is the body of truth (dharma) and furthermore it is also identical with the personal body of the cosmic Buddha. For Kūkai, world, actions, persons and Buddhas are all part of the cosmic monologue of Vairocana, they are the truth being preached, to its own self manifestations. This is ''hosshin seppô'' (literally: &quot;the dharmakâya's expounding of the Dharma&quot;) which can be accessed through mantra which is the cosmic language of Vairocana emanating through cosmic vibration concentrated in sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; In a broad sense, the universe itself a huge text expressing ultimate truth (Dharma) which must be &quot;read&quot;.

Dainichi means &quot;Great Sun&quot; and Kūkai uses this as a metaphor for the great primordial Buddha, whose teaching and presence illuminates and pervades all, like the light of the sun. This immanent presence also means that every being already has access to enlightenment ([[hongaku]]) and [[Buddha nature]], and that, because of this, there is the possibility of &quot;becoming Buddha in this very embodied existence&quot; (''sokushinjôbutsu'').&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; This is achieved because of the [[non-dual]] relationship between the macrocosm of Hosshin and the microcosm of the Shingon practitioner.

Kūkai's exposition of what has been called Shingon's &quot;metaphysics&quot; is based on the three aspects of the cosmic truth or Hosshin — body, appearance and function.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; The body is the physical and mental elements, which are the body and mind of the cosmic Buddha and which is also empty ([[Shunyata]]). The physical universe for Shingon contains the interconnected mental and physical events. The appearance aspect is the form of the world, which appears as mandalas of interconnected realms and is depicted in mandala art such as the [[Womb Realm]] mandala. The function is the movement and change which happens in the world, which includes change in forms, sounds and thought. These forms, sounds and thoughts are expressed by the Shingon practitioner in various rituals and tantric practices which allow them to connect with and inter-resonate with Dainichi and hence reach enlightenment here and now.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Portrait-of-Kitaro-Nishida.png|thumb|170px|Kitarō Nishida, professor of philosophy at Kyoto University and founder of the [[Kyoto School]].]]
In [[Sri Lanka]], Buddhist modernists such as [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] (1864-1933) and the American convert [[Henry Steel Olcott]] sought to show that Buddhism was rational and compatible with modern Scientific ideas such as the theory of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;McMahan, David L. 2008. The Making of Buddhist Modernism. Oxford: Oxford University Press. page 91-97.&lt;/ref&gt; Dharmapala also argued that Buddhism included a strong social element, interpreting it as liberal, altruistic and democratic. [[K. N. Jayatilleke]] wrote the classic modern account of Buddhist epistemology (''Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge'', 1963) and his student [[David Kalupahana]] wrote on the history of Buddhist thought and psychology. Other important Sri Lankan Buddhist thinkers include [[Katukurunde Nanananda Thera|Ven Ñāṇananda]] (''Concept and Reality''), [[Walpola Rahula]], [[Hammalawa Saddhatissa]] (''Buddhist Ethics'', 1987), Gunapala Dharmasiri (''A Buddhist critique of the Christian concept of God'', 1988), [[P. D. Premasiri]] and [[R. G. de S. Wettimuny]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Hoffman, Contemporary Buddhist philosophy: A biographical essay, Asian Philosophy, Vol. 2 No. 1 1992, Pp.79-100, http://buddhism.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ADM/hoffman.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 20th-century China, the modernist [[Taixu]] (1890-1947) advocated a reform and revival of Buddhism. He promoted an idea of a Buddhist [[Pure Land]], not as a metaphysical place in Buddhist cosmology but as something possible to create here and now in this very world, which could be achieved through a &quot;Buddhism for Human Life&quot; (Chinese: 人生佛教; pinyin: rénshēng fójiào) which was free of supernatural beliefs.&lt;ref name=Bingenheimer&gt;{{cite book |last=Bingenheimer |first=Marcus |editor1-last=Hsu |editor1-first=Mutsu |editor2-last=Chen |editor2-first=Jinhua |editor3-last=Meeks |editor3-first=Lori |title=Development and Practice of Humanitarian Buddhism: Interdisciplinary Perspectives |year=2007|publisher=Tzuchi University Press |location=Hua-lien (Taiwan) |isbn=978-986-7625-08-3 |pages=141–161 |chapter=Some Remarks on the Usage of Renjian Fojiao 人間佛教 and the Contribution of Venerable Yinshun to Chinese Buddhist Modernism|url=http://mbingenheimer.net/publications/bingenheimer.yinshunRenjianFojiao.2007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taixu also wrote on the connections between modern science and Buddhism, ultimately holding that &quot;scientific methods can only corroborate the Buddhist doctrine, they can never advance beyond it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;McMahan, David L. 2008. The Making of Buddhist Modernism. Oxford: Oxford University Press. page 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Taixu, [[Yin Shun]] (1906–2005) advocated a form of [[Humanistic Buddhism]] grounded in concern for humanitarian issues, and his students and followers have been influential in promoting [[Humanistic Buddhism]] in [[Taiwan]]. This period also saw a revival of the study of Weishi ([[Yogachara]]), by [[Yang Rensan]] (1837-1911), [[Ouyang Jinwu]] (1871-1943) and [[Liang Shuming]] (1893–1988).&lt;ref&gt;Yih-Hsien Yu, Modern Chinese Philosophy, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Tibetan Buddhism's most influential modernist thinkers is [[Gendün Chöphel]]  (1903–1951), who, according to Donald S. Lopez Jr., &quot;was arguably the most important Tibetan intellectual of the twentieth century.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Holmgren, Felix [reviewer], &quot;The Madman’s Middle Way: Reflections on Reality of the Tibetan Monk Gendün Chöpel by Donald S. Lopez Jr.&quot;, https://www.lionsroar.com/a-modern-man-in-old-tibet/&lt;/ref&gt; Gendün Chöphel traveled throughout India with the Indian Buddhist [[Rahul Sankrityayan]] and wrote a wide variety of material, including works promoting the importance of modern science to his Tibetan countrymen and also Buddhist philosophical texts such as ''Adornment for Nagarjuna’s Thought''. Another very influential Tibetan Buddhist modernist was [[Chögyam Trungpa]], whose [[Shambhala Training]] was meant to be more suitable to modern Western sensitivities by offering a vision of &quot;secular enlightenment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa, Chogyam. (1984) &quot;Shambhala: Sacred Path of the Warrior&quot;, pp 25-34&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Southeast Asia]], thinkers such as [[Buddhadasa]], [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]], [[Sulak Sivaraksa]] and [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] have promoted a philosophy of socially [[Engaged Buddhism]] and have written on the socio-political application of Buddhism. Likewise, Buddhist approaches to [[economic ethics]] ([[Buddhist economics]]) have been explored in the works of [[E. F. Schumacher]],&lt;ref&gt;E. F. Schumacher, &quot;Buddhist economics&quot; (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prayudh Payutto]], [[Neville Karunatilake]] and Padmasiri de Silva. The study of the Pali Abhidhamma tradition continued to be influential in [[Myanmar]], where it was developed by monks such as [[Ledi Sayadaw]] and [[Mahasi Sayadaw]].

Japanese Buddhist philosophy was heavily influenced by the work of the [[Kyoto School]] which included [[Kitaro Nishida]], [[Keiji Nishitani]], [[Hajime Tanabe]] and [[Masao Abe]]. These thinkers brought Buddhist ideas in dialogue with Western philosophy, especially European phenomenologists and existentialists. The most important trend in Japanese Buddhist thought after the formation of the Kyoto school is [[Critical Buddhism]], which argues against several Mahayana concepts such as [[Buddha nature]] and [[Hongaku|original enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=Bingenheimer /&gt; In [[Nichiren Buddhism]], the work of [[Daisaku Ikeda]] has also been popular.

The Japanese Zen Buddhist [[D.T. Suzuki]] (1870–1966) was instrumental in bringing [[Zen Buddhism]] to the West and his [[Buddhist modernism|Buddhist modernist]] works were very influential in the United States. Suzuki's worldview was a Zen Buddhism influenced by [[Romanticism]] and [[Transcendentalism]], which promoted a spiritual freedom as &quot;a spontaneous, emancipatory consciousness that transcends rational intellect and social convention.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McMahan, David L. 2008. The Making of Buddhist Modernism. Oxford: Oxford University Press. page 122&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of Buddhism influenced the Beat writers, and a contemporary representative of Western Buddhist Romanticism is [[Gary Snyder]]. The American Theravada Buddhist monk [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] has critiqued 'Buddhist Romanticism' in his writings.

Western Buddhist monastics and priests such as [[Nanavira Thera]], [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], [[Nyanaponika Thera]], [[Robert Baker Aitken|Robert Aitken]], [[Taigen Dan Leighton]], and [[Matthieu Ricard]] have written texts on Buddhist philosophy. A feature of Buddhist thought in the West has been a desire for dialogue and integration with modern science and psychology, and various modern Buddhists such as [[Alan Wallace]], [[James H. Austin]], [[Mark Epstein]] and the [[14th Dalai Lama]] have worked and written on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, James H. Zen and the Brain&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;14th Dalai Lama, the Universe in a single atom&lt;/ref&gt; Another area of convergence has been Buddhism and environmentalism, which is explored in the work of [[Joanna Macy]]. Another Western Buddhist philosophical trend has been the project to [[Secular Buddhism|secularize Buddhism]], as seen in the works of [[Stephen Batchelor (author)|Stephen Batchelor]].

In the West, Comparative philosophy between Buddhist and Western thought began with the work of [[Charles A. Moore]], who founded the journal [[Philosophy East and West]]. Contemporary Western Academics such as [[Mark Siderits]], [[Jan Westerhoff]], [[Jonardon Ganeri]], [[Miri Albahari]], [[Owen Flanagan]], [[Damien Keown]], [[Tom Tillemans]], [[David Loy]], [[Evan Thompson]] and [[Jay Garfield]] have written various works which interpret Buddhist ideas through [[Western philosophy]].

Scholars such as [[Thomas McEvilley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Thomas | last=McEvilley | title=The Shape of Ancient Thought | publisher=Allworth Communications | year=2002 | isbn=1-58115-203-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher I.

Pyrrhonism: How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism (Studies in Comparative Philosophy and Religion), 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; have identified cross influences between ancient Buddhism and the ancient Greek philosophy of [[Pyrrhonism]]. The Greek philosopher [[Pyrrho]] spent 18 months in India as part of [[Alexander the Great]]'s court on Alexander's conquest of western India, where ancient biographers say his contact with the [[gymnosophists]] caused him to create his philosophy. Because of the high degree of similarity between Nāgārjuna's philosophy and [[Pyrrhonism]], particularly the surviving works of [[Sextus Empiricus]]&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Kuzminski, ''Pyrrhonism: How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism'' 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas McEvilley]] suspects that Nāgārjuna was influenced by Greek Pyrrhonist texts imported into India.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas McEvilley, ''The Shape of Ancient Thought'' 2002 pp499-505&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baruch Spinoza]], though he argued for the existence of a permanent reality, asserts that all phenomenal existence is transitory. In his opinion sorrow is conquered &quot;by finding an object of knowledge which is not transient, not ephemeral, but is immutable, permanent, everlasting.&quot; The Buddha taught that the only thing which is eternal is [[Nirvana]]. [[David Hume]], after a relentless analysis of the mind, concluded that consciousness consists of fleeting mental states. Hume's [[Bundle theory]] is a very similar concept to the Buddhist ''[[skandhas]]'', though his skepticism about causation lead him to opposite conclusions in other areas. [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s philosophy parallels Buddhism in his affirmation of [[asceticism]] and renunciation as a response to suffering and desire.

[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s &quot;[[language-game]]&quot; closely parallel the warning that intellectual speculation or [[papañca]] is an impediment to understanding, as found in the Buddhist ''[[Parable of the Poison Arrow]]''. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], although himself dismissive of Buddhism as yet another nihilism, had a similar impermanent view of the self. [[Heidegger]]'s ideas on being and nothingness have been held by some{{who|date=April 2012}} to be similar to Buddhism today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol1/god_is_dead.html God Is Dead: What Next&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative approach to the comparison of Buddhist thought with Western philosophy is to use the concept of the [[Middle Way]] in Buddhism as a critical tool for the assessment of Western philosophies. In this way Western philosophies can be classified in Buddhist terms as eternalist or nihilist. In a Buddhist view all philosophies are considered non-essential views ([[View (Buddhism)|ditthis]]) and not to be clung to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moralobjectivity.net/thesis_index.html Robert Ellis ''A Buddhist theory of moral objectivity''(Ph.D. thesis)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723211924/http://www.moralobjectivity.net/thesis_index.html |date=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
