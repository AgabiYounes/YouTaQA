'''Bears''' are [[carnivora]]n [[mammal]]s of the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Ursidae'''. They are classified as [[caniforms]], or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight [[species]] of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of [[habitat]]s throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, [[plantigrade]] paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.

While the [[polar bear]] is mostly [[carnivorous]], and the [[giant panda]] feeds almost entirely on [[bamboo]], the remaining six species are [[omnivorous]] with varied diets. With the exception of [[courting]] individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically [[solitary animals]]. They may be [[diurnality|diurnal]] or [[nocturnal]] and have an excellent [[sense of smell]]. Despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they are adept runners, climbers, and swimmers.  Bears use shelters, such as caves and logs, as their dens; most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period of [[hibernation]], up to 100 days.

Bears have been hunted since [[prehistoric]] times for [[bear meat|their meat]] and fur; they have been used for [[bear-baiting]] and other forms of entertainment, such as being [[tame bear|made to dance]]. With their powerful physical presence, they play a prominent role in [[the arts]], [[mythology]], and other cultural aspects of various human societies. In modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian [[bile bear]] market. The [[IUCN]] lists six bear species as [[vulnerable species|vulnerable]] or [[endangered species|endangered]], and even [[least concern]] species, such as the [[brown bear]], are at risk of [[extirpation]] in certain countries. The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;bear&quot; comes from [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|bera}}'' and belongs to a family of names for the bear in [[Germanic languages]], such as Swedish ''{{lang|sv|[[bjorn|björn]]}}'', also used as a first name. This form is conventionally said to be related to a [[Proto-Indo-European]] word for &quot;brown&quot;, so that &quot;bear&quot; would mean &quot;the brown one&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iNUSDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=indo%20european&amp;pg=PA333#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false7|title=The Oxford Iintroduction to Proto Indo European and the Proto Indo European World|last=Mallory|first=J.

Bear taxon names such as Ursidae and ''Ursus'' come from Latin ''Ursus/Ursa'', he-bear/she-bear.&lt;ref name=UrsaMajor/&gt; The female first name &quot;Ursula&quot;, originally derived from a Christian [[St. Ursula|saint]]'s name, means &quot;little she-bear&quot; (diminutive of Latin ''ursa''). In Switzerland, the male first name &quot;Urs&quot; is especially popular, while the name of the canton and city of [[Bern]] is derived from ''Bär'', German for bear.

==Taxonomy==
{{see also|List of ursids}}
The family Ursidae is one of nine families in the suborder [[Caniformia]], or &quot;doglike&quot; carnivorans, within the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Carnivora]]. Bears' closest living relatives are the [[pinniped]]s, [[Canidae|canids]], and [[musteloidea|musteloid]]s.&lt;ref name=Hunt2005&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Welsey-Hunt, G.D. |author2=Flynn, J.J. |year=2005 |title=Phylogeny of the Carnivora: Basal relationships among the Carnivoramorphans, and assessment of the position of 'Miacoidea' relative to Carnivora |journal=Journal of Systematic Palaeontology |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1–28 |doi=10.1017/S1477201904001518}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern bears comprise eight species in three subfamilies: [[Ailuropodinae]] (monotypic with the [[giant panda]]), [[Tremarctinae]] (monotypic with the [[spectacled bear]]), and [[Ursinae]] (containing six species divided into one to three genera, depending on the authority). Nuclear chromosome analysis show that the [[karyotype]] of the six ursine bears is nearly identical, with each having 74&amp;nbsp;[[chromosome]]s (''see'' [[Ursid hybrid]]), whereas the giant panda has 42&amp;nbsp;chromosomes and the spectacled bear 52. These smaller numbers can be explained by the fusing of some chromosomes, and the banding patterns on these match those of the ursine species, but differ from those of procyonids, which supports the inclusion of these two species in Ursidae rather than in [[Procyonidae]], where they had been placed by some earlier authorities.&lt;ref name=Servheen1999&gt;{{cite book |author1=Servheen, C. |author2=Herrero, S. |author3=Peyton, B. |title=Bears: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/1999-004.pdf |year=1999 |publisher=IUCN |isbn=978-2-8317-0462-3 |pages=26–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plithocyon armagnacensis.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Plithocyon|Plithocyon armagnacensis]]'' skull, a member of the extinct subfamily Hemicyoninae from the [[Miocene]]]]

The earliest members of Ursidae belong to the extinct subfamily Amphicynodontinae, including ''[[Parictis]]'' (late [[Eocene]] to early middle [[Miocene]], 38–18&amp;nbsp;[[Mya (unit)|Mya]]) and the slightly younger ''Allocyon'' (early [[Oligocene]], 34–30&amp;nbsp;Mya), both from North America.

The subfamily Ursinae experienced a dramatic proliferation of taxa about 5.3–4.5&amp;nbsp;Mya, coincident with major environmental changes; the first members of the genus ''[[Ursus (genus)|Ursus]]'' appeared around this time.&lt;ref name=krause2008/&gt; The [[sloth bear]] is a modern survivor of one of the earliest lineages to diverge during this radiation event (5.3&amp;nbsp;Mya); it took on its peculiar morphology, related to its diet of termites and ants, no later than by the early Pleistocene. By 3–4&amp;nbsp;Mya, the species ''Ursus minimus'' appears in the fossil record of Europe; apart from its size, it was nearly identical to today's [[Asian black bear]]. It is likely ancestral to all bears within Ursinae, perhaps aside from the sloth bear. Two lineages evolved from ''U.&amp;nbsp;minimus'': the black bears (including the [[sun bear]], the Asian black bear, and the [[American black bear]]); and the brown bears (which includes the [[polar bear]]). Modern [[brown bear]]s evolved from ''U.&amp;nbsp;minimus'' via ''[[Ursus etruscus]]'', which itself is ancestral to the extinct [[Pleistocene]] [[cave bear]]. Species of Ursinae have migrated repeatedly into North America from Eurasia as early as 4 Mya during the early Pliocene.&lt;ref name=Qiu&gt;{{cite journal |author=Qiu Zhanxiang |year=2003 |title=Dispersals of Neogene Carnivorans between Asia and North America |journal=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History |issue=279 |pages=18–31 |url=http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/2246/447/25/B279a02.pdf |doi=10.1206/0003-0090(2003)279&lt;0018:C&gt;2.0.CO;2 |volume=279 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326201351/http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/2246/447/25/B279a02.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2009 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ward and Kynaston, pp.&amp;nbsp;74–77&lt;/ref&gt; The polar bear is the most recently evolved species and descended from a population of brown bears that became isolated in northern latitudes by glaciation 400,000&amp;nbsp;years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liu et al 2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Shiping |last2=Lorenzen |first2=Eline D. |last3=Fumagalli |first3=Matteo |last4=Li |first4=Bo |last5=Harris |first5=Kelley |last6=Xiong |first6=Zijun |last7=Zhou |first7=Long |last8=Korneliussen |first8=Thorfinn Sand|last9=Somel |first9=Mehmet |last10=Babbitt |first10=Courtney |last11=Wray |first11=Greg |last12=Li |first12=Jianwen |last13=He |first13=Weiming |last14=Wang |first14=Zhuo |last15=Fu |first15=Wenjing |last16=Xiang |first16=Xueyan |last17=Morgan |first17=Claire C. |last18=Doherty |first18=Aoife |last19=O'Connell |first19=Mary J. |last20=McInerney |first20=James O. |last21=Born |first21=Erik W. |last22=Dalén |first22=Love |last23=Dietz |first23=Rune |last24=Orlando |first24=Ludovic |last25=Sonne |first25=Christian |last26=Zhang |first26=Guojie |last27=Nielsen |first27=Rasmus |last28=Willerslev |first28=Eske |last29=Wang |first29=Jun |display-authors=6 |title=Population genomics reveal recent speciation and rapid evolutionary adaptation in Polar Bears |journal=Cell |date=2014 |volume=157 |issue=4 |pages=785–794 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2014.03.054 |url=http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(14)00488-7 |pmid=24813606 |pmc=4089990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphology===
[[File:Bear foot.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Unlike most other Carnivora, bears have [[plantigrade]] feet. Drawing by [[Richard Owen]], 1866.]]

Bears are generally bulky and robust animals with short tails. They are [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] with regard to size, with males typically being larger.&lt;ref name=Derocheretal86&gt;{{cite journal |last=Derocher |first=Andrew E. |author2=Andersen, Magnus |author3=Wiig, Øystein |title=Sexual dimorphism of polar bears |journal=Journal of Mammalogy |year=2005 |volume=86 |issue=5 |pages=895–901 |doi=10.1644/1545-1542(2005)86[895:SDOPB]2.0.CO;2 |url=http://cstl-csm.semo.edu/jhrobins/BS107Page/protected/Readings/polarbearssd.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202094143/http://cstl-csm.semo.edu/jhrobins/BS107Page/protected/Readings/polarbearssd.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hunt98&gt;{{Cite book |author=Hunt, R. M. Jr. |year=1998 |chapter=Ursidae |editor1=Janis, Christine M. |editor2=Scott, Kathleen M. |editor3=Jacobs, Louis L. |title=Evolution of Tertiary Mammals of North America, volume 1: Terrestrial carnivores, ungulates, and ungulatelike mammals |location=Cambridge, England |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=174–195 |isbn=978-0-521-35519-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger species tend to show increased levels of sexual dimorphism in comparison to smaller species.&lt;ref name=Hunt98/&gt; Relying as they do on strength rather than speed, bears have relatively short limbs with thick bones to support their bulk. The [[Scapula|shoulder blades]] and the [[pelvis]] are correspondingly massive. The limbs are much straighter than those of the [[big cat]]s as there is no need for them to flex in the same way due to the differences in their gait. The strong forelimbs are used to catch prey, to excavate dens, to dig out burrowing animals, to turn over rocks and logs to locate prey, and to club large creatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall Cavendish&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Black bear large.jpg|thumb|upright|Despite being [[quadruped]]s, bears can stand and sit as humans do.]]
Unlike most other land carnivorans, bears are [[plantigrade]]. They distribute their weight toward the hind feet, which makes them look lumbering when they walk. They are capable of bursts of speed but soon tire, and as a result mostly rely on ambush rather than the chase. Bears can stand on their hind feet and sit up straight with remarkable balance. Their front paws are flexible enough to grasp fruit and leaves. Bears' non-retractable claws are used for digging, climbing, tearing, and catching prey. The claws on the front feet are larger than those on the back and may be a hindrance when climbing trees; black bears are the most arboreal of the bears, and have the shortest claws. Pandas are unique in having a bony extension on the wrist of the front feet which acts as a thumb, and is used for gripping [[bamboo]] shoots as the animals feed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall Cavendish&quot;/&gt;

Most mammals have [[Agouti (coloration)|agouti]] hair, with each individual hair shaft having bands of colour corresponding to two different types of [[melanin]] pigment. Bears however have a single type of melanin and the hairs have a single colour throughout their length, apart from the tip which is sometimes a different shade. The coat consists of long guard hairs, which form a protective shaggy covering, and short dense hairs which form an insulating layer trapping air close to the skin. The shaggy coat helps maintain body heat during winter hibernation and is shed in the spring leaving a shorter summer coat. Polar bears have hollow, translucent guard hairs which gain heat from the sun and conduct it to the dark-coloured skin below. They have a thick layer of blubber for extra insulation, and the soles of their feet have a dense pad of fur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall Cavendish&quot;/&gt; Other than the bold black-and-white pelage of the panda, bears tend to be uniform in colour, although some species may have markings on the chest or face.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward124&quot;/&gt;

Bears have small rounded ears so as to minimise heat loss, but neither their hearing or sight are particularly acute. Unlike many other carnivorans they have [[colour vision]], perhaps to help them distinguish ripe nuts and fruits. They are unique among carnivorans in not having touch-sensitive [[whiskers]] on the muzzle; however, they have an excellent [[olfaction|sense of smell]], better than that of the dog, or possibly any other mammal. They use smell for signalling to each other (either to warn off rivals or detect mates) and for finding food. Smell is the principal sense used by bears to locate most of their food, and they have excellent memories which helps them to relocate places where they have found food before.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall Cavendish&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Ursus arctos 01 MWNH 145 (cropped).JPG|thumb|left|Brown bear skull]]
The [[skull]]s of bears are massive, providing anchorage for the powerful [[Masseter muscle|masseter]] and [[temporal muscle|temporal]] jaw muscles. The [[canine tooth|canine teeth]] are large but mostly used for display, and the [[molar (tooth)|molar]] teeth flat and crushing.

===Feeding===
[[File:Giant Panda Tai Shan.JPG|thumb|left|[[Giant panda]] feeding on [[bamboo]] at [[Smithsonian National Zoological Park]], [[Washington, D. C.]] This species is almost entirely [[herbivorous]].]]

Most bears are opportunistic [[omnivore]]s and consume more plant than animal matter. They eat anything from leaves, roots, and [[berries]] to [[insect]]s, [[carrion]], fresh meat, and fish, and have digestive systems and teeth adapted to such a diet.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServheenForeword&quot;/&gt; At the extremes are the almost entirely herbivorous giant panda and the mostly carnivorous polar bear. However, all bears feed on any food source that becomes seasonally available.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward83&quot;&gt;Ward and Kynaston, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Asiatic black bears in [[Taiwan]] consume large numbers of [[acorn]]s when these are most common, and switch to [[ungulate]]s at other times of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;asiablackdiet&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hwang |first=Mei-Hsiu |year=2002 |title=Diets of Asiatic black bears in Taiwan, with Methodological and Geographical Comparisons |url=http://www.bearbiology.com/fileadmin/tpl/Downloads/URSUS/Vol_13/Hwang_13.pdf |journal=Ursus |volume=13 |pages=111–125 |access-date=2012-12-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723060824/http://www.bearbiology.com/fileadmin/tpl/Downloads/URSUS/Vol_13/Hwang_13.pdf |archive-date=2013-07-23 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bears produce a number of vocal and non-vocal sounds. Tongue-clicking, grunting or chuffing many be made in cordial situations, such as between mothers and cubs or courting couples, while moaning, huffing, snorting or blowing air is made when an individual is stressed. Barking is produced during times of alarm, excitement or to give away the animal's position. Warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping, while teeth-chatters, bellows, growls, roars and pulsing sounds are made in aggressive encounters. Cubs may squeal, bawl, bleat or scream when in distress and make motor-like humming when comfortable or nursing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward117&quot;&gt;Ward and Kynaston, pp. 117–121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Naughton, D.|year=2014|title=The Natural History of Canadian Mammals: Opossums and Carnivores|publisher=University of Toronto Press|pages=218–219, 236, 251–252|isbn=978-1-4426-4483-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vocalizations and Body Language |url=https://www.bear.org/website/bear-pages/black-bear/communication/29-vocalizations-a-body-language.html |publisher=North American Bear Center |accessdate=7 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223132123/https://www.bear.org/website/bear-pages/black-bear/communication/29-vocalizations-a-body-language.html |archive-date=2016-12-23 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Masterson, Linda|year=2016|title=Living With Bears Handbook: Expanded 2nd Edition|publisher=PixyJack Press|pages=215–16|isbn=978-1-936555-61-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Petersetal2007&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peters, G. |author2=Owen, M. |author3=Rogers, L. |year=2007 |title=Humming in bears: a peculiar sustained mammalian vocalization |journal=Acta Theriologica |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=379–389 |doi=10.1007/BF03194236 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227146528 |access-date=2017-09-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203154521/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/227146528_Humming_in_bears_a_peculiar_sustained_mammalian_vocalization/file/3deec5187efc99c3fc.pdf |archive-date=2014-02-03 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Laurie, A.|author2=Seidensticker, J.|year=1977|title=Behavioural ecology of the Sloth bear (''Melursus ursinus'')|journal=Journal of Zoology|volume=182|issue=2|pages=187–204|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1977.tb04155.x|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229976355|access-date=2017-03-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327170117/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Seidensticker/publication/229976355_Behavioural_ecology_of_the_Sloth_bear_Melursus_ursinus/links/53db8a9e0cf2a76fb667a2d1.pdf|archive-date=2017-03-27|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A male bear may visit a female continuously over a period of several days or weeks, depending on the species, to test her reproductive state. During this time period, males try to prevent rivals from interacting with their mate. Courtship may be brief, although in some Asian species, courting pairs may engage in wrestling, hugging, mock fighting and vocalising.

The peoples of eastern Asia use bears' body parts and secretions (notably their gallbladders and bile) as part of [[traditional Chinese medicine]]. More than 12,000 bears are thought to be kept on farms in China, Vietnam, and South Korea for the production of bile.

In [[Korea]]n mythology, a [[Siberian tiger|tiger]] and a bear prayed to [[Hwanung]], the son of the Lord of Heaven, that they might become human. Upon hearing their prayers, Hwanung gave them 20 cloves of garlic and a bundle of [[mugwort]], ordering them to eat only this sacred food and remain out of the sunlight for 100 days. The tiger gave up after about twenty days and left the cave. However, the bear persevered and was transformed into a woman. The bear and the tiger are said to represent two tribes that sought the favor of the heavenly prince.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.san-shin.org/Dan-gun_Myth.html |title=The Myth of Gojoseon's Founding-King Dan-gun |access-date=2017-08-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828194504/http://www.san-shin.org/Dan-gun_Myth.html |archive-date=2017-08-28 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bear-woman ([[Ungnyeo]]; 웅녀/{{lang|ko|熊女}}) was grateful and made offerings to Hwanung.
