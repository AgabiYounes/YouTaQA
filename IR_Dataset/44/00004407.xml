'''Bubble and squeak''' is a traditional [[United Kingdom|British]] [[breakfast]] dish made from potatoes and cabbage. 

In modern times, it is a dish made with the shallow-fried Sunday [[leftovers|leftover]] vegetables from a [[roast dinner]]. The main ingredients are [[potato]] and [[cabbage]], but [[carrot]]s, [[pea]]s, [[Brussels sprout|sprout]]s, or any other leftover vegetables may be added. The chopped vegetables (and cold chopped meat, if used) are fried in a pan together with mashed potatoes or crushed roast potatoes until the mixture is well-cooked and brown on the sides. The dish is so named because the cabbage makes bubbling and squeaking sounds during the cooking process.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Pickett, Joseph P. |title=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=2000 |display-authors=etal}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often served with cold meat from the [[Sunday roast]] and pickles or [[brown sauce]], or as an accompaniment to a [[full breakfast|full English breakfast]].

The meat was traditionally added to the bubble and squeak, although nowadays it is more commonly made without meat. The earliest-known recipe was in [[Maria Rundell|Mrs Rundell]]'s ''[[A New System of Domestic Cookery]]'' in 1806.&lt;ref name=&quot;rundell&quot;&gt;Rundell, Maria Eliza Ketelby (1808). Bubble and Squeak. In ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=30tOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A new system of domestic cookery:Third edition]''. p. 42. Google Book Search. Retrieved on 6 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''bubble and squeak'' is used primarily in England (for Scotland and Ireland&lt;ref&gt; In Canada where the term may have originated, it usually refers strictly to a dish of the leftovers of a cottage roll dinner.

Bubble and squeak has been a popular dish since the late 1800s, as it was an easy way of using leftovers. In more recent times, ready-made pre-prepared versions have become available on the market.
