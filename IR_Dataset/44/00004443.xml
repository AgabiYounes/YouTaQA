Founded as a Roman city, in the Middle Ages Barcelona became the capital of the [[County of Barcelona]]. After merging with the [[Kingdom of Aragon]], Barcelona continued to be an important city in the [[Crown of Aragon]] as an economic and administrative centre of this Crown and the capital of the [[Principality of Catalonia]]. Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important cultural centre and a major tourist destination. Particularly renowned are the architectural works of [[Antoni Gaudí]] and [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]], which have been designated UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]s. The headquarters of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]] are located in Barcelona. The city is known for hosting the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] as well as world-class [[Barcelona#Trade fair and exhibitions|conferences and expositions]] and also many [[Sport in Barcelona#International tournaments|international sport tournaments]].

Barcelona is one of the world's leading tourist, economic, trade fair and cultural centres, and its influence in commerce, education, entertainment, sports, media, fashion, science, and the arts all contribute to its status as one of the major [[global cities]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GAWC&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2010t.html |title=The World According to GaWC 2010 |publisher=Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network, [[Loughborough University]] |accessdate=13 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010004859/http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2010t.html |archivedate=10 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/citylist.html |title=Inventory of World Cities |publisher=Globalization and World Cities (GaWC) Study Group and Network |accessdate=1 December 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014191556/http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/citylist.html |archivedate=14 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a major cultural and economic centre in [[Iberian Peninsula|southwestern Europe]], 24th in the world (before [[Zürich]], after [[Frankfurt]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atkearney.com/documents/10192/dfedfc4c-8a62-4162-90e5-2a3f14f0da3a |title=2012 Global Cities Index |date= |accessdate=30 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020223227/http://www.atkearney.com/documents/10192/dfedfc4c-8a62-4162-90e5-2a3f14f0da3a|archivedate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a financial centre.

During [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]], the city was variously known as ''Barchinona'', ''Barçalona'', ''Barchelonaa'', and ''Barchenona''.

Internationally, Barcelona's name is wrongly abbreviated to 'Barça'. However, this name refers only to [[FC Barcelona]], the football club. The common abbreviated form used by locals is ''Barna''.

Another common abbreviation is 'BCN', which is also the [[IATA airport code]] of the [[Barcelona-El Prat Airport]].

The city is also referred to as the ''Ciutat Comtal'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], and ''Ciudad Condal'' in Spanish (i.e. Comital City or City of Counts), owing to its past as the seat of the [[Count of Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.enciclopedia.cat/EC-GEC-0017957.xml &quot;Ciutat Comtal&quot;] entry in ''Gran Enciclopèdia Catalana'', Barcelona, Enciclopedia.cat, {{in lang|ca}}.

===Pre-history===
The origin of the earliest settlement at the site of present-day Barcelona is unclear. The ruins of an early settlement have been 
found, including different tombs and dwellings dating to earlier than 5000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Servei d'Arqueologia of Institut de Cultura de Barcelona|title=Caserna de Sant Pau del Camp|url=http://cartaarqueologica.bcn.cat/989|website=CartaArqueologica|publisher=Ajuntament de Barcelona|accessdate=2 May 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224118/http://cartaarqueologica.bcn.cat/989 |archivedate=3 March 2016|page=Description and Historical Notes|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MontañaCamposFarré2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author1=MM Montaña |author2=OV Campos |author3=R Farré |title=Study of the Neolithic Excavation Site of the Sant Pau del Camp Barracks |journal=Quarhis |date=2008 |volume=II |issue=4 |page=3 |url=https://www.bcn.cat/.../04_QUARHIS_01_jaciment. |accessdate=2 May 2016 }}{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding of Barcelona is the subject of two different legends. The first attributes the founding of the city to the mythological [[Hercules]]. The second legend attributes the foundation of the city directly to the historical [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] general, [[Hamilcar Barca]], father of [[Hannibal]], who supposedly named the city ''Barcino'' after his family in the 3rd century BC,&lt;ref&gt;Oros. vii. 143; Miñano, ''Diccion.'' vol.&amp;nbsp;i. p.&amp;nbsp;391; Auson. ''Epist.'' xxiv. 68, 69, ''Punica Barcino''.&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no historical or linguistic evidence that this is true.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corporation1957&quot;/&gt;

===Roman Barcelona===
In about 15&amp;nbsp;BC, the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] redrew the town as a ''[[castra|castrum]]'' (Roman military camp) centred on the &quot;''Mons Taber''&quot;, a little hill near the contemporary city hall ([[Plaça de Sant Jaume]]). Under the Romans, it was a colony with the surname of ''Faventia'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Plin.]] iii. 3. s.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt; or, in full, ''Colonia Faventia Julia Augusta Pia Barcino''&lt;ref&gt;Inscr. ap. Gruter, p. 426, nos. 5, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Colonia Julia Augusta Faventia Paterna Barcino''. [[Pomponius Mela]]&lt;ref&gt;ii. 6&lt;/ref&gt; mentions it among the small towns of the district, probably as it was eclipsed by its neighbour ''[[Tarragona|Tarraco]]'' (modern [[Tarragona]]), but it may be gathered from later writers that it gradually grew in wealth and consequence, favoured as it was with a beautiful situation and an excellent harbour.&lt;ref&gt;Avien. ''Ora Maritima.'' 520: &quot;Et Barcilonum amoena sedes ditium.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It enjoyed immunity from imperial burdens.&lt;ref&gt;Paul. Dig. 1. tit. 15, de Cens.&lt;/ref&gt; The city minted its own coins; some from the era of [[Galba]] survive.

Important Roman vestiges are displayed in [[Plaça del Rei]] underground, as a part of the [[Barcelona City History Museum]] (MUHBA); the typically Roman grid plan is still visible today in the layout of the historical centre, the ''[[El Gòtic|Barri Gòtic]]'' (Gothic Quarter). Some remaining fragments of the Roman walls have been incorporated into the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/spain/barcelona/walls/walls.html |title=Roman walls, Barcelona |publisher=Bluffton.edu |accessdate=5 May 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723083724/http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/spain/barcelona/walls/walls.html |archivedate=23 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cathedral, known very formally by the long name of ''Catedral Basílica Metropolitana de Barcelona'', is also sometimes called ''La Seu'', which simply means cathedral (and see, among other things) in Catalan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://catedralbcn.org/ Welcome page in Catalan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190515142108/https://catedralbcn.org/ |date=15 May 2019 }}, Cathedral of Barcelona, {{in lang|ca}}.

===Medieval Barcelona===
The city was conquered by the [[Visigoths]] in the early 5th century, becoming for a few years the capital of all [[Hispania]]. After being conquered by the [[Arabs]] in the early 8th century, it was conquered in 801 by [[Charlemagne]]'s son [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], who made Barcelona the seat of the Carolingian &quot;[[Marca Hispanica|Hispanic March]]&quot; (''Marca Hispanica''), a [[buffer zone]] ruled by the [[Counts of Barcelona|Count of Barcelona]].

The Counts of Barcelona became increasingly independent and expanded their territory to include all of [[Catalonia]], although on 6 July 985, Barcelona was [[Looting|sacked]] by the army of [[Almanzor]].&lt;ref&gt;'''The Usatges of Barcelona: The Fundamental Law of Catalonia''', ed. Donald J. Kagay, (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1994), 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The sack was so traumatic that most of Barcelona's population was either killed or enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Collins, ''Caliphs and Kings, 796–1031'', (Blackwell Publishing, 2012), 191.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1137, [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] and the [[Counts of Barcelona|County of Barcelona]] merged in [[dynastic union]]&lt;ref name=&quot;bisson_31&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The medieval Crown of Aragon.

His territories were later to be known as the [[Crown of Aragon]], which conquered many overseas possessions and ruled the western [[Mediterranean Sea]] with outlying territories [[Naples|in Naples]] and Sicily and as far as [[Duchy of Athens|Athens]] in the 13th century. The forging of a dynastic link between the Crowns of Aragon and [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] marked the beginning of Barcelona's decline. The Bank of Barcelona (''[[:es:Taula de canvi|Taula de canvi]]''), probably the oldest public bank in Europe, was established by the city [[magistrate]]s in 1401. It originated from necessities of the state, as did the [[Medici Bank#Rise|Bank of Venice]] (1402) and the [[Bank of Saint George|Bank of Genoa]] (1407).&lt;ref&gt;The Bankers magazine, volume 11, page 595, J. Smith Homans Jr., New York 1857.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barcelona under the Spanish monarchy===
The marriage of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]] in 1469 united the two royal lines. [[Madrid]] became the centre of political power whilst the colonisation of the Americas reduced the financial importance (at least in relative terms) of Mediterranean trade. Barcelona was a centre of [[Catalan separatism]], including the [[Reapers' War|Catalan Revolt]] (1640–52) against [[Philip IV of Spain]]. The [[plague (disease)|great plague]] of 1650–1654 halved the city's population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/payne15.htm Chapter 15: A History of Spain and Portugal], Stanley G.

[[File:Fortress on Montjuic.jpg|thumb|The [[Montjuïc Castle|fortress at Montjuïc]], most southerly point from which measurements were made when calculating the [[meridional definition]] of the metre]]
In the 18th century, a fortress was built at [[Montjuïc]] that overlooked the harbour. In 1794, this fortress was used by the French astronomer [[Pierre Méchain|Pierre François André Méchain]] for observations relating to a survey stretching to [[Dunkirk]] that provided the official basis of the measurement of a metre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adler |first1=Ken|title=The Measure of All Things: The Seven-Year Odyssey that Transformed the World|year=2002|publisher=Abacus|isbn=978-0-349-11507-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definitive metre bar, manufactured from platinum, was presented to the French legislative assembly on 22 June 1799. Much of Barcelona was negatively affected by the [[Peninsular War|Napoleonic wars]], but the start of industrialisation saw the fortunes of the province improve. Urban planner [[Ildefons Cerdà]] designed the large [[Eixample]] district in the 1850s when the medieval city walls around Barcelona's old town were torn down.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boeing2016&quot;/&gt;

===The Spanish civil war and the Franco period===

In the image [[Manuel Azaña|Azaña]] and [[Juan Negrín|Negrín]] on the city outskirts.]]
During the [[Spanish Civil War]], the city, and Catalonia in general, were resolutely Republican. Many enterprises and public services were &quot;collectivised&quot; by the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and UGT unions. As the power of the Republican government and the Generalitat diminished, much of the city was under the effective control of [[anarchist]] groups. The anarchists lost control of the city to their own allies, the Communists and official government troops, after the street fighting of the Barcelona [[May Days]]. The fall of the city on 26 January 1939, caused a mass exodus of civilians who fled to the French border. The resistance of Barcelona to [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s [[coup d'état]] was to have lasting effects after the defeat of the Republican government. The autonomous institutions of [[Catalonia]] were abolished,&lt;ref&gt;Decree of 5 April 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of the [[Catalan language]] in public life was suppressed. Barcelona remained the second largest city in Spain, at the heart of a region which was relatively industrialised and prosperous, despite the devastation of the [[Spanish Civil War|civil war]]. The result was a large-scale [[immigration]] from poorer regions of Spain (particularly [[Andalusia]], [[Murcia]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]), which in turn led to rapid urbanisation.

===Late twentieth century===
In 1992, Barcelona hosted the [[1992 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]]. The after-effects of this are credited with driving major changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the sea-front were demolished and two miles of beach were created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%, the sewage handling capacity by 27% and the amount of new green areas and beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the city doubled. Perhaps more importantly, the outside perception of the city was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city destination in the world and the 5th amongst European cities.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/53030/Barcelona Barcelona (Spain)]&quot;.

The death of Franco in 1975 brought on a period of democratisation throughout Spain. Pressure for change was particularly strong in Barcelona, which considered (with some
justification) that it had been punished during nearly forty years of Francoism for its support of the Republican government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mock2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Mock|title=Symbols of Defeat in the Construction of National Identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xb-9J4KoT6EC&amp;pg=PA274|date=29 December 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-50352-5|page=274|access-date=22 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512214005/https://books.google.com/books?id=Xb-9J4KoT6EC&amp;pg=PA274|archive-date=12 May 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massive, but peaceful, demonstrations on 11 September 1977 assembled over a million people in the streets of Barcelona to call for the restoration of Catalan autonomy.

[[urban regeneration]] has been rapid, and accompanied by a greatly increased international reputation of the city as a tourist destination. The increased cost of housing has led to a slight decline (−16.6%) in the population over the last two decades of the 20th century as many families move out into the suburbs. This decline has been reversed since 2001, as a new wave of immigration (particularly from [[Latin America]] and from [[Morocco]]) has gathered pace.&lt;ref&gt;The proportion of the population born outside of Spain rose from 3.9% in 2001 to 13.9% in 2006. {{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.es/estadistica/catala/dades/inf/guies/bcn.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=26 June 2010 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220062823/http://www.bcn.es/estadistica/catala/dades/inf/guies/bcn.pdf |archivedate=20 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barcelona is located on the northeast coast of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], facing the [[Mediterranean Sea]], on a [[plain]] approximately {{convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} wide limited by the mountain range of [[Serra de Collserola|Collserola]], the [[Llobregat]] river to the southwest and the [[Besòs (river)|Besòs]] river to the north.&lt;ref name=&quot;gec_3&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia |encyclopedia=Gran Enciclopèdia Catalana |title=Barcelona |date=July 1971 |publisher=Edicions 62 |volume=3 |location=Barcelona |pages=193–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plain covers an area of {{convert|170|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=&quot;gec_3&quot;/&gt; of which {{convert|101|km2|1|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name=&quot;guies_estadistiques&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.es/estadistica/catala/dades/inf/guies/bcn.pdf |title=11 Barcelona.indd |accessdate=26 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220062823/http://www.bcn.es/estadistica/catala/dades/inf/guies/bcn.pdf |archivedate=20 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are occupied by the city itself. It is {{convert|120|km|0|abbr=off}} south of the [[Pyrenees]] and the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] border with France.

[[Tibidabo]], {{convert|512|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high, offers striking views over the city&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panoramas.dk/fullscreen/fullscreen33.html|title=Barcelona Spain Tibidabo Sagrat Cor Church.

Barcelona is peppered with small hills, most of them urbanised, that gave their name to the neighbourhoods built upon them, such as [[El Carmel|Carmel]] ({{convert|267|m|ft|abbr=off|disp=or}}), [[:es:Putxet|Putget]] ({{convert|181|m|ft|abbr=off|disp=or}}) and Rovira ({{convert|261|m|ft|abbr=off||disp=or}}). The escarpment of [[Montjuïc]] ({{convert|173|m|ft|abbr=off|disp=or}}), situated to the southeast, overlooks the harbour and is topped by [[Montjuïc Castle (Barcelona)|Montjuïc Castle]], a fortress built in the 17–18th centuries to control the city as a replacement for the Ciutadella. Today, the fortress is a museum and Montjuïc is home to several sporting and cultural venues, as well as Barcelona's biggest park and gardens.

The city borders on the municipalities of [[Santa Coloma de Gramenet]] and [[Sant Adrià de Besòs]] to the north; the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the east; [[El Prat de Llobregat]] and [[L'Hospitalet de Llobregat]] to the south; and [[Sant Feliu de Llobregat]], [[Sant Just Desvern]], [[Esplugues de Llobregat]], [[Sant Cugat del Vallès]], and [[Montcada i Reixac]] to the west. The municipality includes two small sparsely-inhabited [[exclave]]s to the north-west.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Barcelona}}
According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], Barcelona has a maritime [[Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa''), with mild winters and warm to hot summers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ahrens |first=C. Donald |date=2012 |title=Meteorology Today: An Introduction to Weather, Climate, and the Environment, 10th Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cD6CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA504 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn= 978-0840054999}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the rainiest seasons are autumn and spring. The rainfall pattern is characterised by a short (3 months) [[dry season]] in summer, as well as less winter rainfall than in a typical Mediterranean climate. This subtype, labelled as &quot;Portuguese&quot; by the French geographer George Viers after the climate classification of [[Emmanuel de Martonne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Viers|first=Georges|date=1987|title=Climatología|trans-title=Climatology|language=Spanish|location=Barcelona|publisher=Oikos-Tau|isbn=9788428102957}}, pp.166-167&lt;/ref&gt; and found in the NW Mediterranean area (e.g. [[Marseille#Climate|Marseille]]), can be seen as transitional to the [[humid subtropical climate#Europe|humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') found in inland areas such as the [[Po Valley]] (e.g. [[Milan#Climate|Milan]]), whose rainfall is greater in summer, a feature of [[continental climate]]s.

Its average annual temperature is {{convert|21.2|°C|°F|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|15.1|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at night. The average annual temperature of the sea is about {{convert|20|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. In the coldest month, January, the temperature typically ranges from {{convert|12|to|18|C|F}} during the day, {{convert|6|to|12|C|F}} at night and the average sea temperature is {{convert|13|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather2travel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/spain/barcelona.php|title=Weather2Travel.com: Barcelona Climate Guide|accessdate=16 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718005932/http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/spain/barcelona.php| archivedate= 18 July 2011| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the warmest month, August, the typical temperature ranges from {{convert|27|to|31|C|F}} during the day, about {{convert|23|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at night and the average sea temperature is {{convert|26|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=weather2travel/&gt; Generally, the summer or &quot;holiday&quot; season lasts about six months, from May to October. Two months – April and November – are transitional; sometimes the temperature exceeds {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}}, with an average temperature of {{convert|18|-|19|C|F}} during the day and {{convert|11|-|13|C|F}} at night. December, January and February are the coldest months, with average temperatures around {{convert|15|°C|°F|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|9|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at night. Large fluctuations in temperature are rare, particularly in the summer months. Because of the proximity to the warm sea plus the [[urban heat island]], frosts are very rare in the city of Barcelona. Snow is also infrequent, falling only once every two years on average.

Barcelona averages 78 rainy days per year (≥ 1&amp;nbsp;mm), and annual average relative humidity is 72%, ranging from 69% in July to 75% in October. Rainfall totals are highest in late summer and autumn (September–November) and lowest in early and mid-summer (June–August), with a secondary winter minimum (February–March). Sunshine duration is 2,524&amp;nbsp;hours per year, from 138 (average 4.5&amp;nbsp;hours of sunshine a day) in December to 310 (average 10&amp;nbsp;hours of sunshine a day) in July.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meteorología&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aemet.es/es/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=0076&amp;k=cat |title=Valores Climatológicos Normales.

[[File:Demografía Barcelona (España).PNG|right|upright=1.35|thumb|Demographic evolution, 1900–2007, according to the Spanish Instituto Nacional de Estadística]]

According to Barcelona's City Council, Barcelona's population {{as of|2016|January|1|lc=y}} was 1,608,746&amp;nbsp;people,&lt;ref name=&quot;ASTBCN&quot;&gt;[http://www.bcn.cat/estadistica/angles/dades/tpob/index.htm &quot;Ajuntament de Barcelona - Population, household and homes statistics&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603041620/http://www.bcn.cat/estadistica/angles/dades/tpob/index.htm |date=3 June 2017 }}, retrieved 12 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; on a land area of {{convert|101.4|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. It is the main component of an [[Àrea Metropolitana de Barcelona|administrative area of Greater Barcelona]], with a population of 3,218,071 in an area of {{convert|636|km2|0|abbr=off}} (density 5,060 inhabitants/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The population of the urban area was 4,840,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;demographia&quot;/&gt; It is the central nucleus of the [[Barcelona metropolitan area]], which relies on a population of 5,474,482.&lt;ref name=&quot;eurostat&quot;&gt;[http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=met_pjanaggr3&amp;lang=en Population on 1 January by broad age group, sex and metropolitan regions] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822103143/http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=met_pjanaggr3&amp;lang=en |date=22 August 2016 }} - [[Eurostat]], 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spanish Language|Spanish]] is the most spoken language in Barcelona (according to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and it is understood almost universally. [[Catalan language|Catalan]] is also very commonly spoken in the city: it is understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% can speak it, 79% can read it, and 53% can write it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Departament d'Estadística.

In 1900, Barcelona had a population of 533,000 people,&lt;ref name=&quot;gec_3&quot;/&gt; which grew steadily but slowly until 1950, when it started absorbing a high number of people from other less-industrialised parts of Spain. Barcelona's population peaked in 1979 with 1,906,998 people, and fell throughout the 1980s and 1990s as more people sought a higher [[quality of life]] in outlying cities in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. After bottoming out in 2000 with 1,496,266 people, the city's population began to rise again as younger people started to return, causing a great increase in housing prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.es/estadistica/catala/dades/anuari/cap02/C0201010.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221131641/http://www.bcn.es/estadistica/catala/dades/anuari/cap02/C0201010.htm |archivedate=21 December 2007 |title=Ajuntament de Barcelona: Estadística: Evolució de la població. 1900–2005 |accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population density===
[[File:14-08-06-barcelona-RalfR-314.jpg|thumb|left|View over the [[Passeig de Gràcia]] avenue]]
''Note: This text is entirely based on the municipal statistical database provided by the city council.''

Barcelona is one of the most densely populated cities in Europe. For the year 2008 the city council calculated the population to 1,621,090 living in the 102.2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sized municipality, giving the city an average population density of 15,926 inhabitants per square kilometre with [[Eixample]] being the most populated district.

In the case of Barcelona though, the land distribution is extremely uneven. Half of the municipality or 50.2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, all of it located on the municipal edge is made up of the ten least densely populated neighbourhoods containing less than 10% of the city's population, the uninhabited [[Zona Franca (Barcelona)|Zona Franca]] industrial area and [[Montjuïc]] forest park. Leaving the remaining 90% or slightly below 1.5 million inhabitants living on the remaining {{convert|52|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}} at an average density close to 28,500 inhabitants per square kilometre.

Of the 73 neighbourhoods in the city, 45 had a population density above 20,000 inhabitants per square kilometre with a combined population of 1,313,424 inhabitants living on 38.6&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at an average density of 33,987 inhabitants per square km. The 30 most densely populated neighbourhoods accounted for 57.5% of the city population occupying only 22,7% of the municipality, or in other words, 936,406 people living at an average density of 40,322 inhabitants per square kilometre. The city's highest density is found at and around the neighbourhood of [[Sagrada Família, Barcelona|la Sagrada Família]] where four of the city's most densely populated neighbourhoods are located side by side, all with a population density above 50,000 inhabitants per square kilometre.

===Age structure===
In 1900 almost a third (28.9 percent) were children (aged younger than 14 years), In 2017 this age group constituted only 12.7; those aged between 15 and 24 years in 2017 were 9 percent; those aged between 25 and 44 years a 30.6 percent. In contrast, in 2017 the aged between 45 and 64 years formed the 56.9% of all Barcelonans; while in 1900 the aged 65 and older were just the 6.5 percent, in 2017 reached a 21.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://w3.grupobbva.com/TLFU/dat/05_barcelona.pdf|title=La población de Barcelona|author=Fundación BBVA|access-date=6 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106095806/http://w3.grupobbva.com/TLFU/dat/05_barcelona.pdf|archive-date=6 January 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.cat/estadistica/castella/dades/anuari/cap02/C020104.htm|title=Poblacion por edades quinquenales y sexo. 2017|author=Ajuntament de Barcelona|date=1 January 2017|author-link=Ajuntament de Barcelona|access-date=6 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190506060005/http://www.bcn.cat/estadistica/castella/dades/anuari/cap02/C020104.htm|archive-date=6 May 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 about 59% of the inhabitants of the city were born in [[Catalonia]] and 18.5% coming from the rest of the country. In addition to that, 22.5% of the population was born outside of Spain, a proportion which has more than doubled since 2001 and more than quintupled since 1996 when it was 8.6% respectively 3.9%.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASTBCN&quot; /&gt;

There exists a relatively large [[Pakistan]]i community in Barcelona with up to twenty thousand nationals. The community consists of significantly more men than women. Many of the Pakistanis are living in [[Ciutat Vella]].

Barcelona has a long-standing mercantile tradition. Less well known is that the city industrialised early, taking off in 1833, when Catalonia's already sophisticated textile industry began to use steam power. It became the first and most important industrial city in the Mediterranean basin. Since then, manufacturing has played a large role in its history.

[[Bolsa de Valores de Barcelona|Borsa de Barcelona]] (Barcelona Stock Exchange) is the main stock exchange in the northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula.

Drawing upon its tradition of creative art and craftsmanship, Barcelona is known for its award-winning [[industrial design]]. It also has several congress halls, notably [[Fira de Barcelona]] – the second largest trade fair and exhibition centre in Europe, that host a quickly growing number of national and international events each year (at present above 50). The total exhibition floor space of Fira de Barcelona venues is {{convert|405,000|m2|ha|0|abbr=on}}, not counting [[Gran Via (Barcelona)|Gran Via centre]] on the [[Plaza de Europa]]. However, the [[Eurozone crisis]] and deep cuts in business travel affected the Council's positioning of the city as a convention centre.

An important business centre, the [[World Trade Center Barcelona]], is located in Barcelona's [[Port Vell]] harbour.

The city is known for hosting well as world-class conferences and expositions, including the 1888 ''[[Exposición Universal de Barcelona]]'', the [[1929 Barcelona International Exposition]] (Expo 1929), the [[2004 Universal Forum of Cultures]] and the 2004 [[World Urban Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Urban Forum 2004|url=http://mirror.unhabitat.org/categories.asp?catid=467|accessdate=1 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315031755/http://mirror.unhabitat.org/categories.asp?catid=467|archive-date=15 March 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its large influx of tourists each year, Barcelona, like many other tourism capitals, has to deal with pickpockets, with wallets and passports being commonly stolen items. For this reason, most travel guides recommend that visitors take precautions in order to ensure their possessions' safety, especially inside the metro premises. Despite its moderate pickpocket rate, Barcelona is considered one of the safest cities in terms of health security and personal safety,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-20-safest-cities-in-the-world-2015-1|title=20 Of The Safest Cities In The World|newspaper=Business Insider|access-date=12 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224161443/http://www.businessinsider.com/the-20-safest-cities-in-the-world-2015-1|archive-date=24 December 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly because of a sophisticated policing strategy that has dropped crime by 32% in just over three years and has led it to be considered the 15th safest city in the world by [[Business Insider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/the-15-safest-cities-in-the-world-2016-12/#15-barcelona-7516-three-years-ago-the-barcelona-city-council-decided-to-increase-the-police-presence-on-the-streets-and-in-the-subway-the-strategy-has-yielded-results-with-crime-falling-by-32-1|title=The 15 safest cities in the world|newspaper=Business Insider|access-date=12 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161208023104/http://uk.businessinsider.com/the-15-safest-cities-in-the-world-2016-12/#15-barcelona-7516-three-years-ago-the-barcelona-city-council-decided-to-increase-the-police-presence-on-the-streets-and-in-the-subway-the-strategy-has-yielded-results-with-crime-falling-by-32-1|archive-date=8 December 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While tourism produces economic benefits, the city is &quot;overrun&quot; ... by &quot;hordes of tourists&quot; according to one report. In early 2017, over 150,000 protesters warned that tourism is destabilizing the city. Slogans included &quot;Tourists go home&quot;, &quot;Barcelona is not for sale&quot; and &quot;We will not be driven out&quot;. By then, number of visitors had increased from 1.7 million in 1990 to 32 million in a city with a population of 1.62 million, increasing the cost of rental housing for residents and overcrowding the public places. While tourists spent an estimated €30 billion in 2017, they are viewed by some as a threat to Barcelona's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Burgen |first=Stephen |date=25 June 2018 |title='Tourists go home, refugees welcome': why Barcelona chose migrants over visitors |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jun/25/tourists-go-home-refugees-welcome-why-barcelona-chose-migrants-over-visitors |work=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=3 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180902145924/https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jun/25/tourists-go-home-refugees-welcome-why-barcelona-chose-migrants-over-visitors |archive-date=2 September 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A May 2017 article in England's [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] newspaper included Barcelona among the ''Eight Places That Hate Tourists the Most'' and included a comment from Mayor [[Ada Colau]], &quot;We don't want the city to become a cheap souvenir shop [like Venice]&quot;. To moderate the problem, the city has stopped issuing licenses for new hotels and holiday apartments; it also fined AirBnb with a €30,000.

The traditional importance of textiles is reflected in Barcelona's drive to become a major fashion centre. There have been many attempts to launch Barcelona as a [[Fashion in Barcelona|fashion capital]], notably ''Gaudi Home''.{{citation needed|reason=who or what is Gaudi Home; need cite for it and more info|date=January 2014}}

Beginning in the summer of 2000, the city hosted the prestigious [[Bread and Butter tradeshow|Bread &amp; Butter urban fashion fair]] until 2009, when its organisers announced that it would be returning to [[Berlin]].

As the capital of the autonomous community of [[Catalonia]], Barcelona is the seat of the Catalan government, known as the ''[[Generalitat of Catalonia|Generalitat de Catalunya]]''; of particular note are the [[Government of Catalonia|executive branch]], the [[Parliament of Catalonia|parliament]], and the [[High Court of Justice of Catalonia]]. The city is also the capital of the [[Province of Barcelona]] and the [[Barcelonès]] [[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]] (district).

Barcelona is governed by a city council formed by 41 city councillors, [[Municipal elections in Barcelona|elected]] for a four-year term by [[universal suffrage]]. As one of the two biggest cities in Spain, Barcelona is subject to a special law articulated through the ''Carta Municipal'' (Municipal Law). A first version of this law was passed in 1960 and amended later, but the current version was approved in March 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;ley 1/2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/doc.php?coleccion=iberlex&amp;id=2006/04583 |title=BOE – LEY 1/2006, de 13 de marzo, por la que se regula el Régimen Especial del municipio de Barcelona |publisher=Boe.es |date=14 March 2006 |accessdate=26 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430052956/http://www.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/doc.php?coleccion=iberlex&amp;id=2006%2F04583 |archivedate=30 April 2008 |url-status=dead|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this law, Barcelona's city council is organised in two levels: a political one, with elected city councillors, and one executive, which administrates the programs and executes the decisions taken on the political level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.bcn.es/V61/Home/V61HomeLinkPl/0,2687,200713899_200720868_1,00.html |title=Ajuntament de Barcelona&gt; Ajuntament&gt; El Govern de la Ciutat |publisher=W3.bcn.es |accessdate=26 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728231233/http://w3.bcn.es/V61/Home/V61HomeLinkPl/0%2C2687%2C200713899_200720868_1%2C00.html |archivedate=28 July 2010 |url-status=live |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This law also gives the local government a special relationship with the central government and it also gives the mayor wider prerogatives by the means of municipal executive commissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.cat/catala/laciutat/barcelona/organitzacio.htm |title=Ajuntament de Barcelona: Organització política |publisher=Bcn.cat |accessdate=26 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723081931/http://www.bcn.cat/catala/laciutat/barcelona/organitzacio.htm |archivedate=23 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It expands the powers of the city council in areas like telecommunications, city traffic, [[road traffic safety|road safety]] and [[public safety]].

The seat of the city council is on the Plaça de Sant Jaume, opposite the seat of Generalitat de Catalunya. Since the [[Spanish transition to democracy|coming of the Spanish democracy]], Barcelona [[Municipal elections in Barcelona|had been governed]] by the [[Socialists' Party of Catalonia|PSC]], first with an [[absolute majority]] and later in coalition with [[Republican Left of Catalonia|ERC]] and [[Initiative for Catalonia Greens|ICV]]. After the May 2007 election, the ERC did not renew the coalition agreement and the PSC governed in a minority coalition with ICV as the junior partner.

After 32 years, on 22 May 2011, [[Convergence and Union|CiU]] gained a plurality of seats at the municipal election, gaining 15 seats to the PSC's 11. The [[People's Party (Spain)|PP]] hold 8 seats, ICV 5 and ERC 2.

===Districts===
[[File:Districtes de Barcelona.svg|right|thumb|Districts of Barcelona]]
{{main|Districts of Barcelona}}

Since 1987, the city has been divided into 10&amp;nbsp;administrative [[Districts of Barcelona|districts]] (''districtes'' in Catalan, ''distritos'' in Spanish):
* [[Ciutat Vella]]
* [[Eixample]]
* [[Sants-Montjuïc]]
* [[District of Les Corts|Les Corts]]
* [[Sarrià-Sant Gervasi]]
* [[Gràcia]]
* [[Horta-Guinardó]]
* [[Nou Barris]]
* [[Sant Andreu]]
* [[Sant Martí (district)|Sant Martí]]

The districts are based mostly on historical divisions, and several are former towns annexed by the city of Barcelona in the 18th and 19th centuries that still maintain their own distinct character. Each district has its own council led by a city councillor. The composition of each district council depends on the number of votes each political party had in that district, so a district can be led by a councillor from a different party than the executive council.

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Spain}}
[[File:Universidad de Barcelona, Canciller del Ecuador ofrece conferencia (11986731433).jpg|thumb|Main hall of the [[University of Barcelona]]]]

Barcelona has a well-developed higher education system of [[public university|public universities]]. Most prominent among these is the [[University of Barcelona]] (established in 1450), a world-renowned research and teaching institution with campuses around the city. Barcelona is also home to the [[Polytechnic University of Catalonia]], and the newer [[Pompeu Fabra University]], and, in the private sector the [[EADA Business School]] founded in 1957, became the first Barcelona institution to run manager training programmes for the business community. [[IESE|IESE Business School]], as well as the largest private educational institution, the [[Ramon Llull University]], which encompasses internationally prestigious schools and institutes such as the [[ESADE]] Business School.

[[File:MareNostrum 4 supercomputer at Barcelona Supercomputing Center 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[MareNostrum]] 4 supercomputer hosted at the [[Barcelona Supercomputing Center]], ]]

The city has a network of public schools, from nurseries to high schools, under the responsibility of a consortium led by city council (though the curriculum is the responsibility of the Generalitat de Catalunya). There are also many private schools, some of them Roman Catholic. Most such schools receive a public subsidy on a per-student basis, are subject to inspection by the public authorities, and are required to follow the same curricular guidelines as public schools, though they charge tuition. Known as ''escoles concertades'', they are distinct from schools whose funding is entirely private (''escoles privades'').

The language of instruction at public schools and ''escoles concertades'' is Catalan, as stipulated by the 2009 Catalan Education Act. Spanish may be used as a language of instruction by teachers of Spanish literature or language, and foreign languages by teachers of those languages. An experimental partial immersion programme adopted by some schools allows for the teaching of a foreign language (English, generally) across the curriculum, though this is limited to a maximum of 30% of the school day. No public school or ''escola concertada'' in Barcelona may offer 50% or full immersion programmes in a foreign language, nor does any public school or ''escola concertada'' offer International Baccalaureate programmes.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Barcelona}}
Barcelona's cultural roots go back 2000 years.

=== Squatter's Movement ===
Barcelona is also home to numerous [[Social center|social centres]] and [[Squatting|illegal squats]] that effectively form a shadow society mainly made up of the unemployed, immigrants, dropouts, [[Anarchism|anarchists]], [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarians]] and [[Autonomism|autonomists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=To Get to the Other Side: a journey through Europe and its anarchist movements|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Gelderloos]] estimates that there around 200 squatted buildings and 40 social centres across the city with thousands of inhabitants, making it one of the largest squatter movements in the world. He notes that they pirate electricity, internet and water allowing them to live on less than one euro a day. He argues that these squats embrace an [[Anarcho-communism|anarcho-communist]] and [[anti-work]] philosophy, often freely fixing up new houses, cleaning, patching roofs, installing windows, toilets, showers, lights and kitchens. In the wake of austerity, the squats have provided a number of [[social services]] to the surrounding residents, including [[bicycle]] repair workshops, [[carpentry]] workshops, [[self-defense]] classes, free [[libraries]], [[Community gardening|community gardens]], free meals, [[computer]] labs, language classes, theatre groups, free medical care and legal support services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anarchy Works|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The squats help elderly residents avoid eviction and organise various protests throughout Barcelona. Notable squats include [[Can Vies]] and [[Can Masdeu]]. Police have repeatedly tried to shut down the squatters movement with waves of evictions and raids, but the movement is still going strong.

The Maremagnum, being situated within the confines of the port, is the only commercial mall in the city that can open on Sundays and public holidays.

===National and international rail===
[[File:Barcelona - Estación de Sants y Hotel Barceló Sants 2.jpg|thumb|The main railway station [[Barcelona Sants railway station|Estació de Sants]]]]

Barcelona is a major hub for [[RENFE]], the Spanish state railway network. The city's main [[Inter-city rail]] [[railway station|station]] is [[Barcelona Sants railway station]], whilst [[Estació de França]] terminus serves a secondary role handling suburban, regional and medium distance services. Freight services operate to local industries and to the Port of Barcelona.

RENFE's [[AVE]] [[high-speed rail]] system, which is designed for speeds of {{convert|310|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, was extended from [[Madrid]] to Barcelona in 2008 in the form of the [[Madrid–Barcelona high-speed rail line]]. A shared RENFE-SNCF high-speed rail connecting Barcelona and France ([[Paris]], [[Marseilles]] and [[Toulouse]], through [[Perpignan–Barcelona high-speed rail line]]) was launched in 2013. Both these lines serve Barcelona Sants terminal station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avui.cat/noticia/article/2-societat/5-societat/252283-barcelona-estrena-tgv.html|title=Barcelona estrena TGV|publisher=[[Avui]]|date=9 February 2008 |accessdate=11 July 2011 |language=catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catalannewsagency.com/politics/item/the-last-high-speed-railway-stretch-between-barcelona-and-france-has-finally-been-unveiled-after-years-of-delays|title=The last High Speed railway stretch between Barcelona and France has finally been unveiled after years of delays|publisher=Catalan News Agency|date=8 January 2013|accessdate=27 January 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410223210/http://www.catalannewsagency.com/politics/item/the-last-high-speed-railway-stretch-between-barcelona-and-france-has-finally-been-unveiled-after-years-of-delays|archivedate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metro and regional rail===
[[File:LlefiàL10.JPG|thumb|right|Barcelona Metro]]
Barcelona is served by an extensive local public transport network that includes a [[rapid transit|metro]] system, a [[bus]] network, a [[Commuter rail|regional railway]] system, [[tram]]s, [[funicular]]s, [[rack railway]]s, a [[Gondola lift]] and [[aerial tramway|aerial cable cars]]. These networks and lines are run by a number of different operators but they are integrated into a coordinated fare system, administered by the [[Autoritat del Transport Metropolità]] (ATM). The system is divided into fare zones (1 to 6) and various Integrated Travel Cards are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmb.cat/en/abonaments-integrats|title=Integrated travel cards – Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona|author=|date=|work=tmb.cat|access-date=19 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824054620/http://www.tmb.cat/en/abonaments-integrats|archive-date=24 August 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Barcelona Metro]] network comprises twelve lines, identified by an &quot;L&quot; followed by the line number as well as by individual colours. The Metro largely runs underground; eight Metro lines are operated on dedicated track by the [[Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona]] (TMB), whilst four lines are operated by the [[Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya]] (FGC) and some of them share tracks with RENFE commuter lines.

In addition to the city Metro, several regional rail lines operated by RENFE's [[Rodalies de Catalunya]] run across the city, providing connections to outlying towns in the surrounding region.

===Tram===
[[File:Barcelona Tram 01.jpg|left|thumb|Barcelona Tram]]
The city's two modern tram systems, [[Trambaix]] and [[Trambesòs]], are operated by [[TRAMMET]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.bcn.es/V01/Serveis/Noticies/V01NoticiesLlistatNoticiesCtl/0,2138,1653_35144087_1_573780100,00.html?accio=detall&amp;home=HomeBCN&amp;nomtipusMCM=Noticia |title=News related with the council plans for the tram network union |publisher=W3.bcn.es |accessdate=26 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003195712/http://w3.bcn.es/V01/Serveis/Noticies/V01NoticiesLlistatNoticiesCtl/0%2C2138%2C1653_35144087_1_573780100%2C00.html?accio=detall&amp;home=HomeBCN&amp;nomtipusMCM=Noticia |archivedate= 3 October 2009 |url-status=dead|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[heritage streetcar|heritage tram line]], the [[Tramvia Blau]], also operates between the metro Line 7 and the [[Funicular del Tibidabo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmb.net/en_US/barcelona/moute/planols/planotramviablau.jsp |title=Information of Tramvia Blau |publisher=Tmb.net |accessdate=26 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091224023817/http://www.tmb.net/en_US/barcelona/moute/planols/planotramviablau.jsp |archivedate=24 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funicular and cable car===
Barcelona's metro and rail system is supplemented by several aerial cable cars, funiculars and rack railways that provide connections to mountain-top stations. FGC operates the [[Funicular de Tibidabo]] up the hill of [[Tibidabo]] and the [[Funicular de Vallvidrera]] (FGC), while TMB runs the [[Funicular de Montjuïc]] up [[Montjuïc]]. The city has two aerial cable cars: the [[Montjuïc Cable Car]], which serves Montjuïc castle, and the [[Port Vell Aerial Tramway]] that runs via [[Torre Jaume I]] and [[Torre Sant Sebastia|Torre Sant Sebastià]] over the port.

===Bus===
Buses in Barcelona are a major form of public transport, with extensive local, interurban and night bus networks. Most local services are operated by the TMB, although some other services are operated by a number of private companies, albeit still within the ATM fare structure. A separate private bus line, known as Aerobús, links the airport with the city centre, with its own fare structure.

The [[Estació del Nord Sports Hall|Estació del Nord]] (Northern Station), a former [[railway station]] which was renovated for the 1992 Olympic Games, now serves as the terminus for long-distance and regional bus services.

===Taxi===
[[File:14-08-06-barcelona-RalfR-222.jpg|thumb|Two typical Barcelona taxis]]
Barcelona has a [[taxicab|metered taxi]] fleet governed by the Institut Metropolità del Taxi (Metropolitan Taxi Institute), composed of more than 10,000 cars. Most of the licences are in the hands of [[Self-employment|self-employed]] drivers. With their black and yellow livery, Barcelona's taxis are easily spotted, and can be caught from one of many [[taxi rank]]s, hailed on street, called by telephone or via app.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.barcelona.com/barcelona_city_guide/all_about/taxis_in_barcelona | title = Barcelona Taxi Information | work = Barcelona.com | accessdate = 28 January 2014| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140202102147/http://www.barcelona.com/barcelona_city_guide/all_about/taxis_in_barcelona | archivedate = 2 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bcnweb2.bcn.es:8885/taxi/infocorp/informacio.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20031208074138/http://bcnweb2.bcn.es:8885/taxi/infocorp/informacio.html|url-status=dead|title=Invalid Host Specified|date=8 December 2003|archivedate=8 December 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roads and highways===
[[File:BCN-rdaDalt-9976sh.jpg|thumb|upright|[[B-20 motorway (Spain)|B-20 motorway]] in Barcelona.]]

Barcelona lies on three international routes, including [[European route E15]] that follows the Mediterranean coast, [[European route E90]] to Madrid and Lisbon, and [[European route E09]] to Paris. It is also served by a comprehensive network of motorways and highways throughout the metropolitan area, including [[Autovía A-2|A-2]], [[Autovía A-7|A-7]]/[[Autopista AP-7|AP-7]], [[C-16 highway (Spain)|C-16]], [[C-17 highway (Spain)|C-17]], [[C-31 highway (Spain)|C-31]], [[C-32 highway (Spain)|C-32]], [[Autopista C-33|C-33]], [[Autovia C-60|C-60]].

The city is circled by three half [[Beltway|ring roads]] or bypasses, [[B20 motorway (Spain)|Ronda de Dalt (B-20)]] (on the mountain side), [[B10 motorway (Spain)|Ronda del Litoral (B-10)]] (along the coast) and [[Ronda del Mig]] (separated into two parts: [[Travessera de Dalt]] in the north and the [[Gran Via de Carles III]]), two partially covered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.es/turisme/english/turisme/rutes/rondes_fr.htm |title=The covered Rondes (by-pass) |publisher=Bcn.es |accessdate=26 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516235933/http://www.bcn.es/turisme/english/turisme/rutes/rondes_fr.htm |archivedate=16 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; fast highways with several exits that bypass the city.

The city's main arteries include [[Avinguda Diagonal, Barcelona|Diagonal Avenue]], which crosses it diagonally, [[Avinguda Meridiana, Barcelona|Meridiana Avenue]] which leads to [[Plaça de les Glòries Catalanes, Barcelona|Glòries]] and connects with Diagonal Avenue and [[Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, Barcelona|Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes]], which crosses the city from east to west, passing through its centre. The famous boulevard of [[La Rambla, Barcelona|La Rambla]], whilst no longer an important vehicular route, remains an important pedestrian route.

==Main sights==
[[File:Sagrada Familia 01.jpg|thumb|[[Sagrada Família]] church, designed by [[Antoni Gaudí|Gaudí]]]]

The ''[[El Gòtic|Barri Gòtic]]'' (Catalan for &quot;Gothic Quarter&quot;) is the centre of the old city of Barcelona. Many of the buildings date from medieval times, some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan ''[[Modernisme|modernista]]'' architecture (related to the movement known as [[Art Nouveau]] in the rest of Europe) developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are [[World Heritage Site]]s. Especially remarkable is the work of architect [[Antoni Gaudí]], which can be seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but still unfinished church of the [[Sagrada Família]], which has been under construction since 1882 and is still financed by private donations. {{As of|2015}}, completion is planned for 2026.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/11/sagrada-familia-reaches-its-final-stage-of-construction/413476/ | title = Gaudí's Barcelona Basilica, La Sagrada Família, Reaches Its Final Stage of Construction - The Atlantic | magazine = The Atlantic | accessdate = 1 February 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170312083828/https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/11/sagrada-familia-reaches-its-final-stage-of-construction/413476/ | archive-date = 12 March 2017 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barcelona was also home to [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe]]'s [[Barcelona Pavilion]]. Designed in 1929 for the [[1929 Barcelona International Exposition|International Exposition]] for Germany, it was an iconic building that came to symbolise modern architecture as the embodiment of van der Rohe's aphorisms &quot;less is more&quot; and &quot;God is in the details.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rybczynski2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Witold Rybczynski|title=The Look of Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l71xDwYtEJIC&amp;pg=PA94|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-515633-1|pages=94–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Barcelona pavilion was intended as a temporary structure and was torn down in 1930 less than a year after it was constructed. A modern re-creation by Spanish architects now stands in Barcelona, however, constructed in 1986.

Barcelona won the 1999 [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]] [[Royal Gold Medal]] for its architecture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.architecture.com/Files/RIBATrust/Awards/RoyalGoldMedal/Royal%20Gold%20Medallists%201848%20-%202008.pdf | title = RIBA Royal Gold Medallists | publisher = RIBA | accessdate = 28 January 2014| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140202101307/http://www.architecture.com/Files/RIBATrust/Awards/RoyalGoldMedal/Royal%20Gold%20Medallists%201848%20-%202008.pdf | archivedate = 2 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the first (and {{As of|2015|lc=y}}, only) time that the winner has been a city rather than an individual architect.

Barcelona has a great number of museums, which cover different areas and eras. The [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|National Museum of Art of Catalonia]] possesses a well-known collection of [[Romanesque art]], while the [[Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art]] focuses on [[Post-war|post-1945]] Catalan and [[Spanish art]]. The [[Fundació Joan Miró]], [[Museu Picasso|Picasso Museum]], and [[Fundació Antoni Tàpies]] hold important collections of these world-renowned artists, as well as the [[Can Framis Museum]], focused on post-1960 Catalan Art owned by [[Fundacio Vila Casas|Fundació Vila Casas]].
Several museums cover the fields of history and archaeology, like the [[Barcelona City History Museum]] (MUHBA), the Museum of the [[History of Catalonia]], the [[Archaeology Museum of Catalonia|Archeology Museum of Catalonia]], the [[Barcelona Maritime Museum]], the [[Museu de la Música de Barcelona|Music Museum of Barcelona]] and the privately owned Egyptian Museum. The Erotic museum of Barcelona is among the most peculiar ones, while CosmoCaixa is a [[science museum]] that received the [[European Museum of the Year Award]] in 2006.{{fact|date=September 2019}}

The [[Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona]] was founded in 2011 as a merge of four institutions: the Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona (the main site, at the [[Forum Building]]), the [[Museu Martorell]] (also known as the ''Museu de Geologia'', the Geology Museum, opened to the public from 1882 to 2010), the ''[[Laboratori de Natura]]'', at the [[Castle of the Three Dragons]] (from 1920 to 2010: the Zoology Museum) and the [[Botanical Institute of Barcelona]]. That latter includes both the [[Historical Botanical Garden of Barcelona]], founded 1930, and the [[Jardí Botànic de Barcelona|Botanical garden of Barcelona]], founded 1999.

The [[FC Barcelona Museum]] has been the most visited museum in the city of Barcelona, with 1,506,022 visitors in 2013.{{fact|date=September 2019}}

===Parks===
[[File:Parc de la Ciutadella Barcelona Mai 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Parc de la Ciutadella]] north of [[La Barceloneta]]]]
Barcelona contains sixty municipal parks, twelve of which are historic, five of which are thematic (botanical), forty-five of which are [[urban park|urban]], and six of which are forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Parcs i Jardins, Institut Municipal |url=http://www.bcn.es/parcsijardins/cat/parcs/pa_mapa.htm |title=Parcs i Jardins&gt; Els Parcs&gt; Els Parcs de Barcelona |publisher=Bcn.es |accessdate=26 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105064630/http://www.bcn.es/parcsijardins/cat/parcs/pa_mapa.htm|archivedate=5 January 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; They range from vest-pocket parks to large recreation areas. The urban parks alone cover 10% of the city ({{convert|549.7|ha|acre|1|disp=or|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;guies_estadistiques&quot;/&gt; The total park surface grows about {{convert|10|ha|acre|0|abbr=on}} per year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Parcs i Jardins, Institut Municipal|url=http://www.bcn.es/parcsijardins/cat/parcs/pa_his_ciu.htm |title=Parcs i Jardins&gt; Els Parcs&gt; Història&gt; La ciutat i el verd |publisher=Bcn.es |accessdate=26 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003183148/http://www.bcn.es/parcsijardins/cat/parcs/pa_his_ciu.htm|archivedate=3 October 2009|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a proportion of {{convert|18.1|m2|sqft|0}} of park area per inhabitant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Parcs i Jardins, Institut Municipal|url=http://www.bcn.es/parcsijardins/cat/parcs/pa_his_demo.htm |title=Parcs i Jardins&gt; Els Parcs&gt; Història&gt; La democràcia |publisher=Bcn.es |accessdate=26 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331111427/http://www.bcn.es/parcsijardins/cat/parcs/pa_his_demo.htm|archivedate=31 March 2009|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of Barcelona's parks, [[Montjuïc]] is the largest, with 203&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] located on the mountain of the same name.&lt;ref name=&quot;guies_estadistiques&quot;/&gt; It is followed by [[Parc de la Ciutadella]] (which occupies the site of the old military [[citadel]] and which houses the [[Parliament of Catalonia|Parliament]] building, the [[Barcelona Zoo]], and several museums); {{convert|31|ha|acre|1|disp=or|abbr=on}} including the zoo), the [[Guinardó Park]] ({{convert|19|ha|acre|1|disp=or|abbr=on}}), [[Park Güell]] (designed by [[Antoni Gaudí]]; {{convert|17.2|ha|acre|1|disp=or|abbr=on}}), [[Oreneta Castle Park]] (also {{convert|17.2|ha|acre|1|disp=or|abbr=on}}), [[Diagonal Mar Park]] ({{convert|13.3|ha|acre|1|disp=or|abbr=on}}, inaugurated in 2002), [[Nou Barris Central Park]] ({{convert|13.2|ha|acre|1|disp=or|abbr=on}}), [[Can Dragó Sports Park]] and [[Poblenou Park]] (both {{convert|11.9|ha|acre|1|disp=or|abbr=on}}), the [[Parc del Laberint d'Horta|Labyrinth Park]] ({{convert|9.10|ha|acre|1|disp=or|abbr=on}}), named after the garden maze it contains.&lt;ref name=&quot;guies_estadistiques&quot;/&gt; There are also several smaller parks, for example, the [[Parc de Les Aigües]] ({{convert|2|ha|acre|1|disp=or|abbr=on}}). A part of the Collserola Park is also within the city limits. [[PortAventura World]], one of the largest resort in Europe, with 5,837,509 visitors per year, is located one hour's drive from Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investindustrial.com/dam/Investindustrial/Social-responsibility/Portoflio-Companies-CSR-Reports/PortAventura-2017-Corporate-Social-Responsibility-Report/PortAventura%202017%20Corporate%20Social%20Responsibility%20Report.pdf Corporate responsibility report 2017] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181026064435/http://www.investindustrial.com/dam/Investindustrial/Social-responsibility/Portoflio-Companies-CSR-Reports/PortAventura-2017-Corporate-Social-Responsibility-Report/PortAventura%202017%20Corporate%20Social%20Responsibility%20Report.pdf |date=26 October 2018 }} – [http://www.investindustrial.com/ investindustrial.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181103131536/http://www.investindustrial.com/ |date=3 November 2018 }}, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teaconnect.org/sites/default/files/misc/files/2009report.pdf The Global Attractions Attendance Report] – [[Themed Entertainment Association]], 2009 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319052819/http://www.teaconnect.org/sites/default/files/misc/files/2009report.pdf |date=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, within the city lies [[Tibidabo Amusement Park]], a smaller amusement park in Plaza del Tibidabo, with the [[Muntanya Russa (Tibidabo Amusement Park)|Muntanya Russa]] amusement ride.

===Beaches===
[[File:Platges de Barcelona.svg|right|thumb|upright= 2.5|Beaches of Barcelona]]
Barcelona beach was listed as number one in a list of the top ten city beaches in the world according to ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;NationalGeographic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/top-10/beach-cities-photos/#/beach-barcelona-spain_21757_600x450.jpg|title=Top 10 Beach Cities|accessdate=30 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100721215624/http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/top-10/beach-cities-photos/| archivedate= 21 July 2010 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Discovery Channel]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;DiscoveryChannel&quot;&gt;Movie &quot;Worlds Best Beaches&quot;, Discovery Channel 2005 {{YouTube|8bdvj5gubnA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barcelona contains seven beaches, totalling {{convert|4.5|km|mi|abbr=off}} of coastline. [[Sant Sebastià]], [[La Barceloneta, Barcelona|Barceloneta]] and [[Somorrostro]] beaches, both {{convert|1100|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} in length,&lt;ref name=&quot;guies_estadistiques&quot;/&gt; are the largest, oldest and the most-frequented beaches in Barcelona.

The [[Olympic Harbour]] separates them from the other city beaches: Nova Icària, Bogatell, Mar Bella, Nova Mar Bella and Llevant. These beaches (ranging from {{convert|400|to|640|m|ft|abbr=on}} were opened as a result of the city restructuring to host the [[1992 Summer Olympics]], when a great number of industrial buildings were demolished. At present, the beach sand is artificially replenished given that storms regularly remove large quantities of material. The [[2004 Universal Forum of Cultures]] left the city a large concrete bathing zone on the eastmost part of the city's coastline. Most recently, Llevant is the first beach to allow dogs access during summer season.
