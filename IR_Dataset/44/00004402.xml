==Evolution and taxonomy==
The brown bear is sometimes referred to as the {{lang|enm|bruin}}, from [[Middle English]]. This name originated in the fable, ''History of [[Reynard the Fox]]'', translated by [[William Caxton]], from [[Middle Dutch]] {{lang|dum|bruun}} or {{lang|dum|bruyn}}, meaning ''[[brown]]'' (the color).&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|bruin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-19th century United States, the brown bear was termed &quot;Old Ephraim&quot; and sometimes as &quot;Moccasin Joe&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rooseeltv&quot;&gt;[https://www.fulltextarchive.com/page/Hunting-the-Grisly-and-Other-Sketches1/#p58 Hunting the Grisly and other Sketches]. FullTextArchive.com. Retrieved 15 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific name of the brown bear, ''Ursus arctos'', comes from the Latin {{lang|la|[[Bear#Etymology|ursus]]}}, meaning &quot;bear&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, Henry George and Scott, Robert. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dursus &quot;Ursus.&quot;] ''A Latin Dictionary''. Perseus Digital Library.&lt;/ref&gt; and from {{lang|grc|ἄρκτος}} {{transl|grc|arktos}}, the Greek word for bear.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, Henry George and Scott, Robert.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2315199 &quot;Arktos.&quot;] ''A Greek-English Lexicon''.

Several paleontologists suggest the possibility of two separate brown bear migrations: inland brown bears, also known as [[Grizzly bear|grizzlies]], are thought to stem from narrow-skulled bears which migrated from northern Siberia to central Alaska and the rest of the continent, while Kodiak bears descend from broad-skulled bears from Kamchatka, which colonized the Alaskan peninsula. Brown bear fossils discovered in [[Ontario]], [[Ohio]], [[Kentucky]] and [[Labrador Peninsula|Labrador]] show that the species occurred farther east than indicated in historic records.&lt;ref name=&quot;evolution&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McLellan |first1=Bruce |last2=Reiner |first2=David C. |year=1994 |title=A Review of bear evolution |url=http://www.bearbiology.com/fileadmin/tpl/Downloads/URSUS/Vol_9/McLellan_Reiner_Vol_9.pdf |journal=Int.

===Scientific taxonomy===
{{main|Subspecies of brown bear}}
[[File:Ours des pyrenees aspe 2002.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eurasian brown bear]] (''Ursus arctos arctos''), the [[nominate subspecies]]]]
There are many methods used by scientists to define bear [[species]] and [[subspecies]], as no one method is always effective. Brown bear taxonomy and subspecies classification has been described as &quot;formidable and confusing&quot; with few authorities listing the same specific set of subspecies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Wilson |first1=D. E. |last2=Ruff |first2=S. |year=1999 |title=The Smithsonian Book of North American Mammals |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution Press]] |location=[[Washington, D.C.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic testing is now perhaps the most important way to scientifically define brown bear relationships and names. Generally, genetic testing uses the word [[clade]] rather than species because a genetic test alone cannot define a [[biological species]]. Most genetic studies report on how closely related the bears are (or their [[genetic distance]]). There are hundreds of obsolete brown bear subspecies, each with its own name, and this can become confusing; Hall (1981) lists 86 different types and even as many as 90 have been proposed.&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harris|first1=Arthur H.|title=Pleistocene Vertebrates of Arizona, New Mexico, and Trans-Pecos Texas|date=2013|publisher=UTEP Biodiversity Collections, University of Texas at El Paso}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Storer1955&gt;{{cite book |last1=Storer |first1=T.I. |last2=Tevis |first2=L.P. |title=California Grizzly |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1QVZFQu01KcC&amp;pg=PA149 |archive-url=https://archive.org/details/californiagrizzl00stor |url-access=registration |year=1996 |archive-date=1955 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location=[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley, CA]] |isbn=978-0-520-20520-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/californiagrizzl00stor/page/335 335], 42–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent DNA analysis has identified as few as five main clades which contain all extant brown bears,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bearinfo.org/YESFedRegister.pdf |title=Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Designating the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem Population of Grizzly Bears as a Distinct Population Segment; Removing the Yellowstone Distinct Population Segment of Grizzly Bears From the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife |author=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |date=17 November 2006 |journal=Federal Register |volume=70 |issue=221 |pages=69854–69884 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825042929/http://www.bearinfo.org/YESFedRegister.pdf |archive-date=25 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Calvignac, S. |author2=Hughes, S. |author3=Tougard, C. |author4=Michaux, J. |author5=Thevenot, M. |author6=Philippe, M. |author7=Hamdine, W.|author8=Hanni, C.|title=Ancient DNA evidence for the loss of a highly divergent brown bear clade during historical times |journal=[[Molecular Ecology]] |year=2008 |volume=17 |issue=8 |pages=1962–1970 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-294x.2008.03631.x |pmid=18363668}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a 2017 phylogenetic study revealed nine clades, including one representing polar bears.&lt;ref name=&quot;lan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lan, T. |author2=Gill, S. |author3=Bellemain, E. |author4=Bischof, R. |author5=Zawaz, M.

As well as the exact number of overall brown bear subspecies, its precise relationship to the [[polar bear]] also remains in debate. The polar bear is a recent offshoot of the brown bear. The point at which the polar bear diverged from the brown bear is unclear, with estimations based on genetics and fossils ranging from 400,000 to 70,000 years ago, but most recent analysis has indicated that the polar bear split somewhere between 275,000 and 150,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lindqvist, C. |author2=Schuster, S.

A grizzly–polar bear hybrid (known either as a ''pizzly bear'' or a ''grolar bear'') is a rare [[ursid hybrid]] resulting from a crossbreeding of a brown bear and a [[polar bear]]. It has occurred both in captivity and in the wild. In 2006, the occurrence of this hybrid in nature was confirmed by testing the [[DNA]] of a strange-looking bear that had been shot in the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Arctic]], and seven more hybrids have since been confirmed in the same region, all descended from a single female polar bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richardson|first=Evan|last2=Branigan|first2=Marsha|last3=Paetkau|first3=David|last4=Pongracz|first4=Jodie D.|date=2017-05-31|title=Recent Hybridization between a Polar Bear and Grizzly Bears in the Canadian Arctic|journal=ARCTIC|volume=70|issue=#2|pages=151–160|doi=10.14430/arctic4643|issn=1923-1245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the hybrid had been produced in [[zoo]]s and was considered a &quot;[[Cryptozoology|cryptid]]&quot; (a hypothesized animal for which there is no scientific proof of existence in the wild).

==Description==
[[File:Brown bear (Ursus arctos arctos) smiling.jpg|thumb|right|Brown bears are highly variable in size. Eurasian brown bears often fall around the middle to low sizes for the species.]]
The brown bear is the most variable in size of modern bears. The typical size depends upon which population it is from, and most accepted subtypes vary widely in size. This is in part due to [[sexual dimorphism]], as male brown bears average at least 30% larger in most subtypes. Individual bears also vary in size seasonally, weighing the least in spring due to lack of foraging during hibernation, and the most in late fall, after a period of hyperphagia to put on additional weight to prepare for hibernation. Therefore, a bear may need to be weighed in both spring and fall to get an idea of its mean annual weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hissa, R., Siekkinen, J., Hohtola, E., Saarela, S., Hakala, A., &amp; Pudas, J. |year=1994|title=Seasonal patterns in the physiology of the European brown bear (''Ursus arctos arctos'') in Finland|pmid=8529017|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Physiology|volume= 109|issue=#3|pages= 781–791|doi=10.1016/0300-9629(94)90222-4|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/14671511}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= McLellan&gt;{{cite journal|author=McLellan, B.

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Brown bear seaguls.jpg|left|thumb|Brown bear at Brooks Falls]]
Brown bears were once native to Europe, much of Asia, the [[Atlas Mountains]] of Africa, and North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4003325.stm |title=Ancient bear made early migration |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=12 November 2004 |accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are now [[extinct]] in some areas, and their populations have greatly decreased in other areas. There are approximately 200,000 brown bears left in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown Bear | Species | WWF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Brown Bear {{!}} Species {{!}} WWF|url=http://worldwildlife.org/species/brown-bear|publisher=WWF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest populations are in Russia with 120,000,&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown Bear&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Brown Bear|url=http://www.rollinghillswildlife.com/animals/b/bearbrown/|publisher=Rolling Hills Wildlife Adventure}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United States with 32,500, and [[Canada]] with around 25,000. About 95% of the brown bear population in the United States is in Alaska, though in the lower 48 states, they are repopulating slowly but steadily along the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] and the western [[Great Plains]]. Although many people hold the belief some brown bears may be present in [[Mexico]] and the [[Atlas Mountains]] of [[Morocco]], both are almost certainly extinct. The last Mexican grizzly bear was shot in 1960. In [[Europe]], there are 14,000&amp;nbsp;brown bears in ten fragmented populations, from [[Spain]] (estimated at only 20–25 animals in the [[Pyrenees]] in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.elperiodico.cat/ca/noticias/societat/20100802/neixen-quatre-cries-dos-bru-als-pirineus/416750.shtml|date=2 August 2010|work=elperiodico.cat | title = Neixen quatre cries d'ós bru als Pirineus | accessdate = 19 November 2010 | language = Catalan, Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ecologistasenaccion.org/article17611.html|date=May 2010|publisher=ecologistasenaccion.org | title = Situació preocupant de l'ós bru als Pirineus | accessdate = 19 November 2010 | language = Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a range shared between [[France]], [[Spain]] and [[Andorra]], and some 210 animals in [[Asturias]], [[Cantabria]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Province of León|León]], in the [[Picos de Europa]] and adjacent areas in 2013 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.es/sociedad/20130929/abci-osos-desafio-poblacion-creciente-201309281954.html |work= ABC|location=Spain | title = Osos, el desafío de una población creciente| language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the west, to [[Russia]] in the east, and from [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] in the north to [[Romania]] (4000–5000), [[Bulgaria]] (900–1200), [[Slovakia]] (with about 600–800 animals), [[Slovenia]] (500–700 animals) and [[Greece]] (with about 200 animals) in the south. They are extinct in the [[British Isles]], extremely threatened in [[France]] and [[Spain]], and in trouble over most of [[Central Europe]].

Another large and relatively stable population of brown bears in Europe, consisting of 2,500–3,000 individuals, is the Dinaric-Pindos (Balkans) population, with contiguous distribution in northeast [[Italy]], [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonia]], [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kora.ch/sp-ois/bear-ois/index.htm Bear Online Information System for Europe].

Brown bears live in [[Alaska]], east through the Yukon and [[Northwest Territories]], south through [[British Columbia]] and through the western half of [[Alberta]]. The Alaskan population is estimated at a healthy 32,000 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brown Bear Research in Alaska|url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlifenews.view_article&amp;articles_id=551|publisher=Alaska Department of Fish and Game|accessdate=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small populations exist in the [[Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem]] of northwest [[Wyoming]] (with about 600 animals), the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem of northwest [[Montana]] (with about 750 animals), the Cabinet-Yaak Ecosystem of northwest Montana and northeast [[Idaho]] (with about 30–40 animals), the Selkirk Ecosystem of northeast [[Washington state|Washington]] and northwest Idaho (with about 40–50 animals), and the North Cascades Ecosystem of northcentral Washington (with about 5–10 animals). These five ecosystems combine for a total of roughly 1,470 wild grizzlies still persisting in the contiguous United States. Unfortunately, these populations are isolated from each other, inhibiting any genetic flow between ecosystems. This poses one of the greatest threats to the future survival of the grizzly bear in the contiguous United States.

In Asia, brown bears are found primarily throughout [[Russia]], thence more spottily southwest to parts of the [[Middle East]], to as far south as southwestern [[Iran]], and to the southeast in a small area of [[Northeast China]], [[Western China]], and parts of [[North Korea]], [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[India]]. They can also be found on the [[Japan]]ese island of [[Hokkaidō]], which holds the largest number of non-Russian brown bears in eastern Asia with about 2,000–3,000 animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;&gt;''Carnivores of the World'' by Dr. Luke Hunter. Princeton University Press (2011), {{ISBN|9780691152288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of brown bears in the [[Pyrenees]] mountain range between [[France]] and [[Spain]] is extremely low, estimated at 14 to 18, with a shortage of females. Their rarity in this area has led biologists to release bears, mostly female, from [[Slovenia]] in spring 2006 to reduce the imbalance and preserve the species' presence in the area. The bears were released despite protests from French farmers. A small population of brown bears (''[[Ursus arctos marsicanus]]'') still lives in central Italy (the [[Apennine Mountains]], [[Abruzzo]] and [[Latium]]), with no more than 30-40 individuals, protected by strong laws, but endangered by the human presence in the area.

In [[Arctic]] areas, the potential habitat of the brown bear is increasing. The [[Global warming|warming of that region]] has allowed the species to move farther north into what was once exclusively the domain of the [[polar bear]]. In non-Arctic areas, habitat loss is blamed as the leading cause of endangerment, followed by hunting.

This species inhabits the broadest range of habitats of any living bear species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt;
They seem to have no altitudinal preferences and have been recorded from sea-level to an elevation of {{convert|5000|m|ft|abbr=on}} (the latter in the [[Himalayas]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; In most of their range, brown bears generally seem to prefer semiopen country, with a scattering of vegetation that can allow them a resting spot during the day. However, they have been recorded as inhabiting every variety of northern [[temperate forest]] known to occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; North American brown bears, or [[grizzly bears]], generally seem to prefer open or semi-open landscapes, with the species once having been common on the [[Great Plain]]s and continues to occur in sizeable numbers in [[tundra]] and [[Estuary|coastal estuaries]] and [[island]]s. Variable numbers still occur in [[prairie]] areas of the northern [[Rocky Mountains]] (mostly in Canada but some in the contiguous United States).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; In western Eurasia, they inhabit mostly mountainous woodlands, in ranges such as the [[Alps]], the [[Pyrenees]] and the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], though they may have been driven into more wooded, precipitous habitats due to the prior extensive persecution of the species in some regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;mari&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Murtskhvaladze |first1=M. |last2=Gavashelishvili |first2=A. |last3=Tarkhnishvili |first3=D. |doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04610.x |title=Geographic and genetic boundaries of brown bear (''Ursus arctos'') population in the Caucasus |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=19 |issue=9 |pages=1829–1841 |year=2010 |pmid=20345670}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Macdonald&gt;{{cite book|year=1993|title=Mammals of Europe|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=New Jersey|page=[https://archive.org/details/mammalsofeurope00macd/page/107 107]|isbn=978-0-691-09160-0|author1=Macdonald, D.W.|author2=Barrett, P.|url=https://archive.org/details/mammalsofeurope00macd/page/107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mari&quot;/&gt; Desolate parts of northern and eastern Europe, like large patches of [[Scandinavia]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains]], have always been quite heavily forested and have maintained relatively stable populations of bears, indicating that the brown bears here are well-adapted to forest-dwelling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; In [[Central Asia]], human disturbances are minimal as this area has a harsher environment and is more sparsely populated. In this part of the world, bears may be found in [[steppe]], [[Alpine tundra|alpine meadows]] and even [[desert|desert edge]]. In [[Siberia]], the species seems well-adapted to living in denser [[Taiga|pine forests]]. Eastern Russian forests hold arguably the largest number of brown bears in the world outside of possibly Alaska and northeastern Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; It is thought the Eurasian bears which colonized America were [[tundra]]-adapted and the species is sometimes found around sub-Arctic [[ice field]]s. This is indicated by brown bears in the [[Chukotka Peninsula]] on the Asian side of Bering Strait, which are the only Asian brown bears to live year-round in lowland tundra like their North American cousins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianbearhunt.com/ |title=Brown Bear Hunting in Russia |publisher=Russianbearhunt.com |accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservation status===
While the brown bear's range has shrunk and it has faced local extinctions, it remains listed as a [[Least concern]] species by the [[IUCN]], with a total population of approximately 200,000. {{as of|2012}}, this and the [[American black bear]] are the only bear species not classified as threatened by the IUCN.&lt;ref name= IUCN/&gt;&lt;ref name= Servheen/&gt; However, the [[California grizzly bear]], [[Atlas bear]] and [[Mexican grizzly bear]], as well as brown bear populations in the [[Pacific Northwest]], were hunted to extinction in the 19th and early 20th centuries and many of the southern Asian subspecies are highly endangered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller &amp; Waits 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=CR|last2=Waits|first2=L.P.|title=Phylogeography and mitochondrial diversity of extirpated brown bear (''Ursus arctos'') populations in the contiguous United States and Mexico|journal=Mol.

===Dietary habits===
[[File:Brown Bear Feeding on Salmon.jpg|thumb|upright|Brown bear feeding on [[salmon]]]]
The brown bear is one of the most [[omnivorous]] animals in the world and has been recorded as consuming the greatest variety of foods of any bear.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; Throughout life, this species is regularly curious about the potential of eating virtually any organism or object that they encounter. Food that is both abundant and easily accessed or caught is preferred. Their jaw structure has evolved to fit their dietary habits. Their diet varies enormously throughout their differing areas based on opportunity.

Despite their reputation, most brown bears are not highly carnivorous, as they derive up to 90% of their dietary [[food energy]] from vegetable matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dced.state.ak.us/oed/student_info/learn/bearwatching.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415202025/http://www.dced.state.ak.us/oed/student_info/learn/bearwatching.htm |archivedate=15 April 2009 |title=Alaska is bear territory!|work=Alaska Office of Economic Development |publisher=Dced.state.ak.us |accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They often feed on a variety of plant life, including [[Berry|berries]], [[grass]]es, [[flower]]s, [[acorn]]s and [[pine cone]]s, as well as [[fungi]] such as [[mushroom]]s.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt; Among all bears, brown bears are uniquely equipped to dig for tough foods such as [[root]]s and [[shoot]]s. They use their long, strong claws to dig out earth to reach the roots and their powerful jaws to bite through them.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt; In spring, winter-provided carrion, grasses, shoots, sedges and forbs are the dietary mainstays for brown bears internationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; Fruits, including berries, become increasingly important during summer and early autumn. Roots and bulbs become critical in autumn for some inland bear populations if fruit crops are poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; They will also commonly consume animal matter, which in summer and autumn may regularly be in the form of [[insect]]s, [[larvae]] and [[Larva|grubs]], including [[beehive]]s. Bears in Yellowstone eat an enormous number of [[moth]]s during the summer, sometimes as many as 40,000 [[Army cutworm|army cutworm moths]] in a single day, and may derive up to half of their annual food energy from these insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yellowstonepark.com/MoreToKnow/ShowNewsDetails.aspx?newsid=163 |title=Yellowstone Grizzly Bears Eat 40,000 Moths a Day In August |publisher=Yellowstonepark.com |date=21 June 2011}}{{dead link|date=November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown bears living near coastal regions will regularly eat [[crab]]s and [[clam]]s. In Alaska, bears along the beaches of estuaries regularly dig through the sand for clams.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; This species may eat [[bird]]s and their [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s, including almost entirely ground- or rock-nesting species.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt;  The diet may be supplemented by [[rodent]]s or similar smallish [[mammal]]s, including [[marmot]]s, [[ground squirrel]]s, [[Mouse|mice]], [[rat]]s, [[lemming]]s and [[vole]]s.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt;  With particular regularity, bears in [[Denali National Park]] will wait at burrows of [[Arctic ground squirrel]]s hoping to pick off a few of the {{convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}} rodents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weaselwords.com/page/ferret_art036.php|title=Inherited behavior traits of the domesticated ferret|last=Brown|first=Susan, A|publisher=weaselwords.com|accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Kamchatka peninsula and several parts of coastal Alaska, brown bears feed mostly on spawning [[salmon]], whose nutrition and abundance explain the enormous size of the bears in these areas. The fishing techniques of bears are well-documented. They often congregate around falls when the salmon are forced to breach the water, at which point the bears will try to catch the fish in mid-air (often with their mouths). They will also wade into shallow waters, hoping to pin a slippery salmon with their claws. While they may eat almost all the parts of the fish, bears at the peak of spawning, when there is usually a glut of fish to feed on, may eat only the most nutrious parts of the salmon (including the eggs and head) and then indifferently leave the rest of the carcass to scavengers, which can include [[red fox]]es, [[bald eagle]]s, [[common raven]]s and [[gull]]s. Despite their normally solitary habits, brown bears will gather rather closely in numbers at good spawning sites. The largest and most powerful males claim the most fruitful fishing spots and bears (especially males) will sometimes fight over the rights to a prime fishing spot.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt;

Beyond the regular predation of salmon, most brown bears are not particularly active predators.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; While perhaps a majority of bears of the species will charge at large prey at one point in their lives and most eat carrion, many predation attempts start with the bear clumsily and half-heartedly pursuing the prey and end with the prey escaping alive.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; On the other hand, some brown bears are quite self-assured predators who habitually pursue and catch large prey items. Such bears are usually taught how to hunt by their mothers from an early age.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; Large mammals preyed on can include various [[ungulate]] species such as [[elk]], [[moose]], [[Reindeer|caribou]], [[Muskox|muskoxen]] and [[wild boar]].&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt; When brown bears attack these large animals, they usually target young or infirm ones, as they are easier to catch. Typically when hunting (especially with young prey), the bear pins its prey to the ground and then immediately tears and eats it alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=French |first1= S.

Brown bears may also ambush young animals by finding them via scent.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt; When emerging from hibernation, brown bears, whose broad paws allow them to walk over most ice and snow, may pursue large prey such as moose whose hooves cannot support them on encrusted snow.&lt;ref name= Macdonald/&gt; Similarly, predatory attacks on large prey sometimes occur at riverbeds, when it is more difficult for the prey specimen to run away due to muddy or slippery soil.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt; On rare occasions, while confronting fully-grown, dangerous prey, bears kill them by hitting with their powerful forearms, which can break the necks and backs of large creatures such as adult moose and adult bison.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; They also feed on [[carrion]], and use their size to intimidate other predators, such as [[Wolf|wolves]], [[cougar]]s, [[tiger]]s, and [[American black bear]]s from their kills. Carrion is especially important in the early spring (when the bears are emerging from hibernation), much of it comprised by winter-killed big game.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt; Cannibalism is not unheard of, though predation is not normally believed to be the primary motivation when brown bears attack each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt;

When forced to live in close proximity with humans and their domesticated animals, bears may potentially predate any type of domestic animal. Among these, domestic [[cattle]] are sometimes exploited as prey. Cattle are bitten on the neck, back or head and then the abdominal cavity is opened for eating.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt; Plants and fruit farmed by humans are readily consumed as well, including [[Maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[sorghum]], [[melon]]s and any form of [[Berry|berries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; They will also feed at domestic [[Beekeeping|bee farms]], readily consuming both honey and the contents of the [[honey bee]] colony.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; Human foods and trash or refuse is eaten when possible. When an open garbage dump was kept in Yellowstone, brown bears were one of the most voracious and regular scavengers. The dump was closed after both brown and American black bears came to associate humans with food and lost their natural fear of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt;

Brown bears regularly intimidate [[wolf|wolves]] to drive them away from their kills. In [[Yellowstone National Park]], brown bears pirate wolf kills so often, Yellowstone's Wolf Project director Doug Smith wrote, &quot;It's not a matter of if the bears will come calling after a kill, but when.&quot; Despite the high animosity between the two species, most confrontations at kill sites or large carcasses end without bloodshed on either side. Though conflict over carcasses is common, on rare occasions the two predators tolerate each other on the same kill. To date, there is a single case of fully-grown wolves being killed by a grizzly bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume=122 |issue=1 |year=2008 |title= Gray Wolves, ''Canis lupus'', Killed by Cougars, ''Puma concolor'', and a Grizzly Bear, ''Ursus arctos'', in Montana, Alberta, and Wyoming |author1= Jimenez, Michael D. |author2=Asher, Valpa J. |author3=Bergman, Carita |author4=Bangs, Edward E. |author5=Woodruff, Susannah P. |journal=The Canadian Field-Naturalist |page=76|doi=10.22621/cfn.v122i1.550 }} [http://mountainlion.org/US/WY/WY%20R%20Jimenez%20et%20al%202008%20Gray%20Wolves%20Killed%20by%20Cougars%20and%20Grizzly%20Bears%20in%20Montana,%20Alberta,%20and%20Wyoming%20-%20Canadian%20Field%20Naturalist.pdf PDF].&lt;/ref&gt; Given the opportunity, however, both species will prey on the other's cubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Downey, Betsy |title=Personal Encounter.

Brown bears usually dominate other bear species in areas where they coexist. Due to their smaller size, [[American black bear]]s are at a competitive disadvantage to brown bears in open, unforested areas. Although displacement of black bears by brown bears has been documented, actual interspecific killing of black bears by brown bears has only occasionally been reported. Confrontation is mostly avoided due to the black bear's diurnal habits and preference for heavily forested areas, as opposed to the brown bear's largely nocturnal habits and preference for open spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/upload/predation.pdf|title=Probable grizzly bear predation on an American black bear in Yellowstone National Park |author1=Gunther, Kerry A. |author2=Biel, Mark J. |author3=Anderson, Neil |author4=Watts, Lisette |year=2002 |journal=[[Ursus (journal)|Ursus]] |volume=13 |pages=372–374}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown bears may also kill [[Asian black bear]]s, though the latter species probably largely avoids conflicts with the Brown bear due to similar habits and habitat preferences to the American Black species.&lt;ref name=&quot;denning&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.bearbiology.com/fileadmin/tpl/Downloads/URSUS/Vol_14_2/Seryodkin_14_2.pdf |title=Denning ecology of brown bears and Asiatic black bears in the Russian Far East|jstor=3873015|author=Seryodkin, Ivan V.|journal=Ursus|volume=14|issue= 2 |year=2003|pages=153–161|last2=Kostyria|first2=A.

===Longevity and mortality===
The brown bear has a naturally long life. Wild females have been observed reproducing up to 28 years of age, which is the oldest known age for reproduction of any [[Bear|ursid]] in the wild. The peak reproductive age for females ranges from four to 20 years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schwartz, C. C., Keating, K. A., Reynolds III, H.

When brown bears come to associate human activity with a &quot;food reward&quot;, they are likely to continue to become emboldened; the likelihood of human-bear encounters increases, as they may return to the same location despite relocation. Relocation of the bear has been used to separate the bear from the human environment, but it does not address the problem of the bear's newly-learned association of humans with food or the environmental situations which created the human-habituated bear. &quot;Placing a bear in habitat used by other bears may lead to competition and social conflict, and result in the injury or death of the less dominant bear.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bearsmart.com/managingBears/Relocation.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20060513075036/http://www.bearsmart.com/managingBears/Relocation.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-05-13|title=Relocation|work=Get Bear Smart Society }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yellowstone National Park]], a reserve located in the western United States, contains prime habitat for the grizzly bear (''Ursus arctos horribilis'') and due to the enormous number of visitors, human-bear encounters are common. The scenic beauty of the area has led to an influx of people moving into the area. In addition, because there are so many bear relocations to the same remote areas of Yellowstone, and because male bears tend to dominate the center of the relocation zone, female bears tend to be pushed to the boundaries of the region and beyond. As a result, a large proportion of repeat offenders, bears that are killed for public safety, are females. This creates a further depressive effect on an already-endangered subspecies. The grizzly bear is officially described as &quot;Threatened&quot; in the U.S.. Although the problem is most significant with regard to grizzlies, these issues affect the other types of brown bears as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gunther, K. A. |author2=Haroldson, M.

In Europe, part of the problem lies with [[shepherd]]s; over the past two centuries, many sheep and goat herders have gradually abandoned the more traditional practice of using [[dog]]s to guard flocks, which have concurrently grown larger. Typically, they allow the herds to graze freely over sizeable tracts of land. As brown bears reclaim parts of their range, they may eat livestock as sheep and goats are relatively easy for a bear to kill. In some cases, the shepherds shoot the bear, thinking their livelihood is under threat. Many are now better informed about the ample compensation available and will make a claim when they lose livestock to a bear.&lt;ref name= Mustoni&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mustoni, A. |author2=Carlini, E. |author3=Chiarenzi, B. |author4=Chiozzini, S. |author5=Lattuada, E. |author6=Dupré, E. |author7=Genovesi, P. |author8=Pedrotti, L. |author9=Martinoli, A. |author10=Preatoni, D. |author11=Wauters, L. |author12=Tosi, G. |display-authors=3 |title=Planning the Brown Bear ''Ursus arctos'' reintroduction in the Adamello Brenta Natural Park |journal=Hystrix, the Italian Journal of Mammalogy |volume=14 |issue=1–2 |doi=10.4404/hystrix-14.1-2-4313 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Dahle2&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dahle |first1=B. |last2=Sørensen |first2=O.

Sows with cubs account for many attacks on humans by brown bears in North America. [[Habituation|Habituated]] or food-conditioned bears can also be dangerous, as their long-term exposure to humans causes them to lose their natural shyness and, in some cases, to associate humans with food. Small parties of one or two people are more often attacked by brown bears than large groups, with only one known case of an attack on a group of six or more. In that instance, it is thought that due to surprise, the grizzly bear may not have recognized the size of the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOLS 2011 bear attack&quot;&gt;Medred, Craig (26 July 2011) [http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/alaska-bear-attack-nols-kids-did-phenomenal-job Alaska bear attack: NOLS kids did a 'phenomenal job'], ''[[Alaska Dispatch]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In the majority of attacks resulting in injury, brown bears precede the attack with a growl or huffing sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;attack&quot;/&gt; In contrast to injuries caused by American black bears, which are usually minor, brown bear attacks more often tend to result in serious injury and, in some cases, death.&lt;ref name=&quot;attack&quot;/&gt; Brown bears seem to confront humans as they would when fighting other bears: they rise up on their hind legs, and attempt to &quot;disarm&quot; their victims by biting and holding on to the lower jaw to avoid being bitten in turn.&lt;ref name=&quot;geist&quot;/&gt; Due to the bears' enormous physical strength, even a single bite or swipe can be deadly as in tigers, with some human victims having had their heads completely crushed by a bear bite.&lt;ref name=&quot;living&quot;&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/livinganimalsofw01cornrich#page/n7/mode/2up '&amp;#39;The living animals of the world; a popular natural history with one thousand illustrations'&amp;#39; Volume 1: Mammals], by [[Charles John Cornish|Cornish, C.

Attacks on humans are considered extremely rare in the [[former Soviet Union]], though exceptions exist in districts where they are not as often pursued by hunters.&lt;ref name=&quot;soviet&quot;/&gt; East Siberian brown bears, for example, tend to be much bolder toward humans than their shyer, more persecuted European counterparts.

Within Yellowstone National Park, injuries caused by grizzly attacks in developed areas averaged approximately one per year during the 1930s through to the 1950s, though it increased to four per year during the 1960s. They then decreased to one injury every two years during the 1970s. Between 1980 and 2002, there have been only two human injuries caused by grizzly bears in a developed area. Although grizzly attacks were rare in the backcountry before 1970, the number of attacks increased to an average of approximately one per year during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yellowstone-bearman.com/yell_bear_maul_info.html Bear Caused Human Injuries and Deaths In Yellowstone National Park].

===History of defense from bears===
A study by U.S. and Canadian researchers has found [[pepper spray]] to be more effective at stopping aggressive bear behavior than guns, working in 92% of studied incidents versus 67% for guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bear.org/website/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=202&amp;Itemid=123 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101181640/http://www.bear.org/website/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=202&amp;Itemid=123 |archive-date=1 January 2011 |title=Spray more effective than guns against bears: study |publisher=North American Bear Center |author1=Smith, Herrero |author2=DeBruyn, Wilde |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrying pepper spray is highly recommended by many authorities when traveling in bear country; however, carrying two means of deterrent, one of which is a large caliber gun, is also advised. Solid shotgun slugs, or three buckshot rounds, or a pistol of .44 caliber or more is suggested if a heavy hunting rifle is not available. Guns remain a viable, last resort option to be used in defense of life from aggressive brown bears.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith_brown_bear_projects&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.absc.usgs.gov/research/brownbears/safety/safeconduct.htm |title=Brown Bear Projects at the Alaska Science Center |publisher=Alaska Science Center – Biological Science Office |last=Smith |first=Tom S |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814110427/http://www.absc.usgs.gov/research/brownbears/safety/safeconduct.htm |archivedate=14 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Too often, people do not carry a proper caliber weapon to neutralize the bear. According to the Alaska Science Center, a [[Gauge (bore diameter)|12-gauge]] [[shotgun]] with [[Slug (projectile)|slugs]] has been the most effective weapon. There have been fewer injuries as a result of only carrying lethal loads in the shotgun, as opposed to deterrent rounds.

Campers are often told to wear bright-colored red ribbons and bells and carry whistles to ward off bears. They are told to look for grizzly bear scat in camping areas and be careful to carry the bells and whistles in those areas. Grizzly bear scat is difficult to differentiate from American black bear scat, as diet is in a constant state of flux depending on the availability of seasonal food items. If a bear is killed near camp, the bear's carcass must be adequately disposed of, including entrails and blood, if possible. Failure to move the carcass has often resulted in it attracting other bears and further exacerbating a bad situation. Moving camps immediately is another recommended method.&lt;ref name=&quot;attack&quot;/&gt;

Brown bears often figure into the literature of Europe and North America, in particular that which is written for children. &quot;[[The Brown Bear of Norway]]&quot; is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[fairy tale]] telling the adventures of a girl who married a prince magically turned into a bear and who managed to get him back into a human form by the force of her love and after many trials and difficulties. With &quot;[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]&quot;, a story from England, the Three Bears are usually depicted as brown bears. In German-speaking countries, children are often told the fairytale of &quot;[[Snow White and Rose Red]]&quot;; the handsome prince in this tale has been transfigured into a brown bear. In the United States, parents often read their preschool age children the book ''[[Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?]]'' to teach them their colors and how they are associated with different animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Newman, A.

The coat of arms of [[Madrid]] depicts a bear reaching up into a ''madroño'' or [[Arbutus unedo|strawberry tree]] (''Arbutus unedo'') to eat some of its fruit, whereas the Swiss city of [[Bern]]'s coat of arms also depicts a bear and the city's name is popularly thought to derive from the German word for bear. The brown bear is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 5 [[Croatian kuna|kuna]] coin, minted since 1993.

[[File:Berni Bayern.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Berni is a brown bear mascot of the German football club [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]]]
The [[Bundesliga]] club [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] has a brown bear mascot named Berni. The [[National Football League]] (NFL) franchise in Chicago, Illinois, is named the [[Chicago Bears|Bears]]. In this context, no differentiation between American black and brown bears is needed. The school mascot for [[Bob Jones University]], [[Brown University]], [[George Fox University]], the [[University of Alberta]], the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], the [[University of California, Riverside]], and numerous American [[high school]]s is the brown bear.

In the town of [[Prats de Molló]], in [[Vallespir]], southern France, a &quot;bear festival&quot; (''festa de l'ós'') is celebrated annually at the beginning of spring, in which the locals dress up as bears, cover themselves with soot or coal and oil and &quot;attack&quot; the onlookers, attempting to get everyone dirty. The festival ends with the ''ball de l'os'' (bear dance).
