[[File:Beta-lactam.svg|thumb|120px|right|[[2-Azetidinone]], the simplest β-lactam]]
A  '''beta-lactam''' ('''β-lactam''') ring is a four-membered [[lactam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Gilchrist T | title = Heterocyclic Chemistry | publisher = Longman Scientific | location = Harlow | year = 1987 | isbn = 978-0-582-01421-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A lactam is a cyclic [[amide]].) It is named as such because the nitrogen atom is attached to the [[Β carbon|β-carbon]] atom relative to the carbonyl. The simplest β-lactam possible is [[2-azetidinone]].

==Clinical significance==
[[Image:Penicillin core.svg|thumb|180px|Penicillin core structure]]
The β-lactam ring is part of the core structure of several [[antibiotic]] families, the principal ones being the [[penicillin]]s, [[cephalosporin]]s, [[carbapenem]]s, and [[monobactam]]s, which are, therefore, also called [[β-lactam antibiotic]]s. Nearly all of these antibiotics work by inhibiting bacterial [[cell wall]] biosynthesis. This has a lethal effect on [[bacteria]], although any given bacteria population will typically contain a subgroup that is [[antibiotic resistance|resistant]] to β-lactam antibiotics. [[antibiotic resistance|Bacterial resistance]] occurs as a result of the expression of one of many genes for the production of [[beta-lactamase|β-lactamases]], a class of enzymes that break open the β-lactam ring. More than 1,800 different β-lactamase enzymes have been documented in various species of bacteria.&lt;ref name=Brandt&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brandt C, Braun SD, Stein C, Slickers P, Ehricht R, Pletz MW, Makarewicz O | title = In silico serine β-lactamases analysis reveals a huge potential resistome in environmental and pathogenic species | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 7 | issue =  | pages = 43232 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28233789 | pmc = 5324141 | doi = 10.1038/srep43232 | bibcode = 2017NatSR...743232B }}&lt;/ref&gt; These enzymes vary widely in their chemical structure and catalytic efficiencies.&lt;ref name=Ehmann&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ehmann DE, Jahić H, Ross PL, Gu RF, Hu J, Kern G, Walkup GK, Fisher SL | title = Avibactam is a covalent, reversible, non-β-lactam β-lactamase inhibitor | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 29 | pages = 11663–8 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22753474 | pmc = 3406822 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1205073109 | bibcode = 2012PNAS..10911663E }}&lt;/ref&gt; When bacterial populations have these resistant subgroups, treatment with β-lactam can result in the resistant strain becoming more prevalent and therefore more virulent. β-lactam derived antibiotics can be considered as one of the most important antibiotic classes but prone to clinical resistance. β-lactam exhibits its antibiotic properties by imitating the naturally occurring d-Ala-d-Ala substrate for the group of enzymes known as [[penicillin binding proteins]] (PBP), which have as function to cross-link the peptidoglycan part of the cell wall of the bacteria.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5219821&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tipper DJ, Strominger JL | title = Mechanism of action of penicillins: a proposal based on their structural similarity to acyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 54 | issue = 4 | pages = 1133–41 | date = October 1965 | pmid = 5219821 | pmc = 219812 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.54.4.1133 | bibcode = 1965PNAS...54.1133T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first synthetic β-lactam was prepared by [[Hermann Staudinger]] in 1907 by reaction of the [[Schiff base]] of [[aniline]] and [[benzaldehyde]] with [[diphenylketene]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tidwell TT | title = Hugo (Ugo) Schiff, Schiff bases, and a century of beta-lactam synthesis | journal = Angewandte Chemie | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 1016–20 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18022986 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200702965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Staudinger H | journal = Justus Liebigs Ann.

Up to 1970, most β-lactam research was concerned with the [[penicillin]] and [[cephalosporin]] groups, but since then, a wide variety of structures have been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Flynn EH |title=Cephalosporins and Penicillins : Chemistry and Biology|year=1972|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York and London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid30209477&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hosseyni S, Jarrahpour A | title = Recent advances in β-lactam synthesis | journal = Organic &amp; Biomolecular Chemistry | volume = 16 | issue = 38 | pages = 6840–6852 | date = October 2018 | pmid = 30209477 | doi = 10.1039/c8ob01833b }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An efficient [[Catalysis|catalytic]] synthetic strategy towards beta‐lactams involving “[[in situ]]” generation of [[Ketene|ketenes]] and subsequent trapping with [[Imine|imines]] was reported by the group of de Bruin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paul ND, Chirila A, Lu H, Zhang XP, de Bruin B | title = Carbene radicals in cobalt(II)-porphyrin-catalysed carbene carbonylation reactions; a catalytic approach to ketenes | journal = Chemistry | volume = 19 | issue = 39 | pages = 12953–8 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 24038393 | pmc = 4351769 | doi = 10.1002/chem.201301731 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carbonylation]] of [[carbene radical]] intermediates using the cheap and highly active cobalt(II) tetramethyltetraaza[14]annulene catalyst [Co(MeTAA)] provided a convenient [[One-pot synthesis|one‐pot]] synthetic protocol towards trans-selective beta lactams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Chirila A, van Vliet KM, Paul ND, de Bruin B |date=2018|title=[Co(MeTAA)] Metalloradical Catalytic Route to Ketenes via Carbonylation of Carbene Radicals|journal=European Journal of Inorganic Chemistry|language=en|volume=2018|issue=20–21|pages=2251–2258|doi=10.1002/ejic.201800101|issn=1099-0682|url=https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/34388611/Chirila_et_al_2018_European_Journal_of_Inorganic_Chemistry.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactivity==
Due to [[ring strain]], β-lactams are more readily [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] than linear amides or larger lactams. This strain is further increased by fusion to a second ring, as found in most β-lactam antibiotics. This trend is due to the amide character of the β-lactam being reduced by the [[Plane (geometry)|aplanarity]] of the system. The nitrogen atom of an ideal amide is [[Orbital hybridisation|sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridized]] due to [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance]], and sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridized atoms have [[Trigonal planar molecular geometry|trigonal planar bond geometry]]. As a [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramidal]] bond geometry is forced upon the nitrogen atom by the ring strain, the resonance of the amide bond is reduced, and the carbonyl becomes more [[ketone]]-like. [[Nobel laureate]] [[Robert Burns Woodward]] described a parameter ''h'' as a measure of the height of the trigonal pyramid defined by the nitrogen (as the [[Apex (geometry)|apex]]) and its three adjacent atoms. ''h'' corresponds to the strength of the β-lactam bond with lower numbers (more planar; more like ideal amides) being stronger and less reactive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Woodward RB | title = Penems and related substances | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences | volume = 289 | issue = 1036 | pages = 239–50 | date = May 1980 | pmid = 6109320 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.1980.0042 | bibcode = 1980RSPTB.289..239W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monobactams have ''h'' values between 0.05 and 0.10 [[angstrom]]s (Å). Cephems have ''h'' values in of 0.20&amp;ndash;0.25 Å. Penams have values in the range 0.40&amp;ndash;0.50 Å, while carbapenems and clavams have values of 0.50&amp;ndash;0.60 Å, being the most reactive of the β-lactams toward hydrolysis.&lt;ref name = &quot;Nangia_1996&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nangia A, Biradha K, Desiraju GR | year = 1996 | title = Correlation of biological activity in β-lactam antibiotics with Woodward and Cohen structural parameters: A Cambridge database study | url = | journal = J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. | volume = 2 | issue = 5| pages = 943–53 | doi=10.1039/p29960000943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other applications==
A new study has suggested that β-lactams can undergo ring-opening [[polymerization]] to form amide bonds, to become nylon-3 polymers. The backbones of these polymers are identical to peptides, which offer them biofunctionality. These nylon-3 polymers can either mimic [[host defense peptides]] or act as signals to stimulate [[3T3 cells|3T3]] [[stem cell]] function.&lt;ref name = &quot;Nangia_1996&quot; /&gt;

[[Antiproliferative agent]]s that target tubulin with β-lactams in their structure have also been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Boyle NM, Carr M, Greene LM, Bergin O, Nathwani SM, McCabe T, Lloyd DG, Zisterer DM, Meegan MJ | title = Synthesis and evaluation of azetidinone analogues of combretastatin A-4 as tubulin targeting agents | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 53 | issue = 24 | pages = 8569–84 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21080725 | doi = 10.1021/jm101115u | url = http://arrow.dit.ie/scschcpsart/62 | hdl = 2262/81779 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Boyle NM, Greene LM, Bergin O, Fichet JB, McCabe T, Lloyd DG, Zisterer DM, Meegan MJ | title = Synthesis, evaluation and structural studies of antiproliferative tubulin-targeting azetidin-2-ones | journal = Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 19 | issue = 7 | pages = 2306–25 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21397510 | doi = 10.1016/j.bmc.2011.02.022 | url = http://www.tara.tcd.ie/bitstream/2262/54923/1/Synthesis%2c%20evaluation%20and%20structural%20studies%20of%20antiproliferative%20tubulin-targeting%20azetidin-2-ones.pdf | hdl = 2262/54923 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
