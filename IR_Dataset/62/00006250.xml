Colorado Springs has many features of a modern urban area such as parks, bike trails, and open spaces. However, it is not exempt from problems that typically plague cities experiencing tremendous growth such as overcrowded roads and highways, crime, sprawl, and government budget issues. Many of the problems are indirectly or directly caused by the city's difficulty in coping with the large population growth experienced since 1997, and the annexation of the [[Banning Lewis Ranch]] area to accommodate further population growth of 175,000 future residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gazette.com/article/125568|title=Another strange twist in Banning Lewis Ranch bankruptcy|work=Colorado Springs Gazette|access-date=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
Colorado Springs has a cooler, dry-winter [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSkw''), and its location just east of the Rocky Mountains affords it the rapid warming influence from [[chinook winds]] during winter but also subjects it to drastic day-to-day variability in weather conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://climate.colostate.edu/climateofcolorado.php |title=Colorado Climate Center – Climate of Colorado |publisher=Climate.colostate.edu |accessdate=July 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703034302/http://climate.colostate.edu/climateofcolorado.php |archivedate=July 3, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city has abundant sunshine year-round, averaging 243 sunny days per year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestplaces.net/climate/city/colorado/colorado_springs |title=Colorado Springs, Colorado Climate |publisher=BestPlaces |accessdate=October 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.denverpost.com/weather/2012/01/03/colorado-sunshine-not-all-its-hyped-up-to-be/110/ |title=Colorado sunshine is more myth than science |work=The Denver Post |date=January 3, 2012 |accessdate=October 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and receives approximately {{convert|16.5|in|mm|0}} of annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. Due to unusually low precipitation for several years after flooding in 1999, Colorado Springs enacted lawn water restrictions in 2002. These were lifted in 2005.&lt;ref name=SpringsGovInfo&gt;{{cite web| date = November 3, 2010 | url = http://www.springsgov.com/Page.aspx?NavID=1188 | title=City of Colorado Springs – Drought}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nikola Tesla, with his equipment Wellcome M0014782.jpg|thumb|[[Nikola Tesla]] sitting in the Colorado Springs Experimental Station with his &quot;[[magnifying transmitter]]&quot; generating millions of volts]]
Colorado Springs is one of the most active lightning strike areas in the United States. This natural phenomenon led [[Nikola Tesla]] to select Colorado Springs as the preferred location to build his lab and study electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_colspr.html |title=Tesla, Life and Legacy |publisher=pbs.org |accessdate=April 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Seasonal climate====
Winters range from mild to moderately cold, with December, the coldest month, averaging {{convert|30.8|°F|1}}; historically January has been the coldest month, but, in recent years, December has had both lower daily maxima and minima.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climate-zone.com/climate/united-states/colorado/colorado-springs/ |title=Colorado Springs |publisher=Climate-zone.com |accessdate=September 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, there are 5.2 nights with sub-{{convert|0|°F|0}} lows and 23.6 days where the high does not rise above freezing.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA&quot; /&gt;

Snowfall is usually moderate and remains on the ground briefly because of direct sun, with the city receiving {{convert|38|in|cm|0}} per season, although the mountains to the west often receive in excess of triple that amount; March is the snowiest month in the region, both by total accumulation and number of days with measurable snowfall. In addition, 8 of the top 10 heaviest 24-hour snowfalls have occurred from March to May.&lt;ref name = NOAA/&gt; Summers are warm, with July, the warmest month, averaging {{convert|70.9|°F|1}}, and 18 days of {{convert|90|°F|0}}+ highs annually. Due to the high elevation and aridity, nights are usually relatively cool and rarely does the low remain above {{convert|70|°F|0}}.&lt;ref name = NOAA/&gt;&lt;!--As of Summer 2012, No. 10 extreme high daily minimum is 69&amp;nbsp;°F--&gt; Dry weather generally prevails, but brief afternoon thunderstorms are common, especially in July and August when the city receives the majority of its annual rainfall, due to the [[North American Monsoon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dri.edu/monsoon|title=Evolution of the North American Monsoon|work=DRI Desert Research Institute|access-date=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first autumn freeze and the last freeze in the spring, on average, occur on October 2 and May 6, respectively; the average window for measurable snowfall (≥{{convert|0.1|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is October 21 through April 25. Extreme temperatures range from {{convert|101|°F|0}} on [[Summer 2012 North American heat wave|June 26, 2012]] and most recently on June 21, 2016, down to {{convert|−27|°F|0}} on February 1, 1951 and December 9, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.climatespy.com/climate/summary/united-states/colorado/city-of-colorado-springs-muni/february|title=Colorado Springs, CO climate in February|last=climateSpy.com|website=climatespy.com|access-date=February 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227232106/http://www.climatespy.com/climate/summary/united-states/colorado/city-of-colorado-springs-muni/february|archive-date=February 27, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the plan is to make the interstate eight lanes through the city when funding becomes available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmixproject.com/ |title=Litter Removal Program |publisher=Colorado Department of Transportation's (CDOT) |accessdate=September 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114182606/http://cosmixproject.com/ |archivedate=January 14, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan is similar in nature to Denver's T-Rex expansion plan.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Work has been completed to expand Interstate 25 from 4 to 6 lanes between Woodmen Road (exit 149, the northern terminus for the COSMIX project) and Monument (exit 161).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coloradodot.info/projects/I25NorthCOSDB |title=I-25 North Design Build (Colorado Springs) – CDOT |publisher=Coloradodot.info |accessdate=January 19, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126175510/http://www.coloradodot.info/projects/I25NorthCOSDB |archive-date=January 26, 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zubeck |first=Pam |url=http://www.csindy.com/IndyBlog/archives/2012/12/29/i-25-widening-project-coming-soon |title=I-25 widening project coming soon &amp;#124; IndyBlog |publisher=Csindy.com |date=December 29, 2012 |accessdate=January 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} [[U.S. Route 24 in Colorado|US 24]] runs across the central mountains, through the city, and onto the plains. From west to east in Colorado Springs, US 24 includes the western portion of Cimarron Street and the Midland Expressway, a {{convert|2|mile}} concurrent section with I-25/US 87 between exits 139 and 141, part of Fountain Blvd, an expressway called the Martin Luther King Bypass, part of South Powers Blvd (where it is concurrent with Colorado 21), and the easternmost portion of Platte Avenue out of the city.

====State highways====
A number of state highways serve the city. [[Colorado State Highway 21|State Highway 21]] is a major east side semi-expressway from [[Black Forest, Colorado|Black Forest]] to Fountain. It is widely known as Powers Boulevard. [[Colorado State Highway 83|State Highway 83]] runs north-south from [[Denver]] to northern Colorado Springs. [[Colorado State Highway 94|State Highway 94]] runs east-west from western [[Cheyenne County, Colorado|Cheyenne County]] to eastern Colorado Springs. [[Colorado State Highway 115|State Highway 115]] begins in [[Cañon City, Colorado|Cañon City]] and runs up Nevada Avenue. US 85 and SH 115 are concurrent between Lake Avenue and I-25. [[U.S. Route 85 in Colorado|US 85]] enters the city at Fountain and was signed at Venetucci Blvd, Lake Avenue, and Nevada Avenue.{{refn|In addition, there were plans to develop a &quot;Front Range Toll Road&quot;, a privately owned [[Toll road|turnpike]], which would begin south of Pueblo and end around Fort Collins. This toll road would allow rail and truck traffic to avoid the more highly traveled parts of I-25 along the Front Range. Initially, the project had support but has since been highly contested because of the need to condemn the land of many private citizens, through the use of [[eminent domain]], to make room for the corridor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nosuperslab.org/crap/how_to.html |title=? |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303061620/http://www.nosuperslab.org/crap/how_to.html |archivedate=March 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}

====County and city roads====
In November 2015, voters in Colorado Springs overwhelmingly passed ballot measure 2C, dedicating funds from a temporary sales tax increase to much needed road and infrastructure improvements over five years. This temporary increase is estimated to bring in approximately $50 million annually, which will be used solely to improve roads and infrastructure. The Ballot measure passed by a margin of approximately 65–35%,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.elpasoelections.com/2015Coordinated/Results/results.html|title = El Paso County Clerk and Recorder|access-date = February 10, 2016|website = 2015 Coordinated Election Results}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was championed by newly elected Mayor [[John Suthers]].

In 2004, the voters of Colorado Springs and El Paso County established the Pikes Peak Rural Transportation Authority&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pprta.com |title=PPRTA Homepage |publisher=Pprta.com |date=September 28, 2009 |accessdate=October 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted a 1% sales tax dedicated to improving the region's transportation infrastructure. Together with state funding for the Colorado Springs Metro Interstate Expansion (COSMIX) (2007 completion) and the I-25 interchange with Highway 16 (2008 completion), significant progress has been made since 2003 in addressing the transportation needs of the area.

In early 2010, the city of Colorado Springs approved an expansion of the northernmost part of Powers Boulevard in order to create an Interstate 25 bypass commonly referred to as the Copper Ridge Expansion.&lt;ref name=&quot;For the love of the road&quot; /&gt;{{refn|The project developers also have hopes of increasing business at the future I-25 Powers Boulevard connection by building a {{convert|2.8|e6ft3|e3m3|abbr=unit}} shopping mall on the East side of the Powers exit.&lt;ref name=&quot;For the love of the road&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.csindy.com/colorado/for-the-love-of-a-road/Content?oid=2033692 |title=For the love of a road; Colorado Springs Independent, The (Colorado Springs) |publisher=csindy.com |date=February 3, 2011 |accessdate=February 9, 2011 | first=Ed | last=Sealover}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developers hope to have the project finished by 2013, but have a deadline of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.csindy.com/colorado/noted/Content?oid=1706080 |title=Copper Ridge takes a step; Colorado Springs Independent, The (Colorado Springs) &amp;#124; Find Articles |publisher=csindy.com |date=May 13, 2010 |accessdate=February 9, 2011 | first=Ed | last=Sealover}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}

===Air transport===
[[Colorado Springs Airport]] (COS) has been in operation since 1925. It is the second-largest commercial airport in the state, after [[Denver International Airport]] (DEN). It covers {{convert|7,200|acre}} of land at an elevation of approximately {{convert|6,200|ft}}. COS is considered to be a joint-use civilian and military airport, as [[Peterson Air Force Base]] is a tenant of the airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://coloradosprings.gov/flycos/about-airport |website=FLY COS|title=About the Airport|date=October 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has three paved runways: 17L/35R is {{convert|13,501|by|150|ft}}, the runway 17R/35L is {{convert|11,022|by|150|ft}} and the runway 13/31 is {{convert|8,270|by|150|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gcr1.com/5010web/airport.cfm?Site=COS|website=AirportIQ 5010|title=AirportIQ 5010|access-date=May 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190203064413/https://www.gcr1.com/5010web/airport.cfm?Site=COS|archive-date=February 3, 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, the Colorado Springs City Council approved a Bike Master Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= https://coloradosprings.gov/bikes/page/bike-master-plan |title= Bike Master Plan |publisher=City of Colorado Springs |accessdate=February 26, 2019|date= July 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vision of the city's Bike Master Plan is “a healthy and vibrant Colorado Springs where bicycling is one of many transportation options for a large portion of the population, and where a well-connected and well-maintained network of urban trails, single-track, and on-street infrastructure offers a bicycling experience for present and future generations that is safe, convenient, and fun for getting around, getting in shape, or getting away.” In October 2018, [[Bicycling (magazine)|''Bicycling'']] ranked Colorado Springs the 28th best US city for bicycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= https://www.bicycling.com/culture/a23676188/best-bike-cities-2018/ |title=The Best Bike Cities in America |publisher=Hearst Magazine Media, Inc. |accessdate=February 26, 2019|date=October 10, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bike lanes in Colorado Springs have not been deployed without controversy.  According to [[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|''The Gazette'']], their readers “have mixed feelings for new bike lanes.” &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= https://gazette.com/opinion/hate-it-or-love-it-gazette-readers-have-mixed-feelings/article_d656fa12-b823-11e8-a832-af86a882dc51.html|title= Bike Master Plan |publisher=City of Colorado Springs |accessdate=February 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, the City removed a bike lane along Research Parkway due to overwhelming opposition; an online survey found that 80.5% of respondents opposed the bike lane.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= https://gazette.com/news/colorado-springs-terminating-disputed-bike-lane-project/article_aaa70f21-b643-556c-b64d-62c80d270ef5.html |title= Colorado Springs terminating disputed bike lane project |publisher=The Gazette|accessdate=February 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gazette has stated that since the Bike Master Plan was adopted by City Council, “no issue has elicited more argument in The Gazette pages,” and due to this immense public interest, on February 25, 2019, The Gazette hosted a [[town hall meeting]] called “Battle of the Bike Lanes.”  &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= https://gazette.com/conversations/battle-of-the-bike-lanes-in-colorado-springs-a-community/article_8d07a236-2e56-11e9-926d-bf596adbce66.html |title= Battle of the Bike Lanes in Colorado Springs: A Community Conversation|publisher=The Gazette |accessdate=February 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= https://www.kktv.com/content/news/Battle-of-the-Bike-Lanes-in-Colorado-Springs-A-Community-Conversation-505909361.html|title= WATCH: Battle of the bike lanes in Colorado Springs, a community conversation|publisher=KKTV |accessdate=February 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colorado Springs's sister city organization began when it became partners with Fujiyoshida. The ''torii'' gate erected to commemorate the relationship stands at the corner of Bijou Street and Nevada Avenue, and is one of the city's most recognizable landmarks. The [[Shinto|''torii'' gate]], crisscrossed bridge and shrine, in the median between Platte and Bijou Streets downtown, were a gift to Colorado Springs, erected in 1966 by the Rotary Club of Colorado Springs to celebrate the friendship between the two communities. A plaque near the ''torii'' gate states that &quot;the purpose of the sister city relationship is to promote understanding between the people of our two countries and cities&quot;. The Fujiyoshida Student exchange program has become an annual event.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

To strengthen relations between the two cities, the Colorado Springs Youth Symphony regularly invites taiko drummers from the city to participate in a joint concert in the Pikes Peak Center. The orchestra played in Bankstown, Australia, in 2002 and again in June 2006 as part of their tours to Australia and New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In 2006 and 2010, the Bankstown TAP (Talent Advancement Program) performed with the Youth Symphony and the Colorado Springs Children's Chorale as part of the annual &quot;In Harmony&quot; program.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}
A notable similarity between Colorado Springs and its sister cities is their geographic positions: three of the seven cities are near the foot of a major mountain or mountain range, as is Colorado Springs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.springsgov.com/Page.asp?NavID=1923 |title = City of Colorado Springs – Topic Pages |publisher = Springsgov.com |date = July 6, 2007 |accessdate = October 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
