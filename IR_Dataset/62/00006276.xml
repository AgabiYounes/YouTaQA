The '''Casiquiare river''' ({{IPA-es|kasiˈkjaɾe}}) is a [[distributary]] of the upper [[Orinoco]] flowing southward into the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]], in [[Venezuela]], South America. As such, it forms a unique natural canal between the Orinoco and [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] river systems. It is the world's largest river of the kind that links two major river systems, a so-called [[River bifurcation|bifurcation]]. The area forms a [[Drainage divide|water divide]], more dramatically at regional flood stage.

==Discovery==
In 1744 a [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] priest named Father Roman, while ascending the [[Orinoco River]], met some [[Portugal|Portuguese]] slave-traders from the settlements on the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]]. He accompanied them on their return, by way of the Casiquiare canal, and afterwards retraced his route to the Orinoco. [[Charles Marie de La Condamine]], seven months later, was able to give to the ''[[Académie française]]'' an account of Father Roman's voyage, and thus confirm the existence of this waterway, first reported by [[Cristóbal Diatristán de Acuña|Father Acuña]] in 1639.&lt;ref name=EB1911Amaz/&gt;

Little credence was given to Father Roman's statement until it was verified, in 1756, by the [[Spain|Spanish]] Boundary-line Commission of José Yturriaga and [[José Solano y Bote|Solano]].&lt;ref name=EB1911Amaz/&gt; In 1800 German scientist [[Alexander von Humboldt]]&lt;ref name=EB1911Ori&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Orinoco |volume=20 |pages=275–276}}&lt;/ref&gt; and French botanist [[Aimé Bonpland]] explored the river. During a 1924–25 expedition, [[Alexander H. Rice, Jr.]] of [[Harvard University]] traveled up the Orinoco, traversed the Casiquiare canal, and descended the Rio Negro to the Amazon at Manaus. It was the first expedition to use aerial photography and [[shortwave radio]] for mapping of the region. In 1968 the Casiquiare was navigated by an [[SRN6 hovercraft]] during a [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Graham Clarke|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1565257/Graham-Clarke.html|work= [[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher= |date= 2007-10-07|accessdate=2008-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

The origin of the Casiquiare, at the River Orinoco, is {{convert|9|mi|km|order=flip}} below the mission of [[La Esmeralda, Venezuela|La Esmeralda]] at {{coord|3|8|18.5|N|65|52|42.5|W|region:VE-X_type:landmark|display=inline}}, and about {{convert|123|m|ft}} above sea level. Its mouth at the Rio Negro, an affluent of the [[Amazon River]], is near the town of [[San Carlos de Río Negro|San Carlos]] and is {{convert|91|m|ft}} above sea level.

The general course is south-west, and its length, including windings, is about {{convert|200|mi|km|-1|order=flip}}. Its width, at its [[river bifurcation|bifurcation]] with the Orinoco, is approximately {{convert|300|ft|m|-1|order=flip}}, with a current towards the Rio Negro of {{convert|0.75|mph|m/s|1|order=flip}}. However, as it gains in volume from the very numerous [[tributary]] streams, large and small, that it receives en route, its velocity increases, and in the wet season reaches {{convert|5|mph|m/s|1|order=flip}}, even {{convert|8|mph|m/s|1|order=flip}} in certain stretches. It broadens considerably as it approaches its mouth, where it is about {{convert|1750|ft|m|order=flip|0}} wide. The volume of water the Casiquiare captures from the Orinoco is small in comparison to what it accumulates in its course.&lt;ref name=EB1911Amaz&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Amazon |volume=1 |pages=783–790 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the geological processes are ongoing, and evidence points to a slow and gradual increase in the size of Casiquiare. It is likely that [[stream capture]] is in progress, i.e. what currently is the uppermost Orinoco basin, including [[Cunucunuma River]], eventually will be entirely diverted by the Casiquiare into the Amazon basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editors=Quinn, J.A.; and S.L. Woodward | year=2015 | title=Earth's Landscape: An Encyclopedia of the World's Geographic Features | volume=1 | pages=141–142 | isbn=978-1-61069-445-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In flood time, it is said to have a second connection with the Rio Negro by a branch, which it throws off to the westward, called the [[Itinivini]], which leaves it at a point about {{convert|50|mi|km|-1|order=flip}} above its mouth. In the dry season, it has shallows, and is obstructed by sandbanks, a few rapids and granite rocks. Its shores are densely wooded, and the soil more fertile than that along the Rio Negro. The general slope of the plains through which the canal runs is south-west, but those of the Rio Negro slope south-east.&lt;ref name=EB1911Amaz/&gt;

The Casiquiare is not a sluggish canal on a flat tableland, but a great, rapid river which, if its upper waters had not found contact with the Orinoco, perhaps by cutting back, would belong entirely to the Negro branch of the Amazon.&lt;ref name=EB1911Amaz/&gt;

To the west of the Casiquiare, there is a much shorter and easier [[portage]] between the Orinoco and Amazon basins, called the isthmus of [[Pimichin]], which is reached by ascending the Temi branch of the [[Atabapo River]], an affluent of the Orinoco. Although the Temi is somewhat obstructed, it is believed that it could easily be made navigable for small craft. The isthmus is {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} across, with undulating ground, nowhere over {{convert|50|ft|m|order=flip|0}} high, with swamps and marshes. It is much used for the transit of large canoes, which are hauled across it from the Temi river, and which reach the Rio Negro by the little stream called the Pimichin.&lt;ref name=EB1911Amaz/&gt;

==Hydrographic divide==
The Casiquiare canal – Orinoco River hydrographic divide is a representation of the [[hydrography|hydrographic]] [[water divide]] that delineates the separation between the Orinoco Basin and the [[Amazon Basin]]. (The Orinoco Basin flows west&amp;ndash;north&amp;ndash;northeast into the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]]; the Amazon Basin flows east into the western [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] in the extreme northeast of [[Brazil]].)

Essentially the river divide is a west-flowing, upriver section of Venezuela's Orinoco River with an outflow to the south into the Amazon Basin. This named outflow is the Casiquiare canal, which, as it heads downstream (southerly), picks up speed and also accumulates water volume.

The greatest manifestation of the divide is during floods. During flood stage, the Casiquiare's main outflow point into the Rio Negro is supplemented by an overflow that is a second, and more minor, entry river bifurcation into the Rio Negro and upstream from its major, common low-water entry confluence with the Rio Negro. At flood, the river becomes an area flow source, far more than a narrow confined river.

The Casiquiare canal connects the upper Orinoco, {{convert|9|mi|km|order=flip}} below the mission of Esmeraldas, with the Rio Negro affluent of the Amazon River near the town of San Carlos.&lt;ref name=EB1911Amaz/&gt;

The simplest description (besides the entire area-floodplain) of the water divide is a &quot;south-bank Orinoco River strip&quot; at the exit point of the Orinoco, also the origin of the Casiquiare canal. However, during the Orinoco's flood stage, that single, simply defined &quot;origin of the canal&quot; is turned into a region, and an entire strip along the southern bank of the Orinoco River.
