The '''Canadian Shield''', also called the '''Laurentian Plateau''', or ''{{lang|fr|Bouclier canadien}}'' (French), is a large area of exposed [[Precambrian]] [[Igneous rock|igneous]] and high-grade [[metamorphic rock]]s ([[Shield (geology)|geological shield]]) that forms the ancient geological core of the [[North America]]n continent ([[Laurentia|the North American Craton or Laurentia]]). Composed of igneous rock resulting from its long volcanic history, the area is covered by a thin layer of [[soil]].&lt;ref name =EG&gt;Stephen Marshak. ''Essentials of Geology''. 3rd ed.&lt;/ref&gt; With a deep, common, joined [[bedrock]] region in eastern and central [[Canada]], it stretches north from the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Arctic Ocean]], covering over half of Canada; it also extends south into the northern reaches of the [[United States]].

The Canadian Shield is a [[Physiographic regions of the world|physiographic division]] comprising five smaller physiographic provinces:  the [[Laurentian Upland]], [[Kazan Region]], Davis, Hudson and James.&lt;ref name=ca-atlas&gt;{{Cite web| authorlink =Atlas of Canada |title=Physiographic Regions Map|author=The Atlas of Canada |publisher=Natural Resources Canada |date=|url=https://atlas.gc.ca/phys/en/ |format= |accessdate=2019-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shield extends into the [[United States geology|United States]] as the [[Adirondack Mountains]] (connected by the [[Frontenac Axis]]) and the [[Superior Upland#The Superior Upland|Superior Upland]]. The Canadian Shield is U-shaped and is a subsection of the Laurentia [[craton]] signifying the area of greatest [[glacial]] impact (scraping down to bare rock) creating the thin soils. The Canadian Shield is more than 3.96 billion years old. The Canadian Shield once had jagged peaks, higher than any of today's mountains, but millions of years of erosion have changed these mountains to rolling hills.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canadian Encyclopedia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=James-Abra|first1=Erin|title=Canadian Shield|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/shield/|website=Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=24 January 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111135123/http://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/shield/|archivedate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Shield is a collage of [[Archean]] plates and accreted juvenile arc [[terrane]]s and [[sedimentary basin]]s of the [[Proterozoic]] Eon that were progressively amalgamated during the interval 2.45 to 1.24 [[Ga (unit)|Ga]], with the most substantial growth period occurring during the [[Trans-Hudson orogeny]], between ca. 1.90 to 1.80 Ga.&lt;ref name=Corrigan&gt;{{cite journal |author=Corrigan, D. |year=2008 |title=Metallogeny and Tectonic Evolution of the Trans-Hudson Orogen |url=http://www.pdac.ca/pdac/conv/2008/pdf-tech-session/ts-corrigan.pdf | accessdate =2008-03-05 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409105436/http://www.pdac.ca/pdac/conv/2008/pdf-tech-session/ts-corrigan.pdf |archivedate = April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian Shield was the first part of North America to be permanently elevated above sea level and has remained almost wholly untouched by successive encroachments of the sea upon the continent. It is the Earth's greatest area of exposed Archean rock. The metamorphic base rocks are mostly from the Precambrian (between 4.5 billion and 540 million years ago) and have been repeatedly uplifted and eroded. Today it consists largely of an area of low relief {{convert|300|to|610|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level with a few [[monadnock]]s and low mountain ranges (including the [[Torngat Mountains|Torngat]] and [[Laurentian Mountains]]) probably eroded from the plateau during the [[Cenozoic]] Era. During the [[Pleistocene]] Epoch, continental ice sheets depressed the land surface creating [[Hudson Bay]], scooped out thousands of lake basins, and carried away much of the region's soil.

When the [[Greenland]] section is included, the Shield is approximately circular, bounded on the northeast by the northeast edge of Greenland, with Hudson Bay in the middle. It covers much of Greenland, [[Labrador]], most of [[Quebec]] north of the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence River]], much of [[Ontario]] including northern sections of the [[Ontario Peninsula]], the Adirondack Mountains&lt;ref&gt;Peterson Field Guide to Geology of Eastern North America by Roberts, David &amp; Roger Tory Peterson.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[New York (state)|New York]], the northernmost part of Lower [[Michigan]] and all of [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Michigan]], northern [[Wisconsin]], northeastern [[Minnesota]], the central/northern portions of [[Manitoba]] away from Hudson Bay, northern [[Saskatchewan]], a small portion of northeastern [[Alberta]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abheritage.ca/abnature/shield/shield.htm Alberta Heritage - Alberta Online Encyclopedia] {{webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/2217/20101208161019/http://www.abheritage.ca/abnature/shield/shield.htm |date=2010-12-08 }} - The Canadian Shield Region of Alberta&lt;/ref&gt; and the mainland northern [[Canadian territories]] to the east of a line extended north from the Saskatchewan/Alberta border ([[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]]).&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Canadian-Shield|author=Encyclopædia Britannica|authorlink=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Canadian Shield|accessdate=2009-02-10|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624232123/http://www.britannica.com/place/Canadian-Shield|archivedate=2015-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, the exposed area of the Shield covers approximately {{convert|8000000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}. The true extent of the Shield is greater still and stretches from the [[North American Cordillera|Western Cordillera]] in the west to the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] in the east and as far south as [[Texas]], but these regions are overlaid with much younger rocks and sediment.&lt;!---, but by some definitions these submerged regions may not ''technically'' be part of the Shield since they are not on the surfaces. ---&gt;

== Geology ==
[[Image:Temagami greenstone belt pillow lava.jpg|thumb|right|Weathered Precambrian [[pillow lava]] in the [[Temagami Greenstone Belt]]]]
The Canadian Shield is among the oldest on earth, with regions dating from 2.5 to 4.2 billion years.&lt;ref&gt;Tsuyoshi Iizuka, at al., ''Geology and Zircon Geochronology of the Acasta Gneiss Complex,'' Precambrian Research, 153 (2007) pp. 179 - 208&lt;/ref&gt; 
The multitude of rivers and lakes in the entire region is caused by the [[drainage basin|watersheds]] of the area being so young and in a state of sorting themselves out with the added effect of [[post-glacial rebound]]. The Shield was originally an area of very large, very tall [[mountain]]s (about {{convert|12000|m|disp=or}})&lt;ref&gt;

Each belt probably grew by the coalescence of accumulations erupted from numerous vents, making the tally of volcanoes reach the hundreds. Many of Canada's major ore deposits are associated with Precambrian volcanoes.

The [[Sturgeon Lake Caldera]] in [[Kenora District, Ontario]], is one of the world's best preserved [[mineralization (geology)|mineralized]] [[Neoarchean]] [[caldera]] complexes, which is 2.7 billion years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.d.umn.edu/~rmorton/ronshome/Volcanoes/calderas.html Caldera Volcanoes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814221700/http://www.d.umn.edu/~rmorton/ronshome/Volcanoes/calderas.html |date=2012-08-14 }} Retrieved on 2007-07-20&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian Shield also contains the [[Mackenzie dike swarm]], which is the largest [[dike swarm]] known on [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1190/1.1444345|title=Removing varying directional trends in aeromagnetic data|journal=Geophysics|volume=63|issue=2|pages=446–453|year=1998|last1=Pilkington|first1=Mark|last2=Roest|first2=Walter R.|bibcode=1998Geop...63..446P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mountains have deep roots and float on the denser [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] much like an [[iceberg]] at [[sea]]. As mountains erode, their roots rise and are eroded in turn. The rocks that now form the surface of the [[Shield (geology)|Shield]] were once far below the Earth's surface.

The high pressures and temperatures at those depths provided ideal conditions for mineralization. Although these mountains are now heavily eroded, many large mountains still exist in Canada's far north called the [[Arctic Cordillera]]. This is a vast deeply dissected [[mountain range]], stretching from northernmost [[Ellesmere Island]] to the northernmost tip of Labrador. The range's highest peak is Nunavut's [[Barbeau Peak]] at {{convert|2616|m}} above [[sea level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite bivouac|261|Barbeau Peak}}&lt;/ref&gt; Precambrian rock is the major component of the bedrock.

The North American craton is the bedrock forming the heart of the North American continent and the Canadian Shield is the largest exposed part of the craton's bedrock.

The Canadian Shield is part of an ancient continent called [[Arctica]], which was formed about 2.5 billion years ago during the [[Neoarchean]] era. It was split into Greenland, Laurentia, [[Scotland]], and [[Siberia]], and is now roughly situated in the [[Arctic]] around the current [[North Pole]].

== Ecology ==
&lt;!---not quite ready to delete this yet, but it does not seem germane to geology. Definitely of use to a GEOGRAPHY article about the same area---&gt;
The current [[geomorphology|surface expression]] of the Shield is one of very thin soil lying on top of the [[bedrock]], with many bare outcrops. This arrangement was caused by severe [[glacier|glaciation]] during the [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]], which covered the Shield and scraped the rock clean.

The lowlands of the Canadian Shield have a very dense soil that is not suitable for forestation; it also contains many marshes and bogs ([[muskeg]]s). The rest of the region has coarse soil that does not retain moisture well and is frozen with [[permafrost]] throughout the year. Forests are not as dense in the north.

The Shield is covered in parts by vast [[boreal forest]]s in the south that support natural [[ecosystem]]s as well as a major [[logging]] industry. The boreal forest area gives way to the [[Eastern Canadian Shield taiga]] that covers northern Quebec and most of Labrador. The [[Midwestern Canadian Shield forests]] that run westwards from [[Northwestern Ontario]] have boreal forests that give way to taiga in the most northerly parts of Manitoba and Saskatchewan. [[Hydrography|Hydrographical]] drainage is generally poor, the soil compacting effects of [[glaciation]] being one of the many causes. [[Tundra]] typically prevails in the northern regions. Many mammals such as [[caribou]], [[white-tailed deer]], [[moose]], [[Gray wolf|wolves]], [[wolverine]]s, [[weasel]]s, [[mink]], [[otter]]s, [[grizzly bear]], [[polar bear]]s and [[American black bear|black bears]] are present.&lt;ref&gt;{{NatGeo ecoregion|id=na0612|name=Northern Canadian Shield taiga}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of polar bears (''Ursus maritimus'') the Shield area contains many of the [[Maternity den|denning]] locations such as the [[Wapusk National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;C.

== Mining and economics ==
The Canadian Shield is one of the world's richest areas in terms of [[mineral]] [[ore]]s. It is filled with substantial deposits of [[nickel]], [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[copper]]. Throughout the Shield there are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and one of the best known, is [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Ontario]]. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since the [[Sudbury Basin]] is an ancient [[meteorite]] [[impact crater]]. [[Ejecta]] from the meteorite impact was found in the [[Rove Formation]] in May 2007. The nearby but less known [[Temagami Magnetic Anomaly]] has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin. This suggests it could be a second metal-rich impact crater.&lt;ref name=&quot;GH&quot;&gt;[http://gdcinfo.agg.nrcan.gc.ca/app/3Dimaging/temagami_e.html 3-D Magnetic Imaging using Conjugate Gradients: Temagami anomaly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711184237/http://gdcinfo.agg.nrcan.gc.ca/app/3Dimaging/temagami_e.html |date=2009-07-11 }} Retrieved on 2008-03-12&lt;/ref&gt;

In northeastern Quebec, the giant [[Manicouagan Reservoir]] is the site of an extensive [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] project (Manic-cinq, or Manic-5). This is one of [[List of impact craters on Earth#Largest craters (10 Ma or more)|the largest-known meteorite impact craters on Earth]].

The [[Flin Flon greenstone belt]] in central Manitoba and east-central Saskatchewan is one of the largest [[Paleoproterozoic]] volcanic-hosted massive [[sulfide]] ([[Volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposit|VMS]]) districts in the world, containing 27 [[copper]]-[[zinc]]-([[gold]]) deposits from which more than 183 million tons{{Clarify|date=March 2009}}&lt;!--metric, short or long tons?--&gt; of sulfide have been mined.&lt;ref name=Norris&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Norris, Jessica |title=Report on the 2007 Diamond Drilling Program McClarty Lake Project, Manitoba |publisher=Aurora Geosciences Ltd. |year=2007 |url=http://www.troymet.com/i/pdf/2007McClarty43-101.pdf |accessdate=2008-02-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530010956/http://www.troymet.com/i/pdf/2007McClarty43-101.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shield, particularly the portion in the Northwest Territories, has recently been the site of several major [[diamond]] discoveries. The [[kimberlite]] pipes in which the diamonds are found are closely associated with cratons, which provide the deep [[lithosphere|lithospheric]] [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] required to stabilize diamond as a mineral. The kimberlite eruptions then bring the diamonds from over {{convert|150|km}} depth to the surface. The [[Ekati Diamond Mine|Ekati]] and [[Diavik Diamond Mine|Diavik]] mines are actively mining kimberlite diamonds.
