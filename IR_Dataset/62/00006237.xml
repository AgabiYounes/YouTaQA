It is about the celebration of a birth. The fact of the date and the fact of the birth are two different things. The calendrical verification of the feast itself is not really that important ... What is important to the understanding of a life-changing moment is that it happened, not necessarily where or when it happened. The message is clear: Christmas is not about marking the actual birth date of Jesus. It is about the Incarnation of the One who became like us in all things but sin ([[Hebrews 4:15]]) and who humbled Himself &quot;to the point of death-even death on a cross&quot; (Phil. 2:8). Christmas is a pinnacle feast, yes, but it is not the beginning of the liturgical year. It is a memorial, a remembrance, of the birth of Jesus, not really a celebration of the day itself. We remember that because the Jesus of history was born, the Resurrection of the Christ of faith could happen. |accessdate = April 2, 2009| isbn = 978-1-4185-8073-5| date = November 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Voice-Christmas&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.crivoice.org/cyxmas.html|title = The Christmas Season|publisher = CRI / Voice, Institute|accessdate = April 2, 2009|quote = The origins of the celebrations of Christmas and Epiphany, as well as the dates on which they are observed, are rooted deeply in the history of the early church. There has been much scholarly debate concerning the exact time of the year when Jesus was born, and even in what year he was born. Actually, we do not know either. The best estimate is that Jesus was probably born in the springtime, somewhere between the years of 6 and 4 BC, as December is in the middle of the cold rainy season in [[Bethlehem]], when the sheep are kept inside and not on pasture as told in the Bible. The lack of a consistent system of timekeeping in the first century, mistakes in later calendars and calculations, and lack of historical details to cross-reference events have led to this imprecision in fixing Jesus' birth. This suggests that the Christmas celebration is not an observance of a historical date, but a commemoration of the event in terms of worship.|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090407051524/http://www.crivoice.org/cyxmas.html|archive-date = April 7, 2009|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvard University&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=x_kBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA469&amp;dq=date+of+christmas+unimportant#v=onepage&amp;q=date%20of%20christmas%20unimportant| title = The School Journal, Volume 49|publisher = [[Harvard University]]|quote=Throughout the Christian world the 25th of December is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus Christ.

The choice of that day was, of course, wholly arbitrary, for neither the exact date not the period of the year at which the birth of Christ occurred is known.

The gospels of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] and [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] describe Jesus as being born in [[Bethlehem]] to the [[Virgin Mary]]. In Luke, Joseph and Mary travel from [[Nazareth]] to Bethlehem for the census, and Jesus is born there and laid in a manger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/64496/biblical-literature &quot;Biblical literature&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426082426/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/64496/biblical-literature |date=April 26, 2015 }}, ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2011.

Christmas played a role in the [[Arian controversy]] of the fourth century. After this controversy ran its course, the prominence of the holiday declined for a few centuries. The feast regained prominence after 800 when Charlemagne was crowned emperor on Christmas Day. Later during the Protestant Reformation, the Puritans banned Christmas in England, associating it with drunkenness and other misbehavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Durston&quot;&gt;Durston, Chris, [http://www.historytoday.com/dt_main_allatonce.asp?gid=12890&amp;aid=&amp;tgid=&amp;amid=12890&amp;g12890=x&amp;g9130=x&amp;g30026=x&amp;g20991=x&amp;g21010=x&amp;g19965=x&amp;g19963=x &quot;Lords of Misrule: The Puritan War on Christmas 1642–60&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310013925/http://www.historytoday.com/dt_main_allatonce.asp?gid=12890&amp;aid=&amp;tgid=&amp;amid=12890&amp;g12890=x&amp;g9130=x&amp;g30026=x&amp;g20991=x&amp;g21010=x&amp;g19965=x&amp;g19963=x |date=March 10, 2007 }}, ''History Today'', December 1985, '''35''' (12) pp. 7 – 14.&lt;/ref&gt; It was restored as a legal holiday in England in 1660, but remained disreputable in the minds of many people.

=== Introduction of the festival ===
Christmas does not appear on the lists of festivals given by the early Christian writers Irenaeus and Tertullian.&lt;ref name=&quot;CathChrit&quot; /&gt; Origen and Arnobius both fault the pagans for celebrating birthdays, which suggests that Christmas was not celebrated in their time.&lt;ref&gt;McCracken, George, ''Arnobius of Sicca, the Case Against the Pagans'', Volume 2, p. 83. &quot;Therefore if this is a fact, how can Jupiter be god if it is agreed that god is everlasting, while the other is represented by you to have a birthday, and frightened by the new experience, to have squalled like an infant.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Arnobius wrote after AD 297. The Chronography of 354 records that a Christmas celebration took place in Rome in 336.&lt;ref&gt;The manuscript reads, ''VIII kal. Ian. natus Christus in Betleem Iudeae.'' (&quot;[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/chronography_of_354_12_depositions_martyrs.htm The Chronography of 354 AD.

In the [[Eastern Christianity|East]], the birth of Jesus was celebrated in connection with the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] on January 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h5VQUdZhx1gC&amp;pg=PA65 |editor-first1=Geoffrey |editor-last1=Wainwright |editor-first2=Karen Beth |editor-last2=Westerfield Tucker |title=The Oxford History of Christian Worship |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-19-513886-3 |page=65 |accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roy&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Traditional_Festivals_An_Multicultur.html?id=ANxZYgEACAAJ |first=Christian |last=Roy |title=Traditional Festivals: A Multicultural Encyclopedia |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2005 |place=Santa Barbara, California |isbn=978-1-57607-089-5 |page=146 |accessdate=February 3, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111115502/http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Traditional_Festivals_An_Multicultur.html?id=ANxZYgEACAAJ |archive-date=January 11, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; This holiday was not primarily about the nativity, but rather the [[baptism of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/historyofepiphany|title=History of Epiphany|last=Pokhilko|first=Hieromonk Nicholas|accessdate=December 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923004605/https://sites.google.com/site/historyofepiphany/|archive-date=September 23, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christmas was promoted in the East as part of the revival of [[Orthodox Christianity]] that followed the death of the pro-[[Arianism|Arian]] Emperor [[Valens]] at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378.

December 25 was the date of the [[winter solstice]] on the Roman calendar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradt&quot;&gt;Bradt, Hale, ''Astronomy Methods'', (2004), p. 69.&lt;br /&gt;Roll, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SolsticeDate&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/SF/WinSol.html Bruma] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010145627/http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/SF/WinSol.html |date=October 10, 2006 }}&quot;, ''Seasonal Festivals of the Greeks and Romans''&lt;br /&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137&amp;query=head%3D%231117 18:59]&lt;/ref&gt; A late fourth-century sermon by [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] explains why this was a fitting day to celebrate Christ's nativity: &quot;Hence it is that He was born on the day which is the shortest in our earthly reckoning and from which subsequent days begin to increase in length. He, therefore, who bent low and lifted us up chose the shortest day, yet the one whence light begins to increase.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, [http://www.dec25th.info/Augustine's%20Sermon%20192.html Sermon 192] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125175806/http://dec25th.info/Augustine's%20Sermon%20192.html |date=November 25, 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linking Jesus to the Sun was supported by various Biblical passages. Jesus was considered to be the &quot;Sun of righteousness&quot; prophesied by [[Malachi]]: &quot;Unto you shall the sun of righteousness arise, and healing is in his wings.&quot;&lt;ref name=Malachi /&gt;

Such solar symbolism could support more than one date of birth. An anonymous work known as ''De Pascha Computus'' (243) linked the idea that creation began at the spring equinox, on March 25, with the conception or birth (the word ''nascor'' can mean either) of Jesus on March 28, the day of the creation of the sun in the Genesis account. One translation reads: &quot;O the splendid and divine providence of the Lord, that on that day, the very day, on which the sun was made, March 28, a Wednesday, Christ should be born.&lt;ref name=&quot;CathChrit&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roll&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6MXPEMbpjoAC&amp;pg=PA82 |first=Susan K. |last=Roll |title=Towards the Origin of Christmas |publisher=Kok Pharos Publishing |year=1995 |isbn=978-90-390-0531-6 |page=82, cf. note 115 |accessdate=December 25, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231223014/https://books.google.com/books?id=6MXPEMbpjoAC&amp;pg=PA82 |archive-date=December 31, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, [[Isaac Newton]], who, coincidentally, was born on December 25, argued that the date of Christmas was selected to correspond with the solstice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;&gt;Newton, Isaac, ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16878/16878-h/16878-h.htm Observations on the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918001221/http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16878/16878-h/16878-h.htm |date=September 18, 2012 }}'' (1733). Ch. XI. A sun connection is possible because Christians considered Jesus to be the &quot;Sun of righteousness&quot; prophesied in Malachi 4:2: &quot;But for you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness shall rise with healing in its wings. You shall go out leaping like calves from the stall.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Steven Hijmans of the University of Alberta, &quot;It is cosmic symbolism ... which inspired the Church leadership in Rome to elect the [[southern solstice]], December 25, as the birthday of Christ, and the [[northern solstice]] as that of John the Baptist, supplemented by the equinoxes as their respective dates of conception.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hijmans&quot;&gt;Hijmans, S.E., ''[https://www.scribd.com/doc/33490806/Hijmans-Sol-The-Sun-in-the-Art-and-Religions-of-Rome Sol, the sun in the art and religions of Rome],'' 2009, p. 595. {{ISBN|978-90-367-3931-3}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510231050/http://www.scribd.com/doc/33490806/Hijmans-Sol-The-Sun-in-the-Art-and-Religions-of-Rome |date=May 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Calculation hypothesis ====
The calculation hypothesis suggests that an earlier holiday held on March 25 became associated with the Incarnation.&lt;ref name=SCM&gt;Bradshaw, Paul F., [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_New_SCM_Dictionary_of_Liturgy_and_Wo.html?id=ZrVDmaXP6HEC &quot;Christmas&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109153143/https://books.google.com/books/about/The_New_SCM_Dictionary_of_Liturgy_and_Wo.html?id=ZrVDmaXP6HEC |date=January 9, 2017 }}, ''The New SCM Dictionary of Liturgy of Worship'', Hymns Ancient and Modern Ltd., 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars refer to this feast as the Quartodecimal. Christmas was then calculated as nine months later. The calculation hypothesis was proposed by French writer [[Louis Duchesne]] in 1889.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roll87&quot;&gt;Roll, pp. 88–90.&lt;br /&gt;Duchesne, Louis, ''Les Origines du Culte Chrétien,'' Paris, 1902, 262 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bib-arch.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Andrew McGowan |url=http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-topics/new-testament/how-december-25-became-christmas/ |title=How December 25 Became Christmas |magazine=Bible Review &amp; Bible History Daily |publisher=[[Biblical Archaeology Society]] |accessdate=February 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214085336/http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-topics/new-testament/how-december-25-became-christmas/ |archive-date=December 14, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, March 25 is celebrated as [[Annunciation]]. This holiday was created in the seventh century and was assigned to a date that is nine months before Christmas, in addition to being the traditional date of the equinox. It is unrelated to the Quartodecimal, which had been forgotten by this time.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Annunciation, ''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' 2nd edition, 2003, Catholic University of America Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Christians celebrated the life of Jesus on a date considered equivalent to 14 Nisan (Passover) on the local calendar. Because Passover was held on the 14th of the month, this feast is referred to as the Quartodecimal. All the major events of Christ's life, especially the passion, were celebrated on this date. In his letter to the Corinthians, Paul mentions Passover, presumably celebrated according to the local calendar in Corinth.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|5:7–8|ESV}}: &quot;Our paschal lamb, Christ, has been sacrificed. Therefore let us celebrate the festival...&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Tally, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Tertullian (d. 220), who lived in Latin-speaking North Africa, gives the date of passion celebration as March 25.&lt;ref&gt;Roll, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; The date of the passion was moved to Good Friday in 165 when [[Pope Soter]] created Easter by reassigning the Resurrection to a Sunday. According to the calculation hypothesis, the celebration of the quartodecimal continued in some areas and the feast became associated with Incarnation.

The calculation hypothesis is considered academically to be &quot;a thoroughly viable hypothesis&quot;, though not certain.&lt;ref&gt;Roll (1995), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; It was a traditional Jewish belief that great men were born and died on the same day, so lived a whole number of years, without fractions: Jesus was therefore considered to have been conceived on March 25, as he died on March 25, which was calculated to have coincided with 14&amp;nbsp;Nisan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LR0Nyt3bi_MC&amp;pg=PA99|title=Historical Dictionary of Catholicism|isbn=9780810857551|last1=Collinge|first1=William J.|year=2012|access-date=December 23, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231223014/https://books.google.com/books?id=LR0Nyt3bi_MC&amp;pg=PA99|archive-date=December 31, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; A passage in ''Commentary on the Prophet Daniel'' (204) by [[Hippolytus of Rome]] identifies December 25 as the date of the nativity. This passage is generally considered a late interpellation. But the manuscript includes another passage, one that is more likely to be authentic, that gives the passion as March 25.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chronicon.net/chroniconfiles/Hippolytus%20and%20December%2025th.pdf Hippolytus and December 25th as the date of Jesus' birth] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913113155/http://www.chronicon.net/chroniconfiles/Hippolytus%20and%20December%2025th.pdf |date=September 13, 2018 }}, Roll (1995), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 221, [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] (c.&amp;nbsp;160 – c.&amp;nbsp;240) gave March 25 as the day of creation and of the conception of Jesus in his universal history. This conclusion was based on solar symbolism, with March 25 the date of the equinox. As this implies a birth in December, it is sometimes claimed to be the earliest identification of December 25 as the nativity. However, Africanus was not such an influential writer that it is likely he determined the date of Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Joseph F. |last=Kelly |title=The Origins of Christmas |publisher=Liturgical Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-8146-2984-0 |page= 60}} Online here [http://www.baylor.edu/content/services/document.php/159111.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219095613/http://www.baylor.edu/content/services/document.php/159111.pdf |date=February 19, 2017 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tractate ''De solstitia et aequinoctia conceptionis et nativitatis Domini nostri Iesu Christi et Iohannis Baptistae,'' falsely attributed to [[John Chrysostom]], also argued that Jesus was conceived and crucified on the same day of the year and calculated this as March 25.&lt;ref name=ODCC /&gt;&lt;ref name=Senn&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_WHCk9tyaNoC&amp;pg=PA114|title=Introduction to Christian Liturgy|isbn=9781451424331|last1=Senn|first1=Frank C.|year=2012|access-date=December 23, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231223014/https://books.google.com/books?id=_WHCk9tyaNoC&amp;pg=PA114|archive-date=December 31, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This anonymous tract also states: &quot;But Our Lord, too, is born in the month of December&amp;nbsp;... the eight before the calends of January [25 December]&amp;nbsp;..., But they call it the 'Birthday of the Unconquered'. Who indeed is so unconquered as Our Lord...? Or, if they say that it is the birthday of the Sun, He is the Sun of Justice.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CathChrit&quot; /&gt;

==== History of religions hypothesis ====
The rival &quot;History of Religions&quot; hypothesis suggests that the Church selected December 25 date to appropriate festivities held by the Romans in honor of the Sun god [[Sol Invictus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SCM&quot; /&gt; This cult was established by Aurelian in 274. An explicit expression of this theory appears in an annotation of uncertain date added to a manuscript of a work by 12th-century Syrian bishop [[Jacob Bar-Salibi]]. The scribe who added it wrote:

With regard to a December religious feast of the deified Sun (Sol), as distinct from a solstice feast of the birth (or rebirth) of the astronomical sun, one scholar has commented that &quot;while the winter solstice on or around December 25 was well established in the Roman imperial calendar, there is no evidence that a religious celebration of Sol on that day antedated the celebration of Christmas&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/33490806/Hijmans-Sol-The-Sun-in-the-Art-and-Religions-of-Rome |first=S.E. |last=Hijmans |title=The Sun in the Art and Religions of Rome |isbn=978-90-367-3931-3 |page=588 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510231050/http://www.scribd.com/doc/33490806/Hijmans-Sol-The-Sun-in-the-Art-and-Religions-of-Rome |archive-date=May 10, 2013 |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Thomas Talley has shown that, although the Emperor Aurelian's dedication of a temple to the sun god in the Campus Martius (C.E. 274) probably took place on the 'Birthday of the Invincible Sun' on December 25, the cult of the sun in pagan Rome ironically did not celebrate the winter solstice nor any of the other quarter-tense days, as one might expect.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson&quot;&gt;Michael Alan Anderson, ''Symbols of Saints: Theology, ritual, and kinship in music for John the Baptist and St. Anne (1175–1563)'' The University of Chicago, UMI&amp;nbsp;/ ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, Ann Arbor 2008, pp. 42–46, {{ISBN|978-0-54956551-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Oxford Companion to Christian Thought'' remarks on the uncertainty about the order of precedence between the religious celebrations of the Birthday of the Unconquered Sun and of the birthday of Jesus, stating that the hypothesis that December 25 was chosen for celebrating the birth of Jesus on the basis of the belief that his conception occurred on March 25 &quot;potentially establishes 25 December as a Christian festival before Aurelian's decree, which, when promulgated, might have provided for the Christian feast both opportunity and challenge&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Tucker |first=Karen B.

=== Post-classical history ===
[[File:Nativity from Sherbrooke Missal cropped.jpg|thumb|left|''The Nativity'', from a 14th-century [[Missal]]; a liturgical book containing texts and music necessary for the celebration of Mass throughout the year]]
In the [[Early Middle Ages]], Christmas Day was overshadowed by Epiphany, which in [[western Christianity]] focused on the visit of the [[Biblical Magi|magi]]. But the medieval calendar was dominated by Christmas-related holidays. The forty days before Christmas became the &quot;forty days of St. Martin&quot; (which began on November 11, the feast of [[St. Martin of Tours]]), now known as Advent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot;&gt;Murray, Alexander, [http://www.historytoday.com/alexander-murray/medieval-christmas &quot;Medieval Christmas&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213224341/http://www.historytoday.com/alexander-murray/medieval-christmas |date=December 13, 2011 }}, ''History Today'', December 1986, '''36''' (12), pp. 31 – 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, former [[Saturnalia]]n traditions were attached to Advent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot; /&gt; Around the 12th century, these traditions transferred again to the [[Twelve Days of Christmas]] (December 25 – January 5); a time that appears in the liturgical calendars as Christmastide or Twelve Holy Days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot; /&gt;

The prominence of Christmas Day increased gradually after [[Charlemagne]] was crowned Emperor on Christmas Day in 800. King [[Edmund the Martyr]] was anointed on Christmas in 855 and King [[William I of England]] was crowned on Christmas Day 1066.

[[File:Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld (German - The Coronation of Charlemagne - Google Art Project.jpg|alt=|thumb|The coronation of Charlemagne on Christmas of 800 helped promote the popularity of the holiday]]

By the [[High Middle Ages]], the holiday had become so prominent that chroniclers routinely noted where various [[magnate]]s celebrated Christmas. [[Richard II of England|King Richard II]] of England hosted a Christmas feast in 1377 at which twenty-eight oxen and three hundred sheep were eaten.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot; /&gt; The Yule boar was a common feature of medieval Christmas feasts. [[Christmas carol|Caroling]] also became popular, and was originally performed by a group of dancers who sang. The group was composed of a lead singer and a ring of dancers that provided the chorus. Various writers of the time condemned caroling as lewd, indicating that the unruly traditions of Saturnalia and Yule may have continued in this form.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot; /&gt; &quot;[[Lord of Misrule|Misrule]]&quot;—drunkenness, promiscuity, gambling—was also an important aspect of the festival. In England, gifts were exchanged on [[New Year's Day]], and there was special Christmas ale.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot; /&gt;

Christmas during the Middle Ages was a public festival that incorporated [[ivy]], [[holly]], and other evergreens.&lt;ref name=mcgreevy /&gt; Christmas [[gift-giving]] during the Middle Ages was usually between people with legal relationships, such as tenant and landlord.&lt;ref name=mcgreevy&gt;McGreevy, Patrick. &quot;Place in the American Christmas,&quot; ([https://www.jstor.org/stable/215896 JSTOR] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215223504/https://www.jstor.org/stable/215896 |date=December 15, 2018 }}), ''Geographical Review'', Vol. 80, No. 1.

Retrieved September 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The annual indulgence in eating, dancing, singing, sporting, and card playing escalated in England, and by the 17th century the Christmas season featured lavish dinners, elaborate masques, and pageants.

===Modern history===
Associating it with drunkenness and other misbehaviour, the Puritans banned Christmas in England in the 17th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Durston&quot; /&gt; It was restored as a legal holiday in 1660, but remained disreputable. In the early 19th century, the [[Oxford Movement]] in the [[Anglican Church]] ushered in &quot;the development of richer and more symbolic forms of worship, the building of neo-Gothic churches, and the revival and increasing centrality of the keeping of Christmas itself as a Christian festival&quot; as well as &quot;special charities for the poor&quot; in addition to &quot;special services and musical events&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rowel1993&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowell|first=Geoffrey|date=December 1993|journal=[[History Today]]|volume=43|issue=12|quote=There is no doubt that A Christmas Carol is first and foremost a story concerned with the Christian gospel of liberation by the grace of God, and with incarnational religion which refuses to drive a wedge between the world of spirit and the world of matter. Both the Christmas dinners and the Christmas dinner-carriers are blessed; the cornucopia of Christmas food and feasting reflects both the goodness of creation and the joy of heaven. It is a significant sign of a shift in theological emphasis in the nineteenth century from a stress on the Atonement to a stress on the Incarnation, a stress which found outward and visible form in the sacramentalism of the Oxford Movement, the development of richer and more symbolic forms of worship, the building of neo-Gothic churches, and the revival and increasing centrality of the keeping of Christmas itself as a Christian festival. ... In the course of the century, under the influence of the Oxford Movement's concern for the better observance of Christian festivals, Christmas became more and more prominent. By the later part of the century cathedrals provided special services and musical events, and might have revived ancient special charities for the poor – though we must not forget the problems for large: parish-church cathedrals like Manchester, which on one Christmas Day had no less than eighty couples coming to be married (the signing of the registers lasted until four in the afternoon). The popularity of Dickens' A Christmas Carol played a significant part in the changing consciousness of Christmas and the way in which it was celebrated. The popularity of his public readings of the story is an indication of how much it resonated with the contemporary mood, and contributed to the increasing place of the Christmas celebration in both secular and religious ways that was firmly established by the end of the nineteenth century.|accessdate=December 28, 2016|url=http://www.historytoday.com/geoffrey-rowell/dickens-and-construction-christmas|title=Dickens and the Construction of Christmas|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229101255/http://www.historytoday.com/geoffrey-rowell/dickens-and-construction-christmas|archive-date=December 29, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Dickens]] and other writers helped in this revival of the holiday by &quot;changing consciousness of Christmas and the way in which it was celebrated&quot; as they emphasized family, religion, gift-giving, and social reconciliation as opposed to the historic revelry common in some places.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rowel1993&quot;/&gt;

However, in 17th century England, some groups such as the [[Puritan]]s, strongly condemned the celebration of Christmas, considering it a Catholic invention and the &quot;trappings of [[Papist|popery]]&quot; or the &quot;rags of [[The Beast (Bible)|the Beast]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Durston&quot; /&gt; In contrast, the established [[Church of England|Anglican Church]] &quot;pressed for a more elaborate observance of feasts, penitential seasons, and saints' days.

Churches across France were renamed &quot;Temples of Reason&quot; and the Notre Dame was &quot;de-baptized&quot; for the occasion. The Commune spared no expense: &quot;The first festival of reason, which took place in Notre Dame, featured a fabricated mountain, with a temple of philosophy at its summit and a script borrowed from an opera libretto. At the sound of Marie-Joseph Chénier's Hymne à la Liberté, two rows of young women, dressed in white, descended the mountain, crossing each other before the 'altar of reason' before ascending once more to greet the goddess of Liberty.&quot; As you can probably gather from the above description, 1793 was not a great time to celebrate Christmas in the capital.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101103908/http://historybuff.com/christmas-renamed-dog-day-french-revolution/|archive-date=November 1, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early-19th century, writers imagined [[Tudor period|Tudor]] Christmas as a time of heartfelt celebration.

In Britain, the [[Christmas tree#18th and 19th centuries|Christmas tree]] was introduced in the early 19th century following the personal union with the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] by [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], wife of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]].

In 1822, [[Clement Clarke Moore]] wrote the poem ''[[A Visit From St. Nicholas]]'' (popularly known by its first line: ''Twas the Night Before Christmas'').&lt;ref&gt;Moore's poem transferred the genuine old Dutch traditions celebrated at New Year in New York, including the exchange of gifts, family feasting, and tales of &quot;sinterklass&quot; (a derivation in Dutch from &quot;Saint Nicholas&quot;, from whence comes the modern &quot;Santa Claus&quot;) to Christmas.[http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/ch/in_america.htm ''The history of Christmas: Christmas history in America''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419103042/http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/ch/in_america.htm |date=April 19, 2018 }}, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
The poem helped popularize the tradition of exchanging gifts, and seasonal Christmas shopping began to assume economic importance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usinfo.state.gov/scv/Archive/2005/Dec/19-344398.html &quot;Americans Celebrate Christmas in Diverse Ways&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210120636/https://usinfo.state.gov/scv/Archive/2005/Dec/19-344398.html |date=December 10, 2006 }}, Usinfo.state.gov, November 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
This also started the cultural conflict between the holiday's spiritual significance and its associated [[commercialism]] that some see as corrupting the holiday. In her 1850 book ''The First Christmas in New England'', [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] includes a character who complains that [[the true meaning of Christmas]] was lost in a shopping spree.&lt;ref&gt;First [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]] of Watertown [http://www.watertownfirstpres.org/sermons/12-11-05.html &quot;Oh ... and one more thing&quot;] December 11, 2005

While the celebration of Christmas was not yet customary in some regions in the U.S., [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] detected &quot;a transition state about Christmas here in New England&quot; in 1856. &quot;The old puritan feeling prevents it from being a cheerful, hearty holiday; though every year makes it more so.&quot;&lt;ref name=APH&gt;Restad, Penne L.

Up to the 1950s in the UK, many Christmas customs were restricted to the upper classes and better-off families.

Christmas Day is celebrated as a major festival and [[public holiday]] in countries around the world, including many whose populations are mostly non-Christian. In some non-Christian areas, periods of former colonial rule introduced the celebration (e.g. [[Hong Kong]]); in others, Christian minorities or foreign cultural influences have led populations to observe the holiday. Countries such as Japan, where Christmas is popular despite there being only a small number of Christians, have adopted many of the secular aspects of Christmas, such as gift-giving, decorations, and Christmas trees.

Among [[Christian state|countries with a strong Christian tradition]], a variety of Christmas celebrations have developed that incorporate regional and local cultures.

=== Nativity play ===
{{Main|Nativity play}}
[[File:Childrens Nativity Play 2007.jpg|thumb|Children in Oklahoma reenact a [[Nativity play]]]]
For the Christian celebration of Christmas, the viewing of the [[Nativity play]] is one of the oldest Christmastime traditions, with the first reenactment of the [[Nativity of Jesus]] taking place in A.D. 1223.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Collins |first1=Ace |title=Stories Behind the Great Traditions of Christmas |date=2010 |publisher=Zondervan |isbn=9780310873884 |pages=139–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, [[Francis of Assisi]] assembled a [[Nativity scene]] outside of his church in Italy and children sung Christmas carols celebrating the birth of Jesus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins2010&quot;/&gt; Each year, this grew larger and people travelled from afar to see Francis' depiction of the Nativity of Jesus that came to feature drama and music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins2010&quot;/&gt; Nativity plays eventually spread throughout all of Europe, where they remain popular. Christmas Eve and Christmas Day church services often came to feature Nativity plays, as did schools and theatres.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins2010&quot;/&gt; In France, Germany, Mexico and Spain, Nativity plays are often reenacted outdoors in the streets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins2010&quot;/&gt;

=== Music and carols ===
{{Main|Christmas music}}
[[File:Chant'tie d'Cantiques dé Noué Dézembre 2009 Jèrri a.jpg|thumb|Christmas carolers in [[Jersey]]]]

The earliest extant specifically Christmas hymns appear in fourth-century [[Rome]]. Latin hymns such as &quot;[[Veni redemptor gentium]]&quot;, written by [[Ambrose]], Archbishop of Milan, were austere statements of the theological doctrine of the Incarnation in opposition to [[Arianism]]. &quot;Corde natus ex Parentis&quot; (&quot;Of the Father's love begotten&quot;) by the Spanish poet [[Prudentius]] (d. 413) is still sung in some churches today.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, Clement, ''Christmas customs and traditions'', Courier Dover Publications, 1976, {{ISBN|0-486-23354-5}}, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Christmas &quot;Sequence&quot; or &quot;Prose&quot; was introduced in North European monasteries, developing under [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] into a sequence of rhymed [[stanza]]s. In the 12th century the Parisian monk Adam of St. Victor began to derive music from popular songs, introducing something closer to the traditional [[Christmas carol]].

[[File:Steaua, Bucharest, 1842 crop.jpg|thumb|left|Child singers in [[Bucharest]], 1841]]

The songs now known specifically as carols were originally communal folk songs sung during celebrations such as &quot;harvest tide&quot; as well as Christmas. It was only later that carols began to be sung in church. Traditionally, carols have often been based on [[medieval]] chord patterns, and it is this that gives them their uniquely characteristic musical sound. Some carols like &quot;[[Personent hodie]]&quot;, &quot;[[Good King Wenceslas]]&quot;, and &quot;[[The Holly and the Ivy]]&quot; can be traced directly back to the [[Middle Ages]]. They are among the oldest musical compositions still regularly sung. &quot;[[Adeste Fideles]]&quot; (O Come all ye faithful) appears in its current form in the mid-18th century, although the words may have originated in the 13th century.

The singing of carols initially suffered a decline in popularity after the [[Protestant Reformation]] in northern Europe, although some Reformers, like [[Martin Luther]], wrote carols and encouraged their use in worship. Carols largely survived in rural communities until the revival of interest in popular songs in the 19th century. The 18th-century English reformer [[Charles Wesley]] understood the importance of music to worship. In addition to setting many psalms to melodies, which were influential in the [[Great Awakening]] in the United States, he wrote texts for at least three Christmas carols. The best known was originally entitled &quot;Hark! How All the Welkin Rings&quot;, later renamed &quot;[[Hark! the Herald Angels Sing]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Completely secular Christmas seasonal songs emerged in the late 18th century. &quot;[[Deck the Halls]]&quot; dates from 1784, and the American &quot;[[Jingle Bells]]&quot; was copyrighted in 1857. In the 19th and 20th centuries, African American spirituals and songs about Christmas, based in their tradition of spirituals, became more widely known. An increasing number of seasonal holiday songs were commercially produced in the 20th century, including jazz and blues variations. In addition, there was a revival of interest in early music, from groups singing folk music, such as The Revels, to performers of early medieval and classical music. [[John Rutter]] has composed many carols including &quot;[[All Bells in Paradise]]&quot;, &quot;[[Angels' Carol]]&quot;, &quot;[[Candlelight Carol]]&quot;, &quot;[[Donkey Carol]]&quot;, &quot;[[Jesus Child]]&quot;, &quot;[[Shepherd's Pipe Carol]]&quot; and &quot;[[Star Carol]]&quot;.

=== Traditional cuisine ===
[[File:Christmas pudding.JPG|thumb|right|[[Christmas pudding]] cooked on [[Stir-up Sunday]], it is traditionally served in the UK, Ireland and in other countries]]

A special [[Christmas dinner|Christmas family meal]] is traditionally an important part of the holiday's celebration, and the food that is served varies greatly from country to country. Some regions have special meals for Christmas Eve, such as [[Sicily]], where 12 kinds of fish are served. In the United Kingdom and countries influenced by its traditions, a standard Christmas meal includes turkey, goose or other large bird, gravy, potatoes, vegetables, sometimes bread and cider. Special desserts are also prepared, such as [[Christmas pudding]], [[mince pie]]s, [[fruit cake]], [[Panettone]] and [[Yule log (cake)|Yule log cake]].&lt;ref&gt;Broomfield, Andrea (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=fJ_JDp9OgJEC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=christmas+pudding+england ''Food and Cooking in Victorian England: A History''], Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007, pp. 149–150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muir, Frank (1977), ''Christmas customs &amp; traditions'', Taplinger Pub.

=== Cards ===
[[File:Christmas postcard 1907.jpg|alt=|thumb|upright|A 1907 Christmas card with [[Santa]] and some of his reindeer]]
{{Main|Christmas card}}

Christmas cards are illustrated messages of greeting exchanged between friends and family members during the weeks preceding Christmas Day. The traditional greeting reads &quot;wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year&quot;, much like that of the first commercial [[Christmas card#History|Christmas card]], produced by [[Sir Henry Cole]] in London in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1679110.stm &quot;Christmas card sold for record price&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060205200933/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1679110.stm |date=February 5, 2006 }}, BBC News. Retrieved October 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The custom of sending them has become popular among a wide cross-section of people with the emergence of the modern trend towards exchanging [[E-card]]s.

Christmas cards are purchased in considerable quantities and feature artwork, commercially designed and relevant to the season. The content of the design might relate directly to the [[Nativity of Jesus|Christmas narrative]], with [[Nativity of Jesus in art|depictions of the Nativity of Jesus]], or [[Christian symbols]] such as the [[Star of Bethlehem]], or a white [[dove]], which can represent both the [[Holy Spirit]] and [[Peace]] on Earth. Other Christmas cards are more [[secular]] and can depict [[Christmas tradition]]s, mythical figures such as [[Santa Claus]], objects directly associated with Christmas such as candles, holly, and baubles, or a variety of images associated with the season, such as Christmastide activities, snow scenes, and the wildlife of the northern winter. There are even humorous cards and genres depicting nostalgic scenes of the past such as [[crinoline]]d shoppers in idealized 19th-century streetscapes.

Some prefer cards with a poem, prayer, or [[Bible verse|Biblical verse]]; while others distance themselves from religion with an all-inclusive &quot;Season's greetings&quot;.

=== Commemorative stamps ===
{{Main|Christmas stamp}}
A number of nations have issued [[commemorative stamp]]s at Christmastide. Postal customers will often use these stamps to mail [[Christmas card]]s, and they are popular with [[philately|philatelists]]. These stamps are regular [[postage stamp]]s, unlike [[Christmas seal]]s, and are valid for postage year-round. They usually go on sale sometime between early October and early December and are printed in considerable quantities.

After the introduction of the Julian calendar in Rome, the 25th of December became the day of ''Sol invictus'' when people greeted the winter solstice. It was the day of the Sun's rebirth, and it was the day of the Christmas festivities – although it was only in the year 336 AD that it appears to have become established as the day of Jesus's birth (see Pannenberg 1989: 57). The Eastern Church adopted this date even later, towards the end of the 4th century, having previously regarded the 6th of January as the day of gift-giving, as it still is in the Italian community of Befana. The winter solstice was a time of festivity in every traditional culture, and the Christian Christmas probably took its place within this mythical context of the solar cult. Its core dogma of the Incarnation, however, solidly established the giving and receiving of gifts as the structural principle of that recurrent yet unique event. 'Children were given presents as the Jesus child received gifts from the magi or kings who came from afar to adore him. But in reality it was they, together with all their fellow men, who received the gift of God through man's renewed participation in the divine life' (ibid.: 61).}}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 24, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gift-bearing figures ====
{{Main|Santa Claus|Father Christmas|Christkind}}
[[File:Christmas-gift-bringers-Europe.jpg|thumb|Christmas gift-bringers in Europe]]

A number of figures are associated with Christmas and the seasonal giving of gifts. Among these are [[Father Christmas]], also known as [[Santa Claus]] (derived from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for Saint Nicholas), Père Noël, and the [[Weihnachtsmann]]; [[Saint Nicholas]] or [[Sinterklaas]]; the [[Christkind]]; Kris Kringle; [[Joulupukki]]; [[Nisse (folklore)|tomte/nisse]]; Babbo Natale; [[Basil of Caesarea|Saint Basil]]; and [[Ded Moroz]]. The Scandinavian tomte (also called nisse) is sometimes depicted as a [[gnome]] instead of Santa Claus.

The best known of these figures today is red-dressed Santa Claus, of diverse origins. The name Santa Claus can be traced back to the Dutch ''Sinterklaas'', which means simply Saint Nicholas. Nicholas was a 4th-century [[Greeks in Turkey#History|Greek]] [[bishop]] of [[Myra]], a city in the [[Roman province]] of [[Lycia]], whose ruins are {{convert|3|km}} from modern [[Demre]] in southwest Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Domenico, Roy Palmer |title= The regions of Italy: a reference guide to history and culture |publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group |year= 2002 |page=21 |isbn= 978-0-313-30733-1 |quote= Saint Nicholas (Bishop of Myra) replaced Sabino as the patron saint of the city...

As a port on the Mediterranean Sea, in the middle of the sea lanes that linked Egypt, Greece and Rome, Myra was a destination for traders, fishermen, and merchant sailors. Spawned by the spirit of both the city's Greek heritage and the ruling Roman government, cultural endeavors such as art, drama, and music were mainstays of everyday life. |access-date= June 20, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150911140845/https://books.google.com/books?id=HVPYqrdGhGEC&amp;q=Nicholas+born+Greek+city+of+Patara+270+AD#v=snippet&amp;q=Nicholas%20born%20Greek%20city%20of%20Patara%20270%20AD |archive-date= September 11, 2015 |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other saintly attributes, he was noted for the care of children, generosity, and the giving of gifts. His feast day, December 6, came to be celebrated in many countries with the giving of gifts.&lt;ref name=ADS/&gt;

Saint Nicholas traditionally appeared in bishop's attire, accompanied by helpers, inquiring about the behaviour of children during the past year before deciding whether they deserved a gift or not. By the 13th century, Saint Nicholas was well known in the Netherlands, and the practice of gift-giving in his name spread to other parts of central and southern Europe. At the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 16th–17th-century Europe, many Protestants changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or ''Christkindl'', corrupted in English to Kris Kringle, and the date of giving gifts changed from December 6 to Christmas Eve.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADS&quot; /&gt;

The modern popular image of Santa Claus, however, was created in the United States, and in particular in New York. The transformation was accomplished with the aid of notable contributors including [[Washington Irving]] and the [[German Americans|German-American]] cartoonist [[Thomas Nast]] (1840–1902). Following the [[American Revolutionary War]], some of the inhabitants of New York City sought out symbols of the city's non-English past. New York had originally been established as the Dutch colonial town of [[New Amsterdam]] and the Dutch Sinterklaas tradition was reinvented as Saint Nicholas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Current tradition in several [[Latin American]] countries (such as Venezuela and Colombia) holds that while Santa makes the toys, he then gives them to the Baby Jesus, who is the one who actually delivers them to the children's homes, a reconciliation between traditional [[Religion|religious beliefs]] and the [[iconography]] of Santa Claus imported from the United States.

In [[South Tyrol]] (Italy), Austria, Czech Republic, Southern Germany, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Slovakia, and Switzerland, the [[Christkind]] ([[Ježíšek]] in Czech, Jézuska in Hungarian and Ježiško in Slovak) brings the presents. Greek children get their presents from [[Saint Basil]] on New Year's Eve, the eve of that saint's liturgical feast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skiathosbooks.com/saints_basil.htm |title=St. Basil (330–379) |publisher=Skiathosbooks.com |accessdate=February 3, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112035451/http://www.skiathosbooks.com/saints_basil.htm |archivedate=January 12, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The German St. Nikolaus is not identical with the Weihnachtsmann (who is the German version of Santa Claus / Father Christmas). St. Nikolaus wears a [[bishop]]'s dress and still brings small gifts (usually candies, nuts, and fruits) on December 6 and is accompanied by [[Knecht Ruprecht]]. Although many parents around the world routinely teach their children about Santa Claus and other gift bringers, some have come to reject this practice, considering it deceptive.&lt;ref&gt;Matera, Mariane.

Multiple gift-giver figures exist in Poland, varying between regions and individual families. St Nicholas (''Święty Mikołaj'') dominates Central and North-East areas, the Starman (''Gwiazdor'') is most common in [[Greater Poland]], Baby Jesus (''Dzieciątko'') is unique to [[Upper Silesia]], with the Little Star (''Gwiazdka'') and the Little Angel (''Aniołek'') being common in the South and the South-East.

=== Date according to Julian calendar ===
Some jurisdictions of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], including those of [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russia]], [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgia]], [[History of Christianity in Ukraine#Eastern Orthodox|Ukraine]], [[Macedonian Orthodox Church|Macedonia]], [[Montenegrin Orthodox Church|Montenegro]], [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbia]], and [[Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], mark feasts using the older [[Julian calendar]]. As of {{currentyear}}, there is a difference of 13 days between the Julian calendar and the modern [[Gregorian calendar]], which is used internationally for most secular purposes. As a result, December 25 on the Julian calendar currently corresponds to January 7 on the calendar used by most governments and people in everyday life. Therefore, the aforementioned Orthodox Christians mark December 25 (and thus Christmas) on the day that is internationally considered to be January 7.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jan7&quot; /&gt;

However, other Orthodox Christians, such as those belonging to the jurisdictions of [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgaria]], [[Church of Greece|Greece]], [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romania]], [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Antioch]], [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania|Albania]], [[Church of Cyprus|Cyprus]], [[Finnish Orthodox Church|Finland]], and the [[Orthodox Church in America]], among others, began using the [[Revised Julian calendar]] in the early 20th century, which at present corresponds exactly to the Gregorian calendar.&lt;ref name=4Dates&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/israel/bethlehem-christmas|title=Christmas in Bethlehem|website=www.sacred-destinations.com|access-date=June 12, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616161715/http://www.sacred-destinations.com/israel/bethlehem-christmas|archive-date=June 16, 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, these Orthodox Christians mark December 25 (and thus Christmas) on the same day that is internationally considered to be December 25, and which is also the date of Christmas among Western Christians.

A further complication is added by the fact that the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] continues the original ancient [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] practice of celebrating the birth of Christ not as a separate holiday, but on the same day as the celebration of his baptism ([[Epiphany (holiday)#Oriental Orthodox|Theophany]]), which is on January 6. This is a public holiday in Armenia, and it is held on the same day that is internationally considered to be January 6, because the Armenian Church in Armenia uses the Gregorian calendar.

However, there is also a small [[Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem]], which maintains the traditional Armenian custom of celebrating the birth of Christ on the same day as Theophany (January 6), but uses the ''Julian'' calendar for the determination of that date. As a result, this church celebrates &quot;Christmas&quot; (more properly called Theophany) on the day that is considered January 19 on the Gregorian calendar in use by the majority of the world.

In summary, there are four different dates used by different Christian groups to mark the birth of Christ, given in the table below.

In most Western nations, Christmas Day is the least active day of the year for business and commerce; almost all retail, commercial and institutional businesses are closed, and almost all industries cease activity (more than any other day of the year), whether laws require such or not. In [[England and Wales]], the [[Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004]] prevents all large shops from trading on Christmas Day. Scotland is currently planning similar legislation. [[Film studio]]s release many high-budget movies during the holiday season, including Christmas films, [[fantasy]] movies or high-tone dramas with high production values to hopes of maximizing the chance of nominations for the [[Academy Awards]].

One [[economist]]'s analysis calculates that, despite increased overall spending, Christmas is a [[deadweight loss]] under orthodox [[microeconomic theory]], because of the effect of gift-giving. This loss is calculated as the difference between what the gift giver spent on the item and what the gift receiver would have paid for the item.

On Saturday morning, more than 60 police officers and officials stormed a children's Bible class in Guangzhou, capital of southern China's Guangdong province. The incident came after authorities shut down the 1,500-member Zion Church in Beijing in September and Chengdu's 500-member Early Rain Covenant Church last week.
