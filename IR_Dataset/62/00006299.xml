The '''chupacabra''' or '''chupacabras''' ({{IPA-es|tʃupaˈkaβɾas}}, literally &quot;goat-sucker&quot;; from ''chupar'', &quot;to suck&quot;, and ''cabra'', &quot;goat&quot;) is a [[legend]]ary creature in the [[folklore]] of parts of the Americas, with its first purported sightings reported in [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Latino Bigfoot&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0605/02/lt.01.html |title=Illegal Immigrants Frightened by Raid Rumors; George Bush: &quot;The Decider&quot;; &quot;Happy Slapping&quot; |publisher=CNN |date=2 May 2006 |accessdate=5 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name comes from the animal's reported [[Vampirism|habit]] of attacking and [[Hematophagy|drinking the blood]] of [[livestock]], including [[goat]]s.

Physical descriptions of the creature vary. It is purportedly a heavy creature, the size of a small bear, with a row of spines reaching from the neck to the base of the tail.

Eyewitness sightings have been claimed in Puerto Rico, and have since been reported as far north as [[Maine]], and as far south as [[Chile]], and even being spotted outside the Americas in countries like [[Russia]] and the [[Philippines]], but many of the reports have been disregarded as uncorroborated or lacking evidence. Sightings in northern Mexico and the southern United States have been verified as [[Canidae|canids]] afflicted by [[mange]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Radford2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Radford |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Radford |year=2011 |title=[[Tracking the Chupacabra]]: The Vampire Beast in Fact, Fiction and Folklore |isbn=978-0-8263-5015-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to biologists and wildlife management officials, the chupacabra is an [[urban legend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corp.primerahora.com/archivo.asp?guid=3283EF0636144DD6AAC744E6D18C3E66&amp;year=2002&amp;keyword= |title=Disfrazado el chupacabras |trans-title= |date=24 September 2002 |last=González Rodríguez |first=Miried |website=[[Primera Hora (Puerto Rico)|Primera Hora]] |location=Puerto Rico |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
''Chupacabras'' can be literally translated as &quot;goat-sucker&quot;, from ''chupar'' (&quot;to suck&quot;) and ''cabra'' (&quot;goat&quot;). It is known as both ''chupacabras'' and ''chupacabra'' throughout the Americas, with the former being the original word,&lt;ref name=&quot;Clave&quot;&gt;Diccionario Clave, [http://clave.librosvivos.net/verficha.asp?idelementoaver=42243&amp;cadena=chupacabras chupacabras] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000326/http://clave.librosvivos.net/verficha.asp?idelementoaver=42243&amp;cadena=chupacabras |date=4 March 2016 }}. It states that both singular and plural is ''chupacabras''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter a [[regularization (linguistics)|regularization]] of it.  The name is attributed to Puerto Rican comedian [[Silverio Pérez]], who coined the label in 1995 while commenting on the attacks as a San Juan radio deejay.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pérez2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Pérez |first=Silverio |author-link=Silverio Pérez |title=Más humortivación: para el camino del éxito |trans-title=More Humortivation: The Path for Success |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG3wb8qOgt8C |year=2000 |publisher=Dreams Come True |isbn=978-0-9702011-0-2 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradford2017&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/was_the_nightjar_an_early_chupacabra/ |title=Was the Nightjar an Early Chupacabra? |last=Radford |first=Benjamin |author-link=Benjamin Radford |date=1 June 2017 |website=Center for Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first reported attack eventually attributed to the creatures occurred in March 1995 in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name=&quot;trail&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa051898.htm |title=On the trail of the Chupacabras |last=Wagner |first=Stephen |year=1998 |website=[[About.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050919215215/http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa051898.htm |archive-date=19 September 2005 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight [[domestic sheep|sheep]] were discovered dead, each with three puncture wounds in the chest area and reportedly completely drained of blood.&lt;ref name=&quot;trail&quot; /&gt; A few months later, in August, an eyewitness, Madelyne Tolentino, reported seeing the creature in the Puerto Rican town of [[Canóvanas, Puerto Rico|Canóvanas]], when as many as 150 farm animals and pets were reportedly killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;trail&quot; /&gt; In 1975, similar killings in the small town of [[Moca, Puerto Rico|Moca]] were attributed to ''El Vampiro de Moca'' (&quot;The Vampire of Moca&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://paranormal.about.com/cs/chupacabra/a/aa071403.htm |title=Encounters with Chupacabras |year=2000 |last=Wagner |first=Stephen |website=[[About.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017163054/http://paranormal.about.com/cs/chupacabra/a/aa071403.htm |archive-date=17 October 2007 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, it was suspected that the killings were committed by a [[Satanism|Satanic]] [[cult]]; later more killings were reported around the island, and many farms reported loss of animal life. Each of the animals was reported to have had its body bled dry through a series of small circular incisions.

[[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] comedian and entrepreneur [[Silverio Pérez]] is credited with coining the term ''chupacabras'' soon after the first incidents were reported in the press. Shortly after the first reported incidents in Puerto Rico, other animal deaths were reported in other countries, such as the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], Chile, [[Colombia]], [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Panama]], [[Peru]], [[Brazil]], United States, and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=&quot;trail&quot; /&gt;

In October and December 2018, there came many reports of chupacabras suspects in [[Manipur]], India. Many domestic animals and poultry were killed in a suspicious manner as chupacabra does. Many people said that they had seen the species (chupacabras) with their eyes. However, forensic experts opined that there was no any aspect of chupacabra but street dogs were responsible for mass killing of domestic animals and poultries after studying the remnant of corpse. In 19 July 2019,this creature sighted in Karachi (Pakistan) {Karachi traders fearful after ‘mysterious creature’ sighted in Shershah}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kanglaonline.com/2018/12/strange-animal-attacks-in-manipur-monkeyoid-or-mutant-monkey/|title=Monkeyiod in Manipur}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://kanglaonline.com/2018/12/strange-animal-attacks-in-manipur-monkeyoid-or-mutant-monkey/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reputed origin ==
A five-year investigation by [[Benjamin Radford]], documented in his 2011 book ''[[Tracking the Chupacabra]]'', concluded that the description given by the original eyewitness in Puerto Rico, Madelyne Tolentino, was based on the creature Sil in the 1995 science-fiction horror film ''[[Species (film)|Species]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radford2011&quot; /&gt; The alien creature Sil is nearly identical to Tolentino’s chupacabra eyewitness account and she had seen the movie before her report: &quot;It was a creature that looked like the chupacabra, with spines on its back and all... The resemblance to the chupacabra was really impressive,&quot; Tolentino reported.&lt;ref&gt;Corrales, Scott. Chupacabras: And Other Mysteries. {{ISBN|1-883729-06-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radford revealed that Tolentino &quot;believed that the creatures and events she saw in ''Species'' were happening in reality in Puerto Rico at the time,&quot; and therefore concludes that &quot;the most important chupacabra description cannot be trusted.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Radford2011&quot; /&gt; This, Radford believes, seriously undermines the credibility of the chupacabra as a real animal.&lt;ref&gt;Radford, Benjamin. &quot;Slaying the Vampire: Solving the ''Chupacabra'' Mystery&quot; ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', Vol. 35 No. 3, May/June 2011, Pages 45–48&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the reports of blood-sucking by the chupacabra were never confirmed by a [[necropsy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Radford2011&quot; /&gt; the only way to conclude that the animal was drained of blood. An analysis by a veterinarian of 300 reported victims of the chupacabra found that they had not been bled dry.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Radford divided the chupacabra reports into two categories: the reports from [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Latin America]] where animals were attacked and it is supposed their blood was extracted, and the reports in the United States of [[mammal]]s, mostly dogs and [[coyote]]s with [[mange]], that people call &quot;chupacabra&quot; due to their unusual appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chupacabra Science: How Evolution Made a Mythical Monster |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/10/101028-chupacabra-evolution-halloween-science-monsters-chupacabras-picture/ |date=28 October 2010 |last=Than |first=Ker |work=National Geographic |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late October 2010, [[University of Michigan]] biologist Barry O'Connor concluded that all the chupacabra reports in the United States were simply coyotes infected with the parasite ''[[Sarcoptes scabiei]]'', whose symptoms would explain most of the features of the chupacabra: they would be left with little fur, thickened skin, and rank odor. O'Connor theorized that the attacks on goats occurred &quot;because these animals are greatly weakened, they're going to have a hard time hunting. So they may be forced into attacking livestock because it's easier than running down a rabbit or a deer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ur.umich.edu/1011/Oct25_10/1698-scary-chupacabras-monster |date=25 October 2010 |title=Scary chupacabras monster is as much victim as villain |last=Ross-Flannigan |first=Nancy |website=The University Record |publisher=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although several witnesses came to the conclusion that the attacks could not be the work of dogs or coyotes because they had not eaten the victim, this conclusion is incorrect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radford2011&quot; /&gt; Both dogs and coyotes can kill and not consume the prey, either because they are inexperienced, or due to injury or difficulty in killing the prey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radford2011&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wade and Bowns&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://texnat.tamu.edu/about/procedures-for-evaluating/evaluation-of-suspected-predator-kills/ |title=Evaluation of Suspected Predator Kills |date=May 2010 |last1=Wade |first1=Dale A. |last2=Bowns |first2=James E. |website=Texas AgriLife Research and Extension Center |publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101055717/http://texnat.tamu.edu/about/procedures-for-evaluating/evaluation-of-suspected-predator-kills/ |archivedate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prey can survive the attack and die afterwards from internal [[bleeding]] or [[circulatory shock]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Radford2011&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wade and Bowns&quot; /&gt; The presence of two holes in the neck, corresponding with the [[canine teeth]], are to be expected since this is the only way that most land [[carnivores]] have to catch their prey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radford2011&quot; /&gt;

There are reports of stray [[Mexican Hairless Dog]]s being mistaken for chupacabras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/offbeat/2009/09/01/roldan.chupacabra.KSAT?iref=videosearch |title=Breaking News Videos, Story Video and Show Clips – CNN.com |date=12 March 2014 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
The most common description of the chupacabra is that of a [[reptile]]-like creature, said to have leathery or scaly greenish-gray skin and sharp spines or quills running down its back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://skepdic.com/chupa.html |title=Chupacabra |last=Carroll |first=Robert Todd |authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll |date=29 October 2015 |website=The Skeptic's Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said to be approximately {{convert|3|to|4|ft|1}} high, and stands and hops in a fashion similar to that of a [[kangaroo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;top ten&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/most-mysterious-creatures-of-modern-times-2594695 |title=The Top 10 Most Mysterious Creatures of Modern Times |last=Wagner |first=Stephen |date=8 September 2017 |website=ThoughtCo |publisher=[[Dotdash]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common description of the chupacabra is of a strange breed of wild dog. This form is mostly hairless and has a pronounced spinal ridge, unusually pronounced eye sockets, fangs, and claws. Unlike conventional predators, the chupacabra is said to drain all of the animal's blood (and sometimes organs) usually through three holes in the shape of a downwards-pointing triangle or through one or two holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vocero.com/noticias.asp?s=Locales&amp;n=23285 |last=De Jesús Mangual |first=Tomás |author-link=Tomás de Jesús Mangual |date=9 January 2006 |title=Imputan otro ataque al Chupacabras |website=[[El Vocero]] |location=San Juan, Puerto Rico |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011110443/http://vocero.com/noticias.asp?s=Locales&amp;n=23285 |archive-date=11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Peuchen]]s of Chile also share similarities in their supposed habits, but instead of being dog-like they are described as winged snakes.
