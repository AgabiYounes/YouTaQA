A '''comic book''' or '''comicbook''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Shaw (artist)|Scott Shaw!]], Mike Kazaleh, &quot;Secret Agent Orange&quot;, ''Annoying Orange'' #1, New York: Papercutz, December 2012, pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsYxPdZ4elo&lt;/ref&gt; also called '''comic magazine''' or simply '''comic''', is a publication that consists of [[comics]] art in the form of sequential juxtaposed [[panel (comics)|panels]] that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by descriptive prose and written narrative, usually, dialog contained in [[word balloon]]s emblematic of the comics art form. Although {{not a typo|comics has}} some origins in 18th century [[Japan]], comic books were first popularized in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, ''[[Famous Funnies]]'', was released in the U.S. in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor [[comic strip]]s, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/033comic.html A History of the Comic Book] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525003144/http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/033comic.html |date=25 May 2013 }}. Retrieved 16 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''comic book'' derives from [[American comic book]]s once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.

The largest comic book market is Japan. By 1995, the [[manga]] market in Japan was valued at {{JPY|586.4 billion|link=yes}} ({{US$|6{{ndash}}7 billion|long=no|link=yes}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schodt|first=Frederik|authorlink=Frederik L.

==Structure==
Comic books are reliant on their organization and appearance. Authors largely focus on the frame of the page, size, orientation, and panel positions. These characteristic aspects of comic books are necessary in conveying the content and messages of the author. The key elements of comic books include panels, balloons (speech bubbles), text (lines), and characters. Balloons are usually convex spatial containers of information that are related to a character using a [[tail element]]. The tail has an origin, path, tip, and pointed direction. Key tasks in the creation of comic books are writing, drawing, and coloring. There are many technological formulas used to create comic books, including directions, axes, data, and metrics. Following these key formatting procedures is the writing, drawing, and coloring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Knowledge-driven understanding of images in comic books|last = Rigaud|first = Christophe|date = 2015|journal = International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition|doi = 10.1007/s10032-015-0243-1|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 18|issue = 3|pages = 199–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American comic books==
{{main|American comic book}}
Comics as a print medium have existed in America since the printing of ''[[Histoire de M. Vieux Bois|The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck]]'' in 1842 in hardcover,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/digital/collections/books/ocn259708589/ocn259708589.html ''The Adventures of M. Obadiah Oldbuck''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211005542/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/digital/collections/books/ocn259708589/ocn259708589.html |date=11 February 2015 }} at the [[Dartmouth College]] library&lt;/ref&gt; making it the first known American prototype comic book. Proto-comics periodicals began appearing early in the 20th century, with the first comic standard-sized comic being Funnies on Parade.  Funnies on Parades was the first book that established the size, duration, and format of the modern comic book.  Following this was, [[Dell Publishing]]'s 36-page ''Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics'' as the first true newstand American comic book; Goulart, for example, calls it &quot;the cornerstone for one of the most lucrative branches of magazine publishing&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ron&quot;&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Ron Goulart | last=Goulart | first=Ron | title=Comic Book Encyclopedia | publisher=[[HarperCollins|Harper Entertainment]] | location=New York | year=2004 | isbn=978-0060538163 | url=https://archive.org/details/comicbookencyclo00goul }}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]'s [[Superman]] in 1938 turned comic books into a major industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Goulart | first=Ron | authorlink=Ron Goulart | title=Comic Book Culture: An Illustrated History | date= 2000 | publisher=Collectors Press | page=43 | isbn=978-1-888054-38-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ushered the [[Golden Age of Comics]]. The Golden Age originated the [[archetype]] of the [[superhero]]. According to historian [[Michael A. Amundson]], appealing comic-book characters helped ease young readers' fear of nuclear war and neutralize anxiety about the questions posed by atomic power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zeman|first1=Scott C.|last2=Amundson|first2=Michael A.|title=Atomic Culture: How We Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb|url=https://archive.org/details/automiccultureho00scot|url-access=registration|date=2004|publisher=University Press of Colorado|location=Boulder, Colorado|isbn=9780870817632|page=[https://archive.org/details/automiccultureho00scot/page/11 11]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians generally divide the timeline of the American comic book into eras. The [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] began in the 1930s; which is generally considered the beginning of the comic book that we know today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/the-golden-age-of-comics/ | title = The Golden Age of Comics | work = History Detectives: Special Investigations | publisher = [[PBS]] | accessdate = February 18, 2015 | quote = The precise era of the Golden Age is disputed, though most agree that it was born with the launch of Superman in 1938. | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170905025350/http://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/the-golden-age-of-comics/ | archive-date = 5 September 2017 | url-status=live | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Silver Age of comic books]] is generally considered to date from the first successful revival of the then-dormant superhero form, with the debut of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]''  #4 (Oct. 1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=10649 | title=DC Flashback: The Flash | accessdate=27 June 2008 | last=CBR News Team | date=2 July 2007 | website=[[Comic Book Resources]] | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007032240/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=10649 | archivedate=7 October 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=5706  | title=Breaking the Border – Rants and Ramblings | accessdate=5 January 2010 | last=Zicari | first=Anthony | date=3 August 2007 | publisher=[[Comics Bulletin]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070826092448/http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=5706 |archivedate = 26 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silver Age lasted through the late 1960s or early 1970s, during which time [[Marvel Comics]] revolutionized the medium with such [[naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] superheroes as [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]'s [[Fantastic Four]] and Lee and [[Steve Ditko]]'s [[Spider-Man]]. The demarcation between the Silver Age and the following era, the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]], is less well-defined, with the Bronze Age running from the very early 1970s through the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name=libraries&gt;{{cite book | title=Comic Book Collections for Libraries | publisher=Libraries Unlimited | first=Bryan D. |last=Fagan  |first2= Jody Condit| last2= Condit | isbn=  978-1598845112 | year=2011| page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Modern Age of Comic Books]] runs from the mid-1980s to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide | year=2008 |volume=38| page= 1028 | chapter = Glossary| title-link=Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable event in the history of the American comic book came with psychiatrist [[Fredric Wertham]]'s criticisms of the medium in his book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' (1954), which prompted the American [[Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency]] to investigate comic books. Wertham claimed that comic books were responsible for an increase in juvenile delinquency, as well as potential influence on a child's sexuality and morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seduction of the Innocent|last=Wertham|first=Fredric|publisher=Rinehart and Company, Inc.|year=1954|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to attention from the government and from the media, the U.S. comic book industry set up the Comics Magazine Association of America.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Jeffrey|title=Comic Book Fandom and Cultural Capital|journal=Journal of Popular Culture|date=1997|volume=30|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CMAA instilled the [[Comics Code Authority]] in 1954 and drafted the self-censorship Comics Code that year, which required all comic books to go through a process of approval. It was not until the 1970s that comic books could be published without passing through the inspection of the CMAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Comic book fandom and cultural capital|last = Brown|first = Jeffrey|date = 1997|journal = Journal of Popular Culture|doi = 10.1111/j.0022-3840.1997.3004_13.x|pmid = |access-date = |issn = 0022-3840|volume = 30|issue = 4|pages = 13–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Code was made formally defunct in November 2011.

===   Underground comic books   ===
{{Main|Underground comix}}

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a surge of creativity emerged in what became known as [[underground comics]]. Published and distributed independently of the established comics industry, most of such comics reflected the youth [[counterculture]] and [[drug culture]] of the time. Underground comix &quot;reflected and commented on the social divisions and tensions of American society&quot;.{{attribution needed|date=June 2019}}&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Introducing Comics and Ideology|url=|journal=Comics and Ideology|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many had an uninhibited, often irreverent style; their frank depictions of nudity, sex, profanity, and politics had no parallel outside their precursors, the pornographic and even more obscure &quot;[[Tijuana bibles]]&quot;. Underground comics were almost never sold at newsstands, but rather in such youth-oriented outlets as [[head shops]] and record stores, as well as by [[mail order]]. The underground comix encouraged creators to publish their work independently so that they would have full ownership rights to their characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

[[Frank Stack]]'s ''The Adventures of Jesus'', published under the name Foolbert Sturgeon,&lt;ref name=&quot;Shelton&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Stack | first1=Frank | authorlink1=Frank Stack | last2=Shelton | first2=Gilbert | authorlink2=Gilbert Shelton | title=The New Adventures of Jesus | date=25 December 2006 | publisher=[[Fantagraphics Books]] | page=[https://archive.org/details/newadventuresofj00fran/page/9 9] | chapter=Introduction | isbn=978-1-56097-780-3 | url=https://archive.org/details/newadventuresofj00fran/page/9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Skinn-34&quot;/&gt; has been credited as the first underground comic;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shelton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Skinn-34&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last=Skinn | first=Dez | authorlink=Dez Skinn | title=Comix: The Underground Revolution | date=20 May 2004 | publisher=[[Thunder's Mouth Press]] | page=34 | chapter=Heroes of the Revolution | isbn=978-1-56025-572-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[R. Crumb]] and the crew of cartoonists who worked on ''[[Zap Comix]]'' popularized the form.

===Alternative comics===
{{Main|Alternative comics}}

The rise of comic book [[specialty store]]s in the late 1970s created/paralleled a dedicated market for &quot;independent&quot; or &quot;[[alternative comics]]&quot; in the U.S. The first such comics included the anthology series ''[[Star Reach]]'', published by comic book writer [[Mike Friedrich]] from 1974 to 1979, and [[Harvey Pekar]]'s ''[[American Splendor]]'', which continued sporadic publication into the 21st century and which [[Shari Springer Berman]] and [[Robert Pulcini]] adapted into a [[American Splendor (film)|2003 film]]. Some independent comics continued in the tradition of underground comics. While their content generally remained less explicit, others resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre but were published by smaller artist-owned companies or by single artists. A few (notably ''[[RAW (magazine)|RAW]]'') represented experimental attempts to bring comics closer to the status of [[fine art]].

During the 1970s the &quot;[[small press]]&quot; culture grew and diversified. By the 1980s, several independent publishers – such as [[Pacific Comics|Pacific]], [[Eclipse Comics|Eclipse]], [[First Comics|First]], [[Comico: The Comic Company|Comico]], and [[Fantagraphics]] – had started releasing a wide range of styles and formats—from color-superhero, [[detective]], and science-fiction comic books to black-and-white magazine-format stories of [[Latin American]] [[magical realism]].

A number of small publishers in the 1990s changed the format and distribution of their comics to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The &quot;[[minicomic]]s&quot; form, an extremely informal version of [[self-publishing]], arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sap/decal/americancomics|title=americancomics|website=www.ocf.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-01-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202055024/https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sap/decal/americancomics|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small press.

Small publishers regularly releasing titles include [[Avatar Comics]], [[Hyperwerks]], Raytoons, and [[Terminal Press]], buoyed by such advances in printing technology as digital [[print on demand|print-on-demand]].

===Graphic novels===
[[File:The_Junior_Disease_Detectives_-_Operation_Outbreak.pdf|thumb|The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] published this instructional graphic novel in 2018 to keep youth from spreading infectious diseases]]
{{Main|Graphic novel}}
In 1964, Richard Kyle coined the term &quot;graphic novel&quot;.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Precursors of the form existed by the 1920s, which saw a revival of the [[medieval]] [[woodcut]] tradition by Belgian [[Frans Masereel]],&lt;ref&gt;Sabin, Roger. ''Adult Comics: An Introduction''(Routledge New Accents Library Collection, 2005), p. 291 {{ISBN|978-0-415-29139-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-29139-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; American [[Lynd Ward]] and others, including Stan Lee.
In 1950, [[St. John Publications]] produced the [[digest-sized]], adult-oriented &quot;picture novel&quot; ''[[It Rhymes with Lust]]'', a 128-page digest by [[pseudonym]]ous writer &quot;Drake Waller&quot; ([[Arnold Drake]] and [[Leslie Waller]]), penciler [[Matt Baker (artist)|Matt Baker]] and inker [[Ray Osrin]], touted as &quot;an original full-length novel&quot; on its cover. In 1971, writer-artist [[Gil Kane]] and collaborators devised the paperback &quot;comics novel&quot; ''[[Blackmark]]''. [[Will Eisner]] popularized the term &quot;graphic novel&quot; when he used it on the cover of the paperback edition of his work ''[[A Contract with God|A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories]]'' in 1978.

===Comic book collecting===
{{Main|Comic book collecting}}

The 1970s saw the advent of specialty [[comic book store]]s. Initially, comic books were marketed by publishers to children because comic books were perceived as children's entertainment. However, with increasing recognition of comics as an art form and the growing pop culture presence of [[comic book convention]]s, they are now embraced by many adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Comic book collectors are often lifelong enthusiasts of the comic book stories, and they usually focus on particular heroes and attempt to assemble the entire run of a title.  Comics are published with a sequential number. The first issue of a long-running comic book series is commonly the rarest and most desirable to collectors. The first appearance of a specific character, however, might be in a pre-existing title.  For example, [[Spider-Man]]'s first appearance was in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15.  New characters were often introduced this way and did not receive their own titles until there was a proven audience for the hero. As a result, comics that feature the first appearance of an important character will sometimes be even harder to find than the first issue of a character's own title.

Some rare comic books include copies of the unreleased ''[[Motion Picture Funnies Weekly]]'' #1 from 1939. Eight copies, plus one without a cover, emerged in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974. The &quot;Pay Copy&quot; of this book sold for $43,125 in a 2005 [[Heritage Auctions|Heritage]] auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://comics.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=818&amp;Lot_No=2020&amp;type=prte-pr091305a |title=Motion Picture Funnies Weekly #1 Pay Copy (First Funnies, Inc., 1939) CGC VF/NM 9.0 Cream to off-white pages.

The most valuable American comics have combined rarity and quality with the first appearances of popular and enduring characters. Four comic books have sold for over US$1 million {{as of|2010|December|lc=y}}, including two examples of ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1, the first appearance of [[Superman]],&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2010/02/26/news/economy/batman_comic/ Batman comic book beats Superman at auction, sets record] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303223514/http://money.cnn.com/2010/02/26/news/economy/batman_comic/ |date=3 March 2010 }} CNN Money 2-26-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://money.cnn.com/2014/08/25/news/companies/comic-record/index.html Superman comic sells for record $3.2 million] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027021655/https://money.cnn.com/2014/08/25/news/companies/comic-record/index.html |date=27 October 2018 }} (CNN Money) – 25 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; both sold privately through online dealer ComicConnect.com in 2010, and ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #27, the first appearance of [[Batman]], via public auction.

Updating the above price obtained for ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1, the first appearance of [[Superman]], the highest sale on record for this book is $3.2 million, for a 9.0 copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitney|first=Lance|title=Superman's Action Comics No. 1 sells for record $3.2 million on eBay|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/supermans-action-comics-no-1-sells-for-record-3-2-million-on-ebay|accessdate=31 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827190350/http://www.cnet.com/news/supermans-action-comics-no-1-sells-for-record-3-2-million-on-ebay/|archive-date=27 August 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Sentence fragment: Before [[Fawcett Comics]] introduced [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] --&gt;

Misprints, promotional comic-dealer incentive printings, and issues with extremely low distribution also generally have scarcity value. The rarest modern comic books include the [[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen#Issue 5 recall|original press run]] of ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' #5, which DC executive [[Paul Levitz]] recalled and pulped due to the appearance of a vintage [[Victorian era]] advertisement for &quot;Marvel [[Douche]]&quot;, which the publisher considered offensive;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?article=2153 | publisher=Comic Book Resources | date=23 May 2005 | title=Alan's Previous Problems With DC (sidebar) | work=Lying in the Gutters | last=Johnston | first=Rich | authorlink=Rich Johnston}}&lt;/ref&gt; only 100 copies exist, most of which have been [[Comics Guaranty LLC|CGC]] graded.

In 2000, a company named [[Comics Guaranty]] (CGC) began to &quot;slab&quot; comics, encasing them in thick plastic and giving them a numeric grade. {{as of|2014}}, there are two companies that provide third-party grading of comic book condition. Because the condition is so important to the value of rare comics, the idea of grading by a company that does not buy or sell comics seems like a good one. However, there is some controversy about whether this grading service is worth the high cost, and whether it is a positive development for collectors, or if it primarily services speculators who wish to make a quick profit trading in comics as one might trade in stocks or fine art. Comic grading has created valuation standards that online price guides such as [http://comics.gocollect.com GoCollect] and GPAnalysis have used to report on real-time market values.

The original artwork pages from comic books are also collected, and these are perhaps the rarest of all comic book collector's items, as there is only one unique page of artwork for each page that was printed and published.  These were created by a writer, who created the story; a pencil artist, who laid out the sequential panels on the page; an ink artist, who went over the pencil with pen and black ink; a letterer, who provided the dialogue and narration of the story by hand lettering each word; and finally a colorist, who added color as the last step before the finished pages went to the printer.

When the original pages of artwork are returned by the printer, they are typically given back to the artists, who sometimes sell them at comic book conventions, or in galleries and art shows related to comic book art.  The original pages of the first appearances of such legendary characters as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Spider-Man are considered priceless.

===Advertisements===
[[Advertising in comic books|Comic book advertisement]]s were a common feature in American comic books from the 1950s to the 1980s. They were typically grouped together on the inside back cover in, displayed in black and white with an illustration of the product. As these advertisements were directed at young people, many made sensational claims and sold the products for a few dollars to be sent to a post office box. Products offered included novelty items and toys.

===History of Race in Comic Books===
{{Cleanup section|reason=re-write to make less reliant on quotes, better fit WP's style|date=July 2019}}
Many early iterations of black characters in comics  &quot;became variations on the 'single stereotypical image of Sambo'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woodall|first=Lowery Anderson|date=2010|title=The Secret Identity of Race: Exploring Ethnic and Racial Portrayals in Superhero Comic Book|url=http://aquila.usm.edu/dissertations/478}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sambo was closely related to the coon stereotype but had some subtle differences. They are both a derogatory way of portraying black characters. &quot;The name itself, an abbreviation of raccoon, is dehumanizing. As with Sambo, the coon was portrayed as a lazy, easily frightened, chronically idle, inarticulate, buffoon.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/coon/|title=The Coon Caricature - Anti-black Imagery - Jim Crow Museum - Ferris State University|website=www.ferris.edu|access-date=2019-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This portrayal &quot;was of course another attempt to solidify the intellectual inferiority of the black race through popular culture.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; However, in the 1940s there was a change in portrayal of black characters.  &quot;A cursory glance...might give the impression that situations had improved for African Americans in comics.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; In many comics being produced in this time there was a major push for tolerance between races. &quot;These equality minded heroes began to spring to action just as African Americans were being asked to participate in the war effort.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;

During this time, a government ran program, the Writers' War Board, became heavily involved in what would be published in comics. &quot;The Writers' War Board used comic books to shape popular perceptions of race and ethnicity...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hirsch|first=Paul|date=2014|title=&quot;This Is Our Enemy&quot;: The Writers' War Board and Representations of Race in Comic Books, 1942–1945|journal=Pacific Historical Review|volume=83|issue=3|pages=448–486|doi=10.1525/phr.2014.83.3.448|issn=0030-8684|jstor=10.1525/phr.2014.83.3.448}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only were they using comic books as a means of recruiting all Americans, they were also using it as propaganda to, &quot;[construct] a justification for race based hatred of America's foreign enemies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; The Writers' War Board created comics books that were meant to &quot;[promote] domestic racial harmony&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; However, &quot;these pro-tolerance narratives struggled to overcome the popular and widely understood negative tropes used for decades in American mass culture...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; However, they weren't accomplishing this agenda within all of their comics.

In ''Captain Marvel Adventures,'' a character named steamboat was an amalgamation of some of the worst stereotypes of the time. The Writers' War Board did not ask for any change with this character. &quot;Eliminating Steamboat required the determined efforts of a black youth group in New York City.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Originally their request was refused by individuals working on the comic stating, &quot;''Captain Marvel Adventures'' included many kinds of caricatures 'for the sake of humor'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; The black youth group responded with, &quot;this is not the Negro race, but your one-and-a-half millions readers will think it so.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Afterwards, Steamboat disappeared from the comics all together. There was a comic created about the 99th squadron, also known as the Tuskegee Airmen, an all black air force unit. Instead of making the comic about their story the comic the comic was about Hop Harrigan. A white pilot who captures a Nazi, shows him videos of the 99th squadron defeating his man and then reveals to the Nazi that his men were defeated by African Americans which infuriated him as he sees them as a less superior race and can't believe they bested his men.&quot;...[The] Tuskegee Airmen, and images of black aviators appear in just three of the fifty three panels...[the] pilots of the 99th squadron have no dialogue and interact with neither Hop Harrigan nor his Nazi captive.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; During this time, they also used black characters in comic books as a means to invalidate the militant black groups that were fighting for equality within America. &quot;Spider-Man 'made it clear that militant black power was not the remedy for racial injustice'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; &quot;The Falcon openly criticized black behavior stating' maybe it's important fo[sic] us to cool things down-so we can protect the rights we been fightin' for'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; This poor portrayal and character development of black characters can be partially blamed on the fact that, during this time, &quot;there had rarely been a black artist or writer allowed in a major comics company&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;

Asian characters faced some of the same treatment in comics as black characters did. They were dehumanized and the narrative being pushed was that they were &quot;incompetent and subhuman.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; &quot;A 1944 issue of the ''United State Marines'' included a narrative entitled &quot;The Smell of the Monkeymen...the story depicts Japanese soldiers as simian brutes whose sickening body odor betrays their concealed locations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Chinese characters received the same treatment. &quot;By the time the United States entered WWII, negative perceptions of Chinese were an established part of mass culture...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; However, concerned that the Japanese could use America's anti chinese material as propaganda they began &quot;to present a more positive image of America's Chinese allies...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Just as they tried to show better representation for Black people in comics they did the same for Asian people. However, &quot;Japanese and filipino characters [were] visually indistinguishable. Both groups have grotesque buckteeth, tattered clothing, and bright yellow skin.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; &quot;publishers...depicted America's Asian allies through derogatory images and language honed over the preceding decades.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Asian characters were previously portrayed as, &quot;ghastly yellow demons&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; During WWII, &quot;[every] major superhero worth his spandex devoted himself to the eradication of asian invaders.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; There was &quot;a constant relay race in which one asian culture merely handed off the baton of hatred to another with no perceptible changes in the manner in which the characters would be portrayed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;

&quot;The only specific depiction of a Hispanic superhero did not end well. In 1975 Marvel gave us Hector Ayala a.k.a The White Tiger.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; &quot;Although he fought for several years alongside the likes of much more popular heroes such as Spider-Man and Daredevil, he only lasted six years before sales of comics featuring him got so bad that Marvel had him retire.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; The most famous Hispanic character is Bane, a villain from Batman.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;

The Native American representation in comic books &quot;can be summed up in the noble savage stereotype&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; &quot; a recurring theme...urg[ed] American indians to abandon their traditional hostility towards the United States. They were, tragically, the ones painted as intolerant and disrespectful of the dominant concerns of white America&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;

===Korean manhwa===
{{Main|Manhwa}}

Korean manhwa has quickly gained popularity outside Korea in recent times as a result of the [[Korean Wave]]. The manhwa industry has suffered through two crashes and strict censorship since its early beginnings as a result of the Japanese occupation of the peninsula which stunts the growth of the industry but has now started to flourish thanks in part to the internet and new ways to read manhwa whether on computers or through smartphones. In the past manhwa would be marketed as manga outside the country in order to make sure they would sell well but now that is no longer needed since more people are now more knowledgeable about the industry and Korean culture.

===Webtoons===
{{Main|Webtoons}}

Webtoons have become popular in South Korea as a new way to read comics. Thanks in part to different censorship rules, color and unique visual effects, and optimization for easier reading on smartphones and computers. More [[manhwa]] have made the switch from traditional print manhwa to online webtoons thanks to better pay and more freedom than traditional print manhwa. The webtoon format has also expanded to other countries outside of Korea like China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Western countries. Major webtoon distributors include [[Lezhin]], [[Naver]], and [[Kakao]].

[[File:René Goscinny.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[René Goscinny]] (1926–1977), writer of the ''[[Astérix]]'' comic book series.]] 
France and [[Belgium]] have a long tradition in comics and comic books, called ''[[Franco-Belgian comics|BDs]]'' (an abbreviation of ''bande dessinées'') in French and ''strips'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Belgian comic books originally written in Dutch show the influence of the Francophone &quot;Franco-Belgian&quot; comics but have their own distinct style.

The name ''bande dessinée'' derives from the original description of the art form as drawn strips (the phrase literally translates as &quot;the drawn strip&quot;), analogous to the sequence of images in a film strip. As in its English equivalent, the word &quot;bande&quot; can be applied to both film and comics. Significantly, the French-language term contains no indication of subject-matter, unlike the American terms &quot;comics&quot; and &quot;funnies&quot;, which imply an art form not to be taken seriously. The distinction of comics as ''le neuvième art'' (literally, &quot;the ninth art&quot;) is prevalent in French scholarship on the form, as is the concept of comics criticism and scholarship itself. Relative to the respective size of their populations, the innumerable authors in France and Belgium publish a high volume of comic books. In North America, the more serious Franco-Belgian comics are often seen as equivalent to graphic novels, but whether they are long or short, bound or in magazine format, in Europe there is no need for a more sophisticated term, as the art's name does not itself imply something frivolous.

In France, the authors control the publication of most comics. The author works within a self-appointed time-frame, and it is common for readers to wait six months or as long as two years between installments. Most books first appear in print as a hardcover book, typically with 48, 56, or 64 pages.

Although ''[[Ally Sloper's Half Holiday]]'' (1884) was aimed at an adult market, publishers quickly targeted a younger demographic, which has led to most publications being for children and has created an association in the public's mind of comics as somewhat juvenile.

In 1954, ''[[Tiger (Fleetway)|Tiger]]'' comics introduced ''[[Roy of the Rovers]]'', the hugely popular football based strip recounting the life of [[Roy Race]] and the team he played for, [[Melchester Rovers]]. The stock media phrase &quot;real 'Roy of the Rovers' stuff&quot; is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip's trademark.&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson, Alan; Young, Christopher (2000), &quot;Golden Boys and Golden Memories: Fiction, Ideology, and Reality in Roy of the Rovers and the Death of the Hero&quot;, in Jones, Dudley; Watkins, Tony, A Necessary Fantasy?: the Heroic Figure in Children's Popular Culture: Vol 18, Garland Publishing. pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt; Other comic books such as ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'', ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'', ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]'', ''[[Viz (comics)|Viz]]'' and ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' also flourished. Some comics, such as ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' and other ''2000 AD'' titles, have been published in a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] form. Underground comics and [[British small press comics|&quot;small press&quot;]] titles have also appeared in the UK, notably ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' and ''[[Escape Magazine]]''.

The content of ''[[Action (comic)|Action]]'', another title aimed at children and launched in the mid-1970s, became the subject of discussion in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Although on a smaller scale than similar investigations in the U.S., such concerns led to a moderation of content published within British comics. Such moderation never became formalized to the extent of promulgating a code, nor did it last long. The UK has also established a healthy market in the reprinting and repackaging of material, notably material originating in the U.S. The lack of reliable supplies of American comic books led to a variety of black-and-white reprints, including Marvel's monster comics of the 1950s, Fawcett's [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and other characters such as [[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle|Sheena]], [[Mandrake the Magician]], and [[the Phantom]]. Several reprint companies became involved in repackaging American material for the British market, notably the importer and distributor Thorpe &amp; Porter. Marvel Comics established a UK office in 1972. DC Comics and [[Dark Horse Comics]] also opened offices in the 1990s. The repackaging of European material has occurred less frequently, although ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' and ''[[Asterix]]'' serials have been successfully translated and repackaged in softcover books.

===Spanish comics===
{{Main|Spanish comics}}It has been stated that the 13th century [[Cantigas de Santa Maria|''Cantigas de Santa María'']] could be considered as the first [[Spain|Spanish]] &quot;comic&quot;, although comic books (also known in [[Spain]] as ''historietas'' or ''tebeos'')  made their debut around 1857. The magazine ''[[TBO (comics)|TBO]]'' was influential in popularizing the medium. After the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] regime imposed strict censorship in all media: [[superhero]] comics were forbidden and as a result, comic heroes were based on [[historical fiction]] (in 1944 the medieval hero ''El Guerrero del Antifaz'' was created by Manuel Gago and another popular medieval hero, ''[[Capitán Trueno]]'', was created in 1956 by [[Víctor Mora (comics)|Víctor Mora]] and [[Miguel Ambrosio Zaragoza]]). Two publishing houses — [[Editorial Bruguera]] and [[Editorial Valenciana]] — dominated the Spanish comics market during its golden age (1950–1970). The most popular comics showed a recognizable style of [[Slapstick Humor|slapstick]] humor (influenced by Franco-Belgian authors such as [[André Franquin|Franquin]]): [[José Escobar Saliente|Escobar]]'s ''[[Carpanta]]'' and ''[[Zipi y Zape]]'', [[Manuel Vázquez Gallego|Vázquez]]'s ''[[Las hermanas Gilda]]'' and ''[[Anacleto, agente secreto|Anacleto]],'' [[Francisco Ibáñez Talavera|Ibáñez]]'s ''[[Mortadelo y Filemón]]'' and ''[[13, Rue del Percebe|13. Rue del Percebe]]'' or [[Jan (comic book writer)|Jan]]'s ''[[Superlópez]]''. After the end of the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist period]], there was an increased interest in adult comics with magazines such as ''Totem'', ''[[El Jueves]]'', ''1984'', and ''[[El Vibora (magazine)|El Víbora]],'' and works such as ''Paracuellos'' by [[Carlos Giménez (comics)|Carlos Giménez]].

[[Spain|Spanish]] artists have traditionally worked in other markets finding great success, either in the American (e.g., [[List of Eisner Award winners|Eisner Award winners]] [[Sergio Aragonés]], [[Salvador Larroca]], [[Gabriel Hernández Walta]], [[Marcos Martín]] or [[David Aja]]), the British (e.g., [[Carlos Ezquerra]], co-creator of ''[[Judge Dredd]]'') or the Franco-Belgian one (e.g., [[Angoulême International Comics Festival|Fauve d'Or winner]] [[:fr:Julio Ribera|Julio Ribera]] or ''[[Blacksad]]'' authors [[Juan Díaz Canales]] and [[Juanjo Guarnido]]).

In [[Italy]], comics (known in Italian as ''fumetti'') made their debut as humor strips at the end of the 19th century, and later evolved into adventure stories. After World War II, however, artists like [[Hugo Pratt]] and [[Guido Crepax]] exposed Italian comics to an international audience. Popular comic books such as ''[[Diabolik]]'' or the ''[[Sergio Bonelli Editore|Bonelli]]'' line—namely ''[[Tex Willer]]'' or ''[[Dylan Dog]]''—remain best-sellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fumettologica.it/2014/06/quanto-vendono-i-fumetti-bonelli-i-dati-2014/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181230160637/http://www.fumettologica.it/2014/06/quanto-vendono-i-fumetti-bonelli-i-dati-2014/ |archive-date=30 December 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream comics are usually published on a monthly basis, in a black-and-white [[digest size]] format, with approximately 100 to 132 pages. Collections of classic material for the most famous characters, usually with more than 200 pages, are also common. Author comics are published in the French BD format, with an example being Pratt's ''[[Corto Maltese]]''.

Italian cartoonists show the influence of comics from other countries, including France, Belgium, Spain, and [[Argentina]]. Italy is also famous for being one of the foremost producers of [[Walt Disney]] comic stories outside the U.S.; [[Donald Duck]]'s superhero alter ego, [[Paperinik]], known in English as Superduck, was created in Italy.

==Distribution==
Distribution has historically been a problem for the comic book industry with many mainstream retailers declining to carry extensive stocks of the most interesting and popular comics. The [[smartphone]] and the [[tablet computer|tablet]] have turned out to be an ideal medium for online distribution.&lt;ref name=NYT72113&gt;{{cite news|title=Embracing Tablets, Comic Book Publishers Cash In on a Digital Revolution|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/business/media/comic-books-cash-in-on-a-digital-revolution.html|accessdate=July 24, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 21, 2013|author=Gregory Schmidt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129063315/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/business/media/comic-books-cash-in-on-a-digital-revolution.html|archive-date=29 January 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital distribution===
On November 13, 2007, [[Marvel Comics]] launched [[Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited]], a subscription service allowing readers to read many [[Digital comic|comics]] from Marvel's history online. The service also includes periodic release new comics not available elsewhere. With the release of ''[[Avenging Spider-Man]]'' #1, Marvel also became the first publisher to provide free digital copies as part of the print copy of the comic book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/16781/avenging_spider-man_1_makes_digital_history|title=Avenging Spider-Man #1 Makes Digital History|date=12 October 2011|accessdate=10 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113090741/http://marvel.com/news/story/16781/avenging_spider-man_1_makes_digital_history|archive-date=13 November 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets, many major publishers have begun releasing titles in digital form. The most popular platform is [[comiXology]]. Some platforms, such as [[Graphicly]], have shut down.

== Comic collections in libraries ==
Many libraries have extensive collections of comics in the form of graphic novels. This is a convenient way for many in the public to become familiar with the medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccgclibraries.com/integrating-comics-into-your-exhibits-and-collections/|title=Integrating Comics Into Your Exhibits and Collections|website=ccgclibraries.com|access-date=30 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905111904/http://ccgclibraries.com/integrating-comics-into-your-exhibits-and-collections/|archive-date=5 September 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guinness World Record ==
The largest comic book ever published was on the 5th of August 2018 in São Paulo, Brazil. It is named ''[[Monica's Gang|Turma da Mônica — O Maior Gibi do Mundo!]]'' by [[Panini Comics|Panini Comics Brasil]] and [[Mauricio de Sousa|Mauricio de Sousa Editora]], and it measures at 69.9&amp;nbsp;cm by 99.8&amp;nbsp;cm (2&amp;nbsp;ft 3.51 in by 3&amp;nbsp;ft 3.29 in).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-comic-book-published|title=Largest comic book published|newspaper=Guinness World Records|access-date=2018-08-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221063117/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-comic-book-published|archive-date=21 December 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese manga author [[Eiichiro Oda]] has made comic book history by attaining a Guinness World Record title for having the &quot;Most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author&quot;. His widely popular comic titled ''[[One Piece]]'' was first serialized in ''[[Weekly Shonen Jump]]'' magazine (Shueisha) in Japan, back in December 1997. In the space of fewer than two decades, the series has accumulated an incredibly loyal following and has gone on to sell an incredible 320,866,000 units, with a substantial 77 volumes of the comic book released over that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2015/6/japanese-manga-&quot;one-piece&quot;-is-most-printed-comic-series-by-one-author-ever-385868|title=Most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author|newspaper=Guinness World Records|access-date=2015-06-26}}{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
