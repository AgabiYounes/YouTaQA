A '''civilization''' or '''civilisation''' is any [[complex society]] characterized by [[urban area|urban development]], [[social stratification]] imposed by a cultural [[elite]], [[symbol]]ic systems of communication (for example, [[writing system]]s), and a perceived separation from and domination over the [[natural environment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 1966&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Adams, Robert McCormick|title=The Evolution of Urban Society|year=1966|page=13|publisher=Transaction Publishers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JrZOwKU0TlsC&amp;q=%22civilizations+are+associated%22|isbn=9780202365947}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Haviland 2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|authors=Haviland, William|title=Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2013|page=250|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DfEWAAAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22civilization+refers+to+societies%22|display-authors=etal|isbn=978-1285675305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Ronald|last=Wright|title=A Short History of Progress|publisher=House of Anansi|year=2004|pages=115, 117, and 212|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nzWPFQIEvfEC&amp;q=%22technical,%20anthropological%22|isbn=9780887847066}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Llobera 2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Josep|last=Llobera|title=An Invitation to Anthropology|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2003|pages=136–137|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_-LDyWxODjAC&amp;q=%22best-known+definition%22|isbn=9781571815972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fernández-Armesto 2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Fernández-Armesto|first=Felipe|title=Civilizations: Culture, Ambition, and the Transformation of Nature |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|year=2001|url= https://books.google.com/?id=3MNzi698aXwC|isbn=9780743216500}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyden 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyden|first=Stephen Vickers|title=The Biology of Civilisation|year=2004|pages=7–8|publisher=UNSW Press|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TX78DfVbM7kC&amp;q=%22the+essential+precondition%22|isbn=9780868407661}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Solms-Laubach 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Franz|last=Solms-Laubach|title=Nietzsche and Early German and Austrian Sociology|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2007|pages=115, 117, and 212|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxTITNduFc4C&amp;dq|isbn=9783110181098}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Children's literature, domestication and social foundation : narratives of civilization and wilderness|last=1964-|first=AbdelRahim, Layla|year=|isbn=9780415661102|location=New York|page=8|oclc=897810261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilizations are intimately associated with and often further defined by other socio-politico-economic characteristics, including [[centralization]], the [[domestication]] of both humans and other organisms, [[division of labor|specialization of labour]], culturally ingrained [[Idea of Progress|ideologies of progress]] and [[supremacism]], [[monument]]al [[architecture]], [[taxation]], societal dependence upon [[farming]] and [[expansionism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Haviland 2013&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright 2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Llobera 2003&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyden 2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Solms-Laubach 2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Historically, civilization has often been understood as a larger and &quot;more advanced&quot; culture, in contrast to smaller, supposedly [[primitive culture]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 1966&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright 2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Llobera 2003&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bolesti|first=Maria|title=Barbarism and Its Discontents|year=2013|publisher=Stanford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cpZZKabXvWAC|isbn=9780804785372}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, some scholars have described civilization as being necessarily multicultural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wei|journal=Globality Studies Journal|year=2011|issue=24|title=Civilization and Culture|first=Ruan |url=https://gsj.stonybrook.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/0024Wei.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this broad sense, a civilization contrasts with non-centralized tribal societies, including the cultures of [[nomadic pastoralist]]s, [[Neolithic]] societies or [[hunter-gather]]ers, but sometimes it also contrasts with the cultures found within civilizations themselves. As an uncountable noun, &quot;civilization&quot; also refers to the process of a society developing into a centralized, urbanized, stratified structure. Civilizations are organized in densely populated settlements divided into [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] [[social class]]es with a ruling elite and subordinate urban and rural populations, which engage in intensive agriculture, mining, small-scale manufacture and trade. Civilization concentrates power, extending human control over the rest of nature, including over other human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Sources of Social Power |last=Mann |first=Michael |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1986 |volume=1 |pages=34–41 |author-link=Michael Mann (sociologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilization, as its etymology (below) suggests, is a concept originally linked to towns and cities. The earliest emergence of civilizations is generally associated with the final stages of the [[Neolithic Revolution]], culminating in the relatively rapid process of [[urban revolution]] and [[state formation]], a political development associated with the appearance of a governing elite.

== History of the concept ==
The English word ''civilization'' comes from the [[Early modern France|16th-century French]] ''civilisé'' (&quot;civilized&quot;), from Latin ''civilis'' (&quot;civil&quot;), related to ''civis'' (&quot;citizen&quot;) and ''civitas'' (&quot;city&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3041K2Zv76AC&amp;pg=PT73 |title=The SAGE Glossary of the Social and Behavioral Sciences |last=Sullivan |first=Larry E. |year=2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=9781412951432 |page=73 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental treatise is [[Norbert Elias]]'s ''[[The Civilizing Process]]'' (1939), which traces social [[mores]] from [[Court (royal)|medieval courtly society]] to the [[Early Modern period]].&lt;ref&gt;It remains the most influential sociological study of the topic, spawning its own body of secondary literature. Notably, [[Hans Peter Duerr]] attacked it in a major work (3,500 pages in five volumes, published 1988–2002). Elias, at the time a nonagenarian, was still able to respond to the criticism the year before his death. In 2002, Duerr was himself criticized by Michael Hinz's ''Der Zivilisationsprozeß: Mythos oder Realität'' (2002), saying that his criticism amounted to a hateful defamation of Elias, through excessive standards of [[political correctness]].  ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-25327104.html 40/2002]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Philosophy of Civilization'' (1923), [[Albert Schweitzer]] outlines two opinions: one purely [[materialism|material]] and the other material and [[ethic]]al. He said that the world crisis was from humanity losing the ethical idea of civilization, &quot;the sum total of all progress made by man in every sphere of action and from every point of view in so far as the progress helps towards the spiritual perfecting of individuals as the progress of all progress&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Schweitzer. The Philosophy of Civilization, trans. C.T. Campion (Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books, 1987), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adjectives like &quot;civility&quot; developed in the mid-16th century. The abstract noun &quot;civilization&quot;, meaning &quot;civilized condition&quot;, came in the 1760s, again from French. The first known use in French is in 1757, by [[Victor de Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau]], and the first use in English is attributed to [[Adam Ferguson]], who in his 1767 ''[[Essay on the History of Civil Society]]'' wrote, &lt;!-- Keep original spelling please. --&gt;&quot;Not only the individual advances from infancy to manhood, but the species itself from rudeness to civilisation&quot;.&lt;ref name=Benveniste&gt;Cited after [[Émile Benveniste]], ''Civilisation. Contribution à l'histoire du mot'' (''Civilisation. Contribution to the history of the word''), 1954, published in ''Problèmes de linguistique générale'', [[Éditions Gallimard]], 1966, pp. 336–345 (translated by Mary Elizabeth Meek as ''Problems in general linguistics'', 2 vols., 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; The word was therefore opposed to barbarism or rudeness, in the active pursuit of [[Progress (history)|progress]] characteristic of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

In the late 1700s and early 1800s, during the [[French Revolution]], &quot;civilization&quot; was used in the [[Grammatical number|singular]], never in the plural, and meant the progress of humanity as a whole. This is still the case in French.&lt;ref name=velkley/&gt; The use of &quot;civilizations&quot; as a countable noun was in occasional use in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in the title ''A narrative of the loss of the Winterton East Indiaman wrecked on the coast of Madagascar in 1792; and of the sufferings connected with that event. To which is subjoined a short account of the natives of Madagascar, with suggestions as to their civilizations'' by J. Hatchard, L.B. Seeley and T. Hamilton, London, 1820.&lt;/ref&gt; but has become much more common in the later 20th century, sometimes just meaning [[culture]] (itself in origin an uncountable noun, made countable in the context of [[ethnography]]).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Civilization&quot; (1974), ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' 15th ed. Vol. II, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., 956. Retrieved 25 August 2007. Using the terms &quot;civilization&quot; and &quot;culture&quot; as equivalents is controversial{{clarify|date=October 2014}} and generally rejected, so that for example some types of culture are not normally described as civilizations.&lt;/ref&gt; Only in this generalized sense does it become possible to speak of a &quot;medieval civilization&quot;, which in Elias's sense would have been an oxymoron.

Already in the 18th century, civilization was not always seen as an improvement. One historically important distinction between culture and civilization is from the writings of [[Rousseau]], particularly his work about education, ''[[Emile: or, On Education|Emile]]''. Here, civilization, being more [[Reason|rational]] and socially driven, is not fully in accord with [[human nature]], and &quot;human wholeness is achievable only through the recovery of or approximation to an original prediscursive or prerational natural unity&quot; (see [[noble savage]]). From this, a new approach was developed, especially in Germany, first by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], and later by philosophers such as [[Kierkegaard]] and [[Nietzsche]]. This sees cultures as natural organisms, not defined by &quot;conscious, rational, deliberative acts&quot;, but a kind of pre-rational &quot;folk spirit&quot;. Civilization, in contrast, though more rational and more successful in material progress, is unnatural and leads to &quot;vices of social life&quot; such as guile, hypocrisy, envy and avarice.&lt;ref name=velkley&gt;{{Citation|title=Being after Rousseau: Philosophy and Culture in Question| last=Velkley|first=Richard|year=2002|chapter=The Tension in the Beautiful: On Culture and Civilization in Rousseau and German Philosophy|pages=11–30|publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[World War II]], [[Leo Strauss]], having fled Germany, argued in New York that this opinion of civilization was behind [[Nazism]] and German [[militarism]] and [[nihilism]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://archive.org/details/LeoStraussOnGermanNihilism1941 On German Nihilism]&quot; (1999, originally a 1941 lecture), ''Interpretation'' 26, no. 3 edited by David Janssens and Daniel Tanguay.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Grün - The End of Dinner.jpg|thumb|The emergence of [[table manners]] and other forms of [[etiquette]] and [[self-restraint]] are presented as one of the characteristics of ''civilized'' society by [[Norbert Elias]] in ''[[The Civilizing Process]]'' (1939). ''The End of Dinner'' by [[Jules-Alexandre Grün]] (1913).]]
Social scientists such as [[V. Gordon Childe]] have named a number of traits that distinguish a civilization from other kinds of society.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Childe, V., ''What Happened in History'' (Penguin, 1942) and ''Man Makes Himself'' (Harmondsworth, 1951).&lt;/ref&gt; Civilizations have been distinguished by their means of subsistence, types of [[livelihood]], [[Human settlement|settlement]] patterns, [[forms of government]], [[social stratification]], economic systems, [[literacy]] and other cultural traits. [[Andrew Nikiforuk]] argues that &quot;civilizations relied on shackled human muscle. It took the energy of slaves to plant crops, clothe emperors, and build cities&quot; and considers slavery to be a common feature of pre-modern civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Energy of Slaves: Oil and the new servitude |last=Nikiforuk |first=Andrew |publisher=Greystone Books |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All civilizations have depended on [[agriculture]] for subsistence, with the possible exception of some early civilizations in Peru which may have depended upon maritime resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hallofmaat.com/modules.php?name=Articles&amp;file=article&amp;sid=85 | title=The Maritime Foundations of Andean Civilization: An Evolving Hypothesis | last=Moseley | first=Michael | publisher=The Hall of Ma'at | format= | website= | accessdate=13 June 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818070331/http://www.hallofmaat.com/modules.php?name=Articles&amp;file=article&amp;sid=85 | archive-date=18 August 2015 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Moseley |first=Michael | title = The Maritime Foundations of Andean Civilization |year=1975 |publisher=Cummings |location=Menlo Park |isbn=978-0-8465-4800-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grain farms can result in accumulated storage and a surplus of food, particularly when people use intensive agricultural techniques such as artificial [[fertilisation|fertilization]], [[irrigation]] and [[crop rotation]]. It is possible but more difficult to accumulate horticultural production, and so civilizations based on horticultural gardening have been very rare.&lt;ref&gt;Hadjikoumis; Angelos, Robinson; and Sarah Viner-Daniels (Eds) (2011), &quot;Dynamics of Neolithisation in Europe: Studies in honour of Andrew Sherratt&quot; (Oxbow Books)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grain]] surpluses have been especially important because grain can be [[food storage|stored]] for a long time. A surplus of food permits some people to do things besides produce food for a living: early civilizations included [[soldiers]], [[artisan]]s, [[priest]]s and priestesses, and other people with specialized careers. A surplus of food results in a division of labour and a more diverse range of human activity, a defining trait of civilizations. However, in some places hunter-gatherers have had access to food surpluses, such as among some of the indigenous peoples of the [[Pacific Northwest]] and perhaps during the [[Mesolithic]] [[Natufian culture]]. It is possible that food surpluses and relatively large scale social organization and division of labour predates plant and animal domestication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url= http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/06/gobekli-tepe/mann-text/1 |title= Göbekli Tepe |magazine= [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|date = June 2011|last= Mann|first = Charles C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilizations have distinctly different settlement patterns from other societies. The word &quot;civilization&quot; is sometimes simply defined as &quot;'''living in cities''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Standage]] (2005), ''A History of the World in 6 Glasses'', Walker &amp; Company, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-farmers tend to gather in cities to work and to trade.

Compared with other societies, civilizations have a more complex political structure, namely the [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref&gt;Grinin, Leonid E (Ed) et al. (2004), &quot;The Early State and its Alternatives and Analogues&quot; (Ichitel)&lt;/ref&gt; State societies are more stratified&lt;ref&gt;Bondarenko, Dmitri et al. (2004), &quot;Alternatives to Social Evolution&quot; in Grinin op cit.&lt;/ref&gt; than other societies; there is a greater difference among the social classes. The [[ruling class]], normally concentrated in the cities, has control over much of the surplus and exercises its will through the actions of a [[Forms of government|government]] or [[bureaucracy]]. [[Morton Fried]], a [[conflict theory|conflict theorist]] and [[Elman Service]], an integration theorist, have classified human cultures based on political systems and [[social inequality]]. This system of classification contains four categories&lt;ref&gt;Bogucki, Peter (1999), &quot;The Origins of Human Society&quot; (Wiley Blackwell)&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[horticulture|Horticultural]]/[[Pastoralism|pastoral]] societies'' in which there are generally two inherited social classes; chief and commoner.

Economically, civilizations display more complex patterns of ownership and exchange than less organized societies. Living in one place allows people to accumulate more [[Ownership|personal possessions]] than nomadic people. Some people also acquire [[landed property]], or private ownership of the land. Because a percentage of people in civilizations do not grow their own food, they must [[trade]] their goods and services for food in a [[Market (economics)|market]] system, or receive food through the levy of [[tribute]], redistributive [[taxation]], [[tariffs]] or [[tithe]]s from the food producing segment of the population. Early human cultures functioned through a [[gift economy]] supplemented by limited [[barter]] systems. By the early [[Iron Age]], contemporary civilizations developed [[money]] as a medium of exchange for increasingly complex transactions. In a village, the potter makes a pot for the brewer and the brewer compensates the potter by giving him a certain amount of beer. In a city, the potter may need a new roof, the roofer may need new shoes, the cobbler may need new horseshoes, the blacksmith may need a new coat and the tanner may need a new pot. These people may not be personally acquainted with one another and their needs may not occur all at the same time. A monetary system is a way of organizing these obligations to ensure that they are fulfilled. From the days of the earliest monetarized civilizations, monopolistic controls of monetary systems have benefited the social and political elites.

[[Writing]], developed first by people in [[Sumer]], is considered a hallmark of civilization and &quot;appears to accompany the rise of complex administrative bureaucracies or the conquest state&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Cahokia and the Mississippians|last=Pauketat|first=Timothy R.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780521520669|location=|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traders and bureaucrats relied on writing to keep accurate records. Like money, writing was necessitated by the size of the population of a city and the complexity of its commerce among people who are not all personally acquainted with each other. However, writing is not always necessary for civilization, as shown by the [[Inca]] civilization of the Andes, which did not use writing at all except from a complex recording system consisting of cords and nodes instead: the &quot;Quipus&quot;, and still functioned as a civilized society.

Aided by their division of labour and central government planning, civilizations have developed many other diverse cultural traits. These include organized [[religion]], development in the [[arts]], and countless new advances in [[science]] and [[technology]].

Through history, successful civilizations have spread, taking over more and more territory, and assimilating more and more previously-uncivilized people. Nevertheless, some tribes or people remain uncivilized even to this day. These cultures are called by some &quot;[[primitive culture|primitive]]&quot;, a term that is regarded by others as pejorative. &quot;Primitive&quot; implies in some way that a culture is &quot;first&quot; (Latin = ''primus''), that it has not changed since the dawn of humanity, though this has been demonstrated not to be true. Specifically, as all of today's cultures are contemporaries, today's so-called primitive cultures are in no way antecedent to those we consider civilized. Anthropologists today use the term &quot;[[Protohistoric archaeology|non-literate]]&quot; to describe these peoples.

Civilization has been spread by [[colonization]], [[imperialism|invasion]], [[religious conversion]], the extension of [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic control]] and [[trade]], and by introducing agriculture and writing to non-literate peoples. Some non-civilized people may willingly adapt to civilized behaviour. But civilization is also spread by the technical, material and social dominance that civilization engenders.

Assessments of what level of civilization a polity has reached are based on comparisons of the relative importance of agricultural as opposed to trade or manufacturing capacities, the territorial extensions of its power, the complexity of its [[division of labor|division of labour]], and the carrying capacity of its [[urbanism|urban centres]]. Secondary elements include a developed transportation system, writing, standardized measurement, currency, contractual and [[tort]]-based legal systems, art, architecture, mathematics, scientific understanding, [[metallurgy]], political structures and organized religion.

Traditionally, polities that managed to achieve notable military, ideological and [[economic power]] defined themselves as &quot;civilized&quot; as opposed to other societies or human groupings outside their sphere of influence&amp;nbsp;– calling the latter [[barbarians]], [[wikt:savages|savages]], and [[primitive culture|primitives]]. In a modern-day context, &quot;civilized people&quot; have been contrasted with [[indigenous people]] or [[tribal societies]].

== Cultural identity ==
{{further|Cultural area}}
&lt;!-- [[File:Persepolis iran.jpg;The king of Holy Kingdon Rum kneel of the king of Arabia]] comment to remove redlinked img--&gt;
&quot;Civilization&quot; can also refer to the [[culture]] of a complex society, not just the society itself. Every society, civilization or not, has a specific set of ideas and customs, and a certain set of manufactures and arts that make it unique. Civilizations tend to develop intricate cultures, including a [[state (polity)|state]]-based [[decision making]] apparatus, a [[literature]], professional [[art]], [[architecture]], organized [[religion]] and complex customs of [[education]], [[coercion]] and control associated with maintaining the elite.

[[File:Clash_of_Civilizations_mapn2.png|thumb|upright=2.0|A world map of major civilizations according to the political hypothesis ''[[Clash of Civilizations]]'' by [[Samuel P. Huntington]]]]

The intricate culture associated with civilization has a tendency to spread to and influence other cultures, sometimes assimilating them into the civilization (a classic example being [[China|Chinese]] civilization and its influence on nearby civilizations such as Korea, Japan and Vietnam). Many civilizations are actually large cultural spheres containing many nations and regions. The civilization in which someone lives is that person's broadest cultural identity.

Many historians have focused on these broad cultural spheres and have treated civilizations as discrete units. Early twentieth-century philosopher [[Oswald Spengler]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Spengler, Oswald 1919&quot;&gt;Spengler, Oswald, ''Decline of the West: Perspectives of World History'' (1919)&lt;/ref&gt; uses the German word ''Kultur'', &quot;culture&quot;, for what many call a &quot;civilization&quot;. Spengler believed a civilization's coherence is based on a single primary cultural symbol. Cultures experience cycles of birth, life, decline and death, often supplanted by a potent new culture, formed around a compelling new cultural symbol. Spengler states civilization is the beginning of the decline of a culture as &quot;the most external and artificial states of which a species of developed humanity is capable&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spengler, Oswald 1919&quot; /&gt;

This &quot;unified culture&quot; concept of civilization also influenced the theories of historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] in the mid-twentieth century. Toynbee explored civilization processes in his multi-volume ''[[A Study of History]],'' which traced the rise and, in most cases, the decline of 21 civilizations and five &quot;arrested civilizations&quot;. Civilizations generally declined and fell, according to Toynbee, because of the failure of a &quot;creative minority&quot;, through moral or religious decline, to meet some important challenge, rather than mere economic or environmental causes.

[[Samuel P. Huntington]] defines civilization as &quot;the highest cultural grouping of people and the broadest level of cultural identity people have short of that which distinguishes humans from other species&quot;. Huntington's theories about civilizations are discussed [[Civilization#Future|below]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LO4xG-bH1CQC&amp;pg=PA43 |title=The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order |last=Huntington |first=Samuel P. |date=1997 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9781416561248 |page=43 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complex systems ==
Another group of theorists, making use of [[systems theory]], looks at a civilization as a [[complex system]], i.e., a framework by which a group of objects can be analysed that work in concert to produce some result. Civilizations can be seen as networks of cities that emerge from pre-urban cultures and are defined by the economic, political, military, diplomatic, social and cultural interactions among them. Any organization is a complex [[social system]] and a civilization is a large organization. Systems theory helps guard against superficial but misleading analogies in the study and description of civilizations.

Systems theorists look at many types of relations between cities, including economic relations, cultural exchanges and political/diplomatic/military relations. These spheres often occur on different scales. For example, trade networks were, until the nineteenth century, much larger than either cultural spheres or political spheres. Extensive trade routes, including the [[Silk Road]] through [[Central Asia]] and [[Indian Ocean]] sea routes linking the [[Roman Empire]], [[History of Iran|Persian Empire]], India and China, were well established 2000 years ago, when these civilizations scarcely shared any political, diplomatic, military, or cultural relations. The first evidence of such long distance trade is in the [[Ancient history|ancient world]]. During the [[Uruk period]], Guillermo Algaze has argued that trade relations connected Egypt, Mesopotamia, Iran and Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Algaze, Guillermo, ''The Uruk World System: The Dynamics of Expansion of Early Mesopotamian Civilization'' (Second Edition, 2004) ({{ISBN|978-0-226-01382-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; Resin found later in the [[Royal Cemetery at Ur]] is suggested was traded northwards from Mozambique.

Many theorists argue that the entire world has already become integrated into a single &quot;[[world-system theory|world system]]&quot;, a process known as [[globalization]]. Different civilizations and societies all over the globe are economically, politically, and even culturally interdependent in many ways. There is debate over when this integration began, and what sort of integration – cultural, technological, economic, political, or military-diplomatic – is the key indicator in determining the extent of a civilization. [[David Wilkinson (political scientist)|David Wilkinson]] has proposed that economic and military-diplomatic integration of the [[Mesopotamia]]n and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] civilizations resulted in the creation of what he calls the &quot;Central Civilization&quot; around 1500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://ojs.lib.byu.edu/spc/index.php/CCR/article/view/12262/12162|title=Central Civilization|last1=Wilkinson|first1=David|author-link1=David Wilkinson (political scientist)|journal=[[Comparative Civilizations Review]]|volume=17|issue=|date=Fall 1987|pages=31–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central Civilization later expanded to include the entire Middle East and Europe, and then expanded to a global scale with European colonization, integrating the Americas, Australia, China and Japan by the nineteenth century. According to Wilkinson, civilizations can be culturally heterogeneous, like the Central Civilization, or homogeneous, like the Japanese civilization. What Huntington calls the &quot;clash of civilizations&quot; might be characterized by Wilkinson as a clash of cultural spheres within a single global civilization. Others point to the [[Crusades]] as the first step in globalization. The more conventional viewpoint is that networks of societies have expanded and shrunk since [[Ancient history|ancient times]], and that the current globalized economy and culture is a product of recent European colonialism. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The notion of [[world history]] as a succession of &quot;civilizations&quot; is an entirely modern one.
In the European [[Age of Discovery]], emerging [[Modernity]] was put into stark contrast with the
[[Neolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]]  stage of the cultures of the [[New World]], suggesting
that the complex states had emerged at some time in prehistory.&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;Explicit theories of the origin of the state are relatively modern [...] the age of exploration, by making Europeans aware that many peoples throughout the world lived, not in states, but in independent villages or tribes, made the state seem less natural, and thus more in need of explanation.&quot;
{{cite web |url=http://72.52.202.216/~fenderse/Carneiro.htm |title=A Theory of the Origin of the State |accessdate=5 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530140606/http://72.52.202.216/~fenderse/Carneiro.htm |archivedate=30 May 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term &quot;civilization&quot; as it is now most commonly understood, a complex state with centralisation,  social stratification and specialization of labour, corresponds to early empires that arise in the [[Fertile Crescent]] in the [[Early Bronze Age]], around roughly 3000 BC.
[[Gordon Childe]] defined the emergence of civilization as the result of two successive revolutions: the [[Neolithic Revolution]], triggering the development of settled communities, and the [[Urban Revolution]].

===Urban Revolution===
{{Main|Neolithic|Bronze Age|Cradle of Civilization}}
At first, the [[Neolithic]] was associated with shifting subsistence cultivation, where continuous farming led to the depletion of [[soil fertility]] resulting in the requirement to cultivate fields further and further removed from the settlement, eventually compelling the settlement itself to move. In major semi-arid river valleys, annual flooding renewed soil fertility every year, with the result that population densities could rise significantly.
This encouraged a [[secondary products revolution]] in which people used domesticated animals not just for meat, but also for milk, wool, manure and pulling ploughs and carts&amp;nbsp;– a development that spread through the Eurasian Oecumene.

The earlier neolithic technology and lifestyle was established first in Western Asia (for example at [[Göbekli Tepe]], from about 9,130 BCE), and later in the [[Yellow River]] and [[Yangtze]] basins in China (for example the [[Pengtoushan]] culture from 7,500 BCE), and later spread.
[[Mesopotamia]] is the site of the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10,000 BCE, with civilizations developing from 6,500 years ago. This area has been identified as having &quot;inspired some of the most important developments in human history including the invention of the wheel, the planting of the first cereal crops and the development of cursive script.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;historyandpolicy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-13.html|title=Iraq, past, present and future: a thoroughly-modern mandate?|last=Milton-Edwards|first=Beverley|date=May 2003|work=History &amp; Policy|publisher=History &amp; Policy|accessdate=9 December 2010|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar pre-civilized &quot;neolithic revolutions&quot; also began independently from 7,000 BCE in northwestern [[South America]] (the [[Norte Chico civilization]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Haas |first=Jonathan |last2=Creamer |first2=Winifred |last3=Ruiz |first3=Alvaro |date=December 2004 |title=Dating the Late Archaic occupation of the Norte Chico region in Peru |url= |journal=Nature |language=En |volume=432 |issue=7020 |pages=1020–1023 |doi=10.1038/nature03146 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=15616561}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mesoamerica]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennett, Douglas J.; Winterhalder, Bruce (2006).

The [[8.2 kiloyear event|8.2 Kiloyear Arid Event]] and the [[5.9 kiloyear event|5.9 Kiloyear]] [[Pluvial|Interpluvial]] saw the drying out of semiarid regions and a major spread of deserts.&lt;ref&gt;De Meo, James (2nd Edition), &quot;Saharasia&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  This climate change shifted the cost-benefit ratio of [[endemic warfare|endemic violence]] between communities, which saw the abandonment of unwalled village communities and the appearance of walled cities, associated with the first civilizations.

[[File:Lascar Avenue of the Dead and the Pyramid of the Sun in the background (4566574277).jpg|thumb|The ruins of [[Mesoamerica]]n city [[Teotihuacan]]]]
This &quot;[[urban revolution]]&quot; marked the beginning of the accumulation of transferable surpluses, which helped economies and cities develop. It was associated with the state monopoly of violence, the appearance of a soldier class and endemic warfare, the rapid development of hierarchies, and the appearance of human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ritual human sacrifice promoted and sustained the evolution of stratified societies&quot; op cit{{clarify|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The civilized urban revolution in turn was dependent upon the development of [[sedentism]], the domestication of grains and animals and development of lifestyles that facilitated [[economies of scale]] and accumulation of surplus production by certain social sectors.  The transition from ''complex cultures'' to ''civilizations'', while still disputed, seems to be associated with the development of state structures, in which power was further monopolized by an elite ruling class&lt;ref&gt;Carniero, R.L. (Ed) (1967), &quot;The Evolution of Society: Selections from Herbert Spencer’s Principles of Sociology&quot;, (Univ. of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1967), pp. 32–47, 63–96, 153–165.&lt;/ref&gt; who practised human sacrifice.&lt;ref name=&quot;nature.com&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first1 = Joseph |last1 = Watts|first2 =Oliver|last2 = Sheehan|first3 = Quentin D.|last3 = Atkinson|first4 = Joseph|last4 = Bulbulia|first5 = Russell D.|last5= Gray|title = Ritual human sacrifice promoted and sustained the evolution of stratified societies|journal =Nature |volume = 532|issue = 7598|pages = 228–231|date = 4 April 2016|doi = 10.1038/nature17159|pmid = 27042932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the Neolithic period, various elitist [[Chalcolithic]] civilizations began to rise in various [[Cradle of civilisation|&quot;cradles&quot;]] from around 3300 BCE, expanding into large-scale [[empire]]s in the course of the Bronze Age ([[Old Kingdom of Egypt]], [[Akkadian Empire]], [[Assyrian Empire]], [[Old Assyrian Empire]], [[Hittite Empire]]).

A parallel development took place independently in the [[Pre-Columbian Americas]], where the [[Mayan civilization|Mayans]] began to be [[Maya city|urbanised]] around 500 BCE, and the fully fledged [[Aztec Empire|Aztec]] and [[Inca Empire|Inca]] emerged by the 15th century, briefly before European contact.

=== Axial Age ===
{{Main|Axial Age}}
{{further|Iron Age|Hinduism|Christianization|Spread of Buddhism|Spread of Islam}}
The [[Bronze Age collapse]] was followed by the Iron Age around 1200 BCE, during which a number of new civilizations emerged, culminating in a period from the 8th to the 3rd century BCE which [[Karl Jaspers]] termed the [[Axial Age]], presented as a critical transitional phase leading to [[Classical antiquity|classical civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Tarnas, Richard (1993). ''The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View'' (Ballantine Books)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[William Hardy McNeill]] proposed that this period of history was one in which culture contact between previously separate civilizations saw the &quot;closure of the [[oecumene]]&quot; and led to accelerated social change from China to the Mediterranean, associated with the spread of coinage, larger empires and new religions. This view has recently been championed by Christopher Chase-Dunn and other [[world systems theory|world systems theorists]].

== Fall of civilizations ==
{{prose|section|date=July 2013}}
{{Main|Societal collapse}}
Civilizations have generally ended in one of two ways; either through being incorporated into another expanding civilization (e.g. As Ancient Egypt was incorporated into Hellenistic Greek, and subsequently Roman civilizations), or by collapse and reversion to a simpler form, as happens in what are called Dark Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, Arnold (1965) &quot;A Study of History&quot; (OUP)&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many explanations put forward for the collapse of civilization. Some focus on historical examples, and others on general theory.
* [[Ibn Khaldūn]]'s ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' influenced theories of the analysis, growth and decline of the Islamic civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Campanini (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=5DoasQxzvNQC&amp;pg=PA75 ''Studies on Ibn Khaldûn''], Polimetrica s.a.s., p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested repeated invasions from nomadic peoples limited development and led to social collapse.[[File:Invasions of the Roman Empire 1.png|thumb|[[Migration Period|Barbarian invasions]] played an important role in the fall of the [[Roman Empire]].]] 
* [[Edward Gibbon]]'s work ''[[The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' was a well-known and detailed analysis of the fall of Roman civilization. Gibbon suggested the final act of the collapse of Rome was the fall of [[Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1453 CE. For Gibbon, &quot;The decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the cause of the destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. The story of the ruin is simple and obvious; and instead of inquiring why the Roman Empire was destroyed, we should rather be surprised that it has subsisted for so long&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', 2nd ed., vol. 4, ed. by J. B. Bury (London, 1909), pp.&amp;nbsp;173–174. Chapter XXXVIII: Reign Of Clovis. Part VI. General Observations On The Fall Of The Roman Empire In The West.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Theodor Mommsen]] in his ''[[History of Rome (Mommsen)|History of Rome]]'' suggested Rome collapsed with the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in 476 CE and he also tended towards a biological analogy of &quot;genesis&quot;, &quot;growth&quot;, &quot;senescence&quot;, &quot;collapse&quot; and &quot;decay&quot;.
* [[Oswald Spengler]], in his ''[[Decline of the West]]'' rejected [[Petrarch]]'s chronological division, and suggested that there had been only eight &quot;mature civilizations&quot;. Growing cultures, he argued, tend to develop into imperialistic civilizations, which expand and ultimately collapse, with democratic forms of government ushering in [[plutocracy]] and ultimately [[imperialism]].
* [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] in his ''[[A Study of History]]'' suggested that there had been a much larger number of civilizations, including a small number of arrested civilizations, and that all civilizations tended to go through the cycle identified by Mommsen. The cause of the fall of a civilization occurred when a cultural [[elite]] became a [[parasitic]] elite, leading to the rise of internal and external [[proletariat]]s.
* [[Joseph Tainter]] in ''[[Societal collapse|The Collapse of Complex Societies]]'' suggested that there were [[diminishing returns]] to [[complexity]], due to which, as states achieved a maximum permissible complexity, they would decline when further increases actually produced a negative return. Tainter suggested that Rome achieved this figure in the 2nd century CE.
* [[Jared Diamond]] in his 2005 book ''[[Collapse (book)|Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'' suggests five major reasons for the collapse of 41 studied cultures: environmental damage, such as [[deforestation]] and [[soil erosion]]; [[climate change (general concept)|climate change]]; dependence upon [[international trade|long-distance trade]] for needed resources; increasing levels of internal and external violence, such as war or invasion; and societal responses to internal and environmental problems.
* [[Peter Turchin]] in his [https://web.archive.org/web/20060830212141/http://www.eeb.uconn.edu/faculty/turchin/HistDyn.htm ''Historical Dynamics''] and [[Andrey Korotayev]] ''et al.'' in their [https://www.academia.edu/22215616/Introduction_to_Social_Macrodynamics_Secular_Cycles_and_Millennial_Trends ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics, Secular Cycles, and Millennial Trends''] suggest a number of mathematical models describing collapse of agrarian civilizations. For example, the basic logic of Turchin's &quot;fiscal-demographic&quot; model can be outlined as follows: during the initial phase of a sociodemographic [[Social cycle theory|cycle]] we observe relatively high levels of per capita production and consumption, which leads not only to relatively high [[population growth]] rates, but also to relatively high rates of surplus production. As a result, during this phase the population can afford to pay taxes without great problems, the taxes are quite easily collectible, and the population growth is accompanied by the growth of state revenues. During the intermediate phase, the increasing [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] leads to the decrease of per capita production and consumption levels, it becomes more and more difficult to collect taxes, and state revenues stop growing, whereas the state expenditures grow due to the growth of the population controlled by the state. As a result, during this phase the state starts experiencing considerable fiscal problems. During the final pre-collapse phases the overpopulation leads to further decrease of per capita production, the surplus production further decreases, state revenues shrink, but the state needs more and more resources to control the growing (though with lower and lower rates) population. Eventually this leads to famines, epidemics, state breakdown, and demographic and civilization collapse (Peter Turchin. ''Historical Dynamics.'' [[Princeton University Press]], 2003:121–127; [[Andrey Korotayev]] et al. [https://www.academia.edu/22215616/Introduction_to_Social_Macrodynamics_Secular_Cycles_and_Millennial_Trends Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends. Moscow: Russian Academy of Sciences, 2006]).
* [[Peter Heather]] argues in his book ''[[Decline of the Roman Empire#Peter Heather|The Fall of the Roman Empire: a New History of Rome and the Barbarians]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter J. Heather|title=The Fall Of The Roman Empire: A New History Of Rome And The Barbarians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wCOJfTB7HtgC|accessdate=22 June 2012|date=1 December 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-515954-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; that this civilization did not end for moral or economic reasons, but because centuries of contact with barbarians across the frontier generated its own nemesis by making them a more sophisticated and dangerous adversary. The fact that Rome needed to generate ever greater revenues to equip and re-equip armies that were for the first time repeatedly defeated in the field, led to the dismemberment of the Empire. Although this argument is specific to Rome, it can also be applied to the Asiatic Empire of the Egyptians, to the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties of China, to the Muslim [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and others.
* [[Bryan Ward-Perkins]], in his book ''The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bryan Ward-Perkins|title=The Fall of Rome: And the End of Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2vSUh9KbfKAC|accessdate=22 June 2012|date=7 September 2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280728-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows the real horrors associated with the collapse of a civilization for the people who suffer its effects, unlike many revisionist historians who downplay this. The collapse of complex society meant that even basic plumbing disappeared from the continent for 1,000 years. Similar [[Greek dark ages|Dark Age]] collapses are seen with the Late [[Bronze Age collapse]] in the Eastern Mediterranean, the collapse of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], on [[Easter Island]] and elsewhere.
* [[Arthur Demarest]] argues in ''[[Ancient Maya: The Rise and Fall of a Rainforest Civilization]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |isbn = 978-0-521-53390-4|title = Ancient Maya: The Rise and Fall of a Rainforest Civilization|last1 = Demarest|first1 = Arthur|date = 9 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a holistic perspective to the most recent evidence from archaeology, [[paleoecology]], and epigraphy, that no one explanation is sufficient but that a series of erratic, complex events, including loss of soil fertility, drought and rising levels of internal and external violence led to the disintegration of the courts of Mayan kingdoms, which began a spiral of decline and decay. He argues that the collapse of the Maya has lessons for civilization today.
* Jeffrey A. McNeely has recently suggested that &quot;a review of historical evidence shows that past civilizations have tended to [[over-exploit]] their forests, and that such abuse of important resources has been a significant factor in the decline of the over-exploiting society&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;McNeely, Jeffrey A. (1994) &quot;Lessons of the past: Forests and Biodiversity&quot; (Vol 3, No 1 1994. Biodiversity and Conservation)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thomas Homer-Dixon]] in [http://www.theupsideofdown.com/ ''The Upside of Down: Catastrophe, Creativity, and the Renewal of Civilization''], where he considers that the fall in the [[EROEI|energy return on investments]]. The energy expended to energy yield ratio is central to limiting the survival of civilizations. The degree of social complexity is associated strongly, he suggests, with the amount of disposable energy environmental, economic and technological systems allow. When this amount decreases civilizations either have to access new energy sources or they will collapse.
* [[Feliks Koneczny]] in his work &quot;On the Plurality of Civilizations&quot;  calls his study the science on civilizations. Civilizations fall not because they must or there exist some cyclical or a &quot;biological&quot; life span. There still exist two ancient civilizations&amp;nbsp;– Brahmin-Hindu and Chinese&amp;nbsp;– which are not ready to fall any time soon. Koneczny claimed that civilizations cannot be mixed into hybrids, an inferior civilization when given equal rights within a highly developed civilization will overcome it. One of Koneczny's claims in his study on civilizations is that &quot;a person cannot be civilized in two or more ways&quot; without falling into what he calls an &quot;abcivilized state&quot; (as in abnormal). He also stated that when two or more civilizations exist next to one another and as long as they are vital, they will be in an existential combat imposing its own &quot;method of organizing social life&quot; upon the other.&lt;ref&gt;Koneczny, Feliks (1962) On the Plurality of Civilizations, Posthumous English translation by Polonica Publications, London {{ASIN|B0000CLABJ}}. Originally published in Polish, O Wielości Cywilizacyj, Gebethner &amp; Wolff, Kraków 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; Absorbing alien &quot;method of organizing social life&quot; that is civilization and giving it equal rights yields a process of decay and decomposition.

Political scientist [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]] has argued that the defining characteristic of the 21st century will be a [[clash of civilizations]].&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, Samuel P., ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order'', (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Huntington, conflicts between civilizations will supplant the conflicts between [[nation-state]]s and ideologies that characterized the 19th and 20th centuries. These views have been strongly challenged by others like [[Edward Said]], Muhammed Asadi and [[Amartya Sen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selvesandothers.org/article15618.html |title=A Critique of Huntington's &quot;Clash of Civilizations&quot; |last=Asadi |first=Muhammed |date=22 January 2007 |publisher=Selves and Others |accessdate=23 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426042806/http://www.selvesandothers.org/article15618.html |archivedate=26 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Inglehart]] and [[Pippa Norris]] have argued that the &quot;true clash of civilizations&quot; between the Muslim world and the West is caused by the Muslim rejection of the West's more liberal sexual values, rather than a difference in political ideology, although they note that this lack of tolerance is likely to lead to an eventual rejection of (true) democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/globaliz/cultural/2003/0304clash.htm|title=The True Clash of Civilizations|last=Inglehart|first=Ronald|author2=Pippa Norris|date=March–April 2003|publisher=Global Policy Forum|accessdate=23 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Identity and Violence'' Sen questions if people should be divided along the lines of a supposed &quot;civilization&quot;, defined by religion and culture only. He argues that this ignores the many others identities that make up people and leads to a focus on differences.

Cultural Historian [[Morris Berman]] suggests in ''Dark Ages America: the End of Empire'' that in the corporate consumerist United States, the very factors that once propelled it to greatness―extreme individualism, territorial and economic expansion, and the pursuit of material wealth―have pushed the United States across a critical threshold where collapse is inevitable. Politically associated with over-reach, and as a result of the environmental exhaustion and polarization of wealth between rich and poor, he concludes the current system is fast arriving at a situation where continuation of the existing system saddled with huge deficits and a hollowed-out economy is physically, socially, economically and politically impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Morris (2007), ''Dark Ages America: the End of Empire'' (W.W. Norton)&lt;/ref&gt;  Although developed in much more depth, Berman's thesis is similar in some ways to that of Urban Planner, [[Jane Jacobs]] who argues that the five pillars of United States culture are in serious decay: community and family; higher education; the effective practice of science; taxation and government; and the self-regulation of the learned professions. The corrosion of these pillars, Jacobs argues, is linked to societal ills such as environmental crisis, racism and the growing gulf between rich and poor.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Jane (2005), ''Dark Age Ahead'' (Vintage)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cultural critic]] and author [[Derrick Jensen]] argues that modern civilization is directed towards the domination of the environment and humanity itself in an intrinsically harmful, unsustainable, and self-destructive fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Derrick (2006), &quot;Endgame: The Problem of Civilization&quot;, Vol 1 &amp; Vol 2 (Seven Stories Press)&lt;/ref&gt; Defending his definition both linguistically and historically, he defines civilization as &quot;a culture... that both leads to and emerges from the growth of cities&quot;, with &quot;cities&quot; defined as &quot;people living more or less permanently in one place in densities high enough to require the routine importation of food and other necessities of life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Derrick (2006), &quot;Endgame: The Problem of Civilization&quot;, Vol 1 (Seven Stories Press), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; This need for civilizations to import ever more resources, he argues, stems from their over-exploitation and diminution of their own local resources. Therefore, civilizations inherently adopt imperialist and expansionist policies and, to maintain these, highly militarized, hierarchically structured, and coercion-based cultures and lifestyles.

The [[Kardashev scale]] classifies civilizations based on their level of technological advancement, specifically measured by the amount of energy a civilization is able to harness. The scale is only hypothetical, but it puts energy consumption in a cosmic perspective. The Kardashev scale makes provisions for civilizations far more technologically advanced than any currently known to exist.
