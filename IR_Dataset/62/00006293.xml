==Etymology==
Egyptians often refer to Cairo as ''{{transl|arz|Maṣr}}'' ({{IPA-arz|mɑsˤɾ|IPA}}; {{lang-arz|مَصر}}), the [[Egyptian Arabic]] name for Egypt itself, emphasizing the city's importance for the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Behrens-Abouseif|1992|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Golia|2004|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its official name ''{{Transl|ar|ALA|al-Qāhirah }}'' ({{lang-ar|القاهرة}}) means &quot;the Vanquisher&quot; or &quot;the Conqueror&quot;, supposedly due to the fact that the planet [[Mars]], ''an-Najm al-Qāhir'' ({{lang-ar|النجم القاهر}}, &quot;the Conquering Star&quot;), was rising at the time when the city was founded,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sVQBAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78|title=Towards a Shi'i Mediterranean Empire: Fatimid Egypt and the Founding of Cairo|author=|year=2009|publisher=I.B. Tauris|isbn=978-0-85771-742-9|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly also in reference to the much awaited arrival of the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] Caliph [[Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah|Al-Mu'izz]] who reached Cairo in 973 from [[Mahdia]], the old Fatimid capital.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cairo#Foundation and expansion]]&lt;/ref&gt; The location of the ancient city of [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] is the suburb of [[Ain Shams]] ({{lang-ar|عين شمس}}, &quot;Eye of the Sun&quot;).

The are a few Coptic names of the city. (''di'')''Kashromi'' ({{Lang-cop|(ϯ)ⲕⲁϣⲣⲱⲙⲓ}}) is attested as early as [[1211]] and is a calque which means &quot;man breaker&quot; (&quot;ⲕⲁϣ-&quot; – to break, &quot;ⲣⲱⲙⲓ&quot; – man) which is akin to Arabic ''{{Transl|ar|ALA|al-Qāhirah }}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://incubator.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Wp/cop/%E2%B2%95%E2%B2%81%CF%A3%E2%B2%A3%E2%B2%B1%E2%B2%99%E2%B2%93|title=Talk:Wp/cop/ⲕⲁϣⲣⲱⲙⲓ – Wikimedia Incubator|website=incubator.wikimedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lioui'' ({{Lang-cop|ⲗⲓⲟⲩⲓ}}) or ''Elioui'' ({{Lang-cop|ⲉⲗⲓⲟⲩⲓ}}) is another name which is a corruption of Greek name of Heliopolis ({{Lang-el|Ήλιούπολις}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Casanova|first=Paul|date=1901|title=Les noms coptes du Caire et localités voisines|url=|journal=BIFAO|volume=1|pages=20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that ''Mistram'' ({{Lang-cop|ⲙⲓⲥⲧⲣⲁⲙ}}) or ''Nistram'' ({{Lang-cop|ⲛⲓⲥⲧⲣⲁⲙ}}) is another Coptic name for Cairo, although others think that it's rather a name of an Abbasid capital [[Al-Askar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=La Geographie De l'Egypte A l'epoque Copte|last=Amélineau|first=Emile|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=543}}&lt;/ref&gt; ⲕⲁϩⲓⲣⲏ is a popular modern rendering of an Arabic name (others being ⲭⲁⲓⲣⲟⲛ and (ⲁⲗ)ⲭⲁϩⲓⲣⲁ) which has a folk etymology &quot;land of sun&quot;. Some argue that it was a name of an Egyptian settlement upon which Cairo was built, but it's rather doubtful as this name is not attested in any [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Hieroglyphic]] or [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] source, although some researchers like Paul Casanova view it as a legit theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Cairo is also referred to as ⲭⲏⲙⲓ, which means Egypt in Coptic, the same way it's referred to in Egyptian Arabic.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; 

Sometimes the city is informally referred to as ''{{transl|arz|Kayro}}'' by people from Alexandria ({{IPA-arz|ˈkæjɾo|IPA}}; {{lang-arz|كايرو}}).&lt;ref&gt;'''Good News for Me''': [http://www.gn4me.com/gn4me/details.jsp?artId=3885468 بلال فضل يتفرغ لـ&quot;أهل اسكندرية&quot; بعد &quot;أهل كايرو&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305042411/http://www.gn4me.com/gn4me/details.jsp?artId=3885468 |date=5 March 2016 }}&amp;rlm; {{in lang|ar}} (Belal Fadl frees himself [to write] ''Ahl Eskendereyya'' (the People of Alexandria) after ''Ahl Kayro'' (the People of Cairo))&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Initial settlements ===

The area around present-day Cairo, especially [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] that was the old capital of Egypt, had long been a focal point of [[Ancient Egypt]] due to its strategic location just upstream from the [[Nile Delta]]. However, the origins of the modern city are generally traced back to a series of settlements in the first millennium. Around the turn of the 4th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hawass|Brock|2003|p=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Memphis was continuing to decline in importance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2009 |title=Memphis (Egypt) |encyclopedia=Encarta |publisher=Microsoft |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761573551/memphis_(egypt).html |accessdate=24 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006040551/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761573551/memphis_(egypt).html |archivedate=6 October 2009 |url-status=dead |ref=harv |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] established a fortress town along the east bank of the [[Nile]]. This fortress, known as [[Babylon Fortress|Babylon]], was the nucleus of the Roman and then the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] city and is the oldest structure in the city today. It is also situated at the nucleus of the [[Coptic Orthodox]] community, which separated from the Roman and Byzantine churches in the late 4th century. Many of Cairo's oldest Coptic churches, including the [[Hanging Church]], are located along the fortress walls in a section of the city known as [[Coptic Cairo]].

Following the Muslim conquest in 640 AD, the conqueror [[Amr ibn As]] settled to the north of the Babylon in an area that became known as [[al-Fustat]]. Originally a tented camp (''Fustat'' signifies &quot;City of Tents&quot;) Fustat became a permanent settlement and the first capital of Islamic Egypt.

In 750, following the overthrow of the [[Umayyad caliphate]] by the [[Abbasid]]s, the new rulers created their own settlement to the northeast of Fustat which became their capital. This was known as [[al-Askar]] (the city of sections, or [[cantonment]]s) as it was laid out like a military camp.

A rebellion in 869 by [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]] led to the abandonment of Al Askar and the building of another settlement, which became the seat of government. This was [[al-Qatta'i]] (&quot;the Quarters&quot;), to the north of Fustat and closer to the river. Al Qatta'i was centred around a palace and ceremonial mosque, now known as the [[Mosque of ibn Tulun]].

In 905, the Abbasids re-asserted control of the country and their governor returned to Fustat, razing al-Qatta'i to the ground.

===Foundation and expansion===

[[File:Al-Hakim.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Fresco of Fatimid Caliph [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|Al-Hakim]] (985–1021)]]
In 969, the Fatimids [[Fatimid conquest of Egypt|conquered Egypt]] from their base in [[Ifriqiya]] and a new fortified city northeast of [[Fustat]] was established. It took four years to build the city, initially known as al-Manṣūriyyah,&lt;ref name=&quot;glsm96&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Glassé|Smith|2003|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was to serve as the new capital of the caliphate. During that time, the construction of the [[al-Azhar Mosque]] was commissioned by order of the Caliph, which developed into the third-oldest university in the world. Cairo would eventually become a centre of learning, with the library of Cairo containing hundreds of thousands of books.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meri|Bacharach|2006|p=451}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Caliph [[Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah|al-Mu'izz li Din Allah]] arrived from the old Fatimid capital of [[Mahdia]] in [[Tunisia]] in 973, he gave the city its present name, ''al-Qāhiratu'' (&quot;The Victorious&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;glsm96&quot;/&gt;

For nearly 200 years after Cairo was established, the administrative centre of Egypt remained in [[Fustat]]. However, in 1168 the Fatimids under the leadership of [[vizier]] [[Shawar]] set fire to Fustat to prevent Cairo's capture by the [[Crusades|Crusaders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Daly|Petry|1998|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt's capital was permanently moved to Cairo, which was eventually expanded to include the ruins of Fustat and the previous capitals of [[al-Askar]] and [[al-Qatta'i]]. As al Qahira expanded these earlier settlements were encompassed, and have since become part of the city of Cairo as it expanded and spread; they are now collectively known as &quot;[[Old Cairo]]&quot;.

While the Fustat fire successfully protected the city of Cairo, a continuing power struggle between Shawar, [[List of Kings of Jerusalem|King]] [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]], and the [[Zengid]] general [[Shirkuh]] led to the downfall of the Fatimid establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Daly|Petry|1998|pp=213–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1169, [[Saladin]] was appointed as the new vizier of Egypt by the Fatimids and two years later he seized power from the family of the last Fatimid caliph, [[al-'Āḍid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Daly|Petry|1998|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the first [[Sultan of Egypt]], Saladin established the [[Ayyubid dynasty]], based in Cairo, and aligned Egypt with the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]], who were based in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shillington|2005|p=438}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his reign, Saladin constructed the [[Cairo Citadel]], which served as the seat of the Egyptian government until the mid-19th century.

In 1250, slave soldiers, known as the [[Mamluk]]s, seized control of Egypt and like many of their predecessors established Cairo as the capital of [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|their new dynasty]]. Continuing a practice started by the Ayyubids, much of the land occupied by former [[Fatimid Great Palaces|Fatimid palaces]] was sold and replaced by newer buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction projects initiated by the Mamluks pushed the city outward while also bringing new infrastructure to the centre of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|pp=120–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Cairo flourished as a centre of [[Islamic studies|Islamic scholarship]] and a crossroads on the [[spice trade]] route among the civilisations in [[Afro-Eurasia]]. By 1340, Cairo had a population of close to half a million, making it the largest city west of [[Yuan Dynasty|China]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sh199&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shillington|2005|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historic traveller &lt;ref&gt;Ibn Battuta. The Travels of Ibn Battuta, p. 13, 225. Trans. Samuel Lee. Cosimo, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Battuta travelled thousands of miles during the course of his trek. One city he stopped in was Cairo, Egypt. One significant note Ibn Battuta made was that Cairo was the principal district of Egypt, meaning Cairo was Egypt's most important and most influential city (Ibn Battuta, 2009). Ibn Battuta also acknowledges the importance of the Nile river to all of Egypt, including Cairo, as he often ravelled via boat to arrive at Cairo and to leave to continue his journey. The Nile was not just a means for transportation, it was the source of a plethora of other tangibles as well. The Nile's most influential attribute was its ability to sustain rich soil for agriculture. Part of the Agricultural Revolution thrived in Egypt, predominantly off the back of the Nile. The Nile also served as a source of food and a pathway for trade. Without it, the Egypt we know today wouldn't have been the same. One of Ibn Battuta's most detailed accounts in Cairo involves a plague that was devastating the city. Today, this plague is known as the [[Bubonic Plague]], or the Black Death. It is believed to have arrived in Egypt in 1347, and as Ibn Battuta recalls, the Bubonic plague was responsible for the deaths of between 1 and 20,000 people a day in Cairo &lt;ref&gt;The Travels of Ibn Battuta. UC Berkeley: Berkeley ORIAS, 2018. Electronic.&lt;/ref&gt;(Berkeley ORIAS, 2018) (Ibn Battuta, 2009). The plague originated in Asia and spread via fleas on rodents, such as rats (Berkeley ORIAS, 2018). The plague would end up spreading to all of Eurasia and wiped out any civilizations that were in its path. It is estimated that somewhere between 75 and 200 million people total died from the plague.

Although Cairo avoided [[Europe]]'s stagnation during the [[Late Middle Ages]], it could not escape the [[Black Death]], which struck the city more than fifty times between 1348 and 1517.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shoshan|2002|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its initial, and most deadly waves, approximately 200,000 people were killed by the plague,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Byrne|2004|pp=104–05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, by the 15th century, Cairo's population had been reduced to between 150,000 and 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shoshan|2002|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's status was further diminished after [[Vasco da Gama]] discovered a sea route around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] between 1497 and 1499, thereby allowing spice traders to avoid Cairo.&lt;ref name=&quot;sh199&quot;/&gt;
Cairo's political influence diminished significantly after the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] supplanted [[Mamluk]] power over [[Egypt]] in 1517. Ruling from [[Constantinople]], [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]] [[Selim I]] relegated Egypt to a [[Eyalet|province]], with Cairo as its capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;sh447&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shillington|2005|p=447}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the history of Cairo during Ottoman times is often described as inconsequential, especially in comparison to other time periods.&lt;ref name=&quot;sh199&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://menic.utexas.edu/cairo/history/ottoman/ottoman.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606231911/http://menic.utexas.edu/cairo/history/ottoman/ottoman.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 June 2007 |publisher=The University of Texas Centre for Middle Eastern Studies |title=Ottoman Cairo |year=1995 |last=Rose |first=Christopher |author2=Linda Boxberger |work=Cairo: Living Past, Living Future |accessdate=30 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wi225&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Winter|1992|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the 16th and 17th centuries, Cairo remained an important economic and cultural centre. Although no longer on the spice route, the city facilitated the transportation of [[Yemen]]i [[coffee]] and [[India]]n [[textile]]s, primarily to [[Anatolia]], [[North Africa]], and the [[Balkans]]. Cairene merchants were instrumental in bringing goods to the barren [[Hejaz]], especially during the annual [[hajj]] to [[Mecca]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wi225&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|İnalcık|Faroqhi|Quataert|McGowan|1997|pp=507–09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this same period that al-Azhar University reached the predominance among Islamic schools that it continues to hold today;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winter|2004|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Daly|Petry|1998|pp=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; pilgrims on their way to hajj often attested to the superiority of the institution, which had become associated with Egypt's body of [[Ulema|Islamic scholars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winter|2004|pp=115–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 16th century, Cairo also had [[Tower block|high-rise]] [[apartment|apartment buildings]] where the two lower floors were for commercial and storage purposes and the multiple stories above them were [[renting|rented]] out to [[Leasehold estate|tenants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Traditional Islamic principles of built environment|first=Hisham|last=Mortada|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7007-1700-2|page=viii|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Ottomans, Cairo expanded south and west from its nucleus around the [[Cairo Citadel|Citadel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winter|1992|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was the second-largest in the empire, behind Constantinople, and, although migration was not the primary source of Cairo's growth, twenty percent of its population at the end of the 18th century consisted of religious minorities and foreigners from around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wi2267&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Winter|1992|pp=226–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, when [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] arrived in Cairo in 1798, the city's population was less than 300,000, forty percent lower than it was at the height of Mamluk—and Cairene—influence in the mid-14th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;sh199&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wi2267&quot;/&gt;

The [[Campaign of Egypt|French occupation]] was short-lived as [[British Empire|British]] and Ottoman forces, including a sizeable [[Albanians|Albanian]] contingent, recaptured the country in 1801. Cairo itself [[Siege of Cairo|was besieged]] by a British and Ottoman force culminating with the French surrender on 22 June 1801.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sicker|2001|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British vacated Egypt two years later, leaving the Ottomans, the Albanians, and the long-weakened [[Mamluk]]s jostling for control of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sicker|2001|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Afaf Lutfi Sayyid-Marsot|1984|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continued civil war allowed an Albanian named [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]] to ascend to the role of [[commander]] and eventually, with the approval of the [[ulema|religious establishment]], viceroy of Egypt in 1805.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sicker|2001|pp=104–05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until his death in 1848, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]] instituted a number of social and economic reforms that earned him the title of founder of modern Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Afaf Lutfi Sayyid-Marsot|1984|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGregor|2006|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while Muhammad Ali initiated the construction of public buildings in the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shillington|2005|p=437}}&lt;/ref&gt; those reforms had minimal effect on Cairo's landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|pp=291, 302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bigger changes came to Cairo under [[Isma'il Pasha]] (r. 1863–1879), who continued the modernisation processes started by his grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing inspiration from [[Paris]], Isma'il envisioned a city of [[Tahrir Square|maidans]] and wide avenues; due to financial constraints, only some of them, in the area now composing [[Downtown Cairo]], came to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|pp=313–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isma'il also sought to modernize the city, which was merging with neighbouring settlements, by establishing a [[public works]] ministry, bringing [[natural gas|gas]] and lighting to the city, and opening a theatre and opera house.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|pp=311–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abu-Lughod|1965|pp=436–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The immense debt resulting from Isma'il's projects provided a pretext for increasing European control, which culminated with the [[1882 Anglo-Egyptian War|British invasion]] in 1882.&lt;ref name=&quot;sh199&quot;/&gt; The city's economic centre quickly moved west toward the [[Nile]], away from the historic [[Islamic Cairo]] section and toward the contemporary, European-style areas built by Isma'il.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abu-Lughod|1965|pp=429–31, 455–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hokhwi317&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hourani|Khoury|Wilson|2004|p=317}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europeans accounted for five percent of Cairo's population at the end of the 19th century, by which point they held most top governmental positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abu-Lughod|1965|p=431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British occupation was intended to be temporary, but it lasted well into the 20th century. Nationalists staged [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919|large-scale demonstrations]] in Cairo in 1919,&lt;ref name=&quot;sh199&quot;/&gt; five years after Egypt had been declared a British [[protectorate]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{harvnb|Hourani|Khoury|Wilson|2004|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, while this led to Egypt's [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|independence in 1922]], British troops remained in the country until 1956. During this time, urban Cairo, spurred by new bridges and transport links, continued to expand to include the upscale neighbourhoods of [[Garden City (Cairo)|Garden City]], [[Zamalek]], and [[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|Heliopolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|pp=326–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1882 and 1937, the population of Cairo more than tripled—from 347,000 to 1.3 million&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|p=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and its area increased from {{convert|10|to|163|km2|sqmi|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|p=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was devastated during the 1952 riots known as the [[Cairo Fire]] or Black Saturday, which saw the destruction of nearly 700 shops, movie theatres, casinos and hotels in Downtown Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ahram.org.eg/433/2011/02/04/457/55/Malafat.aspx |script-title=ar:خسائر الحريق |date=12 May 2010 |journal=[[Al-Ahram]] |trans-title=The Fire Damage |language=Arabic |accessdate=4 February 2011 |ref=harv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512021201/http://www.ahram.org.eg/433/2011/02/04/457/55/Malafat.aspx |archivedate=12 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British departed Cairo following the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]], but the city's rapid growth showed no signs of abating. Seeking to accommodate the increasing population, [[President of Egypt|President]] [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] redeveloped [[Tahrir Square|Maidan Tahrir]] and the Nile [[Corniche]], and improved the city's network of bridges and highways.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|p=349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, additional controls of the Nile fostered development within [[Gezira Island]] and along the city's waterfront. The metropolis began to encroach on the fertile [[Nile Delta]], prompting the government to build desert [[satellite town]]s and devise incentives for city-dwellers to move to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|pp=343–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cairo's population has doubled since the 1960s, reaching close to seven million (with an additional ten million in its [[urban area]]). Concurrently, Cairo has established itself as a political and economic hub for [[North Africa]] and the [[Arab world]], with many multinational businesses and organisations, including the [[Arab League]], operating out of the city.

In 1992, Cairo was hit by an [[1992 Cairo earthquake|earthquake]] causing 545 deaths, 6,512 injuries and 50,000 people homeless.&lt;ref name=&quot;NGDC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/results?eq_0=5339&amp;t=101650&amp;s=13&amp;d=22,26,13,12&amp;nd=display|title=NGDC page on the Cairo earthquake|accessdate=9 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901120521/http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/results?eq_0=5339&amp;t=101650&amp;s=13&amp;d=22,26,13,12&amp;nd=display|archive-date=1 September 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Cairo serves as the national capital of Egypt, so it is fair to say it still holds major importance. Many things have changed since Ibn Battuta trekked through the city during his travels. Today, Cairo has taken a major step forward in urbanization as most Cairenes now live in apartment buildings. Because of the influx of people in the city, lone standing houses are rare to find, and apartment buildings accommodate for the limited space and abundance of people. In fact, lone standing houses are symbolic of the wealthy. Formal education has also become very important to those in the city of Cairo. Just as in the United States, there are twelve years of formal education. Cairenes also take an apprehension test similar to the SAT to help them further their education and become accepted to a higher institution. However, most children do not finish school and opt to pick up a trade to enter the work force.&lt;ref&gt;Life in Modern Cairo. The University of Texas at Austin-College of Liberal Arts, Electronic.&lt;/ref&gt; The civil rights movement for women in Cairo has been a long and troubling battle for many years now. Women face constant discrimination, harassment, and abuse throughout Cairo. The situation is so bad in Cairo that it has even been named the most dangerous megacity for women in the world &lt;ref&gt;Cairo 'Most Dangerous' Megacity for Women – Survey. BBC News, 2017. Electronic.&lt;/ref&gt;(BBC News, 2017).  Cairo has also been influenced by modern western civilization. As one travels through modern Cairo, it is not unusual to come across McDonald's, Arby's, Pizza Hut, Subway, and Kentucky Fried Chicken. There are even large scale western restaurants in Cairo, such as Chili's and T.G.I. Friday's. Of course, the majority of restaurants serve Egyptian and [[Arab cuisine|Arab dishes]], but the fact remains that certain aspects of western civilization have crossed the Atlantic and reached the city of Cairo. Sadly, Egypt is one of the poorer countries in the Middle East, with almost half the population living on $2 or less a day &lt;ref&gt;Mitchell Hartman. On Rich and Poor in Egypt. Marketplace, 2011. Electronic.&lt;/ref&gt;(Hartman, 2011). However, from the income the country does make, most of it does come from Cairo, as the majority of the countries manufacturing headquarters are located there. Today's Cairo has clearly evolved since Ibn Battuta made his way through the ancient city. Cairo has made advances in some aspects of daily life, and taken steps backwards in others. However, with that being said, Cairo is still one of the most influential cities in all of the Arab world.

The uprising was mainly a campaign of non-violent civil resistance, which featured a series of demonstrations, marches, acts of civil disobedience, and labour strikes. Millions of protesters from a variety of socio-economic and religious backgrounds demanded the overthrow of the regime of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Despite being predominantly peaceful in nature, the revolution was not without violent clashes between security forces and protesters, with at least 846 people killed and 6,000 injured.

Although the Cairo metropolis extends away from the Nile in all directions, the city of Cairo resides only on the east bank of the river and two islands within it on a total area of {{convert|453|km2|sqmi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cairo.gov.eg/C17/C8/Cairo%20Maps/default.aspx |publisher=Cairo Governorate |accessdate=10 September 2009 |title=Cairo Maps |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419130737/http://www.cairo.gov.eg/C17/C8/Cairo%20Maps/default.aspx |archivedate=19 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;citypop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Egypt.html |publisher=City Population |last=Brinkhoff |first=Thomas |accessdate=12 September 2009 |title=Egypt: Governorates &amp; Cities |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902164545/http://www.citypopulation.de/Egypt.html |archive-date=2 September 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the mid-19th century, when the river was tamed by dams, levees, and other controls, the Nile in the vicinity of Cairo was highly susceptible to changes in course and surface level. Over the years, the Nile gradually shifted westward, providing the site between the eastern edge of the river and the [[Mokattam]] highlands on which the city now stands. The land on which Cairo was established in 969 (present-day [[Islamic Cairo]]) was located underwater just over three hundred years earlier, when [[Fustat]] was first built.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|2002|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low periods of the Nile during the 11th century continued to add to the landscape of Cairo; a new island, known as ''Geziret al-Fil'', first appeared in 1174, but eventually became connected to the mainland. Today, the site of ''Geziret al-Fil'' is occupied by the [[Shubra]] district. The low periods created another island at the turn of the 14th century that now composes [[Zamalek]] and [[Gezira Island|Gezira]]. [[Land reclamation]] efforts by the [[Mamluk]]s and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] further contributed to expansion on the east bank of the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|2002|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the Nile's movement, the newer parts of the city—[[Garden City (Cairo)|Garden City]], [[Downtown Cairo]], and Zamalek—are located closest to the riverbank.&lt;ref name=&quot;riverbank&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The areas, which are home to most of Cairo's [[diplomatic mission|embassies]], are surrounded on the north, east, and south by the older parts of the city. [[Old Cairo]], located south of the centre, holds the remnants of [[Fustat]] and the heart of Egypt's [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christian]] community, [[Coptic Cairo]]. The [[Boulaq]] district, which lies in the northern part of the city, was born out of a major 16th-century port and is now a major industrial centre. The [[Cairo Citadel|Citadel]] is located east of the city centre around [[Islamic Cairo]], which dates back to the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] era and the foundation of Cairo. While western Cairo is dominated by wide boulevards, open spaces, and [[modern architecture]] of European influence, the eastern half, having grown haphazardly over the centuries, is dominated by small lanes, crowded tenements, and [[Islamic architecture]].

Northern and extreme eastern parts of Cairo, which include [[satellite town]]s, are among the most recent additions to the city, as they developed in the late-20th and early-21st centuries to accommodate the city's rapid growth. The western bank of the Nile is commonly included within the urban area of Cairo, but it composes the city of [[Giza]] and the [[Giza Governorate]]. Giza has also undergone significant expansion over recent years, and today the city, although still a suburb of Cairo, has a population of 2.7 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;citypop&quot;/&gt; The Cairo Governorate was just north of the [[Helwan Governorate]] from 2008 when some Cairo's southern districts, including [[Maadi]] and [[New Cairo]], were split off and annexed into the new governorate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/894/eg6.htm |publisher=al-Ahram Weekly |last=Leila |first=Reem |number=894 |date=24–30 April 2008 |accessdate=12 September 2009 |title=Redrawing the Map |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810065313/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/894/eg6.htm |archivedate=10 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to 2011 when the Helwan Governorate was reincorporated into the Cairo Governorate.

According to the [[World Health Organization]], the level of air pollution in Cairo is nearly 12 times higher than the recommended safety level&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://afrique.le360.ma/autres-pays/societe/2018/09/04/22762-egypte-pollution-forbes-fache-les-autorites-du-caire-22762 |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529043115/http://afrique.le360.ma/autres-pays/societe/2018/09/04/22762-egypte-pollution-forbes-fache-les-autorites-du-caire-22762 |archive-date=29 May 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
In Cairo, and along the Nile River Valley, the climate is a [[hot desert climate]] (''BWh'' according to the [[Köppen climate classification]] system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/pics/kottek_et_al_2006.gif |title=World Map of Köppen-Geiger Climate Classification |publisher=Köppen-Geiger |accessdate=22 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017125921/http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/pics/kottek_et_al_2006.gif |archive-date=17 October 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Wind storms can be frequent, bringing [[Mineral dust|Saharan dust]] into the city, from March to May and the air often becomes uncomfortably dry. High temperatures in winter range from {{convert|14|to|22|°C|0|abbr=on}}, while night-time lows drop to below {{convert|11|°C|0|abbr=on}}, often to {{convert|5|°C|0|abbr=on}}. In summer, the highs rarely surpass {{convert|40|°C|0|abbr=on}}, and lows drop to about {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Rainfall is sparse and only happens in the colder months, but sudden showers can cause severe flooding. The summer months have high humidity due to its coastal location. Snowfall is extremely rare; a small amount of [[graupel]], widely believed to be [[snow]], fell on Cairo's easternmost suburbs on 13 December 2013, the first time Cairo's area received this kind of precipitation in many decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Biblical snowstorm: Rare flakes in Cairo, Jerusalem paralyzed by over a foot |first= Jason |last= Samenow |work= The Washington Post |date= 13 December 2013 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/wp/2013/12/13/rare-snow-in-cairo-jerusalem-paralyzed-in-historic-snow/ |access-date= 22 August 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150903233952/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/wp/2013/12/13/rare-snow-in-cairo-jerusalem-paralyzed-in-historic-snow/ |archive-date= 3 September 2015 |url-status= live |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dew points in the hottest months range from {{convert|13.9|°C|0|abbr=on}} in June to {{convert|18.3|°C|0|abbr=on}} in August.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

Cairo has an extensive road network, [[rail system]], [[Rapid transit|subway system]] and maritime services. Road transport is facilitated by personal vehicles, taxi cabs, privately owned public buses and [[Microbus#Van conversions|Cairo microbuses]]. Cairo, specifically Ramses Square, is the centre of almost the entire Egyptian [[transport network|transportation network]].&lt;ref name=TravelCairo&gt;{{Cite book|title=Travel Cairo|year=2007|publisher=MobileReference|isbn=978-1-60501-055-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=50O9dQlwreYC&amp;pg=PT44|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cairo Metro|The subway system]], officially called &quot;Metro (مترو)&quot;, is a fast and efficient way of getting around Cairo. Metro network covers [[Helwan]] and other suburbs. It can get very crowded during [[rush hour]]. Two train cars (the fourth and fifth ones) are reserved for women only, although women may ride in any car they want.

[[Trams in Greater Cairo]] and Cairo trolleybus are former modes of transportation but were closed.

An extensive road network connects Cairo with other Egyptian cities and villages. There is a new [[Ring road|Ring Road]] that surrounds the outskirts of the city, with exits that reach outer Cairo districts. There are flyovers and bridges, such as the Sixth of October bridge that, when the traffic is not heavy, allow fast&lt;ref name=TravelCairo/&gt; [[Mode of transport|means of transportation]] from one side of the city to the other.

Cairo traffic is known to be overwhelming and overcrowded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/779/feature.htm |title=Al-Ahram Weekly &amp;#124; Features &amp;#124; Reaching an impasse |publisher=Weekly.ahram.org.eg |date=1 February 2006 |accessdate=5 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420135315/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/779/feature.htm |archivedate=20 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traffic moves at a relatively fluid pace. Drivers tend to be aggressive, but are more courteous at junctions, taking turns going, with police aiding in [[Road traffic control|traffic control]] of some congested areas.&lt;ref name=TravelCairo/&gt;

In 2017 plans to construct two monorail systems were announced, one linking October City to suburban Giza, a distance of {{cvt|35|km}}, and the other linking Nasr City to New Cairo, a distance of {{cvt|52|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.egyptindependent.com/egypt-build-countrys-first-ever-monorail-cairo/|title=Egypt to build country’s first ever monorail in Cairo|last=Tawfeek|first=Fahrah|date=21 December 2017|website=www.egyptindependent.com|access-date=29 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529001422/https://www.egyptindependent.com/egypt-build-countrys-first-ever-monorail-cairo/|archive-date=29 May 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-derbyshire-48435983|title=Cairo monorail trains to be built in UK|date=28 May 2019|work=BBC News|access-date=29 May 2019|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529002924/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-derbyshire-48435983|archive-date=29 May 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
[[File:Cairo International Stadium.jpg|thumb|[[Cairo International Stadium]] with 75,100 seats]]

[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Egypt, and Cairo has a number of sporting teams that compete in national and regional leagues. The best known teams are [[Al Ahly SC|Al Ahly]], [[Zamalek SC|El Zamalek]] and [[Al-Ismaily]]. [[Al Ahly SC|Al Ahly]] and [[Zamalek SC|El Zamalek]] annual [[Cairo derby|football tournament]] is perhaps the most watched sports event in Egypt as well as the African-Arab region. Both teams are known as the &quot;rivals&quot; of Egyptian football, and are the first and the second champions in Africa and the [[Arab world]]. They play their home games at [[Cairo International Stadium]] or Naser Stadium, which is Egypt's 2nd largest stadium, Cairo's largest one and one of the largest stadiums in the world.

The Cairo International Stadium was built in 1960 and its multi-purpose sports complex that houses the main football stadium, an indoor stadium, several satellite fields that held several regional, continental and global games, including the [[All-Africa Games|African Games]], U17 Football World Championship and was one of the stadiums scheduled that hosted the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations]] which was played in January 2006. Egypt later won the competition and went on to win the next edition In Ghana (2008) making the Egyptian and Ghanaian national teams the only teams to win the African Nations Cup Back to back which resulted in Egypt winning the title for a record number of six times in the history of African Continental Competition. This was followed by a third consecutive win in Angola 2010, making Egypt the only country with a record 3-consecutive and 7-total Continental Football Competition winner. This achievement had also placed the Egyptian football team as the #9 best team in the world's FIFA rankings.

Cairo failed at the applicant stage when bidding for the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], which was hosted in Beijing, China. However, Cairo did host the [[2007 Pan Arab Games]].

There are several other sports teams in the city that participate in several sports including el Gezira [[Sports club|Sporting Club]], el Shams Club, el Seid Club, Heliopolis Club and several smaller clubs, but the biggest clubs in Egypt (not in area but in sports) are [[Al Ahly SC|Al Ahly]] and [[Zamalek|Al Zamalek]]. They have the two biggest football teams in Egypt. There are new sports clubs in the area of New Cairo (one hour far from Cairo's down town), these are Al Zohour sporting club, Wadi Degla sporting club and Platinum Club.

Most of the sports federations of the country are also located in the city suburbs, including the [[Egyptian Football Association]]. The headquarters of the [[Confederation of African Football]] (CAF) was previously located in Cairo, before relocating to its new headquarters in [[6th of October City|6 October City]], a small city away from Cairo's crowded districts.

In October 2008, the Egyptian Rugby Federation was officially formed and granted membership into the [[International Rugby Board]].

Egypt is internationally known for the excellence of its squash players who excel in both professional and junior divisions. Egypt currently has seven players in the top ten of the PSA men's world rankings, and three in the women's top ten. Mohamed El Shorbagy held the world number one position for more than a year before being overtaken by compatriot Karim Abdel Gawad, who is currently number two behind Gregory Gaultier of France. Ramy Ashour and Amr Shabana are regarded as two of the most talented squash players in history. Shabana won the World Open title four times and Ashour twice, although his recent form has been hampered by injury. Egypt's Nour El Sherbini has won the Women's World Championship twice and has been women's world number one for 16 consecutive months. On 30 April 2016, she became the youngest woman to win the Women's World Championship which was held in Malaysia. On April 2017 she retained her title by winning the Women's World Championship which was held in the Egyptian resort of El Gouna.

{{Main|Cairo International Film Festival}}

Cairo held its first international [[film festival]] 16 August 1976, when the first [[Cairo International Film Festival]] was launched by the Egyptian Association of Film Writers and Critics, headed by Kamal El-Mallakh. The Association ran the festival for seven years until 1983.

This achievement lead to the President of the Festival again contacting the [[FIAPF]] with the request that a competition should be included at the 1991 Festival. The request was granted.

In 1998, the Festival took place under the presidency of one of Egypt's leading actors, [[Hussein Fahmy]], who was appointed by the [[Ministry of Culture (Egypt)|Minister of Culture]], [[Farouk Hosny|Farouk Hosni]], after the death of Saad El-Din Wahba. Four years later, the journalist and writer Cherif El-Shoubashy became president.

===Cairo Geniza===
{{Main|Cairo Geniza}}
[[File:Solomon Schechter.jpg|thumb|upright|Solomon Schechter studying documents from the Cairo Geniza, c. 1895]]
The [[Cairo Geniza]] is an accumulation of almost 200,000 Jewish manuscripts that were found in the genizah of the [[Abraham ibn Ezra|Ben Ezra]] synagogue (built 882) of Fustat, Egypt (now Old Cairo), the Basatin cemetery east of Old Cairo, and a number of old documents that were bought in Cairo in the later 19th century. These documents were written from about 870 to 1880 AD and have been archived in various American and European libraries. The Taylor-Schechter collection in the [[University of Cambridge]] runs to 140,000 manuscripts, a further 40,000 manuscripts are at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]].

== Places of worship ==
Among the [[places of worship]], they are predominantly [[Islam|Muslim]] mosques.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica,

Cairo accounts for 11% of Egypt's population and 22% of its economy (PPP). The majority of the nation's commerce is generated there, or passes through the city. The great majority of [[publishing|publishing houses]] and media outlets and nearly all [[Movie studio|film studios]] are there, as are half of the nation's hospital beds and universities. This has fuelled rapid construction in the city—one building in five is less than 15 years old.

This growth until recently surged well ahead of [[Municipal services|city services]]. Homes, roads, electricity, telephone and sewer services were all in short supply. Analysts trying to grasp the magnitude of the change coined terms like &quot;hyper-urbanization&quot;.

===Tahrir Square===
{{Main|Tahrir Square}}
[[Tahrir Square]] was founded during the mid 19th century with the establishment of modern downtown Cairo. It was first named Ismailia Square, after the 19th-century ruler [[Khedive Ismail]], who commissioned the new downtown district's 'Paris on the Nile' design. After the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919]] the square became widely known as Tahrir (Liberation) Square, though it was not officially renamed as such until after the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|1952 Revolution]] which eliminated the monarchy. Several notable buildings surround the square including, the [[American University in Cairo]]'s downtown campus, the [[Mogamma]] governmental administrative Building, the headquarters of the [[Arab League]], the Nile Ritz Carlton Hotel, and the [[Egyptian Museum]]. Being at the heart of Cairo, the square witnessed several major protests over the years. However, the most notable event in the square was being the focal point of the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution]] against former president [[Hosni Mubarak]].

===Egyptian Museum===
{{Main|Egyptian Museum}}
The [[Egyptian Museum|Museum of Egyptian Antiquities]], known commonly as the Egyptian Museum, is home to the most extensive collection of [[ancient Egypt]]ian antiquities in the world. It has 136,000 items on display, with many more hundreds of thousands in its basement storerooms. Among its most famous collections on display are the finds from the [[KV62|tomb of Tutankhamun]].

===Cairo Tower===
{{Main|Cairo Tower}}
The Cairo Tower is a free-standing tower with a revolving restaurant at the top. It provides a bird's eye view of Cairo to the restaurant patrons. It stands in the Zamalek district on Gezira Island in the Nile River, in the city centre. At {{convert|187|m|ft|abbr=off}}, it is {{convert|44|m|ft|abbr=off}} higher than the Great Pyramid of Giza, which stands some {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=off}} to the southwest.

===Old Cairo===
{{Main|Old Cairo}}
[[File:El-Moez Street-Old Cairo-Egypt.jpg|thumb|[[Muizz Street]] in Old Cairo]]
This area of Cairo is so-named as it contains the remains of the ancient Roman [[Babylon Fortress|fortress of Babylon]] and also overlaps the original site of [[Fustat]], the first Arab settlement in Egypt (7th century AD) and the predecessor of later Cairo. The area includes the [[Coptic Cairo]], which holds a high concentration of old Christian churches such as the [[Hanging Church]], the [[Church of St. George (Cairo)|Greek Orthodox Church of St. George]], and other Christian or Coptic buildings, most of which are located over the site of the ancient Roman fortress. It is also the location of the [[Coptic Museum]], which showcases the history of [[Coptic art]] from [[Egypt history#Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt|Greco-Roman]] to [[History of Muslim Egypt|Islamic]] times, and of the [[Ben Ezra Synagogue]], the oldest and best-known [[synagogue]] in Cairo, where the important collection of [[Cairo Geniza|Geniza documents]] were discovered in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2008|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the north of this Coptic enclave is the [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As|Amr ibn al-'As Mosque]], the first mosque in Egypt and the most important religious centre of what was formerly [[Fustat]], founded in 642 AD right after the [[Arab conquest of Egypt|Arab conquest]] but rebuilt many times since.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2008|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic Cairo===

[[File:GD-EG-Caire-Suhaymi008.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bayt Al-Suhaymi]]]]
Cairo holds one of the greatest concentrations of historical monuments of [[Islamic architecture]] in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2008| }}&lt;/ref&gt; The areas around the old [[Fatimid architecture#Cairo fortifications|walled]] city and around the [[Citadel of Cairo|Citadel]] are characterized by hundreds of [[mosques]], tombs, [[madrasas]], mansions, [[caravanserais]], and fortifications dating from the Islamic era and are often referred to as &quot;[[Islamic Cairo]]&quot;, especially in English travel literature.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{harvnb|O'Neill_et_al|2012| }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the location of several important religious shrines such as the [[al-Hussein Mosque]] (whose shrine is believed to hold the head of [[Husayn ibn Ali]]), the Mausoleum of Imam [[al-Shafi'i]] (founder of the [[Shafi'i]] [[madhhab]], one of the primary schools of thought in [[Sunni]] Islamic [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]]), the [[Mashhad of Sayyida Ruqayya|Tomb of Sayyida Ruqayya]], the [[Al-Sayeda Nafeesah Mosque|Mosque of Sayyida Nafisa]], and others.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

The first mosque in Egypt was the [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As]] in what was formerly [[Fustat]], the first Arab-Muslim settlement in the area. However, the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]] is the oldest mosque that still retains its original form and is a rare example of [[Abbasid]] architecture from the [[Islamic Golden Age|classical period of Islamic civilization]]. It was built in 876–879 AD in a style inspired by the Abbasid capital of [[Samarra]] in [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2008|pp=50–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the largest mosques in Cairo and is often cited as one of the most beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2008|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill_et_al|2012|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another Abbasid construction, the [[Nilometer]] on [[Rhoda Island]], is the oldest original structure in Cairo, built in 862 AD. It was designed to measure the level of the [[Nile]], which was important for agricultural and administrative purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Yeomans, Richard. 2006. ''The Art and Architecture of Islamic Cairo''. Garnet Publishing, p 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement that was formally named Cairo (Arabic: ''al-Qahira'') was founded to the northeast of Fustat in 959 AD by the victorious [[Fatimid]] army. The Fatimids built it as a separate palatial city which contained [[Fatimid Great Palaces|their palaces]] and institutions of government. It was enclosed by a circuit of walls, which were rebuilt in stone in the late 11th century AD by the [[vizir]] [[Badr al-Jamali|Badr al-Gamali]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raymond|1993|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; parts of which survive today at [[Bab Zuwayla]] in the south and [[Bab al-Futuh]] and [[Bab al-Nasr (Cairo)|Bab al-Nasr]] in the north.

One of the most important and lasting institutions founded in the Fatimid period was the [[Al-Azhar Mosque|Mosque of al-Azhar]], founded in 970 AD, which competes with the [[Qarawiyyin]] in [[Fes]] for the title of oldest university in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams, Caroline p. 169&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2008|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[al-Azhar University]] is the foremost Center of Islamic learning in the world and one of Egypt's largest universities with campuses across the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams, Caroline p. 169&quot;/&gt; The mosque itself retains significant Fatimid elements but has been added to and expanded in subsequent centuries, notably by the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] sultans [[Qaitbay]] and [[Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri|al-Ghuri]] and by Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda in the 18th century.

Other extant monuments from the Fatimid era include the large [[Al-Hakim Mosque|Mosque of al-Hakim]], the [[Al-aqmar mosque|al-Aqmar mosque]], [[Juyushi Mosque]], [[Lulua Mosque]], and the [[Salih Talai Mosque|Mosque of Salih Tala'i]].

The most prominent architectural heritage of medieval Cairo, however, dates from the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk period]], from 1250 to 1517 AD. The Mamluk sultans and elites were eager patrons of religious and scholarly life, commonly building religious or funerary complexes whose functions could include a mosque, [[madrasa]], [[khanqah]] (for [[Sufis]]), a [[Sebil (fountain)|sabil]] (water dispensary), and a mausoleum for themselves and their families.&lt;ref&gt;Behrens-Abouseif, Doris. 2007. ''Cairo of the Mamluks: A History of Architecture and its Culture''. Cairo: The American University in Cairo Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
Among the best-known examples of Mamluk monuments in Cairo are the huge [[Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan|Mosque-Madrasa of Sultan Hasan]], the [[Mosque of Amir al-Maridani]], the [[Mosque of Sultan al-Muayyad|Mosque of Sultan al-Mu'ayyad]] (whose twin minarets were built above the gate of [[Bab Zuwayla]]), the [[Sultan Al-Ghuri Complex|Sultan Al-Ghuri complex]], the [[Complex of Sultan al-Ashraf Qaytbay|funerary complex of Sultan Qaytbay]] in the [[City of the Dead (Cairo)|Northern Cemetery]], and the trio of monuments in the [[Bayn al-Qasrayn]] area comprising the [[Qalawun complex|complex of Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun]], the [[Madrassa of Al-Nasir Muhammad|Madrasa of al-Nasir Muhammad]], and the [[Madrasa of Sultan Barquq]]. Some mosques include [[spolia]] (often columns or [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]]) from earlier buildings built by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], or [[Copts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;

The Mamluks, and the later [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], also built ''wikala''s or [[caravanserais]] to house merchants and goods due to the important role of trade and commerce in Cairo's economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raymond, André 1993. pp. 90-97&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Raymond|1993|pp=90–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous example still intact today is the [[Wikala of Al-Ghuri|Wikala al-Ghuri]], which nowadays also hosts regular performances by the Al-[[Tannoura]] Egyptian Heritage Dance Troupe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill_et_al|2012|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; The famous [[Khan el-Khalili|Khan al-Khalili]] is a commercial hub which also integrated caravanserais (also known as ''khan''s).

===Citadel of Cairo===
[[File:Flickr - HuTect ShOts - Citadel of Salah El.Din and Masjid Muhammad Ali قلعة صلاح الدين الأيوبي ومسجد محمد علي - Cairo - Egypt - 17 04 2010 (4).jpg|thumb|The [[Citadel of Cairo]], with the [[Mosque of Muhammad Ali]]]]
[[File:Kairo Zitadelle Muhammad-Ali-Moschee 02.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mosque of Muhammad Ali]]]]
{{Main|Cairo Citadel}}

The Citadel is a fortified enclosure begun by [[Saladin|Salah al-Din]] in 1176 AD on an outcrop of the [[Muqatam|Muqattam Hills]] as part of a large defensive system to protect both Cairo to the north and [[Fustat]] to the southwest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raymond, André 1993. pp. 90-97&quot;/&gt; It was the centre of Egyptian government and residence of its rulers until 1874, when [[Isma'il Pasha|Khedive Isma'il]] moved to [[Abdeen Palace|'Abdin Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2008|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still occupied by the military today, but is now open as a tourist attraction comprising, notably, the [[Egyptian National Military Museum|National Military Museum]], the 14th century [[Al-Nasir Muhammad Mosque|Mosque of al-Nasir Muhammad]], and the 19th century [[Mosque of Muhammad Ali]] which commands a dominant position on Cairo's skyline.

===Khan el-Khalili===
{{Main|Khan el-Khalili}}
[[Khan el-Khalili]] is an ancient [[bazaar]], or marketplace adjacent to the [[Al-Hussein Mosque]]. It dates back to 1385, when Amir Jarkas el-Khalili built a large caravanserai, or khan. (A caravanserai is a hotel for traders, and usually the focal point for any surrounding area.) This original carvanserai building was demolished by [[qansuh al-Ghuri|Sultan al-Ghuri]], who rebuilt it as a new commercial complex in the early 16th century, forming the basis for the network of [[souqs]] existing today.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raymond|1993|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many medieval elements remain today, including the ornate [[Mamluk]]-style gateways.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2008|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the Khan el-Khalili is a major tourist attraction and popular stop for tour groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill_et_al|2012|pp=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pollution==
Cairo is an expanding city, which has led to many environmental problems. The [[air pollution]] in Cairo is a matter of serious concern. Greater Cairo's volatile [[aromatic hydrocarbon]] levels are higher than many other similar cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Khoder |first=M.I. |title=Ambient levels of volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere of Greater Cairo |journal=Atmospheric Environment |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=554–66 |date=January 2007 |doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2006.08.051 |issn=1352-2310 |ref=harv |bibcode=2007AtmEn..41..554K }}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 January 2007 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Air quality measurements in Cairo have also been recording dangerous levels of [[lead]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[sulfur dioxide|sulphur dioxide]], and [[suspended solids|suspended particulate matter]] concentrations due to decades of unregulated [[vehicle emissions control|vehicle emissions]], urban industrial operations, and chaff and trash burning. There are over 4,500,000 cars on the streets of Cairo, 60% of which are over 10 years old, and therefore lack modern emission cutting features. Cairo has a very poor dispersion factor because of its lack of rain and its layout of tall buildings and narrow streets, which create a bowl effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.theecoexperts.co.uk/most-polluted-cities |title=The Most Polluted Cities in the World |publisher=The Eco Experts |first=Fran |last=Whittaker-Wood |date=25 July 2018 |accessdate=2 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701230800/https://blog.theecoexperts.co.uk/most-polluted-cities |archive-date=1 July 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:0021 Cairo in smog, 2010.JPG|thumb|left|Smog in Cairo]]
In recent years, a mysterious [[Smog|black cloud]] (as Egyptians refer to it) [[Inversion (meteorology)|appeared over Cairo every autumn]] and causes serious respiratory diseases and eye irritations for the city's citizens. Tourists who are not familiar with such high levels of pollution must take extra care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Black cloud reappears over Cairo|journal=Middle East Online|first=|last=|volume=41|issue=3|page=554|id=|url=|accessdate=|ref=harv|doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2006.08.051|author=Khoder, M|year=2007|bibcode=2007AtmEn..41..554K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cairo also has many unregistered lead and [[copper]] [[smelter]]s which heavily pollute the city. The results of this has been a permanent haze over the city with particulate matter in the air reaching over three times normal levels. It is estimated that 10,000 to 25,000 people a year in Cairo die due to air pollution-related diseases. Lead has been shown to cause harm to the [[central nervous system]] and neurotoxicity particularly in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Lead neurotoxicity in children: basic mechanisms and clinical correlates|journal=Brain|volume=126|issue=1|pages=5–19|date=January 2003|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/126/1/5|accessdate=19 April 2008|doi=10.1093/brain/awg014|author=Lidsky, T.

Twenty thousand buses have also been commissioned to the city to improve congestion levels, which are very high.{{fact|date=January 2020}}
[[File:Street in Cairo - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|Traffic in Cairo]]
The city also suffers from a high level of [[pollution|land pollution]]. Cairo produces 10,000 tons of waste material each day, 4,000 tons of which is not [[Waste collection|collected]] or [[Waste management|managed]]. This once again is a huge [[health|health hazard]] and the Egyptian Government is looking for ways to combat this. The Cairo Cleaning and Beautification Agency was founded to collect and recycle the waste; however, they also work with the [[Zabbaleen]] (or Zabaleen), a community that has been collecting and recycling Cairo's waste since the turn of the 20th century and live in an area known locally as [[Manshiyat naser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/06/03/MNGKOJ82991.DTL |title=From Cairo's trash, a model of recycling / Old door-to-door method boasts 85% reuse rate |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=3 June 2006 |accessdate=5 May 2009 |first=Jack |last=Epstein |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010222736/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2006%2F06%2F03%2FMNGKOJ82991.DTL |archive-date=10 October 2008 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are working together to pick up as much waste as possible within the city limits, though it remains a pressing problem.{{fact|date=January 2020}}

[[Water pollution]] is also a serious problem in the city as the [[Sanitary sewer|sewer system]] tends to fail and overflow. On occasion, [[sewage]] has escaped onto the streets to create a health hazard. This problem is hoped to be solved by a new sewer system funded by the [[European Union]], which could cope with the demand of the city. The dangerously high levels of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] in the city's water system has [[global health]] officials concerned over related health risks.
