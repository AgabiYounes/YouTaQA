In [[architecture]], a '''cupola''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|juː|p|əl|ə}} is a relatively small, most often [[dome]]-like, tall structure on top of a building.&lt;ref name=&quot;ARCHSEE&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.archiseek.com/guides/glossary/c.html |title=Glossary of Architectural Terms - C |accessdate=3 January 2009 |publisher=Archiseek: Online Architecture Resources |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227054353/http://www.archiseek.com/guides/glossary/c.html |archivedate=27 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often used to provide a lookout or to admit light and air, it usually crowns a larger [[roof]] or dome.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHD&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=cupola |title=cupola|accessdate=26 April 2015|work=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fifth Edition |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WHATCUP&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cupola.com/whatscu1.htm |title=Just what is a cupola anyway? |accessdate=3 January 2009 |publisher=Cupola Consulting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivation==
The word derives, via [[Italian language|Italian]], from the lower Latin ''cupula'' (classical Latin ''cupella'' from the Greek κύπελλον ''kupellon'') &quot;small cup&quot; (Latin ''cupa'') indicating a vault resembling an upside down cup.{{efn|In Italian ''cupola'' simply means [[dome]], and the ornamental top element is called ''lanterna''.}}

==History==  
The cupola evolved during the Renaissance from the older [[oculus]].  Being weatherproof, the cupola was better suited to the wetter climates of northern Europe. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The [[chhatri]], seen in [[Architecture of India|Indian architecture]], fits the definition of a cupola when it is used atop a larger structure.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Cupolas often serve as a [[Bell tower|belfry]], [[Belvedere (structure)|belvedere]], or [[roof lantern]] above a main roof. In other cases they may crown a [[spire]], [[tower]], or [[turret]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WHATCUP&quot;/&gt; Barns often have cupolas for ventilation.&lt;ref name=&quot;barncupola&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://madisonbarns.wordpress.com/2014/03/17/what-is-a-cupola-and-why-do-barns-have-them/ |title=What is a cupola and why do barns have them?|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Inc.1980&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Active Interest Media, Inc.|title=Old-House Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WgFVx0D9cXYC&amp;pg=PA177|date=November 1980|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|page=177|ISSN=00940178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cupolas can also appear as small buildings in their own right.
