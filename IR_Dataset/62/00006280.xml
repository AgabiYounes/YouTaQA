[[File:Cuboctahedron.stl|thumb|3D model of a cuboctahedron]]
In [[geometry]], a '''cuboctahedron''' is a [[polyhedron]] with 8 triangular faces and 6 square faces. A cuboctahedron has 12 identical [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]], with 2 triangles and 2 squares meeting at each, and 24 identical [[edge (geometry)|edges]], each separating a triangle from a square. As such, it is a [[quasiregular polyhedron]], i.e. an [[Archimedean solid]] that is not only [[vertex-transitive]] but also [[edge-transitive]]. It is the only [[Cuboctahedron#Symmetries|radially equilateral]] convex polyhedron.

Its [[dual polyhedron]] is the [[rhombic dodecahedron]].

The cuboctahedron was probably known to [[Plato]]: [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron]]'s ''Definitiones'' quotes [[Archimedes]] as saying that Plato knew of a solid made of 8 triangles and 6 squares.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Heath|first=Thomas L.|authorlink=Thomas Little Heath|title=A manual of Greek mathematics|publisher= Clarendon|pages=176|year=1931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other names==
*''Heptaparallelohedron'' ([[Buckminster Fuller]])
**Fuller applied the name &quot;[[Dymaxion]]&quot; to this shape, used in an early version of the [[Dymaxion map]]. He also called it the &quot;Vector Equilibrium&quot; because of its radial equilateral symmetry (its center-to-vertex radius equals its edge length).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sM44p385Ws Vector Equilibrium: R. Buckminster Fuller]&lt;/ref&gt; He called a cuboctahedron consisting of rigid struts connected by flexible vertices a &quot;jitterbug&quot; (this shape can be progressively deformed into an [[icosahedron]], [[octahedron]], and [[tetrahedron]] by collapsing its square sides).
*With O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry, order 48, it is a ''[[Rectification (geometry)|rectified]] [[cube]]'' or ''rectified octahedron'' ([[Norman Johnson (mathematician)|Norman Johnson]])
*With T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry, order 24, it is a ''[[Cantellation (geometry)|cantellated]] [[tetrahedron]]'' or rhombitetratetrahedron.
*With D&lt;sub&gt;3d&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry, order 12, it is a ''triangular [[gyrobicupola]]''.

==Area and volume==
The area ''A'' and the volume ''V'' of the cuboctahedron of edge length ''a'' are:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A &amp;= \left(6+2\sqrt{3}\right)a^2 &amp;&amp;\approx 9.464\,1016a^2 \\
V &amp;= \tfrac{5}{3} \sqrt{2} a^3 &amp;&amp;\approx 2.357\,0226a^3. \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Orthogonal projections==
The ''cuboctahedron'' has four special [[orthogonal projection]]s, centered on a vertex, an edge, and the two types of faces, triangular and square. The last two correspond to the B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[Coxeter plane]]s. The skew projections show a square and hexagon passing through the center of the cuboctahedron.

==Spherical tiling==
The cuboctahedron can also be represented as a [[spherical tiling]], and projected onto the plane via a [[stereographic projection]]. This projection is [[Conformal map|conformal]], preserving angles but not areas or lengths. Straight lines on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane.

==Cartesian coordinates==
The [[Cartesian coordinates]] for the vertices of a cuboctahedron (of edge length {{sqrt|2}}) centered at the origin are:
:(±1,±1,0)
:(±1,0,±1)
:(0,±1,±1)

An alternate set of coordinates can be made in 4-space, as 12 permutations of:
:(0,1,1,2)

This construction exists as one of 16 [[orthant]] [[Facet (geometry)|facets]] of the [[cantellated 16-cell]].

===Root vectors===
The cuboctahedron's 12 vertices can represent the root vectors of the [[simple Lie group]] A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. With the addition of 6 vertices of the [[octahedron]], these vertices represent the 18 root vectors of the [[simple Lie group]] B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Dissection ==

The ''cuboctahedron'' can be dissected into two [[triangular cupola]]s by a common hexagon passing through the center of the cuboctahedron. If these two triangular cupolas are twisted so triangles and squares line up, [[Johnson solid]] J&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[triangular orthobicupola]], is created.
: [[File:Cuboctahedron 3 planes.png|120px]][[File:Triangular cupola.png|120px]][[File:Triangular_orthobicupola.png|120px]]

The cuboctahedron can also be dissected into 6 [[square pyramid]]s and 8 [[tetrahedra]] meeting at a central point. This dissection is expressed in the [[alternated cubic honeycomb]] where pairs of square pyramids are combined into [[octahedra]].
: [[File:TetraOctaHoneycomb-VertexConfig.svg|160px]]

==Geometric relations==
[[File:P1-A3-P1.gif|thumb|Progression between a [[tetrahedron]], expanded into a cuboctahedron, and reverse expanded into the dual tetrahedron]]

=== Symmetries ===
[[File:A3-P5-P3.gif|thumb|Progressions between an [[octahedron]], [[pseudoicosahedron]], and cuboctahedron]]
The cuboctahedron is the unique convex polyhedron in which the long radius (center to vertex) is the same as the edge length; thus its long diameter (vertex to opposite vertex) is 2 edge lengths. This radial equilateral symmetry is a property of only a few [[polytopes]], including the two-dimensional [[hexagon]], the three-dimensional cuboctahedron, and the four-dimensional [[24-cell]] and [[tesseract|8-cell (tesseract)]]. ''Radially equilateral'' polytopes are those which can be constructed, with their long radii, from equilateral triangles which meet at the center of the polytope, each contributing two radii and an edge. Therefore, all the interior elements which meet at the center of these polytopes have equilateral triangle inward faces, as in the dissection of the cuboctahedron into 6 square pyramids and 8 tetrahedra. Each of these radially equilateral polytopes also occurs as cells of a characteristic space-filling [[tessellation]]: the tiling of regular hexagons, the [[rectified cubic honeycomb]] (of alternating cuboctahedra and octahedra), the [[24-cell honeycomb]] and the [[tesseractic honeycomb]], respectively. Each tessellation has a [[dual tessellation]]; the cell centers in a tessellation are cell vertices in its dual tessellation. The densest known regular [[sphere-packing]] in two, three and four dimensions uses the cell centers of one of these tessellations as sphere centers.

A cuboctahedron has octahedral symmetry. Its first [[stellation]] is the [[polyhedral compound|compound]] of a [[cube (geometry)|cube]] and its dual [[octahedron]], with the vertices of the cuboctahedron located at the midpoints of the edges of either.

=== Constructions ===
A cuboctahedron can be obtained by taking an equatorial [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] of a four-dimensional [[24-cell]] or [[16-cell]]. A hexagon can be obtained by taking an equatorial cross section of a cuboctahedron.

The cuboctahedron is a [[Rectification (geometry)|rectified]] [[cube]] and also a rectified [[octahedron]].

It is also a [[Cantellation (geometry)|cantellated]] [[tetrahedron]]. With this construction it is given the [[Wythoff symbol]]: {{nowrap|3 3 {{!}} 2}}. [[Image:Cantellated tetrahedron.png|50px]]

A skew cantellation of the tetrahedron produces a solid with faces parallel to those of the cuboctahedron, namely eight triangles of two sizes, and six rectangles. While its edges are unequal, this solid remains ''vertex-uniform'': the solid has the full tetrahedral [[symmetry group]] and its vertices are equivalent under that group.

The edges of a cuboctahedron form four regular [[hexagon]]s. If the cuboctahedron is cut in the plane of one of these hexagons, each half is a [[triangular cupola]], one of the [[Johnson solid]]s; the cuboctahedron itself thus can also be called a triangular [[bicupola (geometry)|gyrobicupola]], the simplest of a series (other than the [[gyrobifastigium]] or &quot;digonal gyrobicupola&quot;). If the halves are put back together with a twist, so that triangles meet triangles and squares meet squares, the result is another Johnson solid, the [[triangular orthobicupola]], also called an anticuboctahedron.

Both triangular bicupolae are important in [[sphere packing]]. The distance from the solid's center to its vertices is equal to its edge length. Each central [[sphere]] can have up to twelve neighbors, and in a face-centered cubic lattice these take the positions of a cuboctahedron's vertices. In a [[hexagon]]al close-packed lattice they correspond to the corners of the triangular orthobicupola. In both cases the central sphere takes the position of the solid's center.

Cuboctahedra appear as cells in three of the [[convex uniform honeycomb]]s and in nine of the convex [[uniform 4-polytope]]s.

The volume of the cuboctahedron is {{sfrac|5|6}} of that of the enclosing cube and {{sfrac|5|8}} of that of the enclosing octahedron.

=== Vertex arrangement ===
Because it is radially equilateral, the cuboctahedron's center can be treated as a 13th ''canonical apical vertex'', one edge length distant from the 12 ordinary vertices, as the [[Apex (geometry)|apex]] of a [[Pyramid (geometry)#Right pyramids with a regular base|canonical pyramid]] is one edge length equidistant from its other vertices.

The cuboctahedron shares its edges and vertex arrangement with two [[nonconvex uniform polyhedron|nonconvex uniform polyhedra]]: the [[cubohemioctahedron]] (having the square faces in common) and the [[octahemioctahedron]] (having the triangular faces in common). It also serves as a cantellated [[tetrahedron]], as being a rectified [[tetratetrahedron]].

=== Related quasiregular polyhedra and tilings ===
The cuboctahedron exists in a sequence of symmetries of quasiregular polyhedra and tilings with [[vertex configuration]]s (3.''n'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, progressing from tilings of the sphere to the Euclidean plane and into the hyperbolic plane. With [[orbifold notation]] symmetry of *''n''32 all of these tilings are [[wythoff construction]] within a [[fundamental domain]] of symmetry, with generator points at the right angle corner of the domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|authorlink=Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|last=Coxeter|first=H.

The cuboctahedron can be decomposed into a regular [[octahedron]] and eight irregular but equal octahedra in the shape of the convex hull of a cube with two opposite vertices removed. This decomposition of the cuboctahedron corresponds with the cell-first parallel projection of the [[24-cell]] into three dimensions. Under this projection, the cuboctahedron forms the projection envelope, which can be decomposed into six square faces, a regular octahedron, and eight irregular octahedra. These elements correspond with the images of six of the octahedral cells in the 24-cell, the nearest and farthest cells from the 4D viewpoint, and the remaining eight pairs of cells, respectively.
