'''Cambridgeshire''' (abbreviated '''Cambs.'''){{NoteTag|Archaically known as the '''County of Cambridge'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|''EB''|1878}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} is a [[Counties of England|county]] in the [[East of England]], bordering [[Lincolnshire]] to the north, [[Norfolk]] to the north-east, [[Suffolk]] to the east, [[Essex]] and [[Hertfordshire]] to the south, and [[Bedfordshire]] and [[Northamptonshire]] to the west. The city of [[Cambridge]] is the [[county town]]. Modern Cambridgeshire was formed in 1974 as an amalgamation of the counties of [[Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely]] and [[Huntingdon and Peterborough]], the former covering the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] of Cambridgeshire (including the [[Isle of Ely]]) and the latter covering the historic county of [[Huntingdonshire]] and the [[Soke of Peterborough]], historically part of [[Northamptonshire]]. It contains most of the region known as [[Silicon Fen]].

The county is now divided between [[Cambridgeshire County Council]] and [[Peterborough City Council]], which, since 1998, forms a separate [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority]]. In the county there are five district councils, [[Cambridge City Council]], [[East Cambridgeshire District Council]], [[Fenland District Council]], [[Huntingdonshire District Council]] and [[South  Cambridgeshire District Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/info/20050/council_structure/81/local_government_in_cambridgeshire |title=Local government in Cambridgeshire |publisher=Cambridgeshire County Council |access-date=25 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819221806/http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/info/20050/council_structure/81/local_government_in_cambridgeshire |archive-date=19 August 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Cambridgeshire}}

Cambridgeshire is noted as the site of [[Flag Fen]] in [[Fengate]], one of the earliest-known [[Neolithic]] permanent settlements in the [[United Kingdom]], compared in importance to [[Balbridie]] in Aberdeen, Scotland. [[Must Farm]] quarry, at [[Whittlesey]] has been described as 'Britain's [[Pompeii]] due to its relatively good condition, including the 'best-preserved [[Bronze Age]] dwellings ever found'. A great quantity of [[archaeology|archaeological]] finds from the [[Stone Age]], the [[Bronze Age]] and the [[Iron Age]] were made in [[East Cambridgeshire]]. Most items were found in [[Isleham]].{{cn|date=January 2019}}

Cambridgeshire was recorded in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' as &quot;Grantbridgeshire&quot; (or rather ''Grentebrigescire'') (related to the river Granta).

Covering a large part of [[East Anglia]], Cambridgeshire today is the result of several local government unifications.  In 1888 when [[county council]]s were introduced, separate councils were set up, following the traditional division of Cambridgeshire, for
* the area in the south around Cambridge, and
* the liberty of the [[Isle of Ely]].
In 1965, these two administrative counties were merged to form [[Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely]].&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely Order 1964 (SI 1964/366), see [[Local Government Commission for England (1958 - 1967)]], ''Report and Proposals for the East Midlands General Review Area'' (Report No.3), 31 July 1961 and ''Report and Proposals for the Lincolnshire and East Anglia General Review Area'' (Report No.9), 7 May 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;
Under the [[Local Government Act 1972]] this merged with the county to the west, [[Huntingdon and Peterborough]], which had been formed in 1965, by the merger of [[Huntingdonshire]] with the [[Soke of Peterborough]] (the latter previously a part of [[Northamptonshire]] with its own county council). The resulting county was called simply Cambridgeshire.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:The English Non-metropolitan Districts (Definition) Order 1972|The English Non-metropolitan Districts (Definition) Order 1972]] (SI 1972/2039) Part 5: County of Cambridgeshire&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1998, the [[City of Peterborough]] has been a separately administered area, as a [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority]]. It is associated with Cambridgeshire for ceremonial purposes such as [[Lord-Lieutenant|Lieutenancy]], and joint functions such as policing and the fire service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1878/made The Cambridgeshire (City of Peterborough) (Structural, Boundary and Electoral Changes) Order 1996] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140710043436/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1878/made |date=10 July 2014 }} (SI 1996/1878), see [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)]], ''Final Recommendations for the Future Local Government of Cambridgeshire'', October 1994 and ''Final Recommendations on the Future Local Government of Basildon &amp; Thurrock, Blackburn &amp; Blackpool, Broxtowe, Gedling &amp; Rushcliffe, Dartford &amp; Gravesham, Gillingham &amp; Rochester upon Medway, Exeter, Gloucester, Halton &amp; Warrington, Huntingdonshire &amp; Peterborough, Northampton, Norwich, Spelthorne and the Wrekin'', December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the conservation charity [[Plantlife]] unofficially designated Cambridgeshire's [[county flower]] as the [[Pulsatilla vulgaris|Pasqueflower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1461011/The-floral-emblem-of-your-county.html|title=County Flowers|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=5 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cambridgeshire Regiment]] (nicknamed the Fen Tigers), the county-based army unit, fought in the [[Boer War]] in South Africa, the First World War and Second World War &lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.cambridgeshireregiment1914-18.co.uk/the-cambridgeshire-regiment-1914-18.html|title=Cambridgeshire Regiment|website=www.cambridgeshireregiment1914-18.co.uk|accessdate=27 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the county's flat terrain and proximity to the continent, during the Second World War the military built many airfields here for [[RAF Bomber Command]], [[RAF Fighter Command]], and the allied [[USAAF]].  In recognition of this collaboration, the [[Cambridge American Cemetery and Memorial]] is located in [[Madingley]]. It is the only WWII burial ground in England for American servicemen who died during that event.{{cn|date=January 2019}}

Most English counties have nicknames for their people, such as a &quot;[[Tyke (dialect)|Tyke]]&quot; from [[Yorkshire]] and a &quot;[[Yellowbelly (Lincolnshire)|Yellowbelly]]&quot; from [[Lincolnshire]]. The traditional [[nickname]]s for people from Cambridgeshire are &quot;Cambridgeshire Camel&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Provincial Glossary|url= https://archive.org/details/provincialglossa00gros| author= Grose|year=1790}}&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;Cambridgeshire Crane&quot;, referring to the wildfowl that were once abundant in the [[fens]]. The term &quot;Fen Tigers&quot; is sometimes used to describe the people who live and work in the fenlands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pryor1991&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis Pryor|title=Book of Flag Fen: prehistoric Fenland centre|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CIlnAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Fen+Tigers%22&amp;dq=%22Fen+Tigers%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKzMfagpTjAhU4UhUIHaCeCD0Q6AEIYzAK|date=October 1991|publisher=Batsford|isbn=978-0-7134-6752-9|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Original historical documents relating to Cambridgeshire are held by [[Cambridgeshire Archives and Local Studies]].

==Geography==
: ''See also [[Geology of Cambridgeshire]]''
Large areas of the county are extremely low-lying and [[Holme, Cambridgeshire|Holme Fen]] is notable for being the UK's lowest physical point at 2.75&amp;nbsp;m (9&amp;nbsp;ft) below sea level. The highest point is in the village of [[Great Chishill]] at 146&amp;nbsp;m (480&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level. Other [[topographic prominence|prominent]] hills are [[Little Trees Hill]] and [[Wandlebury Hill]] (both at {{convert|74|m|abbr=on}}) in the [[Gog Magog Hills]], [[Rivey Hill]] above [[Linton, Cambridgeshire|Linton]], [[Rowley's Hill]] and the [[Madingley Hills]].

===Green belt===
{{further|Cambridge Green Belt}}
Cambridgeshire contains all its [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]] around the city of Cambridge, extending to places such as [[Waterbeach]], [[Lode, Cambridgeshire|Lode]], [[Duxford]], [[Great Abingdon|Little &amp; Great Abingdon]] and other communities a few miles away in nearby districts, to afford a protection from the conurbation. It was first drawn up in the 1950s.

==Climate==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2013}}
Cambridgeshire has a maritime temperate climate which is broadly similar to the rest of the United Kingdom, though it is drier than the UK average due to its low altitude and easterly location, the prevailing southwesterly winds having already deposited moisture on higher ground further west. Average winter temperatures are cooler than the English average, due to Cambridgeshire's inland location and relative nearness to continental Europe, which results in the moderating maritime influence being less strong. Snowfall is slightly more common than in western areas, due to the relative winter coolness and easterly winds bringing occasional snow from the North Sea. In summer temperatures are average or slightly above, due to less cloud cover. It reaches {{convert|25|°C|0}} on around 10 days each year, and is comparable to parts of Kent and East Anglia.

Various [[football|forms of football]] have been popular in Cambridgeshire since medieval times at least. In 1579 one match played at [[Chesterton, Cambridge|Chesterton]] between townspeople and [[Cambridge University]] students ended in a violent brawl that led the Vice-Chancellor to issue a decree forbidding them to play &quot;footeball” outside of college grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeshirefa.com/AboutUs/History/|title=Sorry.
