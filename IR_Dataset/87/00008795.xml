For the [[1930–31 NHL season|1930–31]] and [[1931–32 NHL season|1931–32]] seasons the team was called the '''Detroit Falcons''', and in [[1932–33 NHL season|1932]] changed their name to the Red Wings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guide&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=[[NHL Official Guide &amp; Record Book]] 2015 |author=National Hockey League |year=2014 |publisher=Triumph |isbn=978-1-62937-011-8 |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wings played their home games at [[Joe Louis Arena]] from 1979 until 2017, after playing for 52 years in [[Olympia Stadium]]. They moved into the new [[Little Caesars Arena]] beginning with the 2017–18 season. The Red Wings are one of the most popular and successful franchises in the NHL; fans and sports commentators refer to the Detroit area as &quot;[[Hockeytown]]&quot;, which has been a registered trademark owned by the franchise since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fee|first=Kevin|title=Detroit Snatches 'Hockeytown ' name from Warroad, Minn.|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-54598019.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105190411/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-54598019.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 5, 2012 |publisher=Knight Ridder/ Tribune Business news |accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the [[1931–32 NHL season|1931–32]] and [[1965–66 NHL season|1965–66]] seasons, the Red Wings missed the playoffs only four times. Between the 1966–67 and 1982–83 seasons, the Red Wings made the playoffs only two times. However, thereafter, from 1983–84 to 2015–16, they made the playoffs 30 times in 32 seasons, including 25-straight from 1990–91 to 2015–16 (not counting the cancelled [[2004–05 Detroit Red Wings season|2004–05 season]]), in [[2005–06 NHL season|2006]] this became the longest active [[List of NHL franchise post-season appearance streaks|streak of postseason appearances]] in all of North American professional sports and finished tied for the third longest streak in NHL history. Since 1983–84, the Red Wings have tallied six [[Presidents' Trophy|regular season first-place finishes]] and have won the Stanley Cup four times ([[1997 Stanley Cup Finals|1997]], [[1998 Stanley Cup Finals|1998]], [[2002 Stanley Cup Finals|2002]], and [[2008 Stanley Cup Finals|2008]]).

{{further|History of the Detroit Red Wings}}

===Early years (1926–1949)===
[[File:1926 27 Detroit Cougars.png|thumb|Team photo from Detroit's inaugural season ([[1926–27 NHL season|1926–27]]). The franchise was known as the Detroit Cougars from 1926 to 1930.]]
Following the [[1926 Stanley Cup playoffs]], during which the [[Western Canada Hockey League|Western Hockey League]] (WHL) was widely reported to be on the verge of folding,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Coleman, Charles L. | title=The Trail of the Stanley Cup, Vol. 1, 1893–1926 inc. |year=1966 |publisher=National Hockey League |location=Montreal, Quebec |page= 498}}&lt;/ref&gt; the NHL held a meeting on April 17 to consider applications for expansion franchises, at which it was reported that five different groups sought a team for Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Coleman, Charles L. | title=The Trail of the Stanley Cup, Vol. 1, 1893–1926 inc. |year=1966 |publisher=National Hockey League |location=Montreal, Quebec |page=508}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a subsequent meeting on May 15, the league approved a franchise to the Townsend-Seyburn group of Detroit and named [[Charles A. Hughes]] as governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Coleman, Charles L. | title=The Trail of the Stanley Cup, Vol. 2, 1927–1946 inc. |year=1969 |publisher=National Hockey League |location=Sherbrooke, PQ |page= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Patrick (ice hockey)|Frank]] and [[Lester Patrick]], the owners of the WHL, made a deal to sell the league's players to the NHL and cease league operations. The new Detroit franchise purchased the players of the WHL's [[Victoria Cougars]], who had won the Stanley Cup in 1925 and had made the Finals the previous winter, to play for the team. The new Detroit franchise also adopted the Cougars' nickname in honor of the folded franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Coleman, Charles L. | title=The Trail of the Stanley Cup, Vol. 2, 1927–1946 inc. |year=1969 |publisher=National Hockey League |location=Sherbrooke, PQ |pages=8-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since no arena in Detroit was ready at the time, the Cougars played their [[1926–27 Detroit Cougars season|first season]] at the [[Border Cities Arena]] in [[Windsor, Ontario]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1920s Cougars&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Written History 1920s – Detroit Red Wings|url=http://redwings.ice.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=43765|website=Detroit Red Wings|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Nathan|last=Bierma|title=Windsor Arena, first home of the Red Wings, is still standing — for now|url=https://www.vintagedetroit.com/blog/2018/02/28/windsor-arena-first-home-red-wings-still-standing-now/|website=Vintage Detroit|date=February 28, 2018|accessdate=December 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[1927–28 NHL season|1927–28 season]], the Cougars moved into the new [[Detroit Olympia]], which would be their home rink until December 15, 1979.&lt;ref name=Olympia&gt;{{cite web|first=Scott|last=Ferkovich|title=When the Red Wings said goodbye to Olympia Stadium|url=https://www.vintagedetroit.com/blog/2017/01/07/red-wings-said-goodbye-olympia-stadium/|website=Vintage Detroit|date=January 7, 2017|accessdate=December 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the first season behind the bench for [[Jack Adams]], who would be the face of the franchise for the next 36 years as either coach or general manager.&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;{{cite web|first=Tony|last=Wolak|title=Jack Adams, the Man and the Award|url=https://thehockeywriters.com/jack-adams-the-man-the-award/|website=The Hockey Writers|date=August 14, 2017|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cougars made the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time in [[1928–29 NHL season|1929]] with [[Carson Cooper]] leading the team in scoring.&lt;ref name=&quot;1920s Cougars&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1928-29 Detroit Cougars Roster and Statistics|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/DTC/1929.html|website=Hockey-Reference.com|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cougars were outscored 7–2 in the two-game series with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1929 Cougars&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=1928-29 Detroit Cougars Schedule and Results|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/DTC/1929_games.html|website=Hockey-Reference.com|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, the Cougars were renamed the Falcons, but their woes continued, as they usually finished near the bottom of the standings, even though they made the playoffs again in [[1931–32 NHL season|1932]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1930s Wings&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redwings.ice.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=43758|title=Written History 1930s – Detroit Red Wings|website=Detroit Red Wings|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1930-31 NHL Summary|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_1931.html|website=Hockey-Reference.com|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1931-32 NHL Summary|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_1932.html|website=Hockey-Reference.com|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1931-32 Detroit Falcons Schedule and Results|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/DTF/1932_games.html|website=Hockey-Reference.com|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, the NHL let grain merchant [[James E. Norris]], who had made two previous unsuccessful bids to buy an NHL team, purchase the Falcons. Norris' first act was to choose a new name for the team—the Red Wings. Earlier in the century, Norris had been a member of the [[Montreal Amateur Athletic Association]] (MAAA), a multi-sport club whose winged-wheel emblem derived from its cycling roots, and [[Montreal Hockey Club|whose hockey team]] won the first Stanley Cup in 1893. Norris decided that a red version of the MAAA &quot;Winged Wheelers&quot; logo was perfect for a team playing in the &quot;Motor City&quot; and on October 5, 1932, the club was renamed the Red Wings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=How did they get to be the Red Wings? |last=Fitzpatrick |first=Jamie |website=LiveAbout|url=https://www.liveabout.com/how-did-they-become-red-wings-2778717|accessdate=January 22, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norris also placed coach Jack Adams on a one-year probation for the [[1932–33 NHL season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legends of Hockey – Spotlight – One on One with Jack Adams|url=https://www.hhof.com/htmlSpotlight/spot_oneononep195901.shtml|website=Hockey Hall of Fame|date=November 24, 2006|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams managed to pass his probationary period by leading the renamed franchise to its first-ever playoff series victory, over the [[Montreal Maroons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1933 NHL Stanley Cup Quarter-Finals: DET vs. MTM|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/playoffs/1933-detroit-red-wings-vs-montreal-maroons-quarter-finals.html|website=Hockey-Reference.com|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team then lost in the semi-finals to the [[New York Rangers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1933 NHL Stanley Cup Semi-Finals: DET vs. NYR|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/playoffs/1933-detroit-red-wings-vs-new-york-rangers-semi-finals.html|website=Hockey-Reference.com|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1933–34 NHL season|1934]], the Red Wings made the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time, with [[John Sorrell (ice hockey)|John Sorrell]] scoring 21 goals over 47 games and [[Larry Aurie]] leading the team in scoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1933-34 Detroit Red Wings Roster and Statistics|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/DET/1934.html|website=Hockey-Reference.com|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]] defeated the Red Wings in the Finals, winning the best-of-five series in four games to claim their first title.&lt;ref name=&quot;1930s champs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanley Cup Champions 1930-1939|url=https://www.nhl.com/news/nhl-stanley-cup-champions-1930-1939/c-287934514|publisher=National Hockey League|date=January 1, 2017|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two seasons later, the Red Wings won their first Stanley Cup in [[1935–36 NHL season|1936]], defeating Toronto in four games.&lt;ref name=&quot;1930s champs&quot;/&gt; Detroit repeated as Stanley Cup champions in [[1936–37 NHL season|1937]], winning over the Rangers in the full five games.&lt;ref name=&quot;1930s champs&quot;/&gt; In 1938, the [[Montreal Canadiens]] and the Red Wings became the first NHL teams to play in Europe, playing in [[Paris]] and [[London]].

In [[1946–47 NHL season|1946]], one of the greatest players in hockey history came into the NHL with the Red Wings.

A successful college hockey coach, Harkness tried to force his two-way style of play on a veteran Red Wings team resistant to change.

===Fan traditions===
[[File:Detroit Red Wings vs. Vancouver Canucks - November 10, 2016 (31013559085).jpg|thumb|During the playoffs, Joe Louis Arena was adorned with a giant octopus, nicknamed [[Al the Octopus|Al]]. This stems from a [[Legend of the Octopus|fan tradition]].]]
{{Main|Legend of the Octopus}}
The &quot;Legend of the Octopus&quot; is a sports tradition during Detroit Red Wings playoff games, in which an octopus is thrown onto the ice surface for good luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detroit Red Wings Legend of the Octopus|url=http://redwings.ice.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=43781|website=Detroit Red Wings|accessdate=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the playoffs, Joe Louis Arena was generally adorned with a giant octopus with red eyes, nicknamed &quot;[[Al the Octopus|Al]]&quot; after head ice manager [[Al Sobotka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legend Of Al The Octopus Lives On|url=http://www.clickondetroit.com/red-wings/23162881/detail.html|accessdate=2011-04-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419143616/http://www.clickondetroit.com/red-wings/23162881/detail.html|archivedate=April 19, 2010|website=ClickOnDetroit.com|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1951–52 NHL season#Playoffs|1952 playoffs]] featured the start of the octopus throw. The owner of a local fish market, Peter Cusimano, threw one from the stands onto the ice. The eight legs are symbolic of the eight wins it took to win the Stanley Cup at the time. The Red Wings went on to sweep both of their opponents that year en route to a Stanley Cup championship. The NHL has, at various times, tried to eliminate this tradition but it continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Greg|last=Wyshynski|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/blog/puck_daddy/post/Lawsuit-seeking-octopus-ban-in-Detroit-already-t?urn=nhl,89102|title=Lawsuit seeking octopus ban in Detroit already tossed|work=Yahoo!

Sobotka is the man responsible for removing the thrown creatures from the ice. When the Red Wings played at Joe Louis Arena, he was known for swinging the tossed octopuses above his head when walking off the ice. On April 19, 2008, the NHL sent a memo to the Red Wings that forbade this; they said that violating the mandate would result in a $10,000 fine.&lt;ref name=Fine&gt;{{cite web|title=NHL bans octopus swinging; $10,000 fine for offenders|url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080419/SPORTS05/804190350/1053/SPORTS05|website=Detroit Free Press|date=April 19, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501054720/http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080419/SPORTS05/804190350/1053/SPORTS05|archivedate=May 1, 2008|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it was to up to the linesmen to remove the octopuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Octopus-gate takes another dramatic turn|url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080425/SPORTS05/80425013/1053/SPORTS05|website=Detroit Free Press|date=April 25, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430152353/http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080425%2FSPORTS05%2F80425013%2F1053%2FSPORTS05|archivedate=April 30, 2008|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an email to the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', NHL spokesman Frank Brown justified the ban because matter flew off the octopus and got on the ice when Sobotka swung it above his head.&lt;ref name=Fine/&gt; This ban was later loosened to allow for the octopus twirling to take place at the Zamboni entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rejoice: Octopus twirling OK again!|url=http://archive.freep.com/article/20080508/BLOG09/80507089/Rejoice-Octopus-twirling-OK-again-|website=Detroit Free Press|date=May 7, 2008|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20150124143532/http://archive.freep.com/article/20080508/BLOG09/80507089/Rejoice-Octopus-twirling-OK-again-|archivedate=January 24, 2015|accessdate=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically during the last minute or two of games that the Red Wings are winning, especially around the end of the season and during the playoffs, fans are known to start singing along to [[Journey (band)|Journey]]'s &quot;[[Don't Stop Believin']].&quot; The song is played over the PA system and continues until it is muted while the crowd sings the words &quot;Born and raised in South Detroit&quot;, then the song resumes over the speakers in the arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Z.
