In order to distinguish this notion of ''dhamma'' from the Indian conception where the term ''dharma'' meant reality (''atman''), in an ontological sense, the Buddha utilised the conception of result or consequence or fruit (''attha'', Sk.

==Etymology==
[[File:Dhamma inscription.jpg|thumb|The [[Prakrit]] word &quot;''Dha-·πÉ-ma''&quot;/[[wikt:ëÄ•ëÄÅëÄ´|ëÄ•ëÄÅëÄ´]] ([[Sanskrit]]: Dharma [[wikt:‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ#Sanskrit|‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ]]) in the [[Brahmi script]], as inscribed by Emperor [[Ashoka]] in his [[Edicts of Ashoka]] (3rd century BCE).]]
The [[Classical Sanskrit]] noun ''dharma'' ([[wikt:‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ#Sanskrit|‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ]]) or the [[Prakrit]] Dha·πÉma ([[wikt:ëÄ•ëÄÅëÄ´|ëÄ•ëÄÅëÄ´]]) are a derivation from the root ''dh·πõ'', which means &quot;to hold, maintain, keep&quot;,{{refn|group=note|name=&quot;Monier Williams&quot;|Monier Williams, ''A Sanskrit Dictionary'' (1899): &quot;to hold, bear (also bring forth), carry, maintain, preserve, keep, possess, have, use, employ, practise, undergo&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Monier Willams.&lt;/ref&gt;}}. Hence, ''dharma'' holds one from falling down or falling to hell. Therefore, takes the meaning of &quot;what is established or firm&quot;, and hence &quot;law&quot;.  It is derived from an older [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''n''-stem ''dharman-'', with a literal meaning of &quot;bearer, supporter&quot;, in a [[Historical Vedic religion|religious sense]]  conceived as an aspect of [[Rta]].{{sfn|Day|1982|pp=42‚Äì45}}

In the [[Rigveda]], the word appears as an ''n''-stem, ''{{IAST|dh√°rman-}}'', with a range of meanings encompassing &quot;something established or firm&quot; (in the literal sense of prods or poles). Figuratively, it means &quot;sustainer&quot; and &quot;supporter&quot; (of deities). It is semantically similar to the Greek ''[[Themis]]'' (&quot;fixed decree, statute, law&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brereton|first=Joel P.|date=December 2004|title=Dh√°rman In The Rgveda|journal=Journal of Indian Philosophy|language=English|volume=32|issue=5‚Äì6|pages=449‚Äì489|doi=10.1007/s10781-004-8631-8|issn=0022-1791|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Classical Sanskrit]], the noun becomes thematic: ''{{IAST|dharma-}}''.

The word ''dharma'' derives from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root 
*''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/d ∞er-|*d ∞er-]]'' (&quot;to hold&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-first=Helmut |editor-last=Rix |editor-link=Helmut Rix |title=Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben |year=2001 |language=German |page=145 |publisher=Dr. Ludwig Reichert Verlag |edition=2nd |location=Wiesbaden|title-link=Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben }}&lt;/ref&gt; which in Sanskrit is reflected as class-1 root{{clarify|date=January 2018|What is a &quot;class-1 root&quot;? I find no article on that topic and no mention of it in the article about Sanskrit. Does that correspond with the numbering in the &quot;Sonority hierarchy&quot; section of the &quot;Proto-Indo-European root&quot; article?}} ''[[wikt:‡§ß‡§∞‡§§‡§ø#Sanskrit|dh·πõ]]''. Etymologically it is related to [[Avestan language|Avestan]] dar- (&quot;to hold&quot;), Latin ''[[wikt:firmus#Latin|firmus]]'' (&quot;steadfast, stable, powerful&quot;), Lithuanian ''[[wikt:derƒóti#Lithuanian|derƒóÃÅti]]'' (&quot;to be suited, fit&quot;), Lithuanian ''dermƒó'' (&quot;agreement&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Karl Brugmann, ''Elements of the Comparative Grammar of the Indo-Germanic languages'',  Volume III, B. Westermann &amp; Co., New York, 1892, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''darna'' (&quot;harmony&quot;) and [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''[[wikt:–¥—Ä—ä–∂–∞—Ç–∏#Old Church Slavonic|dr—ä≈æati]]'' (&quot;to hold, possess&quot;).
*Classical Sanskrit word ''dharmas'' would formally match with Latin o-stem ''[[wikt:firmus#Latin|firmus]]'' from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''d ∞er-mo-s'' &quot;holding&quot;, were it not for its historical development from earlier Rigvedic n-stem.

In Classical Sanskrit, and in the [[Vedic Sanskrit]] of the [[Atharvaveda]], the stem is thematic: ''{{IAST|dh√°rma-}}'' ([[DevanƒÅgarƒ´]]: ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ). In [[Prakrit]] and [[PƒÅli]], it is rendered ''dhamma''. In some [[Indo-Aryan languages#Contemporary languages|contemporary Indian languages]] and dialects it alternatively occurs as ''dharm''.

;Ancient translations
When the [[Mauryan Empire|Mauryan Emperor]] [[Ashoka]] wanted in the 3rd century BCE to translate the word &quot;Dharma&quot; (he used [[Prakrit]] word ''[[Dhamma|Dha·πÉma]]'') into Greek and Aramaic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amp.scroll.in/article/905466/how-did-the-ramayana-and-mahabharata-come-to-be-and-what-has-dharma-got-to-do-with-it|title=How did the 'Ramayana' and 'Mahabharata' come to be (and what has 'dharma' got to do with it)?}}&lt;/ref&gt; he used the Greek word ''[[Eusebeia]]'' (Œµ·ΩêœÉŒ≠Œ≤ŒµŒπŒ±,  piety, spiritual maturity, or godliness) in the [[Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription]] and the [[Kandahar Greek Edict of Ashoka|Kandahar Greek Edicts]], and the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word ''Qsyt'' (&quot;Truth&quot;) in the [[Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hiltebeitel |first1=Alf |title=Dharma: Its Early History in Law, Religion, and Narrative |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=9780195394238 |pages=36‚Äì37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4NF8pYxdvIC&amp;pg=PA36 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Dharma is a concept of central importance in [[Indian philosophy]] and [[Indian religions|religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dhand|first=Arti|date=17 December 2002|title=The Dharma of Ethics, the Ethics of Dharma: Quizzing the Ideals of Hinduism|journal=Journal of Religious Ethics|language=en|volume=30|issue=3|page=351|doi=10.1111/1467-9795.00113|issn=1467-9795|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has multiple meanings in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; It is difficult to provide a single concise definition for ''dharma'', as the word has a long and varied history and straddles a complex set of meanings and interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. B. Van Buitenen, &quot;Dharma and Moksa&quot;, ''Philosophy East and West'', Volume 7, Number 1/2 (April‚ÄìJuly 1957), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no equivalent single-word synonym for ''dharma'' in western languages.&lt;ref name=lraw&gt;See:

There have been numerous, conflicting attempts to translate ancient Sanskrit literature with the word ''dharma'' into German, English and French. The concept, claims Paul Horsch,&lt;ref name=paulhorsch/&gt; has caused exceptional difficulties for modern commentators and translators. For example, while Grassmann's&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Grassmann, ''Worterbuch zum Rig-veda'' (German Edition), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120816367}}&lt;/ref&gt; translation of Rig-veda identifies seven different meanings of dharma, [[Karl Friedrich Geldner]] in his translation of the Rig-veda employs 20 different translations for dharma, including meanings such as &quot;law&quot;, &quot;order&quot;, &quot;duty&quot;, &quot;custom&quot;, &quot;quality&quot;, and &quot;model&quot;, among others.&lt;ref name=paulhorsch/&gt; However, the word ''dharma'' has become a widely accepted [[loanword]] in English, and is included in all modern unabridged English dictionaries.

The root of the word ''dharma'' is &quot;dhri&quot;, which means &quot;to support, hold, or bear&quot;. It is the thing that regulates the course of change by not participating in change, but that principle which remains constant.&lt;ref name=stevenrosen&gt;Steven Rosen (2006), ''Essential Hinduism'', Praeger, {{ISBN|0-275-99006-0}}, pp. 34‚Äì45.&lt;/ref&gt; Monier-Williams, the widely cited resource for definitions and explanation of Sanskrit words and concepts of Hinduism, offers&lt;ref&gt;see:

Yet, each of these definitions is incomplete, while the combination of these translations does not convey the total sense of the word. In common parlance, ''dharma'' means &quot;right way of living&quot; and &quot;path of rightness&quot;.&lt;ref name=stevenrosen/&gt;

The meaning of the word ''dharma'' depends on the context, and its meaning has evolved as ideas of Hinduism have developed through history. In the earliest texts and ancient myths of Hinduism, ''dharma'' meant cosmic law, the rules that created the universe from chaos, as well as rituals; in later [[Vedas]], [[Upanishads]], [[Puranas]] and the [[Indian epic poetry|Epics]], the meaning became refined, richer, and more complex, and the word was applied to diverse contexts.&lt;ref name=phph&gt;see:

In Buddhism, ''dharma'' incorporates the teachings and doctrines of the founder of Buddhism, [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]].

==History==
According to the authoritative book ''[[History of Dharmasastra (P.V. Kane)|History of Dharmasastra]]'', in the hymns of the [[Rigveda]] the word dharma appears at least fifty-six times, as an adjective or noun. According to Paul Horsch,&lt;ref name=paulhorsch&gt;Horsch, Paul, &quot;From Creation Myth to World Law: the Early History of Dharma&quot;, ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', December 2004, Volume 32, Issue 5-6, pp. 423‚Äì448.&lt;/ref&gt; the word dharma has its origin in the myths of Vedic Hinduism. The Brahman (whom all the gods make up), claim the hymns of the Rig Veda, created the universe from chaos, they hold (dhar-) the earth and sun and stars apart, they support (dhar-) the sky away and distinct from earth, and they stabilise (dhar-) the quaking mountains and plains.&lt;ref name=paulhorsch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RgVeda 6.70.1, 8.41.10, 10.44.8, for secondary source see [[Karl Friedrich Geldner]], Der Rigveda in Auswahl (2 vols.), Stuttgart; and [[Harvard Oriental Series]], 33‚Äì36, Bd. 1‚Äì3: 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; The gods, mainly [[Indra]], then deliver and hold order from disorder, harmony from chaos, stability from instability ‚Äì actions recited in the Veda with the root of word dharma.&lt;ref name=phph/&gt; In hymns composed after the mythological verses, the word dharma takes expanded meaning as a [[Buddhist cosmology|cosmic]] principle and appears in verses independent of gods. It evolves into a concept, claims Paul Horsch,&lt;ref name=paulhorsch/&gt; that has a dynamic functional sense in [[Atharvaveda]] for example, where it becomes the cosmic law that links cause and effect through a subject. Dharma, in these ancient texts, also takes a ritual meaning. The ritual is connected to the cosmic, and &quot;dharmani&quot; is equated to ceremonial devotion to the principles that gods used to create order from disorder, the world from chaos.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Horsch, &quot;From Creation Myth to World Law: the Early History of Dharma&quot;, ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', December 2004, Volume 32, Issue 5-6, pp. 430‚Äì431.&lt;/ref&gt; Past the ritual and cosmic sense of dharma that link the current world to mythical universe, the concept extends to ethical-social sense that links human beings to each other and to other life forms. It is here that dharma as a concept of law emerges in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;P. Thieme, Gedichte aus dem Rig-Veda, Reclam Universal-Bibliothek Nr. 8930, pp. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Horsch, &quot;From Creation Myth to World Law: the Early History of Dharma&quot;, ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', December 2004, Volume 32, Issue 5-6, pp. 430‚Äì432.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dharma and related words are found in the oldest Vedic literature of Hinduism, in later Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, and the Epics; the word dharma also plays a central role in the literature of other Indian religions founded later, such as Buddhism and Jainism.&lt;ref name=&quot;phph&quot;/&gt; According to Brereton,&lt;ref name=jbrereton/&gt; ''Dharman'' occurs 63 times in [[Rigveda|Rig-veda]]; in addition, words related to Dharman also appear in Rig-veda, for example once as dharmakrt, 6 times as ''satyadharman'', and once as ''dharmavant'', 4 times as ''dharman'' and twice as ''dhariman''.

[[Indo-European studies|Indo-European]] parallels for &quot;Dharma&quot; are known, but the only Iranian equivalent is Old Persian ''darmƒÅn'' &quot;remedy&quot;, the meaning of which is rather removed from [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] ''dh√°rman'', suggesting that the word &quot;Dharma&quot; did not have a major role in the [[Indo-Iranian period|Indo-Iranian]] period, and was principally developed more recently under the Vedic tradition.&lt;ref name=jbrereton&gt;Joel Brereton (2004), &quot;Dharman in the RgVeda&quot;, ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'',  Vol. 32, [https://www.academia.edu/5993798/Dh_rman_In_The_Rgveda pp. 449‚Äì489]. &quot;There are Indo-European parallels to ''dh√°rman'' (cf. Wennerberg 1981: 95f.), but the only Iranian equivalent is Old Persian ''darmƒÅn'' 'remedy', which has little bearing on Indo-Aryan ''dh√°rman''. There is thus no evidence that IIr. *dharman was a signiÔ¨Åcant culture word during the Indo-Iranian period.&quot; (p.449) &quot;The origin of the concept of dharman rests in its formation. It is a Vedic, rather than an Indo-Iranian word, and a more recent coinage than many other key religious terms of the Vedic tradition. Its meaning derives directly from dhr 'support, uphold, give foundation to' and therefore 'foundation' is a reasonable gloss in most of its attestations.&quot; (p.485)&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is thought that the ''[[Daena]]'' of [[Zoroastrianism]], also meaning the &quot;eternal Law&quot; or &quot;religion&quot;, is related to Sanskrit &quot;Dharma&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morreall |first1=John |last2=Sonn |first2=Tamara |title=The Religion Toolkit: A Complete Guide to Religious Studies |date=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781444343717 |page=324 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aM461tmUDe4C&amp;pg=PT324 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideas in parts overlapping to ''Dharma'' are found in other ancient cultures: such as Chinese [[Tao]], Egyptian [[Maat]], Sumerian [[Me (mythology)|Me]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stevenrosen&quot;/&gt;

===Eusebeia and dharma===

[[File:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|220px|The [[Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription]] is from Indian [[Emperor Asoka]] in 258 BC, and found in [[Afghanistan]]. The inscription renders the word ''Dharma'' in Sanskrit as [[Eusebeia]] in Greek, suggesting ''dharma'' in ancient India meant spiritual maturity, devotion, piety, duty towards and reverence for human community.&lt;ref name=paulhacker/&gt;]]
In mid-20th century, an inscription of the Indian [[Emperor Asoka]] from the year 258 BC was discovered in Afghanistan, the [[Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription]]. This rock inscription contains [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] text. According to [[:de:Paul Hacker|Paul Hacker]],&lt;ref name=paulhacker/&gt; on the rock appears a Greek rendering for the Sanskrit word dharma: the word [[eusebeia]].&lt;ref name=paulhacker&gt;Paul Hacker (1965), &quot;Dharma in Hinduism&quot;, ''[[Journal of Indian Philosophy]]'', Volume 34, Issue 5, pp. 479‚Äì496 (English translated version by Donald R. Davis (2006)).&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars of Hellenistic Greece explain eusebeia as a complex concept. Eusebia means not only to venerate gods, but also spiritual maturity, a reverential attitude toward life, and includes the right conduct toward one's parents, siblings and children, the right conduct between husband and wife, and the conduct between biologically unrelated people. This rock inscription, concludes Paul Hacker,&lt;ref name=paulhacker/&gt; suggests dharma in India, about 2300 years ago, was a central concept and meant not only religious ideas, but ideas of right, of good, of one's duty toward the human community.&lt;ref&gt;[[Etienne Lamotte]], Bibliotheque du Museon 43, Louvain, 1958, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rta, maya and dharma===
The evolving literature of Hinduism linked ''dharma'' to two other important concepts: ''·πöta'' and ''MƒÅyƒÅ''. [[·πöta]] in Vedas is the truth and [[Buddhist cosmology|cosmic]] principle which regulates and coordinates the operation of the universe and everything within it.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Holdrege (2004), &quot;Dharma&quot; in: Mittal &amp; Thursby (Editors) The Hindu World, New York: Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-21527-7}}, pp. 213‚Äì248.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=koller/&gt; [[MƒÅyƒÅ]] in Rig-veda and later literature means illusion, fraud, deception, magic that misleads and creates disorder,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0800/mw__0844.html MƒÅyƒÅ] Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, {{ISBN|978-8120603691}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus is contrary to reality, laws and rules that establish order, predictability and harmony. Paul Horsch&lt;ref name=paulhorsch/&gt; suggests ·πöta and dharma are parallel concepts, the former being a cosmic principle, the latter being of moral social sphere; while MƒÅyƒÅ and dharma are also correlative concepts, the former being that which corrupts law and moral life, the later being that which strengthens law and moral life.&lt;ref name=koller&gt;Koller, J. M. (1972), &quot;Dharma: an expression of universal order&quot;, ''Philosophy East and West'', 22(2), pp. 136‚Äì142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Northrop, F. S. C. (1949), &quot;Naturalistic and cultural foundations for a more effective international law&quot;, ''Yale Law Journal'', 59, pp. 1430‚Äì1441.&lt;/ref&gt;

Day proposes dharma is a manifestation of ·πöta, but suggests ·πöta may have been subsumed into a more complex concept of dharma, as the idea developed in ancient India over time in a nonlinear manner.{{sfn|Day|1982|pp=42‚Äì44}} The following verse from the [[Rigveda]] is an example where ''rta'' and dharma are linked:
{{quote|O Indra, lead us on the path of Rta, on the right path over all evils...|[[Mandala 10|RV 10]].133.6}}

==Hinduism==
{{Hinduism small}}
Dharma is an organising principle in Hinduism that applies to human beings in solitude, in their interaction with human beings and nature, as well as between inanimate objects, to all of [[cosmos]] and its parts.&lt;ref name=stevenrosen/&gt; It refers to the order and customs which make life and universe possible, and includes behaviours, rituals, rules that govern society, and ethics.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODWR-Dharma&quot; /&gt;{{refn|group=note|name=&quot;ODWR-Dharma&quot;}} Hindu dharma includes the religious duties, moral rights and duties of each individual, as well as behaviours that enable social order, right conduct, and those that are virtuous.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Dharma&quot;, ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', 6th Ed. (2013), Columbia University Press, Gale, {{ISBN|978-0787650155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dharma, according to Van Buitenen,&lt;ref name=vanbuitenen&gt;J. A. B. Van Buitenen, &quot;Dharma and Moksa&quot;, ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. ‚Äì Jul., 1957), pp. 33‚Äì40&lt;/ref&gt; is that which all existing beings must accept and respect to sustain harmony and order in the world. It is neither the act nor the result, but the natural laws that guide the act and create the result to prevent chaos in the world. It is innate characteristic, that makes the being what it is. It is, claims Van Buitenen, the pursuit and execution of one's nature and true calling, thus playing one's role in cosmic concert. In Hinduism, it is the dharma of the bee to make honey, of cow to give milk, of sun to radiate sunshine, of river to flow.&lt;ref name=vanbuitenen/&gt; In terms of humanity, dharma is the need for, the effect of and essence of service and interconnectedness of all life.&lt;ref name=stevenrosen/&gt;&lt;ref name=paulhacker/&gt;

In its true essence, dharma means for a Hindu to &quot;expand the mind&quot; as the scholar Devdutt Pattnaik suggests in his treatises in Hinduism. Furthermore, it represents the direct connection between the individual and the societal phenomena that bind the society together. In the way societal phenomena affect the conscience of the individual, similarly do the actions of an individual may alter the course of the society, for better or for worse. This is been subtlely echoed by the credo ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡•ã ‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞‡§Ø‡§§‡§ø ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ú‡§æ: meaning dharma is that which holds and provides support to the social construct.

In Hinduism, ''dharma'' includes two aspects ‚Äì ''[[sanƒÅtana dharma]]'', which is the overall, unchanging and abiding principals of dharma and is not subject to change, and ''[[yuga dharma]]'', which is valid for a [[yuga]], an epoch or age as established by Hindu tradition.

===In Vedas and Upanishads===
The [[Dharma#History|history section]] of this article discusses the development of dharma concept in [[Vedas]]. This development continued in the [[Upanishads]] and later ancient scripts of Hinduism. In Upanishads, the concept of dharma continues as universal principle of law, order, harmony, and truth. It acts as the regulatory moral principle of the Universe. It is explained as law of righteousness and equated to ''[[satya]]'' ([[Sanskrit]]: ‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ç, truth),&lt;ref name=chjo/&gt;&lt;ref name=paulh/&gt; in hymn 1.4.14 of [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|Brhadaranyaka Upanishad]], as follows:

Nothing is higher than dharma. The weak overcomes the stronger by dharma, as over a king. Truly that dharma is the Truth (''Satya''); Therefore, when a man speaks the Truth, they say, &quot;He speaks the Dharma&quot;; and if he speaks Dharma, they say, &quot;He speaks the Truth!&quot; For both are one.|[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]|1.4.xiv&lt;ref name=chjo&gt;[[Charles Johnston (Theosophist)|Charles Johnston]], The Mukhya Upanishads: Books of Hidden Wisdom, Kshetra, {{ISBN|978-1495946530}}, p. 481, for discussion: pp. 478‚Äì505.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=paulh&gt;Horsch, Paul (translated by Jarrod Whitaker), &quot;From Creation Myth to World Law: The early history of Dharma&quot;, ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', Vol 32, pp. 423‚Äì448, (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===In the Epics===
The Hindu religion and philosophy, claims [[Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Sr.|Daniel Ingalls]],&lt;ref&gt;Daniel H. H. Ingalls, &quot;Dharma and Moksa&quot;, ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. ‚Äì Jul., 1957), pp. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; places major emphasis on individual practical morality. In the Sanskrit epics, this concern is omnipresent.

In the Second Book of [[Ramayana]], for example, a peasant asks the King to do what dharma morally requires of him, the King agrees and does so even though his compliance with the law of dharma costs him dearly. Similarly, dharma is at the centre of all major events in the life of Rama, Sita, and Lakshman in Ramayana, claims Daniel Ingalls.&lt;ref name=danielingalls&gt;Daniel H. H. Ingalls, &quot;Dharma and Moksa&quot;, ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (April ‚Äì July 1957), pp. 41‚Äì48.&lt;/ref&gt; Each episode of Ramayana presents life situations and ethical questions in symbolic terms. The issue is debated by the characters, finally the right prevails over wrong, the good over evil. For this reason, in Hindu Epics, the good, morally upright, law-abiding king is referred to as &quot;dharmaraja&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The MahƒÅbhƒÅrata: Book 11: The Book of the Women; Book 12: The Book of Peace, Part 1 By Johannes Adrianus Bernardus Buitenen, James L. Fitzgerald p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mahabharata]], the other major Indian epic, similarly, dharma is central, and it is presented with symbolism and metaphors. Near the end of the epic, the god Yama, referred to as dharma in the text, is portrayed as taking the form of a dog to test the compassion of [[Yudhishthira]], who is told he may not enter paradise with such an animal, but refuses to abandon his companion, for which decision he is then praised by dharma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m17/m17003.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 17: Mahaprasthanika Parva: Section 3|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value and appeal of the Mahabharata is not as much in its complex and rushed presentation of metaphysics in the 12th book, claims Ingalls,&lt;ref name=danielingalls/&gt; because Indian metaphysics is more eloquently presented in other Sanskrit scriptures; the appeal of Mahabharata, like Ramayana, is in its presentation of a series of moral problems and life situations, to which there are usually three answers given, according to Ingalls:&lt;ref name=danielingalls/&gt; one answer is of [[Bhima]], which is the answer of brute force, an individual angle representing materialism, egoism, and self; the second answer is of [[Yudhishthira]], which is always an appeal to piety and gods, of social virtue and of tradition; the third answer is of introspective [[Arjuna]], which falls between the two extremes, and who, claims Ingalls, symbolically reveals the finest moral qualities of man. The Epics of Hinduism are a symbolic treatise about life, virtues, customs, morals, ethics, law, and other aspects of dharma.&lt;ref&gt;There is considerable amount of literature on dharma-related discussion in Hindu Epics: of Egoism versus Altruism, Individualism versus Social Virtues and Tradition; for examples, see:
* Johann Jakob Meyer (1989), Sexual life in ancient India, {{ISBN|8120806387}}, Motilal Banarsidass, pp. 92‚Äì93; Quote ‚Äì &quot;In Indian literature, especially in Mahabharata over and over again is heard the energetic cry ‚Äì Each is alone. None belongs to anyone else, we are all but strangers to strangers; (...), none knows the other, the self belongs only to self. Man is born alone, alone he lives, alone he dies, alone he tastes the fruit of his deeds and his ways, it is only his work that bears him company. (...) Our body and spiritual organism is ever changing; what belongs, then, to us? (...) Thus, too, there is really no teacher or leader for anyone, each is his own Guru, and must go along the road to happiness alone. Only the self is the friend of man, only the self is the foe of man; from others nothing comes to him. Therefore what must be done is to honor, to assert one's self...&quot;; Quote ‚Äì &quot;(in parts of the epic), the most thoroughgoing egoism and individualism is stressed...&quot;

* J Ganeri (2010), A Return to the Self: Indians and Greeks on Life as Art and Philosophical Therapy, Royal Institute of Philosophy supplement, 85(66), pp. 119‚Äì135.&lt;/ref&gt; There is extensive discussion of dharma at the individual level in the Epics of Hinduism, observes [[Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Sr.|Ingalls]]; for example, on free will versus destiny, when and why human beings believe in either, ultimately concluding that the strong and prosperous naturally uphold free will, while those facing grief or frustration naturally lean towards destiny.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel H. H. Ingalls, &quot;Dharma and Moksa&quot;, ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. ‚Äì Jul., 1957), pp. 44‚Äì45; Quote ‚Äì &quot;(...)In the Epic, free will has the upper hand. Only when a man's effort is frustrated or when he is overcome with grief does he become a predestinarian (believer in destiny).&quot;; Quote ‚Äì &quot;This association of success with the doctrine of free will or human effort (purusakara) was felt so clearly that among the ways of bringing about a king's downfall is given the following simple advice: 'Belittle free will to him, and emphasise destiny.{{'&quot;}} (Mahabharata 12.106.20).&lt;/ref&gt; The Epics of Hinduism illustrate various aspects of dharma, they are a means of communicating dharma with metaphors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Huston Smith]], The World Religions, {{ISBN|978-0061660184}}, HarperOne (2009); For summary notes: [http://staff.gps.edu/montgomery/World%20Religions/Faiths/hinduism/Background%20to%20Hindu%20Literature.htm Background to Hindu Literature] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040922160422/http://staff.gps.edu/montgomery/World%20Religions/Faiths/hinduism/Background%20to%20Hindu%20Literature.htm |date=2004-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===According to 4th century Vatsyayana===
According to [[Klaus Klostermaier]], 4th century Hindu scholar [[VƒÅtsyƒÅyana]] explained dharma by contrasting it with adharma.&lt;ref name=klausk&gt;Klaus Klostermaier, A survey of Hinduism, SUNY Press, {{ISBN|0-88706-807-3}}, Chapter 3: &quot;Hindu dharma&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; VƒÅtsyƒÅyana suggested that dharma is not merely in one's actions, but also in words one speaks or writes, and in thought. According to VƒÅtsyƒÅyana:&lt;ref name=klausk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jha, Nyayasutras with Vatsyayana Bhasya, 2 vols, Oriental Books (1939).&lt;/ref&gt;

# Adharma of body: hinsa (violence), steya (steal, theft), pratisiddha maithuna (sexual indulgence with someone other than one's partner)
# Dharma of body: dana (charity), paritrana (succor of the distressed) and paricarana (rendering service to others)
# Adharma from words one speaks or writes: mithya (falsehood), parusa (caustic talk), sucana (calumny) and asambaddha (absurd talk)
# Dharma from words one speaks or writes: satya (truth and facts), hitavacana (talking with good intention), priyavacana (gentle, kind talk), svadhyaya (self study)
# Adharma of mind: paradroha (ill will to anyone), paradravyabhipsa (covetousness), nastikya (denial of the existence of morals and religiosity)
# Dharma of mind: daya (compassion), asprha (disinterestedness), and sraddha (faith in others)

===According to Patanjali Yoga===

In the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|''Yoga Sutras'' of Patanjali]] the dharma is real; in the Vedanta it is unreal.&lt;ref name=&quot;The yoga-system of Patanjali&quot;&gt;[https://archive.org/details/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft The yoga-system of Patanjali] The ancient Hindu doctrine of concentration of mind, embracing the mnemonic rules, called Yoga-sutras, James Haughton Woods (1914), Harvard University Press {{page needed|date=December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Dharma is part of [[yoga]], suggests Patanjali; the elements of Hindu dharma are the attributes, qualities and aspects of yoga.&lt;ref name=&quot;The yoga-system of Patanjali&quot;/&gt; Patanjali explained dharma in two categories: ''[[yamas]]'' (restraints) and ''[[niyama]]s'' (observances).&lt;ref name=klausk/&gt;

The five yamas, according to Patanjali, are: abstain from injury to all living creatures, abstain from falsehood (satya), abstain from unauthorised appropriation of things-of-value from another (acastrapurvaka), abstain from coveting or sexually cheating on your partner, and abstain from expecting or accepting gifts from others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft The yoga-system of Patanjali] Yoga-sutras, James Haughton Woods (1914), Harvard University Press, pp. 178‚Äì180.&lt;/ref&gt; The five yama apply in action, speech and mind. In explaining yama, Patanjali clarifies that certain professions and situations may require qualification in conduct. For example, a fisherman must injure a fish, but he must attempt to do this with least trauma to fish and the fisherman must try to injure no other creature as he fishes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft The yoga-system of Patanjali] Yoga-sutras, James Haughton Woods (1914), Harvard University Press, pp. 180‚Äì181.&lt;/ref&gt;

The five niyamas (observances) are cleanliness by eating pure food and removing impure thoughts (such as arrogance or jealousy or pride), contentment in one's means, meditation and silent reflection regardless of circumstances one faces, study and pursuit of historic knowledge, and devotion of all actions to the Supreme Teacher to achieve perfection of concentration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft The yoga-system of Patanjali] Yoga-sutras, James Haughton Woods (1914), Harvard University Press, pp. 181‚Äì191.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources===
Dharma is an empirical and experiential inquiry for every man and woman, according to some texts of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=paulhacker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kumarila, Tantravarttika, Anandasramasamskrtagranthavalih, Vol. 97, pp. 204‚Äì205; For an English Translation, see Jha (1924), Bibliotheca Indica, Vol. 161, Vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Apastamba|Apastamba Dharmasutra]] states:

{{quote| ''Dharma'' and ''Adharma'' do not go around saying, &quot;That is us.&quot; Neither do gods, nor gandharvas, nor ancestors declare what is ''Dharma'' and what is ''Adharma''.| ''Apastamba Dharmasutra''&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Olivelle|Olivelle, Patrick]]. ''Dharmas≈´tras: The Law Codes of Ancient India''. Oxford World Classics, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other texts, three sources and means to discover dharma in Hinduism are described. These, according to [[:de:Paul Hacker|Paul Hacker]], are:&lt;ref name=ph79/&gt; First, learning historical knowledge such as Vedas, Upanishads, the Epics and other Sanskrit literature with the help of one's teacher. Second, observing the behavior and example of good people. The third source applies when neither one's education nor example exemplary conduct is known. In this case, &quot;[[atmatusti]]&quot; is the source of dharma in Hinduism, that is the good person reflects and follows what satisfies his heart, his own inner feeling, what he feels driven to.&lt;ref name=ph79&gt;Paul Hacker (1965), &quot;Dharma in Hinduism&quot;, ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', Volume 34, Issue 5, pp. 487‚Äì489 (English translated version by Donald R. Davis (2006)).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dharma, life stages and social stratification===
{{main|Ashrama (stage)|Puru·π£ƒÅrtha|l1=ƒÄ≈õrama}}
Some texts of Hinduism outline ''dharma'' for society and at the individual level. Of these, the most cited one is ''[[Manusmriti]]'', which describes the four ''Varnas'', their rights and duties.&lt;ref name=alfh&gt;[[Alf Hiltebeitel]] (2011), ''Dharma: Its Early History in Law, Religion, and Narrative'', {{ISBN|978-0195394238}}, Oxford University Press, pp. 215‚Äì227.&lt;/ref&gt; Most texts of Hinduism, however, discuss ''dharma'' with no mention of ''Varna'' ([[Caste system in India|caste]]).&lt;ref&gt;Thapar, R. (1995), The first millennium BC in northern India, Recent perspectives of early Indian history, 80‚Äì141.&lt;/ref&gt; Other dharma texts and Smritis differ from Manusmriti on the nature and structure of Varnas.&lt;ref name=alfh/&gt; Yet, other texts question the very existence of varna. [[Bhrigu]], in the Epics, for example, presents the theory that dharma does not require any varnas.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas R. Trautmann (1964), &quot;On the Translation of the Term Varna&quot;, ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient'', Vol. 7, No. 2 (Jul., 1964), pp. 196‚Äì201.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, medieval India is widely believed to be a socially stratified society, with each social strata inheriting a profession and being endogamous. Varna was not absolute in Hindu dharma; individuals had the right to renounce and leave their Varna, as well as their [[Ashrama (stage)|asramas]] of life, in search of moksa.&lt;ref name=alfh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see:
* Van Buitenen, J. A. B. (1957). &quot;Dharma and Moksa&quot;. ''Philosophy East and West'', Volume 7, Number 1/2 (April ‚Äì July 1957), pp. 38‚Äì39
* Koller, J. M. (1972), &quot;Dharma: an expression of universal order&quot;, ''Philosophy East and West'', 22(2), pp. 131‚Äì144.&lt;/ref&gt; While neither Manusmriti nor succeeding Smritis of Hinduism ever use the word varnadharma (that is, the dharma of varnas), or varnasramadharma (that is, the dharma of varnas and asramas), the scholarly commentary on Manusmriti use these words, and thus associate dharma with varna system of India.&lt;ref name=alfh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kane, P.V. (1962), History of Dharmasastra (Ancient and Medieval Religious and Civil Law in India), Volume 1, pp. 2‚Äì10.&lt;/ref&gt; In 6th century India, even Buddhist kings called themselves &quot;protectors of varnasramadharma&quot; ‚Äì that is, dharma of varna and asramas of life.&lt;ref name=alfh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olivelle, P. (1993). ''The Asrama System: The history and hermeneutics of a religious institution'', New York: [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

At the individual level, some texts of Hinduism outline [[Ashrama (stage)|four ƒÅ≈õrama]]s, or stages of life as individual's dharma. These are:&lt;ref&gt;Alban G. Widgery, &quot;The Principles of Hindu Ethics&quot;, ''International Journal of Ethics'', Vol. 40, No. 2 (Jan., 1930), pp. 232‚Äì245.&lt;/ref&gt; (1) [[Brahmacharya|brahmacƒÅrya]], the life of preparation as a student, (2) [[Grihastha|g·πõhastha]], the life of the householder with family and other social roles, (3) [[Vanaprastha|vƒÅnprastha]] or aranyaka, the life of the forest-dweller, transitioning from worldly occupations to reflection and renunciation, and (4) [[sannyƒÅsa]], the life of giving away all property, becoming a recluse and devotion to moksa, spiritual matters.

The four stages of life complete the four human strivings in life, according to Hinduism.&lt;ref name=jkkpwg/&gt; Dharma enables the individual to satisfy the striving for stability and order, a life that is lawful and harmonious, the striving to do the right thing, be good, be virtuous, earn religious merit, be helpful to others, interact successfully with society. The other three strivings are [[Artha]] ‚Äì the striving for means of life such as food, shelter, power, security, material wealth, etc.; [[Kama]] ‚Äì the striving for sex, desire, pleasure, love, emotional fulfillment, etc.; and [[Moksa]] ‚Äì the striving for spiritual meaning, liberation from life-rebirth cycle, self-realisation in this life, etc. The four stages are neither independent nor exclusionary in Hindu dharma.&lt;ref name=jkkpwg&gt;see:

===Dharma and poverty===
Dharma  being necessary for individual and society, is dependent on poverty and prosperity in a society, according to Hindu dharma scriptures. For example, according to Adam Bowles,&lt;ref name=adambowles&gt;Adam Bowles (2007), Dharma, Disorder, and the Political in Ancient India, Brill's Indological Library (Book 28), {{ISBN|978-9004158153}}, Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] 11.1.6.24 links social prosperity and ''dharma'' through water. Waters come from rains, it claims; when rains are abundant there is prosperity on the earth, and this prosperity enables people to follow Dharma ‚Äì moral and lawful life. In times of distress, of drought, of poverty, everything suffers including relations between human beings and the human ability to live according to dharma.&lt;ref name=adambowles/&gt;

In Rajadharmaparvan 91.34-8, the relationship between poverty and dharma reaches a full circle. A land with less moral and lawful life suffers distress, and as distress rises it causes more immoral and unlawful life, which further increases distress.&lt;ref name=adambowles/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Derrett, J. D. M. (1959), &quot;Bhu-bharana, bhu-palana, bhu-bhojana: an Indian conundrum&quot;, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, 22, pp. 108‚Äì123.&lt;/ref&gt; Those in power must follow the raja dharma (that is, dharma of rulers), because this enables the society and the individual to follow dharma and achieve prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Gonda]], &quot;Ancient Indian Kingship from the Religious Point of View&quot;, ''Numen'', Vol. 3, Issue 1 (Jan., 1956), pp. 36‚Äì71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dharma and law===
{{main|Hindu law}}
The notion of ''dharma'' as duty or propriety is found in India's ancient legal and religious texts. In Hindu philosophy, justice, social harmony, and happiness requires that people live per dharma. The [[Dharmashastra]] is a record of these guidelines and rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=G√§chter|first=Othmar|title=Anthropos|journal=Anthropos Institute|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The available evidence suggest India once had a large collection of dharma related literature (sutras, shastras); four of the sutras survive and these are now referred to as Dharmasutras.&lt;ref name=polivelle/&gt; Along with laws of Manu in Dharmasutras, exist parallel and different compendium of laws, such as the laws of Narada and other ancient scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Davis, Jr., &quot;A Realist View of Hindu Law&quot;, ''Ratio Juris''. Vol. 19 No. 3 September 2006, pp. 287‚Äì313.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lariviere, Richard W. (2003), The Naradasmrti, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass&lt;/ref&gt; These different and conflicting law books are neither exclusive, nor do they supersede other sources of dharma in Hinduism. These Dharmasutras include instructions on education of the young, their rites of passage, customs, religious rites and rituals, marital rights and obligations, death and ancestral rites, laws and administration of justice, crimes, punishments, rules and types of evidence, duties of a king, as well as morality.&lt;ref name=polivelle&gt;Patrick Olivelle (1999), ''The Dharmasutras: The law codes of ancient India'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-283882-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{anchor|Buddhism}}
{{Buddhism}}
In Buddhism ''dharma'' means cosmic law and order,&lt;ref name=&quot;ODWR-Dharma&quot; /&gt; but is also applied to the teachings of the Buddha.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODWR-Dharma&quot; /&gt; In [[Buddhist philosophy]], ''dhamma/dharma'' is also the term for &quot;[[phenomena]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;david&quot;/&gt; In East Asia, the translation for dharma is [[wiktionary:Ê≥ï|Ê≥ï]], pronounced ''f«é'' in Mandarin, ''choe ‡ΩÜ‡Ωº‡Ω¶‡ºã'' in Tibetan, ''beop'' in Korean, ''h≈ç'' in Japanese, and ''ph√°p'' in Vietnamese. However, the term dharma can also be transliterated from its original form.

===Buddha's teachings===
&lt;!--&quot;Sacca-kiriya&quot; links here. Please adjust link there if this section is removed or renamed. Thanks.--&gt;
For practicing Buddhists, references to &quot;dharma&quot; (''dhamma'' in Pali) particularly as &quot;the Dharma&quot;, generally means the teachings of the Buddha, commonly known throughout the East as Buddha-Dharma. It includes especially the discourses on the fundamental principles (such as the [[Four Noble Truths]] and the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]), as opposed to the parables and to the poems.

The status of Dharma is regarded variably by different Buddhist traditions. Some regard it as an ultimate truth, or as the fount of all things which lie beyond the &quot;[[three realms]]&quot; (Sanskrit: ''tridhatu'') and the &quot;wheel of becoming&quot; (Sanskrit: ''[[bhavachakra]]''), somewhat like the pagan Greek and Christian [[logos]]: this is known as ''[[Dharmakaya]]'' (Sanskrit). Others, who regard the Buddha as simply an enlightened human being, see the Dharma as the [[essence]] of the &quot;84,000 different aspects of the teaching&quot; (Tibetan: ''chos-sgo brgyad-khri bzhi strong'') that the Buddha gave to various types of people, based upon their individual propensities and capabilities.

Dharma refers not only to the sayings of the Buddha, but also to the later traditions of interpretation and addition that the various [[schools of Buddhism]] have developed to help explain and to expand upon the Buddha's teachings. For others still, they see the Dharma as referring to the &quot;truth&quot;, or the ultimate reality of &quot;the way that things really are&quot; (Tibetan: ''Cho'').

The Dharma is one of the [[Three Jewels]] of Buddhism in which practitioners of Buddhism seek refuge, or that upon which one relies for his or her lasting happiness. The Three Jewels of Buddhism are the [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], meaning the mind's perfection of enlightenment, the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]], meaning the teachings and the methods of the Buddha, and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], meaning the monastic community who provide guidance and support to followers of the Buddha.

===Chan Buddhism===
Dharma is employed in [[Ch'an]] in a specific context in relation to transmission of authentic doctrine, understanding and bodhi; recognised in [[Dharma transmission]].

==Jainism==
{{Main|Dharma (Jainism)}}
[[File:Jain Prateek Chihna-modif.svg|thumb|140px|Jainism]]

The word Dharma in Jainism is found in all its key texts. It has a contextual meaning and refers to a number of ideas. In the broadest sense, it means the teachings of the Jinas,&lt;ref name=&quot;ODWR-Dharma&quot; /&gt; or teachings of any competing spiritual school,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John E. |last=Cort|title=Jains in the World: Religious Values and Ideology in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PZk-4HOMzsoC&amp;pg=PA192 |year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803037-9|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; a supreme path,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter B.

The major [[Jain text]], ''Tattvartha Sutra'' mentions ''Das-dharma'' with the meaning of &quot;ten righteous virtues&quot;. These are forbearance, modesty, straightforwardness, purity, truthfulness, self-restraint, austerity, renunciation, non-attachment, and celibacy.{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=128}} AcƒÅrya Am·πõtacandra, author of the Jain text, ''Puru·π£ƒÅrthasiddhyupƒÅya'' writes:{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=22}}
{{quote|A right believer should constantly meditate on virtues of dharma, like supreme modesty, in order to protect the soul from all contrary dispositions. He should also cover up the shortcomings of others.|''Puru·π£ƒÅrthasiddhyupƒÅya'' (27)}}

===Dharmastikaay (Dravya)===
The term ''dharmastikaay'' also has a specific [[ontology|ontological]] and soteriological meaning in Jainism, as a part of its theory of six [[dravya (Jainism)|dravya]] (substance or a reality). In the Jain tradition, existence consists of ''jiva'' (soul, atman) and ''ajiva'' (non-soul), the latter consisting of five categories: inert non-sentient atomic matter (pudgalastikaay), space (akasha), time (kala), principle of motion (dharmastikaay), and principle of rest (adharmastikaay).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John E. |last=Cort|title=Open Boundaries: Jain Communities and Cultures in Indian History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WWfnXbVWjKcC |year=1998|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-3786-5|pages=10‚Äì11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dundas2003p93&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas|authorlink=Paul Dundas|title=The Jains|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93 |year=2003|edition=2|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415266055|pages=93‚Äì95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term ''dharmastikaay'' to mean motion and to refer to an ontological sub-category is peculiar to Jainism, and not found in the metaphysics of Buddhism and various schools of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dundas2003p93&quot;/&gt;

==Sikhism==
[[File:Khanda Orange.jpg|thumb|140px|Sikhism]]
{{main|Sikhism}}
For [[Sikh]]s, the word ''dharam'' ({{lang-pan|‡®ß‡®∞‡®Æ|dharam}}) means the path of righteousness and proper religious practice.&lt;ref name=rinehart138&gt;Rinehart, Robin (2014), in Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech (Editors), ''The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies'', {{ISBN|978-0199699308}}, [[Oxford University Press]], pp. 138‚Äì139.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guru Granth Sahib]] in hymn 1353 connotes dharma as duty.&lt;ref&gt;W. Owen Cole (2014), in Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech (Editors), ''The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies'', {{ISBN|978-0199699308}}, Oxford University Press, pp. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[3HO]] movement in Western culture, which has incorporated certain Sikh beliefs, defines Sikh Dharma broadly as all that constitutes religion, moral duty and way of life.&lt;ref&gt;Verne Dusenbery (2014), in Pashaura Singh and Louis E. Fenech (Editors), ''The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies'', {{ISBN|978-0199699308}}, Oxford University Press, pp. 560‚Äì568.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dharma in symbols==
[[File:Flag of India.svg|thumb|200px|The wheel in the centre of India's flag symbolises Dharma.]]
The importance of ''dharma'' to Indian sentiments is illustrated by India's decision in 1947 to include the [[Ashoka Chakra]], a depiction of the ''[[dharmachakra]]'' ( the &quot;wheel of dharma&quot;),  as the central motif on its flag.&lt;ref&gt;Narula, S. (2006), ''International Journal of Constitutional Law'', 4(4), pp. 741‚Äì751.&lt;/ref&gt;
