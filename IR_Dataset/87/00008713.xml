==Career==

===Early work in outliners===
In 1979 Dave Winer became an employee of [[Personal Software]], where he worked on his own product idea named VisiText, which was his first attempt to build a commercial product around an &quot;expand and collapse&quot; outline display&lt;ref name=apple-bluff&gt;{{Cite news | last = Swaine | first = Michael | title = Calling Apple's Bluff | work = Dr. Dobb's | accessdate = 2009-06-08 | date = 1991-09-01 | url = http://www.ddj.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=184408623 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and which ultimately established [[outliner]]s as a software product. In 1981 he left the company and founded [[Living Videotext]] to develop this still-unfinished product. The company was based in [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], [[California|CA]], and grew to more than 50 employees.&lt;ref name=apple-bluff /&gt;

ThinkTank, which was based on VisiText, was released in 1983 for [[Apple II series|Apple II]] and was promoted as an &quot;idea processor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In 1987, at the height of the company's success, Winer sold [[Living Videotext]] to [[NortonLifeLock|Symantec]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|  last = Dyson| first = Esther| title = Critical Mass| work = Release 1.0| date = 1987-07-09| accessdate = 2009-06-08| url = http://downloads.oreilly.com/radar/r1/07-87.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; for an undisclosed but substantial transfer of stock&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Software Units Plan to Merge | work = New York Times | accessdate = 2009-06-04 | date = 1987-07-09 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/09/business/company-news-software-units-plan-to-merge.html?pagewanted=print }}&lt;/ref&gt; that &quot;made his fortune.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;borsook&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 1052-0341| volume = 8| issue = 11| pages = 102–108| last = Borsook| first = Paulina|authorlink=Paulina Borsook | title = Keeping the faith| journal = Upside| date = November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winer continued to work at Symantec's Living Videotext division, but after six months he left the company in pursuit of other challenges.&lt;ref name=apple-bluff/&gt;

===Years at UserLand===
{{main|UserLand Software}}

Winer founded [[UserLand Software]] in 1988&lt;ref name=outliners-and-programming /&gt; and served as the company's CEO until 2002.

UserLand's original flagship product, [[Userland Software#Frontier|Frontier]], was a system-level [[scripting language|scripting]] environment for the [[Macintosh|Mac]],  Winer's pioneering weblog, ''Scripting News'', takes its name from this early interest. Frontier was an outliner-based scripting language, echoing Winer's longstanding interest in outliners and anticipating code-folding editors of the late 1990s.
Winer became interested in web publishing while helping automate the production process of the strikers' online newspaper during San Francisco's [[San Francisco newspaper strike of 1994|newspaper strike]] of November 1994,&lt;ref name=rosenbergEverything&gt;{{Cite book| edition = eBook| publisher = Crown| isbn = 978-0-307-45138-5| last = Rosenberg| first = Scott| title = Say Everything: How Blogging Began, What It's Becoming, and Why It Matters| chapter = The unedited voice of a person: '''Dave Winer'''| location = New York, NY, USA | date = 2009-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|50}} According to [[Newsweek]], through this experience, he &quot;revolutionized Net publishing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=50 For The Future |work=Newsweek |accessdate=2009-05-10 |date=1995-02-27 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/106555/output/print |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120905114914/http://www.newsweek.com/id/106555/output/print |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Winer subsequently shifted the company's focus to online publishing products, enthusiastically promoting and experimenting with these products while building his websites and developing new features. One of these products was [[Userland Software#Frontier|Frontier]]'s NewsPage Suite of 1997, which supported the publication of Winer's ''Scripting News'' and was adopted by a handful of users who &quot;began playing around with their own sites in the Scripting News vein.&quot;&lt;ref name=rosenbergEverything/&gt;{{rp|59}} These users included notably [[Chris Gulker]] and [[Jorn Barger]], who envisaged [[blog]]ging as a [[social networking service|networked]] practice among users of the software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| publisher = ACM| doi = 10.1145/1557914.1557962| isbn = 978-1-60558-486-7| pages = 279–288| last = Ammann| first = Rudolf| title = Jorn Barger, the NewsPage network and the emergence of the weblog community| booktitle = Proceedings of the 20th ACM conference on hypertext and hypermedia| location = Torino, Italy| accessdate = 2009-07-15| year = 2009| url = http://tawawa.org/ark/p/jorn-barger-community.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winer was named a Seybold Fellow in 1997, to assist the executives and editors that comprised the Seybold Institute in ensuring &quot;the highest quality and topicality&quot; in their educational program, the [[Seybold Seminars]]; the honour was bestowed for his &quot;pioneering work in web-based publishing systems.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Seybold Institute Staff | year = 1997 | title = The Seybold Institute, Seybold Fellows: Dave Winer | access-date = 17 March 2016 | url = http://www.seyboldseminars.com/News/fellows.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/19971018032643/http://www.seyboldseminars.com/News/fellows.html | archivedate=1997-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keen to enter the &quot;competitive arena of high-end Web development,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morgenstern |first=David |work=MacWeek |title=Frontier blazing Internet trail |accessdate=2010-05-31 |date=1998-06-26 |url=https://macweek.zdnet.com/1224-0627/nw_frontier.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001003104131/http://macweek.zdnet.com/1224-0627/nw_frontier.html |archivedate=October 3, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Winer then came to collaborate with [[Microsoft]] and jointly developed the [[XML-RPC]] protocol. This led to the creation of [[Simple Object Access Protocol|SOAP]], which he co-authored with [[Microsoft]]'s [[Don Box]], Bob Atkinson, and Mohsen Al-Ghosein.

In December 1997, acting on the desire to &quot;offer much more timely information,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Gillmor| first = Dan| title = Small portals prove that size matters| work = San Jose Mercury News| date = 1998-12-06| accessdate = 2010-07-20| url = http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/focus/DanGillmor19981206.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winer designed and implemented an [[XML]] syndication format for use on his ''Scripting News'' weblog,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tim.oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html?page=3 |title=Blogging and the Wisdom of Crowds |first=Tim|last=O'Reilly |publisher=O'Reilly and Associates |date=2005-09-30 |accessdate=2007-01-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518113913/http://tim.oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html?page=3 |archivedate=18 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scripting.com/davenet/1997/12/15/scriptingNewsInXML.html |title=Scripting News in XML |author='''Winer, Dave''' |date=1997-12-15 |publisher=[[Scripting News]] |accessdate=2006-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus making an early contribution to the [[history of web syndication technology]]. By December 2000, competing dialects of [[RSS]] included several varieties of [[Netscape]]'s RSS, Winer's RSS 0.92, and an [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]-based RSS 1.0. Winer continued to develop the branch of the RSS fork originating from RSS 0.92, releasing in 2002 a version called RSS 2.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/rss2.html|title=RSS 2.0 specification|author=|date=|work=w3.org|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winer's advocacy of web syndication in general and RSS 2.0 in particular convinced many news organizations to syndicate their news content in that format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Margaret | last=Kanes |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1032-993344.html	 |title=Old data update tool gains new converts	 |publisher=CNET News	 |date=March 20, 2003	 |accessdate=2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in early 2002 ''[[The New York Times]]'' entered an agreement with UserLand to syndicate many of their articles in RSS 2.0 format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=105317&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=593901 	 |title=NYTimes.com Expands Its RSS Feeds to 27 Categories	 |work=The New York Times(press release)	 |date=July 20, 2004	 |accessdate=2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winer resisted calls by technologists to have the shortcomings of RSS 2.0 improved. Instead, he froze the format and turned its ownership over to [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Festa| first = Paul| title = Dispute exposes bitter power struggle behind Web logs| work = CNET News| date = 2003-08-04| url = http://news.cnet.com/Battle-of-the-blog/2009-1032_3-5059006.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With products and services based on UserLand's [[Userland Software#Frontier|Frontier]] system, Winer became a leader in [[blog]]ging tools from 1999 onwards,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gillmor| first = Dan| title = We the Media: Grassroots Journalism by the People, for the People| chapter = The Read-Write Web| accessdate = 2010-05-31| year = 2004| chapterurl = http://authorama.com/we-the-media-3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a &quot;leading evangelist of weblogs.&quot;&lt;ref name=almost-famous /&gt;  In 2000 Winer developed the Outline Processor Markup Language [[OPML]], an [[XML]] format for [[Outline (summary)|outlines]], which originally served as the native file format for [[Radio UserLand]]'s [[outliner]] application and has since been adopted for other uses, the most common being to exchange lists of [[web feeds]] between web [[feed aggregator]]s. UserLand was the first to add an &quot;enclosure&quot; tag in its RSS, modifying its blog software and its aggregator so that bloggers could easily link to an audio file (see  [[podcast]]ing and [[history of podcasting]]).

In February 2002 Winer was named one of the &quot;Top Ten Technology Innovators&quot; by [[InfoWorld]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Udell| first = Jon| title = Top ten technology innovators: Dave Winer| work = Infoworld| accessdate = 2009-05-13| date = 2002-02-27| url = http://www.infoworld.com/articles/fe/xml/02/03/04/020304fewiner.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041104022339/http://www.infoworld.com/articles/fe/xml/02/03/04/020304fewiner.html |archivedate = 2004-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2002 Winer underwent life-saving [[coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass surgery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=And the winner is ...|first= Steve |last=Gillmor|date= January 3, 2003|accessdate=May 2, 2012 |url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/2682495/operating-systems/and-the-winner-is----.html|work=InfoWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt; to prevent a heart attack and as a consequence stepped down as CEO of [[UserLand Software|UserLand]] shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = '''Winer, Dave''' | title = An untold story of UserLand | work = Scripting News | accessdate = 2008-08-08 | date = 2007-03-12 | url = http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/03/12/anUntoldStoryOfUserland.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained the firm's majority shareholder, however, and claimed personal ownership of [[Weblogs.com]].

==Projects and activities==

===24 Hours of Democracy===
In February 1996, while working as a columnist for [[HotWired]], Winer organized [https://web.archive.org/web/20090222062109/http://www.scripting.com/twentyFour/ 24 Hours of Democracy], an online protest against the recently passed [[Communications Decency Act]]. As part of the protest, over 1,000 people, among them [[Microsoft]] chairman [[Bill Gates]], posted essays to the Web on the subject of [[democracy]], [[civil liberty]] and [[freedom of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Winer's weblogging product, [[Radio Userland]], the program favored by [[Adam Curry|Curry]], had a built-in aggregator and thus provided both the &quot;send&quot; and &quot;receive&quot; components of what was then called [[Podcast|audioblogging]].&lt;ref&gt;Curry, Adam, 2002-10-21 ''UserNum 1014: [http://radio.weblogs.com/0001014/2002/10/21.html#a2427 Cool to hear my own audio-blog...] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302043755/http://radio.weblogs.com/0001014/2002/10/21.html#a2427#a2427 |date=2009-03-02 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilchrist, Harold 2002-10-27 ''Audioblog/Mobileblogging News [http://radio.weblogs.com/0100368/2002/10/27.html this morning I'm experimenting with producing an audioblogging show...] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302043822/http://radio.weblogs.com/0100368/2002/10/27.html |date=2009-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2003 Winer challenged other aggregator developers to provide support for enclosures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = '''Winer, Dave''' | title = How to support enclosures in aggregators | work = RSS 2.0 at Harvard Law | accessdate = 2009-06-12 | date = 2003-07-18 | url = http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/enclosuresAggregators.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2003, [[Kevin Marks]] demonstrated a script to download RSS enclosures and pass them to [[iTunes]] for transfer to an [[iPod]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Marks | first = Kevin | title = Bloggercon live video | work = Epeus' epigone | accessdate = 2009-06-12 | date = 2003-10-04 | url = http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003/10/bloggercon-live-video.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Curry then offered an RSS-to-iPod script&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Curry | first = Adam | title = RSS2iPod | work = Adam Curry's Weblog | accessdate = 2009-06-12 | date = 2003-10-12 | url = http://radio.weblogs.com/0001014/2003/10/12.html#a4604 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090222185407/http://radio.weblogs.com/0001014/2003/10/12.html#a4604#a4604 | archive-date = 2009-02-22 | url-status=dead | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; that moved [[MP3]] files from [[Radio UserLand]] to [[iTunes]].

The [[podcast]]ing-related web site audio.weblogs.com was also included in the $2.3 million deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Naraine

===Share your OPML===
Winer opened his self-described &quot;commons for sharing outlines, feeds, and taxonomy&quot; in May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Arrington| first = Michael

===Rebooting the News===
Since 2009, Winer has collaborated with [[New York University]]'s associate professor of journalism [[Jay Rosen]] on ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121112450/http://rebootnews.com/ Rebooting the News]'', a weekly [[podcast]] on technology and innovation in journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Windsor| first = Tim| title = Rebooting The News: Dave Winer and Jay Rosen on saving journalism| work = » Nieman Journalism Lab| accessdate = 2011-01-22| date = 2009-04-20| url = http://www.niemanlab.org/2009/04/rebooting-the-news-dave-winer-and-jay-rosen-talk-about-saving-journalism/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced on July 1, 2011 that the show would be on break, as NYU itself was, from June to September. However, no new episodes have been released since, making show #94 released on May 23, 2011 the last.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Rosen| first = Jay| title = We’re on summer break for a bit| work = » Rebooting the News| accessdate = 2012-12-01| date = 2011-07-01| url = http://rebootnews.wordpress.com/2011/07/01/were-on-summer-break-for-a-bit/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
