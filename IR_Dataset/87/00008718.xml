He graduated from [[Whitman College]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitman.edu/content/alumni/connected/alumniindweb|title=Alumni Individual Web Sites|website=[[Whitman College]]|accessdate=May 10, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611192237/http://www.whitman.edu/content/alumni/connected/alumniindweb|archivedate=June 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Benedict allegedly chose his stage name from a serving of [[Eggs Benedict]] he had prior to his acting career. He is of German extraction.

==Career==
[[File:Chopper One cast 1974.JPG|thumb|Photo of the cast of the short-lived television program ''[[Chopper One]]''. From left: Dirk Benedict, [[Ted Hartley]], [[Jim McMullan]].]]

Benedict's film debut was in the 1972 film ''[[Georgia, Georgia]]''. When the New York run for ''[[Butterflies Are Free]]'' ended, he received an offer to repeat his performance in [[Hawaii]], opposite [[Barbara Rush]]. While there, he appeared as a guest lead on ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]''. The producers of a horror film called ''[[Sssssss]]'' (1973) saw Benedict's performance in ''Hawaii Five-O'' and promptly cast him as the lead in that movie. He next played the psychotic wife-beating husband of [[Twiggy]] in her American film debut, ''[[W (1974 film)|W]]'' (1974). Benedict starred in the television series ''[[Chopper One]]'', which aired for one season in 1974. He made two appearances in ''[[Charlie's Angels]]''. He also appeared on the &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot; variety show.

Benedict's career break came in 1978 when he appeared as [[Lieutenant Starbuck]] in the movie and television series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''. The same year Benedict starred in the TV movie ''Cruise Into Terror'', and appeared in the ensemble movie ''[[Scavenger Hunt]]'' the following year.

===1980s and 1990s===
In 1980, Benedict starred alongside [[Linda Blair]] in an action-comedy movie called ''[[Ruckus (film)|Ruckus]]''. In 1983, Dirk gained further popularity as con-man Lieutenant Templeton &quot;Face&quot; Peck in 1980s action television series ''[[The A-Team]]''. He played &quot;Faceman&quot; from {{start date|1982}} to {{end date|1986}}, although the series didn't air until January 1983, and the final episode wasn't shown until 1987 rebroadcasts. The [[List of The A-Team episodes#Season 2: 1983–1984|second season]] episode &quot;Steel&quot; includes a scene at [[Universal Studios]] where Face is seen looking bemused as a [[Cylon (1978)|Cylon]] walks by him as an in-joke to his previous role in ''Battlestar Galactica''. The clip is incorporated into the series' opening credit sequence from season 3 onward.

In 1986, Benedict starred as low-life band manager Harry Smilac in the movie ''[[Body Slam (film)|Body Slam]]'' along with [[Lou Albano]], [[Roddy Piper]], and cameo appearances by [[Freddie Blassie]], [[Ric Flair]], and [[Bruno Sammartino]]. His character Smilac ends up managing the pro-wrestler &quot;Quick Rick&quot; Roberts (Piper) and faces opposition by Captain Lou and his wrestling tag-team &quot;[[The Wild Samoans|the Cannibals]]&quot;.

In 1987, Benedict took the title role of Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'' at the [[Classic Stage Company|Abbey Theatre]] in Manhattan. Both his performance and the entire production were lambasted by critics.&lt;ref&gt;Brucker, D.J.R. [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/22/theater/the-stage-hamlet.html &quot;The Stage: Hamlet&quot;], ''The New York Times'', September 22, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Benedict starred in the 1989 TV movie ''Trenchcoat in Paradise''.

In 1991, Benedict starred in ''[[Blue Tornado (film)|Blue Tornado]],'' playing Alex, [[call sign]] Fireball, an [[Italian Air Force]] [[fighter pilot]]. Benedict published an autobiography, ''Confessions of a Kamikaze Cowboy: A True Story of Discovery, Acting, Health, Illness, Recovery, and Life'' ([[Avery Publishing]] {{ISBN|0895294796}}). In 1993, Benedict starred in ''[[Shadow Force (film)|Shadow Force]]''.

Benedict also appeared as Jake Barnes in the 1996 action-adventure film ''[[Alaska (1996 film)|Alaska]]''.

===2000s and 2010s===
In 2000, Benedict wrote and directed his first screenplay, [[Cahoots (film)|''Cahoots'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/244091/Cahoots/overview|title=Cahoots|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 10, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908015459/https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/244091/Cahoots/overview|archivedate=September 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benedict appeared in the 2006 German film ''[[Goldene Zeiten]]'' (&quot;Golden Times&quot;) in a dual role, playing an American former TV star as well as a German lookalike who impersonates him.

In 2006, he wrote an online essay criticizing the then-airing ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' re-imagined series and, especially, its casting of a woman as his character, Starbuck, writing that &quot;the war against masculinity has been won&quot; and that &quot;a television show based on hope, spiritual faith, and family is unimagined and regurgitated as a show of despair, sexual violence and family dysfunction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benedict|first1=Dirk|url=http://www.dirkbenedictcentral.com/home/articles-readarticle.php?nid=5|title=Lost in Castration|website=Dirk Benedict Central|date=May 2004|accessdate=February 7, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220100737/http://www.dirkbenedictcentral.com/home/articles-readarticle.php?nid=5|archive-date=December 20, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He appeared as a contestant on the 2007 [[U.K.]] series of ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 5 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother]]''. He arrived on launch night in a replica of the [[The A-Team#GMC van|''A-Team'' van]], smoking a cigar and accompanied by the [[The A-Team#Theme song and soundtrack|''A-Team'' theme tune]].

In 2010, Benedict starred in a stage production of ''[[Columbo#Development and character profile|Prescription: Murder]]'' playing [[Columbo (character)|Lieutenant Columbo]] for the [[Middle Ground Theatre Company]] in the UK. Benedict also made a [[cameo appearance]] in the [[The A-Team (film)|2010 film adaptation]] of ''The A-Team'' as Pensacola Prisoner Milt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dirkbenedictcentral.com/home/headline-readarticle.php?nid=45| title=&quot;Prescription:Murder&quot; and &quot;The A-Team&quot;| website=Dirk Benedict Central| accessdate=May 22, 2012| date=November 23, 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921002524/http://dirkbenedictcentral.com/home/headline-readarticle.php?nid=45| archive-date=September 21, 2010| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, Benedict took on the role of Jack Strange in the B movie [[Space Ninjas]] written and directed by Scott McQuaid. Dirk plays an eccentric T.V. host of a show called 'Stranger Than Fiction', which is like a hybrid of the Twilight Zone and the X-Files. The movie is a sci-fi, comedy, horror that follows a bunch of high school students trying to survive the night from a Space Ninja invasion.

==Personal life==
In the 1970s, Benedict survived a prostate [[tumor]] believed to have been [[prostate cancer|cancerous]]. Having rejected conventional medical treatment, he credited his survival to the adoption of a [[macrobiotic diet]] recommended to him by actress [[Gloria Swanson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| last=Benedict |first=Dirk |url=http://people.com/archive/an-a-team-stars-toughest-battle-against-the-specter-of-cancer-is-waged-in-secret-and-alone-vol-20-no-15/| title=An A-Team Star's Toughest Battle—Against the Specter of Cancer—is Waged in Secret and Alone |work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=July 2, 2014 |accessdate=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1986, he married [[Toni Hudson]], an actress with whom he has two sons, George and Roland.  Hudson had previously appeared as Dana in the fourth season ''A-Team'' episode titled &quot;Blood, Sweat and Cheers&quot;. They divorced in 1995. In 1998, Benedict learned that he also has another son, John Talbert (born 1968), from an earlier relationship, who had been placed for adoption. With the help of his adoptive parents, Talbert discovered and contacted his birth parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.parade.com/features/070501-youramerica-adoption2.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504012228/http://www.parade.com/features/070501-youramerica-adoption2.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-05-04 |title=Adopted and Searching for Answers |work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]] |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
