==Etymology and meaning==
''Duḥkha'' (Sanskrit; Pali ''dukkha'') is a term found in ancient Indian literature, meaning anything that is &quot;uneasy, uncomfortable, unpleasant, difficult, causing pain or sadness&quot;.{{Sfn|Monier-Williams|1899|p=483}}&lt;ref name=rhysdavids324&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas William Rhys Davids|author2=William Stede|title=Pali-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Guw2CnxiucC&amp;pg=PA324|year=1921|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1144-7|pages=324–325}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a concept in Indian religions about the nature of life that innately includes the &quot;unpleasant&quot;, &quot;suffering&quot;, &quot;pain&quot;, &quot;sorrow&quot;, &quot;distress&quot;, &quot;grief&quot; or &quot;misery.&quot;{{Sfn|Monier-Williams|1899|p=483}}&lt;ref name=rhysdavids324/&gt; The term ''duḥkha'' does not have a one-word English translation, and embodies diverse aspects of unpleasant human experiences.&lt;ref name=peterharvey26/&gt;&lt;ref name=rhysdavids324/&gt; It is opposed to the word ''[[sukha]]'', meaning &quot;happiness,&quot; &quot;comfort&quot; or &quot;ease.&quot;{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=Kindle Locations 542-550}}

The word is commonly explained as a derivation from Aryan terminology for an axle hole, referring to an axle hole which is not in the center and leads to a bumpy, uncomfortable ride. According to Winthrop Sargeant,{{quote|The ancient Aryans who brought the Sanskrit language to India were a nomadic, horse- and cattle-breeding people who travelled in horse- or ox-drawn vehicles. ''Su'' and ''dus'' are prefixes indicating good or bad. The word ''kha'', in later Sanskrit meaning &quot;sky,&quot; &quot;ether,&quot; or &quot;space,&quot; was originally the word for &quot;hole,&quot; particularly an axle hole of one of the Aryan's vehicles. Thus ''sukha'' … meant, originally, &quot;having a good axle hole,&quot; while ''duhkha'' meant &quot;having a poor axle hole,&quot; leading to discomfort.{{sfn|Sargeant|2009|p=303}}}}

[[Joseph Goldstein (writer)|Joseph Goldstein]], American [[vipassana]] teacher and writer, explains the etymology as follows:
{{quote|The word ''dukkha'' is made up of the prefix ''du'' and the root ''kha''. ''Du'' means “bad” or “difficult.” ''Kha'' means “empty.” “Empty,” here, refers to several things—some specific, others more general. One of the specific meanings refers to the empty axle hole of a wheel. If the axle fits badly into the center hole, we get a very bumpy ride. This is a good analogy for our ride through [[saṃsāra]].{{sfn|Goldstein|2013|p=289}}}}

However, according to [[Monier Monier-Williams]], the actual roots of the [[Pali]] term [[wikt:dukkha|''dukkha'']] appear to be [[Sanskrit]] [[wikt:दुस्-|दुस्-]] (''dus-'', &quot;bad&quot;) + [[wikt:स्था|स्था]] (''stha'', &quot;to stand&quot;).{{Sfn|Monier-Williams|1899|p=483, entry note:&amp;nbsp;|ps=&quot;according to grammarians properly written ''dush-kha'' and said to be from ''dus'' and ''kha'' [cf. ''su-khá'']; but more probably a Prākritized form for duḥ-stha'', q.v.&quot;}}  Regular phonological changes in the development of Sanskrit into the various [[Prakrit]]s led to a shift from ''dus-sthā'' to ''duḥkha'' to ''dukkha''.

==Buddhism==
{{buddhism}}
Contemporary translators of Buddhist texts use a variety of English words to convey the aspects of ''duḥkha''. Early Western translators of Buddhist texts (before the 1970s) typically translated the Pali term ''dukkha'' as &quot;suffering.&quot; Later translators have emphasized that &quot;suffering&quot; is too limited a translation for the term duḥkha, and have preferred to either leave the term untranslated or to clarify that translation with terms such as anxiety, distress, frustration, unease, unsatisfactoriness, etc.{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=Kindle locations 524-528}}{{sfn|Prebish|1993}}{{sfn|Keown|2003}} Many contemporary teachers, scholars, and translators have used the term &quot;unsatisfactoriness&quot; to emphasize the subtlest aspects of dukkha.{{sfn|Dalai Lama|1998|p=38}}{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=61}}{{sfn|Smith|Novak|2009|loc=Kindle location 2769}}{{sfn|Keown|2000|loc=Kindle Locations 932-934}}{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2011|p=6}} Contemporary translators have used a variety of English words to translate the term ''duḥkha'',{{refn|group=note|Contemporary translators have used a variety of English words to translate the term ''duḥkha''; translators commonly use different words to translate aspects of the term. For example, ''duḥkha'' has been translated as follows in many contexts:
* Suffering (Harvey, Williams, Keown, Anderson, Gombrich, Thich Nhat Hanh, Ajahn Succito, Chogyam Trungpa, Rupert Gethin, Dalai Lama, ''et al.'')
* Pain (Harvey, Williams, Keown, Anderson, Huxter, Gombrich, et al)
* Unsatisfactoriness (Dalai Lama, Bhikkhu Bodhi, Rupert Gethin, ''et al.'')
* Stress [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]](&lt;ref&gt;https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn56/sn56.011.than.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.086.than.html bottom

* Frustration (Dalai Lama, ''Four Noble Truths'', p.&amp;nbsp;38)
* Misery
* Anxiety (Chogyam Trungpa, ''The Truth of Suffering'', pp.&amp;nbsp;8–10)
* Uneasiness (Chogyam Trungpa)
* Unease (Rupert Gethin)
* Unhappiness}}
and many translators prefer to leave the term untranslated.{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=Kindle Locations 542-550}}

Within the Buddhist sutras, duḥkha is divided in three categories:
* ''Dukkha-dukkha'', the duḥkha of painful experiences. This includes the physical and mental sufferings of [[Jāti (Buddhism)|birth]], [[Jarāmaraṇa|aging]], [[Byādhi (Buddhism)|illness]], [[Jarāmaraṇa|dying]]; distress from what is not desirable.
* ''Viparinama-dukkha'', the duḥkha of pleasant or happy experiences changing to unpleasant when the causes and conditions that produced the pleasant experiences cease.
* ''Sankhara-dukkha'', the duḥkha of conditioned experience. This includes &quot;a basic unsatisfactoriness pervading all existence, all forms of life, because all forms of life are changing, impermanent and without any inner core or substance.&quot;&lt;ref group=web name=bodhi1&gt;[http://www.beyondthenet.net/dhamma/fourNoble.htm ''The Four Noble Truths - By Bhikkhu Bodhi]&lt;/ref&gt; On this level, the term indicates a lack of satisfaction, a sense that things never measure up to our expectations or standards.

Various sutras sum up how life in this &quot;mundane world&quot; is regarded to be ''duḥkha'', starting with ''[[saṃsāra|samsara]]'', the ongoing process of death and rebirth itself:{{refn|group=note|name=&quot;PW&quot;|Paul Williams: &quot;All rebirth is due to karma and is impermanent. Short of attaining enlightenment, in each rebirth one is born and dies, to be reborn elsewhere in accordance with the completely impersonal causal nature of one's own karma. The endless cycle of birth, rebirth, and redeath, is samsara.&quot;{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=74-75}}}}
# [[Jāti (Buddhism)|Birth]] is duḥkha, [[Jarāmaraṇa|aging]] is duḥkha, [[Byādhi (Buddhism)|illness]] is duḥkha, [[Jarāmaraṇa|death]] is duḥkha; 
# Sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are duḥkha; 
# Association with the unbeloved is duḥkha; separation from the loved is duḥkha; 
# Not getting what is wanted is duḥkha. 
# In conclusion, the five [[skandhas|clinging-aggregates]] are duḥkha.

''Duḥkha'' is one of the [[three marks of existence]], namely ''duḥkha'' (&quot;suffering&quot;), ''[[anatman]]'' (not-self), ''[[anitya]]'' (&quot;impermanence&quot;).

The Buddhist tradition emphasizes the importance of developing insight into the nature of ''duḥkha'', the conditions that cause it, and how it can be overcome. This process is formulated in the teachings on the [[Four Noble Truths]].

==Hinduism==
In [[Hindu]] literature, the earliest [[Upanishads|Upani{{IAST|ṣ}}ads]] — the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|{{IAST|Bṛhadāraṇyaka}}]] and the [[Chandogya Upanishad|{{IAST|Chāndogya}}]] — in all likelihood predate the advent of Buddhism.{{refn|group=note|See, e.g., [[Patrick Olivelle]] (1996), ''Upani{{IAST|ṣ}}ads'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press), {{ISBN|978-0-19-283576-5}}, p. xxxvi: &quot;The scholarly consensus, well-founded I think, is that the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|{{IAST|Bṛhadāraṇyaka}}]] and the {{IAST|Chāndogya}} are the two earliest [[Upanishads|Upani{{IAST|ṣ}}ads]]....  The two texts as we have them are, in all likelihood, pre-Buddhist; placing them in the seventh to sixth centuries BCE may be reasonable, give or take a century or so.&quot;}}  In these scriptures of Hinduism, the Sanskrit word ''du{{IAST|ḥ}}kha'' (दुःख) appears in the sense of &quot;suffering, sorrow, distress&quot;, and in the context of a spiritual pursuit and liberation through the knowledge of [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul/self).&lt;ref name=olivellebu4414/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deussen1980p497&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author=Paul Deussen|title=Sixty Upaniṣads of the Veda, Vol. 1| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mSpQo9q-tIC&amp;pg=PR497| year=1980| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (Reprinted)| isbn=978-81-208-1468-4|pages=482–485, 497}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hume, [https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n281/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad], The Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, pages 261-262&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison of Buddhism and Hinduism==
Both Hinduism and Buddhism emphasize that one overcomes ''du{{IAST|ḥ}}kha'' through the development of understanding.{{refn|group=note|For a general discussion of the core Indian spiritual goal of developing transcendent &quot;seeing,&quot; see, e.g., Hamilton, Sue (2000/2001), ''Indian Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction'', (Oxford: Oxford U. Press), pp. 9-10, {{ISBN|978-0-19-285374-5}}.}} However, the two religions widely differ in the nature of that understanding. Hinduism emphasizes the understanding and acceptance of Atman (self, soul) and [[Brahman]], while Buddhism emphasizes the understanding and acceptance of [[Anatta]] (Anatman, non-self, non-soul) as each discusses the means to liberation from ''Duḥkha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Johannes Bronkhorst|title= Buddhist Teaching in India|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fjU6AwAAQBAJ|year=2009 |publisher=Wisdom Publications |isbn= 978-0-86171-811-5|pages= 23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvey2013p34&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=The Selfless Mind: Personality, Consciousness and Nirvana in Early Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfPcAAAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-78336-4|pages=34, 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;
