'''David Elieser Deutsch''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRS}}&lt;ref name=frs/&gt; ({{IPAc-en|d|ɔɪ|tʃ}}; born 18 May 1953)&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; is a British [[physicist]] at the [[University of Oxford]]. He is a Visiting Professor in the Department of Atomic and Laser Physics at the [[Centre for Quantum Computation]] (CQC) in the [[Clarendon Laboratory]] of the University of Oxford. He pioneered the field of [[quantum computation]] by formulating a description for a [[quantum Turing machine]], as well as specifying an algorithm designed to run on a quantum computer. &lt;ref name=Deutsch1985&gt;

In 2009, Deutsch expounded a new criterion for scientific explanation, which is to formulate invariants: 'State an explanation [publicly, so that it can be dated and verified by others later] that  remains invariant [in the face of apparent change, new information, or unexpected conditions]'.&lt;ref name=TED&gt;[https://www.ted.com/talks/david_deutsch_a_new_way_to_explain_explanation David Deutsch (October 2009) &quot;A new way to explain explanation&quot; ''TED talk'']

==Early life and education==
Deutsch was born in [[Haifa]] in Israel on 18 May 1953, the son of Oskar and Tikva Deutsch. David attended Geneva House school in Cricklewood (His parents owned and ran the Alma restaurant on Cricklewood broadway NW2.) followed by The William Ellis School in Highgate (then a voluntary aided school in north London) before reading [[Natural Sciences (Cambridge)|Natural Sciences]] at [[Clare College, Cambridge]] and taking [[Part III of the Mathematical Tripos]]. He went on to [[Wolfson College, Oxford]] for his doctorate in [[theoretical physics]]&lt;ref name=dphd&gt;{{cite thesis|first=David Elieser|last=Deutsch|url=http://solo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/OXVU1:LSCOP_OX:oxfaleph020621138|website=bodleian.ox.ac.uk|publisher=University of Oxford|year=1978|title=Boundary effects in quantum field theory|degree=DPhil|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.453518}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote his thesis on [[quantum field theory]] in [[curved space-time]]&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt;&lt;ref name=peach/&gt; supervised by [[Dennis Sciama]]&lt;ref name=mathgene/&gt; and [[Philip Candelas]].&lt;ref name=dphd/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Deutsch|first1=David|last2=Candelas|first2=Philip|year=1979|title=Boundary effects in quantum field theory|journal=Physical Review D|volume=20|issue=12|pages=3063–3080|doi=10.1103/physrevd.20.3063|via=|bibcode=1979PhRvD..20.3063D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and research==
His work on [[quantum algorithms]] began with a ground-breaking 1985 paper,&lt;ref name=Deutsch1985/&gt; later expanded in 1992 along with [[Richard Jozsa]] to produce the [[Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm]], one of the first examples of a quantum algorithm that is exponentially faster than any possible deterministic classical algorithm. In his 1985 paper, &lt;ref name=Deutsch1985/&gt;, he also suggests the use of [[Entangled state|entangled states]] and [[Bell's theorem]] for [[quantum key distribution]].

Together with Chiara Marletto, he published a paper in December 2014 entitled ''Constructor theory of information'',&lt;ref name=DeutschMarletto2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deutsch|first1=D.|last2=Marletto|first2=C.|title=Constructor theory of information|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=471|issue=2174|year=2014|pages=20140540|issn=1364-5021|doi=10.1098/rspa.2014.0540|pmid=25663803|pmc=4309123 |arxiv=1405.5563|bibcode=2014RSPSA.47140540D}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; that conjectures that information can be expressed solely in terms of which transformations of physical systems are possible and which are impossible.

&lt;blockquote&gt;... laid the foundations of the quantum theory of computation, and has subsequently made or participated in many of the most important advances in the field, including the discovery of the first quantum algorithms, the theory of quantum logic gates and quantum computational networks, the first quantum error-correction scheme, and several fundamental quantum universality results. He has set the agenda for worldwide research efforts in this new, interdisciplinary field, made progress in understanding its philosophical implications (via a variant of the many-universes interpretation) and made it comprehensible to the general public, notably in his book The Fabric of Reality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1996, he appeared in the BBC ''[[Horizon (UK TV series)|Horizon]]'' programme.&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;{{IMDb name|id=2396284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Fabric of Reality''===
{{Main article|The Fabric of Reality}}

In his 1997 book ''The Fabric of Reality'', Deutsch details his &quot;Theory of Everything.&quot; It aims not at the reduction of everything to particle physics, but rather mutual support among [[multiversal]], computational, epistemological, and evolutionary principles. His theory of everything is somewhat [[emergence|emergentist]] rather than [[reductionism|reductive]]. There are four strands to his theory:

# [[Hugh Everett]]'s [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics|quantum physics]], &quot;the first and most important of the four strands.&quot;
# [[Karl Popper]]'s [[epistemology]], especially its anti-inductivism and requiring a [[scientific realism|realist]] (non-instrumental) interpretation of scientific theories, as well as its emphasis on taking seriously those bold conjectures that resist falsification.
# [[Alan Turing]]'s theory of computation, especially as developed in Deutsch's [[Turing principle]], in which the [[Universal Turing machine]] is replaced by Deutsch's [[universal quantum computer]]. (&quot;''The'' theory of computation is now the quantum theory of computation.&quot;)
# [[Richard Dawkins]]' refinement of [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] evolutionary theory and the [[Extended evolutionary synthesis|modern evolutionary synthesis]], especially the ideas of replicator and meme as they integrate with Popperian problem-solving (the [[epistemological]] strand).

===''The Beginning of Infinity''===
{{Main article|The Beginning of Infinity }}

Deutsch's second book, ''The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations that Transform the World'', was published on 31 March 2011. In this book, Deutsch views the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] of the 18th century as near the beginning of a potentially  unending sequence of purposeful knowledge creation. He examines the nature of [[meme]]s and how and why [[creativity]] evolved in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{TED speaker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards and honours===
''The Fabric of Reality'' was shortlisted for the [[Royal Society Prizes for Science Books|Rhone-Poulenc science book award]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.daviddeutsch.org.uk/books/the-fabric-of-reality/|title=The Fabric of Reality|last=Deutsch|first=David|website=daviddeutsch.org.uk|access-date=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Deutsch was awarded the [[Dirac Prize]] of the [[Institute of Physics]] in 1998,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.daviddeutsch.org.uk/about-me/|title=About Me|last=Deutsch|year=2016|first=David|website=daviddeutsch.org.uk|access-date=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Edge of Computation Science Prize in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/al/prizes.htm Edge of Computation Science Prize] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209230404/http://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/al/prizes.htm |date=9 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, he received the [[Dirac_Medal#Dirac_Medal_of_the_ICTP|Dirac Medal]] of the [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics|International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ictp.it/about-ictp/prizes-awards/the-dirac-medal/the-medallists/dirac-medallists-2017.aspx|title=Dirac Medal of ICTP 2017|website=www.ictp.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deutsch is related to [[Paul Dirac]] through his doctoral advisor Dennis Sciama, whose doctoral advisor was Dirac. Deutsch was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 2008|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2008]].&lt;ref name=frs&gt;{{cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/people/david-deutsch-11329/|website=royalsociety.org|publisher=[[Royal Society]]|location=London|author=Anon|year=2008|title=Professor David Deutsch FRS}} One or more of the preceding sentences incorporates text from the royalsociety.org website where: {{quote|“All text published under the heading 'Biography' on Fellow profile pages is available under [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License]].” --{{cite web |url=https://royalsociety.org/about-us/terms-conditions-policies/ |title=Royal Society Terms, conditions and policies |accessdate=2016-03-09 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111170346/https://royalsociety.org/about-us/terms-conditions-policies/ |archivedate=11 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Deutsch is an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celebatheists.com/wiki/David_Deutsch David Deutsch entry], Celeb atheists website, 30 March 2005. Accessed Jan 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a founding member of the parenting and educational method known as [[Taking Children Seriously]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.utne.com/mind-and-body/taking-children-seriously-tcs.aspx#axzz36G0RK12u|title=Taking Children Seriously: A new child-rearing movement believes parents should never coerce their kids|last=Friedman|first=Dawn|year=2003|website=UTNE Reader|publisher=Ogden Publications, Inc.|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
