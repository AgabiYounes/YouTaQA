'''Desiderio Alberto Arnaz y de Acha III''' (March 2, 1917 – December 2, 1986), better known as '''Desi Arnaz''',  was a Cuban-born American actor, musician, bandleader, comedian and film and television producer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his role as the witty [[Lucy and Ricky Ricardo|Ricky Ricardo]] on the American television series sitcom ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', where he co-starred with his then wife, dramatic and comedic actress [[Lucille Ball]] (1911–1989).&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot;/&gt; Arnaz and Ball are generally credited as the innovators of the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[rerun]], which they pioneered with the ''I Love Lucy'' series.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ent 20081009&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Desi Arnaz &amp; Lucille Ball: The Geniuses Who Shaped The Future Of Television|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/197550|magazine=Entrepreneur|accessdate=January 28, 2013|date=October 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnaz and Lucille Ball co-founded and ran the television production company called [[Desilu Productions]], originally to market ''I Love Lucy'' to television networks. After ''I Love Lucy'' ended, Arnaz went on to produce several other television series, at first with Desilu Productions, and later independently, including ''[[The Ann Sothern Show]]'' and ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]''. He was also renowned for leading his Latin music band, the Desi Arnaz Orchestra.

==Early life==
Arnaz was born Desiderio Alberto Arnaz y de Acha, III, in [[Santiago de Cuba]], Cuba,&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot;/&gt; to [[Desiderio Alberto Arnaz II|Desiderio Alberto Arnaz y de Alberni II]] (March 8, 1894 – May 31, 1973) and his wife Dolores de Acha (April 2, 1896 – October 24, 1988). His father was Santiago's youngest mayor and also served in the Cuban House of Representatives. His maternal grandfather was Alberto de Acha, an executive at rum producer [[Bacardi|Bacardi &amp; Co.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Gjelten, Tom 2008, p. 122&quot;&gt;Gjelten, Tom. ''Bacardi and the Long Fight for Cuba: The Biography of a Cause''. Viking Adult, 2008, p. 122 (footnote).&lt;!-- ISSN/ISSN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnaz describes the opulent family life of his early youth in his autobiography, ''A Book'' (1976)—the family owned three ranches, a palatial home, and a vacation mansion on a private island in Santiago Bay, Cuba. Following the [[Cuban Revolution of 1933]], led by [[Fulgencio Batista]], which overthrew President [[Gerardo Machado]], Alberto Arnaz was jailed and all of his property was confiscated. He was released after six months when his brother-in-law Alberto de Acha intervened on his behalf.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gjelten, Tom 2008, p. 122&quot;/&gt; The family then fled to [[Miami]], where Desi attended [[St. Patrick Catholic School (Miami Beach, Florida)|St. Patrick Catholic High School]]. In the summer of 1934, he attended [[Saint Leo University|Saint Leo Prep]]&lt;ref&gt;Horgan, James J. (1990). ''Pioneer College: The Centennial History of Saint Leo College, Saint Leo Abbey, and Holy Name Priory''. Saint Leo College Press. p. 463.&lt;/ref&gt; (near [[Tampa]]) to help improve his English.

==Professional career==

=== Acting career ===
When he moved to the United States, Desi Arnaz turned to show business to support himself. In 1939, he starred on Broadway in the musical ''[[Too Many Girls (musical)|Too Many Girls]]''. He went to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] the next year to appear in the show's movie version at [[RKO Pictures|RKO]], which starred [[Lucille Ball]]. Arnaz and Ball eloped on November 30, 1940. Arnaz also played guitar for [[Xavier Cugat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnaz&quot;/&gt;

Arnaz appeared in several movies in the 1940s such as ''[[Bataan (film)|Bataan]]'',  starring Robert Taylor (1943). Many consider his portrayal of the jive-loving California National Guardsman Felix Ramirez to be his best early role. He received his [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] notice, but before reporting, he injured his knee. He completed his recruit training, but was classified for limited service in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]]. He was assigned to direct [[United Service Organization]] (USO) programs at the [[Birmingham General Army Hospital]] in the [[San Fernando Valley]]. Discovering the first thing the wounded soldiers requested was a glass of cold milk, he arranged for movie starlets to meet them and pour the milk for them. Following his discharge from the Army on November 16, 1945, he formed another orchestra, which was successful in live appearances and recordings.&lt;ref&gt;Who's Who In Hollywood! By Terry Rowan, Desi Arnaz, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; He sang for troops in Birmingham Hospital with John Macchia and hired his childhood friend [[Marco Rizo]] to play piano and arrange for the orchestra. When he became successful in television, he kept the orchestra on his payroll, and Rizo arranged and orchestrated the music for ''[[I Love Lucy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Queens of Comedy: Lucille Ball, Phyllis Diller, Carol Burnett, Joan Rivers, and the New Generation of Funny Women|last=Horowitz|first=Susan|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1997|isbn=9782884492447|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Lucy desi 1957.JPG|thumb|upright|Lucille Ball and Arnaz, 1957]]
On October 15, 1951, Arnaz co-starred in the premiere of ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', in which he played a fictionalized version of himself, Cuban orchestra leader Enrique &quot;Ricky&quot; Ricardo. His co-star was his real-life wife, Lucille Ball, who played Ricky's wife, Lucy. Television executives had been pursuing Ball to adapt her very popular radio series ''[[My Favorite Husband]]'' for television. Ball insisted on Arnaz playing her on-air spouse so the two would be able to spend more time together. [[CBS]] wanted Ball's ''Husband'' co-star [[Richard Denning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Richard Denning |url=https://variety.com/1998/scene/people-news/richard-denning-1117882474/ |website=Variety |accessdate=2 March 2019 |language=en |date=21 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original premise was for the couple to portray Lucy and Larry Lopez, a successful show business couple whose glamorous careers interfered with their efforts to maintain a normal marriage. Market research indicated, however, that this scenario would not be popular, so [[Jess Oppenheimer]] changed it to make Ricky Ricardo a struggling young orchestra leader and Lucy an ordinary housewife who had show business fantasies but no talent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} The character name &quot;Larry Lopez&quot; was dropped because of a real-life bandleader named Vincent Lopez, and was replaced with &quot;Ricky Ricardo&quot;. Ricky often appeared at, and later owned, the Tropicana Club, which under his ownership he renamed Club Babalu.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Initially, the idea of having Ball and the distinctly Latin American Arnaz portray a married couple encountered resistance as they were told that Desi's Cuban accent and Latin style would not be agreeable to American viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;title=Sotomayor: More 'Splainin' to Do&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/allison-silver/sotomayer-more-splainin-t_b_236347.html|title=Sotomayor: More 'Splainin' to Do|accessdate=June 18, 2010|work=The Huffington Post|quote=CBS executives originally did not want Ball, a sassy redhead, married to a Latino on the program|first=Allison|last=Silver|date=July 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple overcame these objections, however, by touring together, during the summer of 1950, in a live [[vaudeville]] act they developed with the help of Spanish clown Pepito Pérez, together with Ball's radio show writers. Much of the material from their vaudeville act, including Lucy's memorable seal routine, was used in the pilot episode of ''I Love Lucy''. Segments of the pilot were recreated in the sixth episode of the show's first season.  During his time on the show, Arnaz and Ball became TV's most successful entrepreneurs.

=== Desilu Productions ===
{{Main|Desilu Productions}}
[[File:Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.jpg|thumb|left|Lucille Ball and Arnaz in Los Angeles, 1953]]
With Ball, Arnaz founded [[Desilu Productions]]. At that time, most television programs were broadcast live, and as the largest markets were in New York, the rest of the country received only [[kinescope]] images. [[Karl Freund]], Arnaz's cameraman, and even Arnaz himself have been credited with the development of the [[multiple-camera setup]] production style using adjacent sets in front of a live audience that became the standard for subsequent [[situation comedy|situation comedies]]. The use of film enabled every station around the country to broadcast high-quality images of the show. Arnaz was told that it would be impossible to allow an audience onto a [[sound stage]], but he worked with Freund to design a set that would accommodate an audience, allow filming, and adhere to fire and safety codes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}.  Due to the expense of 35mm film, Arnaz and Ball agreed to salary cuts.  In return they retained the rights to the films.  This was the basis for their invention of re-runs and syndicating TV shows (a huge source of new revenue). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date = 26 September 2016|first = Jeff |last = Saporito |url= http://screenprism.com/insights/article/how-did-i-love-lucy-invent-the-rerun|title=How did I Love Lucy invent the rerun and syndication? |website= ScreenPrism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to ''I Love Lucy'', he executive produced ''[[The Ann Sothern Show]]'' and ''[[Those Whiting Girls]]'' (starring [[Margaret Whiting]] and [[Barbara Whiting Smith]]), and was involved in several other series such as ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'', ''[[Whirlybirds]]'', and ''Sheriff of Cochise'' / ''United States Marshal''. He also produced the feature film ''[[Forever, Darling]]'' (1956), in which he and Ball starred. In the late 1950s, Arnaz proposed a [[Western (genre)|Western]] television series to his then neighbor, [[Victor Orsatti]], who formed a production company, Ror-Vic, in partnership with actor [[Rory Calhoun]]. Ror-Vic produced ''[[The Texan (TV series)|The Texan]]'', which aired on Monday evenings on CBS from 1958 to 1960. Episodes were budgeted at $40,000 each, with two [[black-and-white]] segments filmed weekly through [[Desilu Studios]]. Despite the name, the series was mostly in Pearl Flats in the [[Mojave Desert]] of [[Southern California]]. The program could have been renewed for a third season had Calhoun not desired to return to films.&lt;ref&gt;Billy Hathorn, &quot;Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967&quot;, ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 89 (2013), pp. 110–12&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Desilu company continued long after Arnaz's divorce from Ball and her subsequent marriage to [[Gary Morton]]. Desilu produced its own programs and provided facilities to other producers. Desilu produced ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. When Ball sold her share of Desilu to what became [[Paramount Television]], Arnaz went on to form his own production company from his share of Desilu. With the newly formed Desi Arnaz Productions, he made ''[[The Mothers-In-Law]]'' (at Desilu) for [[United Artists Television]] and [[NBC]]. This sitcom ran for two seasons from 1967 to 1969. Arnaz's company was succeeded-in-interest by the company now known as Desilu, Too. [[Desilu, Too]] and Lucille Ball Productions work hand-in-hand with [[MPI Home Video]] in the home video reissues of the Ball/Arnaz material not currently owned by CBS (successor-in-interest to Paramount Television, which in turn succeeded the original Desilu company). This material includes ''[[Here's Lucy]]'' and ''The Mothers-In-Law'', as well as many programs and specials Ball and Arnaz made independently of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KoABABSnX7oC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=%22she+set+up+lucille+ball+productions%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi90uOE1InRAhWGRCYKHSPjBrYQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22she%20set%20up%20lucille%20ball%20productions%22&amp;f=false|title=Lucy A to Z: The Lucille Ball Encyclopedia|page=60|author=Karol, Michael|publisher=iUniverse|year=2008|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

=== Beliefs ===
Arnaz and Ball decided that the show would maintain what Arnaz termed &quot;basic good taste&quot; and were therefore determined to avoid [[ethnic joke]]s, as well as humor based on physical handicaps or mental disabilities. Arnaz recalled that the only exception consisted of making fun of Ricky Ricardo's accent; even these jokes worked only when Lucy, as his wife, did the mimicking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnaz&quot; /&gt;

Arnaz was deeply patriotic about the United States. In his memoirs, he wrote that he knew of no other country in the world where &quot;a sixteen-year-old kid, broke and unable to speak the language&quot; could achieve the successes that he had.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnaz&quot; /&gt;

=== Marriages ===
[[File:Lucille_Ball_and_Desi_Arnaz_1955.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ball and Arnaz in 1955]]
Arnaz and Lucille Ball were married on November 30, 1940. Their marriage was turbulent. Convinced that Arnaz was being unfaithful to her and also because he came home drunk several times, Ball filed for divorce in September 1944, but returned to him before the [[interlocutory]] decree became final.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Arnaz and Ball subsequently had two children, actress [[Lucie Arnaz]] (born 1951) and actor [[Desi Arnaz Jr.]] (born 1953).

Arnaz's marriage with Ball began to collapse under the strain of his growing problems with alcohol and also because of [[womanizing]]. According to his memoir, the combined pressures of managing the production company, as well as supervising its day-to-day operations, had greatly worsened as it grew much larger, and he felt compelled to seek outlets to alleviate the stress.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Arnaz was also suffering from [[diverticulitis]]. Ball divorced him in 1960. When Ball returned to weekly television, she and Arnaz worked out an agreement regarding Desilu, wherein she bought him out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KoABABSnX7oC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=%22he+sold+his+share+of+desilu%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwix-pPG1YnRAhVGeSYKHZ1UAjgQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22he%20sold%20his%20share%20of%20desilu%22&amp;f=false|title=Lucy A to Z: The Lucille Ball Encyclopedia|page=16|author=Karol, Michael|publisher=iUniverse|year=2008|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnaz married his second wife, Edith Eyre Hirsch (née McSkimming), on March 2, 1963, and greatly reduced his show business activities. He served as executive producer of ''The Mothers-in-Law'', and during its two-year run, made four guest appearances as a Spanish [[Torero (bullfighter)|matador]], Señor Delgado. Edith died in 1985, aged 67, from cancer.

Although Arnaz and Ball both married other spouses after their divorce in 1960, they remained friends and grew closer in his final decade. &quot;''I Love Lucy'' was never just a title&quot;, wrote Arnaz in the last years of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Desilu: The Story of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz {{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family home video later aired on television showed Ball and Arnaz playing together with their grandson Simon shortly before Arnaz's death.

==Later life==
[[File:Desi arnaz sr and jr 1974.JPG|thumb|left|Arnaz appeared with his son in the 1974 television special, ''California, My Way''.]]
In the 1970s, Arnaz co-hosted a week of shows with daytime host and producer [[Mike Douglas]]. [[Vivian Vance]] appeared as a guest.&lt;ref name=LucyFAQ&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nNCGDwAAQBAJ|title=Lucille Ball FAQ: Everything Left to Know About America's Favorite Redhead|last=Monush|first=Barry|date=2011-06-01|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9781557839404|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arnaz also headlined a ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'' special on [[NBC]] that featured his two children, with a brief appearance by Vance. To promote his autobiography, ''A Book'', on February 21, 1976, Arnaz served as a guest host on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', with his son, Desi, Jr., also appearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/saturday-night-live/episode-14-season-1/desi-arnaz/100385|title=Saturday Night Live {{!}} TV Guide|website=TVGuide.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program contained spoofs of ''I Love Lucy'' and ''The Untouchables''.&lt;ref name=LucyFAQ /&gt; The spoofs of ''I Love Lucy'' were supposed to be earlier concepts of the show that never made it on the air, such as &quot;I Love Louie&quot;, where Desi lived with [[Louis Armstrong]]. He read [[Lewis Carroll]]'s poem &quot;[[Jabberwocky]]&quot; in a heavy Cuban accent (he pronounced it &quot;Habberwocky&quot;). Desi Jr., played the drums and, supported by the ''SNL'' band, Desi sang both &quot;[[Babalu (song)|Babalu]]&quot; and another favorite from his dance band days, &quot;[[Cuban Pete (song)|Cuban Pete]]&quot;; the arrangements were similar to the ones used on ''I Love Lucy''. He ended the broadcast by leading the entire cast in a raucous conga line through the ''SNL'' studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=about&amp;p=887&amp;item=T:02112|title=The Paley Center for Media|website=The Paley Center for Media|language=en|access-date=2019-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75n.phtml|title=SNL Transcripts: Desi Arnaz: 02/21/76|last=jtranscripts|first=Author|date=2018-10-08|website=SNL Transcripts Tonight|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnaz and his wife eventually moved to [[Del Mar, California]], where he lived the rest of his life in semi-retirement. He owned a [[horse-breeding]] farm in [[Corona, California]], and raced [[thoroughbred]]s. He contributed to charitable and nonprofit organizations, including [[San Diego State University]]. He also taught classes at San Diego State in studio production and acting for television. Arnaz made a guest appearance on the TV series ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'', starring [[Linda Lavin]] and produced by ''I Love Lucy'' co-creators [[Madelyn Pugh]] (Madelyn Davis) and [[Bob Carroll, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scua2.sdsu.edu/archon/?p=collections/controlcard&amp;id=60|title=Desi Arnaz Papers, 1947-1976 {{!}} Special Collections &amp; University Archives|website=Scua2.sdsu.edu|access-date=2019-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2019}}
Arnaz was a regular smoker for much of his life and often smoked cigarettes on the set of ''I Love Lucy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quitsmoking.about.com/od/Famous/g/Famous-Tobacco-Victims-Actor-Desi-Arnaz.htm|title=Famous Tobacco Victims - Desi Arnaz|author=Terry Martin|work=About.com Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; He smoked Cuban cigars until he was in his sixties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-12-03/news/mn-486_1_desi-arnaz|title=Desi Arnaz, TV Lucy's Loving Co-Star, Dies|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arnaz was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1986. He died several months later on December 2, 1986, at the age of 69. Arnaz was cremated and his ashes scattered. His death came just five days before Lucille Ball received the [[Kennedy Center Honors]]. He was predeceased by his second wife, Edith, who died a year earlier on March 23, 1985. His mother outlived him by almost two years.

==Legacy==
Desi Arnaz has two stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]: one at 6301 Hollywood Boulevard for contributions to motion pictures and one at 6250 Hollywood Boulevard for television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hwof.com/stars?recipient=Desi+Arnaz|title=Search results for 'Desi Arnaz' |work=[[The Hollywood Walk of Fame]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike his co-stars, Arnaz was never nominated for an Emmy for his performance in ''I Love Lucy''. In 1956, he won a [[Golden Globe]] for [[13th Golden Globe Awards#Television Achievement|Best Television Achievement]] for helping to shape the American Comedy through  his contributions in front of and behind the camera of ''I Love Lucy''. He was inducted into the Television Academy's Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/news/hall-fame/desi-arnaz-hall-fame-tribute|title=Desi Arnaz: Hall of Fame Tribute|website=Television Academy|language=en|access-date=2019-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Center]] museum is in [[Jamestown, New York]], and the Desi Arnaz Bandshell in the Lucille Ball Memorial Park is in [[Celoron, New York]].

Desi Arnaz appears as a character in [[Oscar Hijuelos]]' 1989 novel ''[[The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love]]'' and is portrayed by his son, Desi Arnaz, Jr. in the 1992 film adaptation, ''[[The Mambo Kings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Mambo Kings (1992) |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/59318 |website=AFI {{!}} Catalog |publisher=American Film Institute |accessdate=8 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnaz was portrayed by [[Oscar Nuñez]] in ''I Love Lucy: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Sitcom'', a comedy about how Arnaz and Ball battled to get their sitcom on the air. It had its world premiere in Los Angeles on July 12, 2018, co-starring [[Sarah Drew]] as [[Lucille Ball]] and [[Seamus Dever]] as ''I Love Lucy'' creator-producer-head writer [[Jess Oppenheimer]].
