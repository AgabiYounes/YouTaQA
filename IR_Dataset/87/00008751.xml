A '''dominatrix''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|ɒ|m|ᵻ|'|n|eɪ|t|r|ɪ|k|s}}, plural '''dominatrices''' {{IPAc-en|-|'|n|eɪ|t|r|ɪ|s|iː|z|,_|-|n|ə|'|t|r|aɪ|-}}), is a woman who takes the dominant role in [[BDSM]] activities. A dominatrix might be of any sexual orientation, but her orientation does not necessarily limit the genders of her submissive partners. The role of a dominatrix may not even involve physical pain toward the submissive; her domination can be verbal, involving humiliating tasks, or servitude. A dominatrix is typically a paid professional (''pro-domme'') as the term ''dominatrix'' is little-used within the non-professional BDSM scene.

The term ''domme'' is a coined pseudo-French female variation of the slang ''dom'' (short for ''dominant''). The use of ''domme'', ''dominatrix'', ''dom'', or ''dominant'' by any woman in a dominant role is chosen mostly by personal preference and the conventions of the local BDSM scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Easton|Hardy|2002|p=iii}}: &quot;Semantics vary widely throughout the kinky world, from one region to the next, one sexual orientation to the next, one playstyle to the next.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''mistress''' or '''dominant mistress''' is sometimes also used. '''''Female dominance''''', '''''female domination''''' or '''''femdom''''' refer to BDSM activities in which the dominant partner is female.

As fetish culture is increasingly becoming more prevalent in Western media, [[List of dominatrices in popular culture|depictions of dominatrices in film and television]] have become more common.

==Etymology==
''Dominatrix'' is the feminine form of the [[Latin]] ''dominator'', a ruler or lord, and was originally used in a non-sexual sense. Its use in English dates back to at least 1561. Its earliest recorded use in the prevalent modern sense, as a female dominant in S&amp;M, dates to 1961.&lt;ref name=Seves&gt;Pérez Seves, ''Eric Stanton &amp; the History of the Bizarre Underground'', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially coined to describe a woman who provides punishment-for-pay as one of the case studies within Bruce Roger's pulp paperback ''The Bizarre Lovemakers''.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Bruce (1967) &quot;The Bizarre Lovemakers&quot; cited in {{harvp|Nomis|2013|p=131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was taken up shortly after by the Myron Kosloff title ''Dominatrix'' (with art by [[Eric Stanton]]) in 1968, and entered more popular mainstream knowledge following the 1976 film ''Dominatrix Without Mercy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nomis|2013|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term ''dominatrix'' was not used, the classic example in literature of the female dominant-male submissive relationship is portrayed in the 1870 novella ''[[Venus in Furs]]'' by Austrian writer [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]]. The term ''[[Sadomasochism|masochism]]'' was later derived from the author's name by [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] in the latter's 1886 forensic study ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis (Richard von Krafft-Ebing book)|Psychopathia Sexualis]]''.

==History==
[[File:Ostra Studio violin student.jpg|thumb|upright|A scene where both dominant and submissive are female, circa 1930s. A music teacher is caning the buttocks of a student with a [[violin bow]].]]

The history of the dominatrix is argued to date back to rituals of the Goddess [[Inanna]] (or [[Ishtar]] as she was known in Akkadian), in ancient Mesopotamia. Ancient cuneiform texts consisting of &quot;Hymns to Inanna&quot; have been cited as examples of the archetype of powerful, sexual female displaying dominating behaviors and forcing Gods and men into submission to her.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Inana and Ebih&quot; ETCSL, Faculty of Oriental Studies, University of Oxford http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr132.htm cited in {{harvp|Nomis|2013|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologist and historian Anne O. Nomis notes that Inanna's rituals included cross-dressing of cult personnel, and rituals &quot;imbued with pain and ecstasy, bringing about initiation and journeys of altered consciousness; punishment, moaning, ecstasy, lament and song, participants exhausting themselves with weeping and grief.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See &quot;A Hymn to Inana C&quot; ETCSL, Faculty of Oriental Studies, University of Oxford see lines 70–80 viewable at http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section4/tr4073.htm cited in {{harvp|Nomis|2013|pp=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tale of Phyllis and Aristotle]], which became popular and gained numerous versions from the 12th century onwards, tells the story of a dominant woman who seduced and dominated the male intellect of the greatest philosopher. In the story, Phyllis forces [[Aristotle]] to kneel on the ground so that she rides on his back while whipping and verbally humiliating him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aristotle and Phyllis |url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/20121 |publisher=[[Art Institute Chicago]] |accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith2013&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Smith, Justin E.

H. Smith |accessdate=31 March 2018 |date=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The profession appears to have originated as a specialization within [[brothel]]s, before becoming its own unique craft. As far back as the 1590s, flagellation within an erotic setting is recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nomis|2013|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The profession features in erotic prints of the era, such as the British Museum mezzotint &quot;The Cully Flaug'd&quot; (c. 1674–1702), and in accounts of forbidden books which record the flogging schools and the activities practised.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nomis|2013|pp=80–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the 18th century, female &quot;Birch Disciplinarians&quot; advertised their services in a book masked as a collection of lectures or theatrical plays, entitled &quot;[[Fashionable Lectures]]&quot; (c. 1761).&lt;ref name=&quot;fashionable&quot;&gt;&quot;Fashionable Lectures&quot; (c1761) British Library Rare Books collection, cited in {{harvp|Nomis|2013|pp=92–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included the names of 57 women, some actresses and courtesans, who catered to birch discipline fantasies, keeping a room with rods and cat o' nine tails, and charging their clients a Guinea for a &quot;lecture&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;fashionable&quot;/&gt;

The 19th century is characterised by what historian Anne O. Nomis characterises as the &quot;Golden Age of the Governess&quot;. No fewer than twenty establishments were documented as having existed by the 1840s, supported entirely by flagellation practices and known as &quot;Houses of Discipline&quot; distinct from brothels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nomis_101&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Nomis|2013|p=101}}, citing original historical books and accounts from British Library &quot;Rare Books&quot;, including Fraxi, Pisanus (pseudonym of Henry Spencer Ashbee) (1877) &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; (Index of Forbidden Books) and Mary Wilson &quot;Preface&quot; to &quot;The Venus School-mistress&quot; (edition dating to between 1836–1877; reprinted by Birchopolis in 1917)&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the well-known &quot;dominatrix governesses&quot; were Mrs Chalmers, Mrs Noyeau, the late Mrs Jones of Hertford Street and London Street, the late Mrs [[Theresa Berkley]], Bessy Burgess of York Square and Mrs Pyree of Burton Cres.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nomis_101&quot;/&gt; The most famous of these Governess &quot;female flagellants&quot; was [[Theresa Berkley]], who operated her establishment on [[Charlotte Street]] in the central [[London]] district of [[Marylebone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nomis|2013|pp=101–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is recorded to have used implements such as [[whip]]s, [[caning|canes]] and birches, to chastise and punish her male clients, as well as the [[Berkley Horse]], a specially designed flogging machine, and a pulley suspension system for lifting them off the floor.&lt;ref&gt;Fraxi, Pisanus (pseudonym of Henry Spencer Ashbee) &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; (Index of Forbidden Books) (1877)&lt;/ref&gt; Such historical use of [[corporal punishment]] and [[Suspension bondage|suspension]], in a setting of [[Domination and submission (BDSM)|domination]] roleplay, connects very closely to the practices of modern-day professional dominatrices.

The &quot;bizarre style&quot; (as it came to be called) of leather catsuits, claws, tail whips, and latex rubber only came about in the 20th century, initially within commercial fetish photography, and taken up by dominatrices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nomis|2013|pp=119–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the mid-20th century, dominatrices operated in a very discreet and underground manner, which has made them difficult to trace within the historical record. A few photographs still exist of the women who ran their domination businesses in London, New York, The Hague and Hamburg's [[Herbertstraße]], predominantly in sepia and black-and-white photographs, and scans from magazine articles, copied and re-copied. Amongst these were Miss Doreen of London who was acquainted with [[John Sutcliffe (designer)|John Sutcliffe]] of [[AtomAge]] fame, whose clients reportedly included Britain's top politicians and businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nomis|2013|pp=133–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York, the dominatrix Anne Laurence was known within the underground circle of acquaintances during the 1950s, with Monique Von Cleef arriving in the early 1960s, and hitting national headlines when her home was raided by police detectives on 22 December 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nomis|2013|pp=140–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Cleef went on to set up her &quot;House of Pain&quot; in The Hague in the 1970s, which became one of the world capitals for dominatrices, reportedly with visiting lawyers, ambassadors, diplomats and politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nomis|2013|pp=151–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Domenica Niehoff]] worked as a dominatrix in Hamburg and appeared on talk shows on German television from the 1970s onwards, campaigning for [[sex workers' rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Childs|first=David|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/domenica-niehoff-prostitute-and-social-activist-who-campaigned-for-the-legalisation-of-her-1639293.html|title=Domenica Niehoff: Prostitute and social activist who campaigned for the legalisation of her profession|work=The Independent|date=7 March 2009|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mistress Raven, founder and manager of [[Pandora's Box (BDSM)|Pandora's Box]], one of New York's best known BDSM studios,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/09/movies/humiliation-business-and-its-customers.html|title=Humiliation Business And Its Customers|author=Stephen Holden|date= 9 May 1997|newspaper=The News York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; was featured in [[Nick Broomfield]]'s 1996 documentary film ''[[Fetishes (film)|Fetishes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041021033430/http://nyrock.com/movies/1997/fetishes.asp|url=http://nyrock.com/movies/1997/fetishes.asp|title=Fetishes: Whips, Chains and Other Family Entertainment|website=NY Rock|author=Otto Luck|date=May 1997|archive-date=21 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''dominatrix'' is mostly used to describe a female professional dominant (or &quot;pro-domme&quot;) who is paid to engage in [[play (BDSM)|BDSM play]] with a submissive. Professional dominatrices are not prostitutes, despite the sensual and erotic interactions she has.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindemann|first=Danielle|date=2010-08-02|title=Will the Real Dominatrix Please Stand Up: Artistic Purity and Professionalism in the S&amp;M Dungeon1|journal=Sociological Forum|volume=25|issue=3|pages=588–606|doi=10.1111/j.1573-7861.2010.01197.x|issn=0884-8971}}&lt;/ref&gt; An appointment or roleplay is referred to as a &quot;session&quot;, and is often conducted in a dedicated professional play space which has been set up with specialist equipment, known as a &quot;dungeon&quot;. Sessions may also be conducted remotely by letter or telephone, or in the contemporary era of technological connectivity by email or online chat. Most, but not all, clients of female professional dominants are men. Male professional dominants also exist, catering predominantly to the gay male market.

Women who engage in female domination typically promote and title themselves under the terms &quot;dominatrix&quot;, &quot;mistress&quot;, &quot;lady&quot;, &quot;madame&quot;, &quot;herrin&quot; or &quot;goddess&quot;. In a study of German dominatrices, Andrew Wilson said that the trend for dominatrices choosing names aimed at creating and maintaining an atmosphere in which class, femininity and mystery are key elements of their self-constructed identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wilson|2005|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some professional dominatrices set minimum age limits for their clients. Popular requests from clients are for dungeon play including [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], [[spanking]] and [[cock and ball torture]], or for [[medical fetishism|medical play]] using hoods, gas masks and [[urethral sounding]].&lt;ref name=Dublin&gt;{{cite news|title=Making men's fantasies a reality: The life of a professional dominatrix in Dublin|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/dublin-dominatrix-2878270-Dec2016/|work=The Journal|location=Ireland|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verbal [[erotic humiliation]] is also popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What You Learn About Masculinity from Making Fun of Men's Small Dicks for a Living|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9b8aw3/small-penis-humiliation-masculinity-trump|author=Margaret Corvid|date=28 August 2016|work=Vice}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not unusual for a dominatrix to consider her profession different from that of an [[Call girl|escort]] and not perform [[tie and tease]] or &quot;[[Erotic massage#Commercial erotic and sexual massage|happy endings]]&quot;.

While dominatrices come from many different backgrounds, it has been shown that a considerable number are well-educated. Research into US dominatrices published in 2012 indicated that 39% of the sample studied had received some sort of graduate training.{{sfn|Lindemann|2012|p=187}}

A 1985 study suggested that about 30 percent of participants in BDSM subculture were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01550846 |title=On the prevalence and roles of females in the sadomasochistic subculture: Report of an empirical study |year=1985 |last1=Breslow |first1=Norman |last2=Evans |first2=Linda |last3=Langley |first3=Jill |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=303–17 |pmid=4051718}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1994 report indicated that around a quarter of the women who took part in BDSM subculture did so professionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01541410 |title=The prevalence and some attributes of females in the sadomasochistic subculture: A second report |year=1994 |last1=Levitt |first1=Eugene E. |last2=Moser |first2=Charles |last3=Jamison |first3=Karen V. |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=465–73 |pmid=7993186}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1995 study of Internet [[discussion group]] messages, the preference for the dominant-initiator role was expressed by 11% of messages by heterosexual women, compared to 71% of messages by heterosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01542185 |title=Sexual bondage: A review and unobtrusive investigation |year=1995 |last1=Ernulf |first1=Kurt E. |last2=Innala |first2=Sune M. |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=631–54 |pmid=8572912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional dominatrices can be seen advertising their services online and in print publications which carry erotic services advertising, such as [[contact magazine]]s and [[fetish magazine]]s that specialise in female domination.{{sfn|Lindemann|2012|p=42}} The precise number of women actively offering professional domination services is unknown. Most professional dominatrices practice in large metropolitan cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and London, with as many as 200 women working as dominatrices in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Black |first=Tony |title=Dominatrix Directory: Los Angeles – Star Pro-Dommes |url=http://fetpro.com/dominatrix-directory-los-angeles-stars/ |accessdate=12 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312224343/http://fetpro.com/dominatrix-directory-los-angeles-stars/ |archivedate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional dominatrices may take pride or differentiation in their psychological insight into their clients' [[sexual fetishism|fetishes]] and desires, as well as their technical ability to perform complex BDSM practices, such as [[Japanese bondage|Japanese shibari]], head-scissoring&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pinsky|first=Dina|last2=Levey|first2=Tania G.|date=2015-03-04|title='A world turned upside down': Emotional labour and the professional dominatrix|journal=Sexualities|volume=18|issue=4|pages=438–458|doi=10.1177/1363460714550904|issn=1363-4607}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and other forms of [[Bondage (sexual)|bondage]], [[Suspension bondage|suspension]], [[Cock and ball torture (sexual practice)|torture]] roleplay, and [[corporal punishment]], and other such practices which require a high degree of knowledge and competency to safely oversee. From a sociological point of view, Danielle Lindemann has stated the &quot;embattled purity regime&quot; in which many pro-dommes emphasise their specialist knowledge and professional skills, while distancing themselves from economic criteria for success, in a way which is comparable to avant-garde artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lindemann|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some dominatrices practice [[financial domination]], or findom, a fetish in which a submissive is aroused by sending money or gifts to a dominatrix at her instruction. In some cases the dominatrix is given control of the submissive's finances or a &quot;blackmail&quot; scenario is acted out. In the majority of cases the dominatrix and the submissive do not physically meet. The interactions are typically performed using the Internet, which is also where such services are advertised. Findom was originally a niche service that a traditional dominatrix would offer, but it has become popular with less-experienced online practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=What is Findom? A Submissive Man Explains the Fetish|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/findom-what-is-it-financial-domination-definition-explained-a7646931.html|newspaper=The Independent|location=UK|author=Rachel Hosie|date=24 March 2017|access-date=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To differentiate women who identify as a dominatrix but do not offer paid services, non-professional dominants are occasionally referred to as a &quot;lifestyle&quot; dominatrix or Mistress. The term &quot;lifestyle&quot; to signify BDSM is occasionally a contention topic in the BDSM community and that some dominatrices may dislike the term. Some professional dominatrices are also &quot;lifestyle&quot; dominatrices - i.e., in addition to paid sessions with submissive clients they engage in unpaid recreational sessions or may incorporate power exchange within their own private lives and relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Holly (2011)  &quot;Unleashed: The secret world of Britain's Dominatrixes&quot; in [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/fantasies-fetishes/unleashed-the-secret-world-of-britains-dominatrixes-6263209.html The Independent, 20 November 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term has fallen out of general usage with respect to women who are dominant in their private relationships, and has taken on more and more, the connotation of &quot;professional.&quot;

== Notable Dominatrices ==
[[Catherine Robbe-Grillet]] is a personal dominatrix. Born in Paris in September 24, 1930, she later became France's most famous dominatrix. She is also writer and actress, the widow of nouveau roman pioneer and sadist [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wdw.nl/en/review/desk/catherine_robbe_grillet_an_eighty_four_year_old_dominatrix_in_istanbul|title=Catherine Robbe-Grillet: An Eighty-four-year-old Dominatrix in Istanbul - WdW Review - Program - Witte de With|website=www.wdw.nl|access-date=2019-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; She currently lives with Beverly Charpentier, a 51-year-old South African woman who is her submissive companion. Although being such a famous dominatrix, she has never accepted payment for her &quot;ceremonies&quot;. She's quoted as saying &quot;If someone pays, then they are in charge. I need to remain free. It is important that everyone involved knows that I do it solely for my pleasure.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2014/01/Catherine-robbe-grillet-interview|title=An Exclusive Interview with France's Most Famous Dominatrix, Catherine Robbe-Grillet|last=Nast|first=Condé|website=Vanity Fair|access-date=2019-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Catherine is my secret garden,” Charpentier says. &quot;I have given myself to her, body and soul. She does whatever she wants, whenever she wants, with either or both, according to her pleasure—and her pleasure is also my pleasure.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Catherine has always been heavily censored in her novels for writing about S/M stories. She identifies as a “pro-sex feminist” and “the kind of feminist who supports the right of any man or women to work as a prostitute, if it is their free choice.”&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

==Imagery==
[[File:Vivian LaVey at AVN Adult Entertainment Expo 2011 1.jpg|thumb|upright|A dominatrix wearing typical [[fetish fashion]] themed [[Latex clothing|latex]] dress, [[fishnet stockings]] and [[stiletto heels]]. She is holding a [[Paddle (spanking)|spanking paddle]].]]

The dominatrix is a female [[archetype]] which operates on a symbolic mode of representation, associated with particular attire and props that are drawn on within popular culture to signify her role—as a strong, dominant, sexualised woman—linked to but distinct from images of [[sexual fetish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Reichert|Lambiase|2003|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the twentieth century, the imagery associated with dominatrices was developed by the work of a number of artists including the costume designer and photographer [[Charles Guyette]], the publisher and film director [[Irving Klaw]], and the illustrators [[Eric Stanton]] and [[Gene Bilbrew]] who drew for the fetish magazine [[Exotique]].

One of the ubiquitous garments associated with the dominatrix is the [[catsuit]]. Historically, the black leather female catsuit entered dominant fetish culture in the 1950s with the ''[[AtomAge]]'' magazine and its connections to fetish fashion designer [[John Sutcliffe (designer)|John Sutcliffe]]. The spill-over into mainstream culture, occurred with catsuits being worn by strong female protagonists in popular 1960s TV programs like ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', and in the comic super-heroines such as [[Catwoman]], in which the catsuit represented the independent woman capable of &quot;kick-ass&quot; moves and antics, enabling complete freedom of movement. On another level, the one-piece [[catsuit]] accentuated and exaggerated the sexualized female form, providing visual access to a woman's body, while simultaneously obstructing physical penetrative access. &quot;You can look but you can't touch&quot; is the mechanism of this operation, which plays upon the BDSM practice known as &quot;[[tease and denial]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tseëlon|2004|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other common signifying footwear of the dominatrix are [[thigh-high boots]] in leather or shiny PVC, which have long held a fetishistic status and are sometimes called [[boot fetishism|kinky boots]], along with the very high [[stiletto heel]]. [[Fishnet]] stockings, [[Seamed stockings|seamed hosiery]], and [[stocking]]s and [[Garter (stockings)#Garter belts|garter belts]] (suspenders) are also popular accents in the representation and attire of dominatrices, to emphasize the form and length of their legs, with erotic connotation.

Tight, leather [[corset]]s are another staple garment of the dominatrix signification. Gloves, whether long [[opera gloves]] or fingerless gloves, are often a further accessory to emphasize the feminine role. [[Neck corset]]s may also be worn.

Dominatrices often wear clothing made from [[fetish fashion]] materials. Examples include [[PVC clothing]], [[latex clothing]] and garments drawn from the [[leather subculture]]. In some cases elements of dominatrix attire, such as leather boots and peaked cap, are drawn from [[Nazi chic]], particularly the black [[SS officer]]'s uniform which has been widely adopted and fetishized by underground gay and BDSM lifestyle groups to satisfy a [[uniform fetish]].

The body language of the dominatrix is frequently represented by the use of strong, dominant body-language which is comparable to the [[animal communication|dominant posturing in the animal world]]. The props she may brandish will strongly signify her role as dominatrix, such as bearing a flogger, whip or riding crop as illustrated in the artwork of [[Bruno Zach]] in the early 20th century,&lt;ref name=Bonhams&gt;{{cite web|title=Bruno Zach's 'Riding Crop Girl' hits World Record $150,602 at Bonhams art auction|url=https://www.justcollecting.com/miscellania/bruno-zachs-riding-crop-girl-hits-world-record-150-602-at-bonhams-art-auction|website=justcollecting.com|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bonhams Lot 116&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Lot 116 - Bruno Zach 'The Riding Crop' an Impressive Green and Gilt Patinated Bronze|url=https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/20122/lot/116/|website=Bonhams.com|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in conventional representation.

The dominatrix is holding onto a chain leash with is attached to a [[Collar (BDSM)|collar]] on the submissive's neck.]] Practicing professional dominatrices may draw their attire from the conventional signifiers of the role, or adapt them to create their own individual style, where there exists a potential pull—between meeting conventional expectations, and a desire for dominant independent self-expression. Some contemporary dominatrices draw upon an eclectic range of strong female archetypes, including the goddess, the female superheroine, the femme fatale, the priestess, the empress, the queen, the governess, the [[KGB]] secret agent, to their own ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wilson|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature ==
Literature on the Dominatrix has been around since the 10th century. Canoness Hroswitha, in her manuscript ''Maria,'' uses the word ''Dominatrix'' for the main character.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baron|first=Jeremy Hugh|date=June 2006|title=Spare the rod: The figure of the dominatrix in the literary canon|journal=Sexuality and Culture|volume=10|issue=2|pages=76–95|doi=10.1007/s12119-006-1016-2|issn=1095-5143}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is portrayed as an unattainable woman who is too good for any of the men who are in love with her. The theme of &quot;the unattainable woman&quot; has been used thoroughly in medieval literature as well, although it differs from a dominatrix. Medieval themes surrounding the unattainable woman concerned issues of social classes and structure, with chivalry being a prime part of a relationship between a man and woman. There are some exceptions to this trend during medieval times. In Cervantes’ ''Don Quixote'' (1605), Celadon is imprisoned by Galatea. Celadon complains that his “mistress . . . Galatea keeps me on such a short leash”. Robert Herrick published in 1648, Hesperides.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; In it there were three revealing poems ''An Hymne to Love'', ''The Dream'', and ''To Love'' which showcase masculine longing for domination, restraint, discipline. In ''Ulysses'' by James Joyce, the character Bloom has many fantasies of submission to a lady and to receive whippings by her.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Female domination has been explored in literature tracing back as far as the 10th century.
