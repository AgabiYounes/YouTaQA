== Early life and education ==
Hofstadter was born in [[New York City]], the son of Jewish parents; [[Nobel Prize]]-winning physicist [[Robert Hofstadter]] and Nancy Givan Hofstadter.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford News Service,[http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2007/pr-nancy-082207.html ''Nancy Hofstadter, widow of Nobel laureate in physics, dead at 87''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324094751/http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2007/pr-nancy-082207.html |date=March 24, 2012 }}, August 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up on the campus of [[Stanford University]], where his father was a professor, and he attended the [[International School of Geneva]] in 1958–1959. He graduated with Distinction in [[Mathematics]] from [[Stanford University]] in 1965, and received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[Physics]]&lt;ref name=&quot;hofphd&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;energylevels&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hofstadter | first = Douglas | author-link = Douglas Hofstadter | title = Energy levels and wave functions of Bloch electrons in rational and irrational magnetic fields | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevB.14.2239 | journal = Physical Review B | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 2239 | year = 1976 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[University of Oregon]] in 1975, where his study of the energy levels of [[Bloch electron]]s in a magnetic field led to his discovery of the [[fractal]] known as the [[Hofstadter's butterfly|Hofstadter butterfly]].&lt;ref name=&quot;energylevels&quot;/&gt;

== Academic career ==
Since 1988, Hofstadter has been the College of Arts and Sciences Distinguished Professor of Cognitive Science and Comparative Literature at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] in Bloomington, where he directs the Center for Research on Concepts and Cognition which consists of himself and his graduate students, forming the &quot;Fluid Analogies Research Group&quot; (FARG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cogsci.indiana.edu/|title=Center for Research on Concepts and Cognition: Indiana University Bloomington|accessdate=April 30, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411235652/https://cogsci.indiana.edu/|archivedate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was initially appointed to the Indiana University's Computer Science Department faculty in 1977, and at that time he launched his research program in computer modeling of mental processes (which at that time he called &quot;artificial intelligence research&quot;, a label that he has since dropped in favor of &quot;cognitive science research&quot;). In 1984, he moved to the [[University of Michigan]] in Ann Arbor, where he was hired as a professor of psychology and was also appointed to the Walgreen Chair for the Study of Human Understanding. In 1988 he returned to Bloomington as &quot;College of Arts and Sciences Professor&quot; in both cognitive science and computer science. He was also appointed adjunct professor of history and philosophy of science, philosophy, comparative literature, and psychology, but has said that his involvement with most of those departments is nominal.&lt;ref&gt;IU pages as [http://www.cogs.indiana.edu/people/homepages/hofstadter.html faculty]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031231140234/http://www.cogs.indiana.edu/people/homepages/hofstadter.html |date=December 31, 2003 }}, [http://www.indiana.edu/~alldrp/members/hofstadter.html IU distinguished faculty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040225021941/http://www.indiana.edu/~alldrp/members/hofstadter.html |date=February 25, 2004 }} (see [http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/5075.html this announcement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216060858/http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/5075.html |date=December 16, 2007 }} on March 21, 2007) and as [http://newsinfo.iu.edu/sb/page/normal/198.html speaker]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216170905/http://newsinfo.iu.edu/sb/page/normal/198.html |date=December 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acm.org/crossroads/xrds10-2/hofstadter.html A Day in the Life of&amp;nbsp;...

Hofstadter's many interests include music, visual art, the [[mind]], [[creativity]], [[consciousness]], [[self-reference]], [[translation]] and [[mathematics]].

At the University of Michigan and Indiana University, he co-authored, with [[Melanie Mitchell]], a computational model of &quot;high-level perception&quot;&amp;nbsp;– [[Copycat (software)|Copycat]]&amp;nbsp;– and several other models of [[Analogy|analogy-making]] and [[cognition]], including the Tabletop project, co-developed with [[Robert M. French]]. Hofstadter's doctoral student James Marshall subsequently extended the Copycat project under the name &quot;Metacat&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Letter Spirit project, implemented by Gary McGraw and John Rehling, aims to model the act of artistic creativity by designing stylistically uniform &quot;gridfonts&quot; (typefaces limited to a grid). Other more recent models include Phaeaco (implemented by Harry Foundalis) and SeqSee (Abhijit Mahabal), which model high-level perception and analogy-making in the microdomains of [[Bongard problem]]s and number sequences, respectively, as well as George (Francisco Lara-Dammer), which models the processes of perception and discovery in triangle geometry.&lt;ref&gt;

The pursuit of [[beauty]] has driven Hofstadter both inside and outside his professional work. He seeks beautiful mathematical patterns, beautiful explanations, beautiful typefaces, beautiful sonic patterns in poetry, ''etc''. Hofstadter has said of himself, &quot;I'm someone who has one foot in the world of humanities and arts, and the other foot in the world of science.&quot; He has had several exhibitions of his artworks in various university art galleries. These shows have featured large collections of his gridfonts, his [[ambigrams]] (pieces of calligraphy created with two readings, either of which is usually obtained from the other by rotating or reflecting the ambigram, but sometimes simply by &quot;oscillation&quot;, like the [[Necker Cube]] or the [[Optical illusion#Explanation of cognitive illusions|rabbit/duck figure]] of [[Joseph Jastrow]]), and his &quot;Whirly Art&quot; (music-inspired visual patterns realized using shapes based on various alphabets from India). (Hofstadter invented the term &quot;ambigram&quot; in 1984; many ambigrammists all over the world have since taken up the concept.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unc.edu/~mumukshu/gandhi/gandhi/hofstadter.htm Sounds like Bach] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013202016/http://www.unc.edu/~mumukshu/gandhi/gandhi/hofstadter.htm |date=October 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofstadter collects and studies cognitive errors (largely, but not solely, speech errors), &quot;bon mots&quot; (spontaneous humorous quips), and analogies of all sorts, and his long-time observation of these diverse products of cognition, and his theories about the mechanisms that underlie them, have exerted a powerful influence on the architectures of the computational models developed by himself and FARG members.&lt;ref&gt;
Hofstadter, Douglas, To Err is Human; to Study Error-making is Cognitive Science. Together with David Moser. ''Michigan Quarterly Review'', Vol. XXVIII, No. 2, 1989, pp. 185–215.&lt;/ref&gt;

All FARG computational models share certain key principles, including:
* that human thinking is carried out by thousands of independent small actions in parallel, biased by the concepts that are currently activated
* that activation spreads from activated concepts to less activated &quot;neighbor concepts&quot;
* that there is a &quot;mental temperature&quot; that regulates the degree of randomness in the parallel activity
* that promising avenues tend to be explored more rapidly than unpromising ones

FARG models also have an overarching philosophy that all cognition is built from the making of analogies. The computational architectures that share these precepts are called &quot;active symbols&quot; architectures.

Hofstadter's thesis about consciousness, first expressed in ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'' (''GEB'') but also present in several of his later books, is that it is an emergent consequence of seething lower-level activity in the brain. In ''GEB'' he draws an analogy between the social organization of a colony of ants and the mind seen as a coherent &quot;colony&quot; of neurons. In particular, Hofstadter claims that our sense of having (or being) an &quot;I&quot; comes from the abstract pattern he terms a &quot;[[strange loop]]&quot;, which is an abstract cousin of such concrete phenomena as [[Audio feedback|audio]] and [[Optical feedback|video feedback]], and which Hofstadter has defined as &quot;a level-crossing feedback loop&quot;. The prototypical example of this abstract notion is the self-referential structure at the core of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]]. Hofstadter's 2007 book ''[[I Am a Strange Loop]]'' carries his vision of consciousness considerably further, including the idea that each human &quot;I&quot; is distributed over numerous brains, rather than being limited to precisely one brain.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.bizcharts.com/stoa_del_sol/conscious/conscious2.html Consciousness In The Cosmos: Perspective of Mind: Douglas Hofstadter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804052510/http://www.bizcharts.com/stoa_del_sol/conscious/conscious2.html |date=August 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofstadter's writing is characterized by an intense interaction between form and content, as exemplified by the 20 dialogues in ''GEB'', many of which simultaneously talk about and imitate strict musical forms used by Bach, such as canons and fugues. Most of Hofstadter's books feature some kind of structural alternation: in ''GEB'' between dialogues and chapters, in ''The Mind's I'' between selections and reflections, in ''Metamagical Themas'' between Chapters and Postscripts, and so forth. Both in his writing and in his teaching, Hofstadter stresses the concrete, constantly using examples and analogies, and avoids the abstract. Typical of the courses he teaches is his seminar &quot;[[Group Theory]] and [[Galois Theory]] Visualized&quot;, in which abstract mathematical ideas are rendered as concretely as possible. He puts great effort into making ideas clear and visual, and asserts that when he teaches, if his students do not understand something, it is never their fault but always his own.

Hofstadter is passionate about languages. In addition to English, his mother tongue, he speaks French and Italian fluently (the language spoken at home with his children is Italian). At various times in his life, he has studied (in descending order of level of fluency reached) German, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Mandarin, Dutch, Polish, and Hindi.{{Citation needed|reason=See discussion page about his Russian.|date=June 2010}} His love of sounds pushes him to strive to minimize, and ideally get rid of, any foreign accent.

''[[Le Ton beau de Marot|Le Ton beau de Marot: In Praise of the Music of Language]]'' is a long book devoted to language and translation, especially poetry translation, and one of its leitmotifs is a set of some 88 translations of &quot;Ma Mignonne&quot;, a highly constrained poem by 16th-century French poet [[Clément Marot]]. In this book, Hofstadter jokingly describes himself as &quot;[[pi]]lingual&quot; (meaning that the sum total of the varying degrees of mastery of all the languages that he's studied comes to 3.14159&amp;nbsp;...), as well as an &quot;oligoglot&quot; (someone who speaks &quot;a few&quot; languages).&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, Douglas R. ''Le Ton Beau de Marot.'' New York: Basic Books, 1997, pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, Douglas R. ''Le Ton Beau de Marot'', Chapter &quot;How Jolly the Lot of an Oligoglot&quot;, New York: Basic Books, 1997, pp. 15–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the bicentennial year of Russian poet and writer [[Alexander Pushkin]], Hofstadter published a verse translation of Pushkin's classic novel-in-verse ''[[Eugene Onegin]]''. Hofstadter has translated many other poems too (always respecting their formal constraints), and two novels (in prose): ''[[La chamade|La Chamade]]'' (''That Mad Ache'') by French writer [[Françoise Sagan]], and ''La Scoperta dell'Alba'' (''The Discovery of Dawn'') by [[Walter Veltroni]], the then head of the Partito Democratico in Italy. ''The Discovery of Dawn'' was published in 2007, and ''That Mad Ache'' was published in 2009, bound together with Hofstadter's essay ''Translator, Trader: An Essay on the Pleasantly Pervasive Paradoxes of Translation''.

Hofstadter has said that he feels &quot;uncomfortable with the nerd culture that centers on computers&quot;. He admits that &quot;a large fraction [of his audience] seems to be those who are fascinated by technology&quot;, but when it was suggested that his work &quot;has inspired many students to begin careers in computing and artificial intelligence&quot; he replied that he was pleased about that, but that he himself has &quot;no interest in computers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wired&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In his book ''Metamagical Themas'', he says that &quot;in this day and age, how can anyone fascinated by creativity and beauty fail to see in computers the ultimate tool for exploring their essence?&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Provoked by predictions of a [[technological singularity]] (a hypothetical moment in the future of humanity when a self-reinforcing, runaway development of [[artificial intelligence]] causes a radical change in technology and culture), Hofstadter has both organized and participated in several public discussions of the topic. At Indiana University in 1999 he organized such a symposium, and in April 2000, he organized a larger symposium entitled &quot;Spiritual Robots&quot; at Stanford University, in which he moderated a panel consisting of [[Ray Kurzweil]], [[Hans Moravec]], [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]], [[Ralph Merkle]], [[Bill Joy]], [[Frank Drake]], [[John Henry Holland|John Holland]] and [[John Koza]]. Hofstadter was also an invited panelist at the first [[Singularity Summit]], held at Stanford in May 2006. Hofstadter expressed doubt about the likelihood of the singularity coming to pass in the foreseeable future.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Will Spiritual Robots Replace Humanity By 2100?&quot;, April 1, 2000 Note: as of 2007, videos seem to be missing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mooreslaw&quot;&gt;&quot;Moore's Law, Artificial Evolution, and the Fate of Humanity.&quot; In L.

In 1988 Dutch director Piet Hoenderdos created a docudrama about Hofstadter and his ideas, ''[[Victim of the Brain]]'', based on ''[[The Mind's I]]''. It includes interviews with Hofstadter about his work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8576072297424860224 Victim of the Brain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817051855/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8576072297424860224 |date=August 17, 2007 }} – 1988 docudrama about the ideas of Douglas Hofstadter&lt;/ref&gt;

== Columnist ==
When [[Martin Gardner]] retired from writing his &quot;[[Mathematical Games (column)|Mathematical Games]]&quot; column for ''[[Scientific American]]'' magazine, Hofstadter succeeded him in 1981–1983 with a column titled ''[[Metamagical Themas]]'' (an [[anagram]] of &quot;Mathematical Games&quot;). An idea he introduced in one of these columns was the concept of &quot;Reviews of This Book&quot;, a book containing nothing but cross-referenced reviews of itself which has an online implementation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reenigne.org/blog/review/ Online implementation of his ''Reviews of this Book'' idea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107122927/http://www.reenigne.org/blog/review/ |date=January 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Hofstadter's columns in ''Scientific American'' concerned the damaging effects of sexist language, and two chapters of his book ''[[Metamagical Themas]]'' are devoted to that topic, one of which is a biting analogy-based satire titled &quot;[http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/purity.html A Person Paper on Purity in Language]&quot; (1985), in which the reader's presumed revulsion at racism and racist language is used as a lever to motivate an analogous revulsion at sexism and sexist language; Hofstadter published it under the pseudonym William Satire, an allusion to [[William Safire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/purity.html A Person Paper on Purity in Language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516222831/http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/purity.html |date=May 16, 2015 }} by William Satire (alias Douglas R. Hofstadter), 1985 – a satirical piece, on the subject of sexist language&lt;/ref&gt; Another column reported on the discoveries made by University of Michigan professor [[Robert Axelrod]] in his computer tournament pitting many iterated [[prisoner's dilemma]] strategies against each other, and a follow-up column discussed a similar tournament that Hofstadter and his graduate student [[Marek Lugowski]] organized.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The &quot;Metamagical Themas&quot; columns ranged over many themes, and included, to name just three, one on patterns in [[Frédéric Chopin]]'s piano music (particularly his [[Études (Chopin)|études]]), another on the concept of [[superrationality]] (choosing to cooperate when the other party/adversary is assumed to be equally intelligent as oneself), and one on the [[self-modifying game]] of [[Nomic]], based on the way in which the legal system modifies itself, and developed by philosopher [[Peter Suber]].&lt;ref&gt;''Metamagical Themas'', Douglas R. Hofstadter, Basic Books, New Yoork (1985), see preface, introduction, contents listing.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Hofstadter was married to Carol Ann Brush until her death. They met in Bloomington, and married in Ann Arbor in 1985. They had two children, Danny and Monica.  Carol died in 1993 from the sudden onset of a brain tumor&amp;nbsp;– [[glioblastoma multiforme]]&amp;nbsp;– when their children were five and two. The Carol Ann Brush Hofstadter Memorial Scholarship for Bologna-bound Indiana University students was established in 1996 in her name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~frithome/alumni/spr96index.html French and Italian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212193054/http://www.indiana.edu/~frithome/alumni/spr96index.html |date=December 12, 2007 }} Spring 1996, Vol. X&lt;/ref&gt; Hofstadter's book ''[[Le Ton beau de Marot]]'' is dedicated to their two children and its dedication reads &quot;To M. &amp; D., living sparks of their Mommy's soul&quot;.

In the fall of 2010, Hofstadter met Baofen Lin in a [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|chacha]] class, and the two were married in Bloomington in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldtimesonline.com/srch.php?terms=hofstadter+baofen&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 {{Dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofstadter has composed numerous pieces for piano, and a few for piano and voice. He created an audio CD with the title ''DRH/JJ'', which includes all these compositions performed primarily by pianist Jane Jackson, but with a few performed by Brian Jones, Dafna Barenboim, Gitanjali Mathur and himself.&lt;ref&gt;Piano Music by Douglas Hofstadter (Audio CD) {{ISBN|1-57677-143-1}}, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The dedication for ''I Am A Strange Loop'' is: &quot;To my sister Laura, who can understand, and to our sister Molly, who cannot.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, Douglas R. ''I Am a Strange Loop,'' p. v. Basic Books, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Hofstadter explains in the preface that his younger sister Molly never developed the ability to speak or understand language.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, Douglas R. ''I Am a Strange Loop,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y2lmjHDS1dgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22i%20am%20a%20strange%20loop%22&amp;pg=PR11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. xi.] Basic Books, 2007. &quot;No one knew what it was, but Molly wasn't able to understand language or to speak (nor is she to this day, and we never did find out why).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of his attitudes about consciousness and empathy, Hofstadter has been a [[vegan]] for roughly half his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==In popular culture==
In the 1982 novel ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]'', [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s first sequel to ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', [[HAL 9000]] is described by Dr. Chandra as being caught in a &quot;Hofstadter–[[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]] loop&quot;. The movie uses the term &quot;H. Möbius loop&quot;.

On April 3, 1995, Hofstadter's book ''Fluid Concepts &amp; Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought'' was the first book ever sold by [[Amazon.com]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-first-book-ever-ordered-by-a-customer-on-Amazon] 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
