'''Dolly Rebecca Parton''' (born January 19, 1946) is an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, actress, author, businesswoman, and humanitarian, known primarily for her work in [[country music]]. After achieving success as a songwriter for others, Parton made her album debut in 1967 with ''[[Hello, I'm Dolly]]''. With steady success during the remainder of the 1960s (both as a solo artist and with a series of duet albums with [[Porter Wagoner]]), her sales and chart peak came during the 1970s and continued into the 1980s. Parton's albums in the 1990s did not sell as well, but she achieved commercial success again in the new millennium and has released albums on various independent labels since 2000, including her own label, Dolly Records.

Parton's music includes 25 [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA)-certified gold, platinum and multi-platinum awards. She has had 25 songs reach No. 1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country music charts, a record for a female artist (tied with [[Reba McEntire]]). She has 41 career top-10 country albums, a record for any artist, and she has 110 career charted singles over the past 40 years. She has garnered ten [[Grammy Award]]s, two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, ten [[Country Music Association Awards]], seven [[Academy of Country Music Awards]], three [[American Music Awards]], and is one of only seven female artists to win the Country Music Association's Entertainer of the Year Award. Parton has received 47 Grammy nominations.

In 1999, Parton was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. She has composed over 3,000 songs, including &quot;[[I Will Always Love You]]&quot; (a two-time U.S. country chart-topper, as well as an international pop hit for [[Whitney Houston]]), &quot;[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]&quot;, &quot;[[Coat of Many Colors (song)|Coat of Many Colors]]&quot;, and &quot;[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]&quot;. She is also [[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards#Four nominations|one of the few]] to have received at least one nomination from the Academy Awards, Grammy Awards, [[Tony Awards]], and [[Emmy Awards]]. As an actress, she has starred in films such as ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'' (1980) and ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' (1982), for which she earned [[Golden Globe]] nominations for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress]], as well as ''[[Rhinestone (film)|Rhinestone]]'' (1984), ''[[Steel Magnolias]]'' (1989), ''[[Straight Talk]]'' (1992) and ''[[Joyful Noise (film)|Joyful Noise]]'' (2012).

In 2020, at the age of 74, Parton received worldwide attention after posting four pictures in which she showed how she would present herself on the social media platforms [[LinkedIn]], [[Facebook]], [[Instagram]] and [[Tinder]]. The original post on Instagram&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.instagram.com/p/B7l01DEF4HI &quot;Dolly Parton challenge - Original post on Instagram&quot;], ''Dolly Parton''&lt;/ref&gt; went viral after celebrities posted their own versions of the so-called [[Dolly Parton challenge]] on social media.


==Early life and career==
Dolly Rebecca Parton was born January 19, 1946, in a one-room cabin on the banks of the [[Little Pigeon River (Tennessee)|Little Pigeon River]] in [[Pittman Center, Tennessee|Pittman Center]], a very small community in [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]] in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] of [[East Tennessee]].{{sfn|Parton|1994}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Randy L. (editor)|title=Dolly on Dolly: interviews and encounters with Dolly Parton|publisher=Chicago Review Press|year=2017|isbn=978-1-61373-519-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the fourth of 12 children born to Avie Lee Caroline ([[Maiden and married names|née]] Owens; 1923–2003) and Robert Lee Parton Sr. (1921–2000). Her father, known as &quot;Lee&quot;, worked in the mountains of East Tennessee, first as a [[sharecropper]] and later tending his own small tobacco farm and acreage. He also worked construction jobs to supplement the farm's small income. Mr. Parton was illiterate but Dolly Parton often says despite that fact, he was one of the smartest people she's known in regards to business and making a profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daddy's Dinner Bucket: Mr. Lee Parton|url=http://dollyparton.com/front-porch-stories/daddys-dinner-bucket-lee-parton/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Parton|1994}}&lt;ref name=&quot;belfasttelegraphifightilliteracy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Dolly Parton: 'I fight illiteracy for my father'|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/dolly-parton-i-fight-illiteracy-for-my-father-35185084.html|access-date=July 3, 2018|work=Belfast Telegraph|date=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avie Lee was homemaker for the large family. Her 11 pregnancies (the tenth being twins) in 20 years made her a mother of 12 by age 35. Often in poor health, she still managed to keep house and entertain her children with songs and tales of mountain folklore. Avie Lee's father, Jake Owens, was a [[Pentecostal]] preacher, so Parton and her siblings all attended church regularly. Parton has long credited her father for her business savvy, and her mother's family for her musical abilities.{{sfn|Parton|1994}}
While Dolly Parton was still very young, her family moved to a farm on nearby Locust Ridge. Most of her cherished memories of youth happened there, and it is the place about which she wrote the song &quot;[[My Tennessee Mountain Home (song)|My Tennessee Mountain Home]]&quot; in the 1970s. Parton bought back the Locust Ridge property in the 1980s.{{sfn|Parton|1994}} Two of her siblings are no longer living; Larry died shortly after birth in 1955, and Floyd died in 2018.{{sfn|Parton|1994}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dolly Parton's Brother, Floyd Parton, Dead at 61|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/dolly-parton-brother-floyd-parton-dead/|publisher=tasteofcountry.com|access-date=January 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music played an important role in her early life.

Her earliest public performances were in the church, beginning at age six. At seven, she started playing a homemade guitar.

Parton began performing as a child,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dolly performs on Cas Walker Show – WIVK Radio|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/music/uncle-bill-owens-introduces-dolly-to-cas-walker/|publisher=Dolly Parton Productions|access-date=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; singing on local radio and television programs in the [[East Tennessee]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Magill|first1=Frank Northen|last2=Aves|first2=Alison|title=Dictionary of World Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uiQAaGgOChIC&amp;pg=PA2896|access-date=July 14, 2014|year=1999|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-1-57958-048-3|page=2896}}&lt;/ref&gt; By ten, she was appearing on ''[[Cas Walker#Radio and television|The Cas Walker Show]]'' on both [[WIVK-FM|WIVK Radio]] and [[WBIR-TV]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], Tennessee.

After graduating from Sevier County High School in 1964, Parton moved to Nashville the next day.{{sfn|Parton|1994}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Backwoods Glam&quot;/&gt; Her initial success came as a songwriter, having signed with Combine Publishing shortly after her arrival;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Presentation: Dolly Parton Timeline|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/html/dollyparton/dollyparton-partontimeline.html|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|access-date=July 15, 2014|date=April 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with her frequent songwriting partner, her uncle Bill Owens, she wrote several charting singles during this time, including two top-10 hits: [[Bill Phillips (singer)|Bill Phillips]]'s &quot;Put It Off Until Tomorrow&quot; (1966) and [[Skeeter Davis]]'s &quot;[[Fuel to the Flame]]&quot; (1967). Her songs were recorded by many other artists during this period, including [[Kitty Wells]] and [[Hank Williams Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Whitburn|2005|pages=108, 422}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She signed with [[Monument Records]] in 1965, at age 19; she initially was pitched as a [[bubblegum pop]] singer. She released a string of singles, but the only one that charted, &quot;Happy, Happy Birthday Baby&quot;, did not crack the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Although she expressed a desire to record country material, Monument resisted, thinking her unique voice with its strong vibrato was not suited to the genre.

After her composition &quot;Put It Off Until Tomorrow&quot;, as recorded by Bill Phillips (with Parton, uncredited, on harmony), went to number six on the country chart in 1966, the label relented and allowed her to record country. Her first country single, &quot;Dumb Blonde&quot; (composed by [[Curly Putman]], one of the few songs during this era that she recorded but did not write), reached number 24 on the country chart in 1967, followed by &quot;Something Fishy&quot;, which went to number 17. The two songs appeared on her first full-length album, ''[[Hello, I'm Dolly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hello I'm Dolly – Dolly's first solo album 1967|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/music/hello-im-dolly-album/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==
===1967–1975: Country music success===
[[File:Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton 1969.jpg|thumb|upright|Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton in 1969]]
In 1967, musician and country music entertainer [[Porter Wagoner]] invited Parton to join his organization, offering her a regular spot on his weekly [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] television program ''The Porter Wagoner Show'', and in his road show. As documented in her 1994 autobiography,&lt;ref name=allMusicGuide/&gt; initially, much of Wagoner's audience was unhappy that [[Norma Jean (singer)|Norma Jean]], the performer whom Parton had replaced, had left the show, and was reluctant to accept Parton (sometimes chanting loudly for Norma Jean from the audience).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/301080/dolly-parton/biography|title=Dolly Parton-Biography|work=Billboard|access-date=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Wagoner's assistance, however, Parton was eventually accepted. Wagoner convinced his label, [[RCA Victor]], to sign her. RCA decided to protect their investment by releasing her first single as a [[duet]] with Wagoner. That song, a remake of [[Tom Paxton]]'s &quot;[[The Last Thing on My Mind]]&quot;, released in late 1967, reached the country top 10 in January 1968, launching a six-year streak of virtually uninterrupted top-10 singles for the pair.

Parton's first solo single for RCA Victor, &quot;[[Just Because I'm a Woman (1968 album)#Album information|Just Because I'm a Woman]]&quot;, was released in the summer of 1968 and was a moderate chart hit, reaching number 17. For the remainder of the decade, none of her solo efforts – even &quot;[[In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)]]&quot;, which later became a standard – were as successful as her duets with Wagoner. The duo was named [[Country Music Association Awards|Vocal Group of the Year]] in 1968 by the [[Country Music Association]], but Parton's solo records were continually ignored. Wagoner had a significant financial stake in her future; as of 1969, he was her co-producer and owned nearly half of Owe-Par,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dolly and Uncle Bill Owens start Owe-Par Publishing Company|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/awards_milestones/owe-par-publishing-company/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the publishing company Parton had founded with Bill Owens.

By 1970, both Parton and Wagoner had grown frustrated by her lack of solo chart success. Wagoner persuaded Parton to record [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]' &quot;[[Mule Skinner Blues]]&quot;, a [[gimmick]] that worked. The record shot to number three, followed closely, in February 1971, by her first number-one single, &quot;[[Joshua (song)|Joshua]]&quot;. For the next two years, she had numerous solo hits – including her signature song &quot;[[Coat of Many Colors]]&quot; (number four, 1971) – in addition to her duets. Top-20 singles included &quot;The Right Combination&quot; and &quot;Burning the Midnight Oil&quot; (both duets with Wagoner, 1971); &quot;Lost Forever in Your Kiss&quot;, (with Wagoner) &quot;[[Touch Your Woman]]&quot;, (1972) &quot;[[My Tennessee Mountain Home]]&quot; and &quot;Travelin' Man&quot; (1973).&lt;ref name=&quot;DollyPartonEntertainment.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dollypartonmusic.net|title=Dolly Parton Entertainment|access-date=October 7, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622025454/http://www.dollypartonmusic.net/|archive-date=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although her solo singles and the Wagoner duets were successful, her biggest hit of this period was &quot;[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]&quot;. Released in late 1973, it topped the country chart in February 1974 and reached the lower regions of the Hot 100. (It eventually also charted in the U.K., reaching number seven in 1976, representing Parton's first U.K. success). Parton, who had always envisioned a solo career, made the decision to leave Wagoner's organization; the pair performed their last duet concert in April 1974, and she stopped appearing on his TV show in mid-1974, although they remained affiliated. He helped produce her records through 1975.&lt;ref name=allMusicGuide&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1759|pure_url=yes}} Dolly Parton profile], Allmusic.com; accessed March 31, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The pair continued to release duet albums, their final release being 1975's ''Say Forever You'll Be Mine''.&lt;ref name=&quot;officialmusicwebsite&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dollypartonmusic.net|title=Dolly Parton official music website|work=Dolly Parton Entertainment|access-date=October 7, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622025454/http://www.dollypartonmusic.net/|archive-date=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, her song, &quot;[[I Will Always Love You]]&quot;, written about her professional break from Wagoner, went to number one on the country chart. Around the same time, [[Elvis Presley]] indicated that he wanted to record the song. Parton was interested until Presley's wily manager, [[Colonel Tom Parker]], told her that it was standard procedure for the songwriter to sign over half of the publishing rights to any song recorded by Presley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmt.com/artists/news/1535871/20060707/presley_elvis.jhtml|title=Dolly Parton Reflects on Her Greatest Moments|access-date=March 22, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012164144/http://cmt.com/artists/news/1535871/20060707/presley_elvis.jhtml|archive-date=October 12, 2007}}, cmt.com; July 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Parton refused. That decision has been credited with helping to make her many millions of dollars in royalties from the song over the years. Parton had three solo singles reach number one on the country chart in 1974 (&quot;Jolene&quot;, &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; and &quot;[[Love Is Like a Butterfly (song)|Love Is Like a Butterfly]]&quot;), as well as the duet with Porter Wagoner, &quot;[[Please Don't Stop Loving Me]]&quot;. In a 2019 episode of the [[Sky Arts]] music series ''Brian Johnson: A Life on the Road'', Parton described finding old cassette tapes and realizing that she'd composed both &quot;Jolene&quot; and &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; in the same songwriting session, telling Johnson &quot;Buddy, that was a good night.&quot; Parton again topped the singles chart in 1975 with &quot;[[The Bargain Store]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dollymania.net/chartb.html On The Charts – The Singles], dollymania.net; accessed September 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1976–1986: Pop transition===
[[File:Young-Dolly-Parton.jpg|thumb|upright|Parton in 1977]]
From 1974 to 1980, she consistently charted in the country [[Top 40|Top 10]], with eight singles reaching number one. Parton had her own syndicated television variety show, ''[[Dolly!]]'' (1976–77) Many performers, including [[Rose Maddox]], [[Kitty Wells]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Emmylou Harris]], and [[Linda Ronstadt]] covered her songs. Her siblings Randy and Stella both received recording contracts of their own.&lt;ref name=allMusicGuide/&gt;

Parton began to embark on a high-profile crossover campaign, attempting to aim her music in a more mainstream direction and increase her visibility outside of the confines of country music. In 1976, she began working closely with [[Sandy Gallin]], who served as her personal manager for the next 25 years. With her 1976 album ''[[All I Can Do (album)|All I Can Do]]'', which she co-produced with Porter Wagoner, Parton began taking more of an active role in production, and began specifically aiming her music in a more mainstream, pop direction. Her first entirely self-produced effort, ''[[New Harvest...First Gathering]]'' (1977), highlighted her pop sensibilities, both in terms of choice of songs – the album contained covers of the pop and R&amp;B classics &quot;[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]&quot; and &quot;[[(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher|Higher and Higher]]&quot; – and production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Harvest...First Gathering – 18th Solo Album|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/music/new-harvest-first-gathering-album/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the album was well received and topped the U.S. country albums chart, neither it nor its single &quot;[[Light of a Clear Blue Morning]]&quot; made much of an impression on the pop charts.

After ''New Harvest'''s disappointing chart performance, Parton turned to high-profile pop producer [[Gary Klein (producer)|Gary Klein]] for her next album. The result, 1977's ''[[Here You Come Again]],'' became her first million-seller, topping the country album chart and reaching number 20 on the pop chart. The [[Barry Mann]]-[[Cynthia Weil]]-penned [[Here You Come Again (song)|title track]] topped the country singles chart, and became Parton's first top-ten single on the pop chart (#3). A second single, the double A-sided &quot;[[Two Doors Down]]&quot;/&quot;[[It's All Wrong, But It's All Right]]&quot; topped the country chart and crossed over to the pop Top 20. For the remainder of the 1970s and into the early 1980s, many of her subsequent singles moved up on both charts simultaneously. Her albums during this period were developed specifically for pop-[[crossover (music)|crossover]] success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dolly Parton's Official Song List|url=http://dollyparton.com/music-discography-song-list/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Parton won a [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance]] for her ''Here You Come Again'' album. She continued to have hits with &quot;[[Heartbreaker (Dolly Parton song)|Heartbreaker]]&quot;, (1978) &quot;[[Baby I'm Burning]]&quot; (1979) and &quot;[[You're the Only One (Dolly Parton song)|You're the Only One]],&quot; (1979) all of which charted in the pop [[Top 40]] and topped the country chart. &quot;[[Sweet Summer Lovin']]&quot; (1979) became the first Parton single in two years to not top the country chart (though it did reach the Top 10). During this period, her visibility continued to increase, with multiple television appearances. A highly publicized candid interview on a ''[[Barbara Walters Special]]'' in 1977 (timed to coincide with ''Here You Come Again'''s release) was followed by appearances in 1978 on [[Cher]]'s ABC [[Cher... Special|television special]], and her own joint special with [[Carol Burnett]] on CBS, ''Carol and Dolly in Nashville''.

Parton served as one of three co-hosts (along with [[Roy Clark]] and [[Glen Campbell]]) on the CBS special ''Fifty Years of Country Music''. In 1979, Parton hosted the NBC special ''The Seventies: An Explosion of Country Music'', performed live at the [[Ford Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and whose audience included President [[Jimmy Carter]].
Her commercial success grew in 1980, with three consecutive country chart number-one hits: the [[Donna Summer]]-written &quot;[[Starting Over Again (Donna Summer song)|Starting Over Again]]&quot;, &quot;[[Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You]]&quot;, and &quot;[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]&quot;, which topped the country and pop charts in early 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;allMusicGuide&quot;/&gt; She had another Top 10 single that year with &quot;Making Plans&quot;, a single released from a 1980 [[Porter &amp; Dolly|reunion album with Porter Wagoner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Just Between Me And You compilation w/Porter Wagoner|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/music/just-between-you-and-me-compilation/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dolly Parton 2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Dolly Parton holding a baby in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], 1983]]
The theme song to the 1980 feature film ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'', in which she starred along with [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Lily Tomlin]], &quot;9 to 5&quot;, not only reached number one on the country chart, but also, in February 1981, reached number one on the pop and the [[adult contemporary music|adult-contemporary]] charts, giving her a triple number-one hit. Parton became one of the few female country singers to have a number-one single on the country and pop charts simultaneously. It also received a nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]. Her singles continued to appear consistently in the country Top 10. Between 1981 and 1985, she had 12 Top-10 hits; half of them hit number one. She continued to make inroads on the pop chart as well. A re-recorded version of &quot;I Will Always Love You,&quot; from the feature film ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' (1982) scraped the Top 50 that year and her duet with [[Kenny Rogers]], &quot;[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]&quot; (written by the [[Bee Gees]] and produced by [[Barry Gibb]]), spent two weeks at number one in 1983.&lt;ref name=allMusicGuide/&gt;

In the mid-1980s, her record sales were still relatively strong, with &quot;[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]&quot;, &quot;[[Downtown (Petula Clark song)|Downtown]]&quot;, &quot;[[Tennessee Homesick Blues]]&quot; (1984), &quot;[[Real Love (Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers song)|Real Love]]&quot; (another duet with Kenny Rogers), &quot;[[Don't Call It Love]]&quot; (1985) and &quot;[[Think About Love]]&quot; (1986) all reaching the country Top 10 (&quot;Tennessee Homesick Blues&quot; and &quot;Think About Love&quot; reached number one; &quot;Real Love&quot; also reached number one on the country chart and became a modest crossover hit). However, RCA Records did not renew her contract after it expired in 1986, and she signed with [[Columbia Records]] in 1987.&lt;ref name=allMusicGuide/&gt;

===1987–2005: Country and bluegrass period===
Along with [[Emmylou Harris]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]], she released ''[[Trio (Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris album)|Trio]]'' (1987) to critical acclaim. The album revitalized Parton's music career, spending five weeks at number one on ''Billboard's'' Country Albums chart, and also reached the top 10 on ''Billboard'''s Top-200 Albums chart. It sold several million copies and produced four Top 10 country hits, including [[Phil Spector]]'s &quot;[[To Know Him Is to Love Him]]&quot;, which went to number one. ''Trio'' won the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]]. After a further attempt at pop success with ''[[Rainbow (Dolly Parton album)|Rainbow]],'' (1987) including the single &quot;[[The River Unbroken]]&quot;, Parton focused on recording country material. ''[[White Limozeen]]'' (1989) produced two number one hits in &quot;[[Why'd You Come in Here Lookin' Like That]]&quot; and &quot;[[Yellow Roses]]&quot;. Although Parton's career appeared to be revived, it was actually just a brief revival before contemporary country music came in the early 1990s and moved most veteran artists off the charts.&lt;ref name=allMusicGuide/&gt;

[[File:Dolly Parton with square red earrings.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Dolly Parton at a recording session ca 1989]]A duet with [[Ricky Van Shelton]], &quot;[[Rockin' Years]]&quot; (1991) reached number one, though Parton's greatest commercial fortune of the decade came when Whitney Houston recorded &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; for the soundtrack of the feature film ''[[The Bodyguard (1992 film)|The Bodyguard]]'' (1992). Both the single and the album were massively successful. Parton's soundtrack album from the 1992 film, ''[[Straight Talk]]'', however, was less successful. But her 1993 album ''[[Slow Dancing with the Moon]]'' won critical acclaim and did well on the charts, reaching number four on the country albums chart, and number 16 on the ''Billboard'' 200 album chart. She recorded &quot;The Day I Fall in Love&quot; as a duet with [[James Ingram]] for the feature film ''[[Beethoven's 2nd (film)|Beethoven's 2nd]]'' (1993). The songwriters (Ingram, [[Carole Bayer Sager]], and [[Clif Magness]]) were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song, and Parton and Ingram performed the song at the awards telecast. Similar to her earlier collaborative album with Harris and Ronstadt, Parton released ''[[Honky Tonk Angels]]'' in the fall of 1993 with [[Loretta Lynn]] and [[Tammy Wynette]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;&gt;[http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/parton_dolly/bio.jhtml &quot;Dolly Parton Biography.&quot;] [[Country Music Television]]; retrieved February 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It was certified as [[Oro album|a gold album]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] and helped revive both Wynette and Lynn's careers. Also in 1994, Parton contributed the song &quot;You Gotta Be My Baby&quot; to the AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/red-hot-country-mw0000622534|title=Red Hot + Country – Various Artists &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|date=September 13, 1994|access-date=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A live acoustic album, ''[[Heartsongs: Live from Home]]'', featuring stripped-down versions of some of her hits, as well as some traditional songs, was released in late 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Barry Weber|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/heartsongs-live-from-home-mw0000119223|title=Heartsongs: Live from Home – Dolly Parton &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parton's recorded music during the mid- to late-1990s remained steady and somewhat eclectic. Her 1995 re-recording of &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; (performed as a duet with [[Vince Gill]]), from her album ''[[Something Special (Dolly Parton album)|Something Special]].'' won the Country Music Association's [[Country Music Association Awards#Awards by year|Vocal Event of the Year Award]]. The following year, ''[[Treasures (Dolly Parton album)|Treasures]]'', an album of covers of 1960s/70s hits was released, and featured a diverse collection of material, including songs by [[Mac Davis]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Cat Stevens]], and [[Neil Young]]. Her recording of Stevens' &quot;[[Peace Train]]&quot; was later re-mixed and released as a dance single, reaching ''Billboard's ''dance singles chart. Her 1998 country-rock album ''[[Hungry Again]]'' was made up entirely of her own compositions. Although neither of the album's two singles, &quot;(Why Don't More Women Sing) Honky Tonk Songs&quot; and &quot;Salt in my Tears&quot;, charted, videos for both songs received significant airplay on [[Country Music Television|CMT]]. A second and more contemporary collaboration with Harris and Ronstadt, ''[[Trio II]]'', was released in early 1999. Its cover of Neil Young's song &quot;[[After the Gold Rush (song)|After the Gold Rush]]&quot; won a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]]. Parton also was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1999.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

Parton recorded a series of [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]-inspired albums, beginning with ''[[The Grass Is Blue]]'' (1999), winning a [[Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album]]; and ''[[Little Sparrow]]'' (2001), with its cover of [[Collective Soul]]'s &quot;[[Shine (Collective Soul song)|Shine]]&quot; winning a [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance]]. The third, ''[[Halos &amp; Horns]]'' (2002) included a bluegrass version of the [[Led Zeppelin]] song &quot;[[Stairway to Heaven]]&quot;. In 2005, she released ''[[Those Were the Days (Dolly Parton album)|Those Were The Days]]'' consisting of her interpretations of hits from the [[folk-rock]] era of the late 1960s and early 1970s, including &quot;[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]&quot;, &quot;[[Where Do the Children Play?]]&quot;, &quot;[[Crimson and Clover]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Where Have All the Flowers Gone?]]&quot;&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

===2005–present===
Parton earned her second Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song for &quot;[[Transamerica (soundtrack)|Travelin' Thru]],&quot; which she wrote specifically for the feature film ''[[Transamerica (film)|Transamerica]].'' (2005) Due to the song's (and film's) acceptance of a [[transgender]] woman, Parton received [[death threats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wunderink, Susan|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/glimpses/2008/backwoodsbarbie.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804100023/http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/glimpses/2008/backwoodsbarbie.html|archive-date=August 4, 2008|title=Dolly Parton – Backwoods Barbie (Dolly Records)|work=[[Christianity Today]]|date=August 4, 2008|access-date=February 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to number one on the country chart later in 2005 by lending her distinctive harmonies to the [[Brad Paisley]] ballad, &quot;[[When I Get Where I'm Going]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

In addition to the title song for ''9 to 5,'' she also recorded a second version of &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; for ''The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas'' (1982). The second version was a number one country hit and also reached number 53 on the pop charts.
&quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; has been covered by many country artists, including Ronstadt on ''[[Prisoner In Disguise]]'' (1975), Kenny Rogers on ''[[Vote for Love]]'' (1996), and [[LeAnn Rimes]] on ''[[Unchained Melody: The Early Years]]'' (1997). Whitney Houston performed it on ''The Bodyguard'' soundtrack and her version became the best-selling hit both written and performed by a female vocalist, with worldwide sales of over 12 million copies. In addition, the song has been translated into Italian and performed by the Welsh opera singer [[Katherine Jenkins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridgeindependent.co.uk/whats-on/review-an-evening-with-katherine-jenkins-comes-to-cambridge-9070477/|title=Review: An Evening with Katherine Jenkins comes to Cambridge|last=Peel|first=Adrian|date=2019-05-16|website=Cambridge Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acting career==
===Acting breakthrough===
In addition to her performing appearances on ''[[The Porter Wagoner Show]]'' in the 1960s and into the 1970s, her two self-titled television variety shows in the [[Dolly!|1970s]] and [[Dolly (TV series)|1980s]], and on ''American Idol'' in 2008 and other guest appearances, Parton has had television roles. In 1979, she received an Emmy award nomination as &quot;Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Variety Program&quot; for her guest appearance in a [[Cher]] special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dolly Parton|url=http://www.allgoodseats.com/Dolly-Parton.html|website=AllGoodSeats.com|publisher=All Good Seats|access-date=June 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the mid-1970s, Parton wanted to expand her audience base. Although her first attempt, the television variety show ''[[Dolly!]]'' (1976–77), had high ratings, it lasted only one season, with Parton requesting to be released from her contract because of the stress it was causing on her [[vocal cords]] (she later tried a second television variety show, also titled ''[[Dolly (TV series)|Dolly]]'' (1987–88); it too lasted only one season).

In her first feature film, Parton portrayed a secretary in a leading role with [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Lily Tomlin]] in the comedy film ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'' (1980). The movie highlights the discrimination of women in a working environment and created awareness of the National Association of Working Women (9–5).{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} She received nominations for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] and a [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall of Fame&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/bio/C137|title=Dolly Parton – Biography|publisher=[[Songwriters Hall of Fame]]|access-date=February 12, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910084613/http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/bio/C137|archive-date=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Golden Globes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/28736|title=Award Search – Dolly Parton|publisher=[[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]]|access-date=February 12, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312114043/http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/28736|archive-date=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parton wrote and recorded the film's title song.

After a two-year hiatus from films, Parton was teamed with [[Sylvester Stallone]] for ''[[Rhinestone (film)|Rhinestone]]'' (1984).

Dean, who is retired from running an [[asphalt]] road-paving business in Nashville, has always shunned publicity and rarely accompanies his wife to any events. According to Parton, he has seen her perform only once. She also has said in interviews that, although it appears they spend little time together, it is simply that nobody sees him publicly. She has commented on Dean's romantic side, saying that he does spontaneous things to surprise her and sometimes even writes poems for her.{{sfn|Parton|1994|p=214}} In 2011 Parton said, &quot;We're really proud of our marriage.

Parton and Dean helped raise several of Parton's younger siblings in Nashville, leading her nieces and nephews to refer to her as &quot;Aunt Granny,&quot; a moniker that later lent its name to one of Parton's [[Dollywood]] restaurants. The couple have no children of their own, but Parton is the godmother of performer [[Miley Cyrus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20184725,00.html|first=Brian|last=Orloff|title=Dolly Parton Calls Miley Cyrus a 'Little Elvis'|newspaper=[[People (American magazine)|People]]|date=March 17, 2008|access-date=February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public image===
Parton has turned down several offers to pose nude for ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, but did appear on the cover of the October 1978 issue wearing a [[Playboy bunny]] outfit, complete with ears (the issue featured Lawrence Grobel's extensive and candid interview with Parton, representing one of her earliest high-profile interviews with the mainstream press). The association of breasts with Parton's public image is illustrated in the naming of [[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly the sheep]] after her, since the sheep was cloned from a cell taken from an adult ewe's mammary gland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/22/newsid_4245000/4245877.stm|title=1997: Dolly the Sheep Is Cloned|publisher=BBC News (&quot;On This Day – 1950–2005&quot; database)|date=n.d.|access-date=February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Weise, Elizabeth|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/genetics/2006-07-04-dolly-anniversary_x.htm|title=Dolly Was World's Hello to Cloning's Possibilities|work=[[USA Today]]|date=July 4, 2006|access-date=February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], Alabama, the [[General W.K.

===Philanthropy===
Since the mid-1980s, Parton has supported many charitable efforts, particularly in the area of literacy, primarily through her [[Dollywood Foundation]].
Her literacy program, Dolly Parton's Imagination Library,&lt;ref name=&quot;imagination&quot;&gt;[http://www.imaginationlibrary.com Dolly Parton's Imagination Library], imaginationlibrary.com; accessed February 21, 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; a part of the Dollywood Foundation, mails one book per month to each enrolled child from the time of their birth until they enter kindergarten.

The Dollywood Foundation, funded from Parton's profits, has been noted for bringing jobs and tax revenues to a previously depressed region. Parton also has worked to raise money for several other causes, including the [[American Red Cross]] and [[HIV/AIDS]]-related charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/dolly-parton|title=Dolly Parton: Charity Work &amp; Causes|publisher=Look to the Stars|access-date=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
