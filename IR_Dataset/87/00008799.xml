==Hijacking==
On [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] eve, November 24, 1971, a middle-aged man carrying a black attaché case approached the flight counter of [[Northwest Airlines|Northwest Orient Airlines]] at [[Portland International Airport]].

Cooper opened his briefcase long enough for her to glimpse eight red cylinders&lt;ref name=&quot;cylinders&quot; /&gt; (&quot;four on top of four&quot;) attached to wires coated with red insulation, and a large cylindrical battery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://n467us.com/Data%20Files/Logs%2006-20-2008R.pdf Transcript of Crew Communications] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053644/http://n467us.com/Data%20Files/Logs%2006-20-2008R.pdf |date=September 21, 2013 }}, N467us.com Retrieved February 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; After closing the briefcase, he stated his demands: $200,000 in &quot;negotiable American currency&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;twenty&quot; /&gt; four parachutes (two primary and two reserve); and a fuel truck standing by in Seattle to refuel the aircraft upon arrival.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=18}} Schaffner conveyed Cooper's instructions to the pilots in the cockpit; when she returned, Cooper was wearing dark sunglasses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-NYmag2007-10-21&quot; /&gt;

The pilot, William Scott, contacted [[Seattle–Tacoma International Airport|Seattle–Tacoma Airport]] air traffic control, which in turn informed local and federal authorities. The 36 other passengers were given false information that their arrival in Seattle would be delayed because of a &quot;minor mechanical difficulty&quot;.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=20}} Northwest Orient's president, [[Donald Nyrop]], authorized payment of the ransom, and ordered all employees to cooperate fully with the hijacker's demands.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=19}} The aircraft circled [[Puget Sound]] for approximately two hours to allow [[Seattle Police Department|Seattle police]] and the FBI sufficient time to assemble Cooper's parachutes and ransom money, and to mobilize emergency personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-NYmag2007-10-21&quot; /&gt;

Flight attendant Tina Mucklow recalled that Cooper appeared familiar with the local terrain; at one point he remarked, &quot;Looks like [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] down there,&quot; as the aircraft flew above it. He also correctly mentioned that [[McChord Field|McChord Air Force Base]] was only a 20-minute drive (at that time) from Seattle-Tacoma Airport. Schaffner described him as calm, polite, and well-spoken, not at all consistent with the stereotypes (enraged, hardened criminals or [[List of Cuba–United States aircraft hijackings|&quot;take-me-to-Cuba&quot;]] political dissidents) popularly associated with [[air piracy]] at the time{{According to whom|date=January 2020}}. Mucklow stated, &quot;He wasn't nervous,&quot; she told investigators. &quot;He seemed rather nice. He was never cruel or nasty. He was thoughtful and calm all the time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-NYmag2007-10-21&quot; /&gt; He ordered a second bourbon and soda, paid his drink tab (and attempted to give Mucklow the change),&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-NYmag2007-10-21&quot; /&gt; and offered to request meals for the flight crew during the stop in Seattle.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=22}}

FBI agents assembled the ransom money from several Seattle-area banks&amp;nbsp;– 10,000 unmarked 20-dollar bills, most with serial numbers beginning with the letter &quot;L&quot; indicating issuance by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco]], and most from the 1963A or 1969 series&lt;ref name = &quot;check-six&quot; /&gt;&amp;nbsp;– and made a [[Microform|microfilm]] photograph of each of them.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=25}} Cooper rejected the military-issue parachutes offered by McChord AFB personnel, instead demanding civilian parachutes with manually operated [[ripcord (skydiving)|ripcords]]. Seattle police obtained them from a local [[Parachuting|skydiving]] school.&lt;ref name=&quot;crime museum&quot; /&gt;

===Passengers released===
At 5:24&amp;nbsp;p.m. PST, Cooper was informed that his demands had been met, and at 5:39&amp;nbsp;p.m. the aircraft landed at Seattle-Tacoma Airport.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=43}} It was more than an hour after sunset and Cooper instructed Scott to taxi the jet to an isolated, brightly lit section of the [[Airport apron|apron]] and close each window shade&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Mystery: D. B. Cooper |network=NBC |date=October 12, 1988 |series=[[Unsolved Mysteries]] |series-no=1 |number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the cabin to deter police [[sniper]]s. Northwest Orient's Seattle operations manager, Al Lee, approached the aircraft in street clothes to avoid the possibility that Cooper might mistake his airline uniform for that of a police officer. He delivered the cash-filled knapsack and parachutes to Mucklow via the aft stairs. Once the delivery was completed, Cooper ordered all passengers, Schaffner, and senior flight attendant Alice Hancock to leave the plane.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=28}}

During refueling, Cooper outlined his flight plan to the cockpit crew: a southeast course toward [[Mexico City]] at the minimum airspeed possible without stalling the aircraft&amp;nbsp;– approximately {{convert|100|kn|round=5}}&amp;nbsp;– at a maximum {{convert|10000|ft|adj=on}} altitude. He further specified that the [[landing gear]] remain deployed in the takeoff/landing position, the [[Flap (aeronautics)|wing flaps]] be lowered 15&amp;nbsp;degrees, and the cabin remain [[cabin pressurization|unpressurized]].&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg and Ulvaeus, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Copilot William Rataczak informed Cooper that the aircraft's range was limited to approximately {{convert|1000|mi}} under the specified flight configuration, which meant that a second refueling would be necessary before entering [[Mexico]]. Cooper and the crew discussed options and agreed on [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], [[Nevada]], as the refueling {{nowrap|stop.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=45}}}} With the plane's rear exit door open and its staircase extended, Cooper directed the pilot to take off. Northwest's home office objected, on grounds that it was unsafe to take off with the aft staircase deployed. Cooper countered that it was indeed safe, but he would not argue the point; he would lower it once they were airborne.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=33–34}}

An [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] official requested a face-to-face meeting with Cooper aboard the aircraft, which was denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rothenberg | first1 = David | last2 = Ulvaeus | first2 = Marta | title = The New Earth Reader: The Best of Terra Nova | publisher = [[MIT Press]] | year = 1999 | location = [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]] | page = [https://archive.org/details/newearthreaderbe0000unse/page/4 4] | isbn = 978-0-262-18195-2 | url = https://archive.org/details/newearthreaderbe0000unse/page/4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The refueling process was delayed because of a [[vapor lock]] in the fuel tanker truck's pumping mechanism. However, once refueling had been completed, the plane was able to take off.

===Back in the air===
[[File:Rwr727tail.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 727]] with the aft airstair open]]
At approximately 7:40&amp;nbsp;p.m., the Boeing 727 took off with only five people on board: Cooper, pilot Scott, flight attendant Mucklow, copilot Rataczak, and flight engineer H. E. Anderson. Two [[Convair F-106 Delta Dart|F-106]] fighter aircraft were scrambled from McChord Air Force Base and followed behind the airliner, one above it and one below, out of Cooper's view.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=36}} A [[Lockheed T-33]] trainer, diverted from an unrelated [[Air National Guard]] mission, also shadowed the 727 before running low on fuel and turning back near the Oregon–[[California]] state line.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=53}} Overall there were five planes in total trailing the hijacked plane. None of the pilots saw him jump or could pinpoint a location where he could have landed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url=https://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1846670_1846800_1846854,00.html|title=Top Ten Famous disappearances}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After takeoff, Cooper told Mucklow to join the rest of the crew in the cockpit and remain there with the door closed. As she complied, Mucklow observed Cooper tying something around his waist. At approximately 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., a warning light flashed in the cockpit, indicating that the aft [[airstair]] apparatus had been activated. The crew's offer of assistance via the aircraft's intercom system was curtly refused. The crew soon noticed a subjective change of air pressure, indicating that the aft door was open.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=56}}

At approximately 8:13&amp;nbsp;p.m., the aircraft's tail section sustained a sudden upward movement, significant enough to require trimming to bring the plane back to level flight.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|pp=58, 66}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Braggp4&quot;&gt;Bragg, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; At approximately 10:15&amp;nbsp;p.m., the aircraft's aft airstair was still deployed when Scott and Rataczak landed the 727 at [[Reno–Tahoe International Airport|Reno Airport]]. FBI agents, state troopers, sheriff's deputies, and Reno police surrounded the jet, as it had not yet been determined with certainty that Cooper was no longer aboard, but an armed search quickly confirmed his absence.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=48}}

==Investigation==
FBI agents recovered 66 unidentified latent fingerprints aboard the airliner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pasternak-USNWR2000-07-24&quot; /&gt; The agents also found Cooper's black clip-on tie, his tie clip and two of the four parachutes,&lt;ref name=&quot;parachutes&quot; /&gt; one of which had been opened and two shroud (suspension) lines cut from its canopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = F.B.I. reheats cold case | work = [[National Post]] | last = Cowan | first = James | date = January 3, 2008 | url = https://nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=211616 | archive-url = https://archive.today/20080121231748/http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=211616 | url-status = dead | archive-date = January 21, 2008 | access-date = January 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities interviewed eyewitnesses in Portland, Seattle, and Reno, and all those who personally interacted with Cooper.

A precise search area was difficult to define, as even small differences in estimates of the aircraft's speed, or the environmental conditions along the flight path (which varied significantly by location and altitude), changed Cooper's projected landing point considerably.&lt;ref name=&quot;new&quot; /&gt; An important variable was the length of time he remained in free fall before pulling his ripcord—if indeed he succeeded in opening a parachute at all.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=68}} Neither of the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] fighter pilots saw anything exit the airliner, either visually or on [[radar]], nor did they see a parachute open; but at night, with extremely limited visibility and cloud cover obscuring any ground lighting below, an airborne human figure clad entirely in black clothing could easily have gone undetected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = D.B.

In an experimental re-creation, Scott piloted the aircraft used in the hijacking in the same flight configuration.

The FBI also coordinated an aerial search, using fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters from the [[Oregon Army National Guard]], along the entire flight path (known as [[Victor airways|Victor 23]] in standard aviation terminology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aeronautical Information Manual |publisher=Federal Aviation Administration |url=http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim/chap5/aim0503.html |access-date=August 10, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721041334/http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim/Chap5/aim0503.html |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; but &quot;Vector 23&quot; in most Cooper {{Nowrap|literature&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-NYmag2007-10-21&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pasternak-USNWR2000-07-24&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Nuttall|2010|pp=90–91}})}} from Seattle to Reno. Although numerous broken treetops and several pieces of plastic and other objects resembling parachute canopies were sighted and investigated, nothing relevant to the hijacking was found.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=71}}

Shortly after the spring thaw in early 1972, teams of FBI agents aided by some 200 [[United States Army|Army]] soldiers from [[Fort Lewis]], along with Air Force personnel, National Guardsmen, and civilian volunteers, conducted another thorough ground search of Clark and Cowlitz counties for eighteen days in March, and then an additional eighteen days in April.{{sfn|Olson|2010|p=34}} Electronic Explorations Company, a marine salvage firm, used a [[submarine]] to search the {{convert|200|ft|m|adj=on}} depths of Lake Merwin.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=101–104}} Two local women stumbled upon a skeleton in an abandoned structure in Clark County; it was later identified as the remains of a female teenager who had been abducted and murdered several weeks before.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=86}} Ultimately, the search and recovery operation—arguably the most extensive, and intensive, in U.S. history—uncovered no significant material evidence related to the hijacking.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=87–89}}

===Search for ransom money===
A month after the hijacking, the FBI distributed lists of the ransom serial numbers to financial institutions, [[casino]]s, racetracks, and other businesses that routinely conducted significant cash transactions, and to law enforcement agencies around the world. Northwest Orient offered a reward of 15% of the recovered money, to a maximum of $25,000. In early 1972, [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] [[John N. Mitchell]] released the serial numbers to the general public.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot; /&gt; In 1972, two men used counterfeit 20-dollar bills printed with Cooper serial numbers to swindle $30,000 from a ''[[Newsweek]]'' reporter named Karl Fleming in exchange for an interview with a man they falsely claimed was the hijacker.&lt;ref&gt;[https://vault.fbi.gov/D-B-Cooper%20/D-B-Cooper-Part-1-of-7/view FBI files on Fleming case, released via Freedom of Information Act] Retrieved February 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=July 2018}}

In early 1973, with the ransom money still missing, ''[[The Oregon Journal]]'' republished the serial numbers and offered $1,000 to the first person to turn in a ransom bill to the newspaper or any FBI field office. In Seattle, the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer|Post-Intelligencer]]'' made a similar offer with a $5,000 reward. The offers remained in effect until Thanksgiving 1974, and though there were several near-matches, no genuine bills were found.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=95}} In 1975 Northwest Orient's insurer, Global Indemnity Co., complied with an order from the [[Supreme Court of Minnesota|Minnesota Supreme Court]] and paid the airline's $180,000 claim on the ransom money.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=184}}

===Later developments===
Subsequent analyses indicated that the original landing zone estimate was inaccurate: Scott, who was flying the aircraft manually because of Cooper's speed and altitude demands, later determined that his flight path was significantly farther east than initially assumed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seven1996-11-17&quot; /&gt; Additional data from a variety of sources—in particular [[Continental Airlines]] pilot Tom Bohan, who was flying four minutes behind Flight 305—indicated that the wind direction factored into drop zone calculations had been wrong, possibly by as much as 80 degrees.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=111–113}} This and other supplemental data suggested that the actual drop zone was probably south-southeast of the original estimate, in the drainage area of the [[Washougal River]].{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=114–116}}

===Investigation suspended===
On July 8, 2016, the FBI announced that it was suspending active investigation of the Cooper case, citing a need to focus its investigative resources and manpower on issues of higher and more urgent priority. Local field offices will continue to accept any legitimate physical evidence—related specifically to the parachutes or the ransom money—that may emerge in the future. The 60-volume case file compiled over the 45-year course of the investigation will be preserved for historical purposes at [[FBI headquarters]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] On the FBI website, there is currently a 28-part packet full of evidence gathered over the years. All the evidence is open to the public to read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vault.fbi.gov/D-B-Cooper%20|title=DB Cooper Vault|publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]|access-date=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/seattle/press-releases/2016/update-on-investigation-of-1971-hijacking-by-d.b.-cooper|title=Update on Investigation of 1971 Hijacking by D.B. Cooper|publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]|access-date=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical evidence==
The official physical description of Cooper has remained unchanged and is considered reliable. Flight attendants Schaffner and Mucklow, who spent the most time with Cooper, were interviewed on the same night in separate cities,&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI-Redux&quot; /&gt; and gave nearly identical descriptions: {{convert|5|ft|10|in}} to {{convert|5|ft|11|in}} tall, {{convert|170|to|180|lb}}, mid-40s, with close-set piercing brown eyes and swarthy skin.&lt;ref name=&quot;enigma&quot; /&gt;

Three major pieces of evidence were left on the plane when D.B. Cooper jumped:  His black clip on tie, a mother of pearl tie clip, and eight filter-tipped Raleigh cigarette butts.  The information about the tie and tie clip were not announced to the public for almost 20 years, when in 1991 it was revealed in the book D.B. Cooper: The Real McCoy.  Sometime after the hijacking the cigarette butts were lost, and have not turned up since.&lt;ref&gt;The Curse of D.B. Cooper, Wall Street Journal, by Geoffrey Gray, August 6, 2011, https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903454504576488242006448106&lt;/ref&gt;

Only four pieces of evidence (two definite and two potential) linked to D. B. Cooper have turned up from 1978–2017:

*In November 1978, a placard printed with instructions for lowering the aft stairs of a 727 was found by a deer hunter near a logging road about {{convert|13|mi}} east of [[Castle Rock, Washington]], well north of Lake Merwin, but within Flight 305's basic flight path.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=108}}

===Subsequent FBI disclosures===
In late 2007, the FBI announced that a partial [[DNA]] profile had been obtained from three organic samples found on Cooper's clip-on tie in 2001,&lt;ref name=&quot;new&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = D.B.

They also disclosed that Cooper chose the older of the two primary parachutes supplied to him, rather than the technically superior professional sport parachute; and that from the two reserve parachutes, he selected a &quot;dummy&quot;—an unusable unit with an inoperative ripcord intended for classroom demonstrations,&lt;ref name=&quot;new&quot; /&gt; although it had clear markings identifying it to any experienced skydiver as non-functional.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=40}} (He cannibalized the other, functional reserve parachute, possibly using its shrouds to tie the money bag shut,&lt;ref name=&quot;new&quot; /&gt; and to secure the bag to his body as witnessed by Mucklow.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=53}}) The FBI stressed that inclusion of the dummy reserve parachute, one of four obtained in haste from a Seattle skydiving school, was accidental.&lt;ref name=&quot;King5&quot; /&gt;

In March 2009, the FBI disclosed that Tom Kaye, a [[paleontology|paleontologist]] from the [[Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture]] in Seattle, had assembled a team of &quot;citizen sleuths&quot;, including scientific illustrator Carol Abraczinskas and [[metallurgy|metallurgist]] Alan Stone. The group, eventually known as the Cooper Research Team,&lt;ref name=&quot;citizensleuths&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensleuths.com/|title=Home - Citizen Sleuths|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; reinvestigated important components of the case using [[GPS]], satellite imagery, and other technologies unavailable in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;isodbc&quot; /&gt; Although little new information was gained regarding the buried ransom money or Cooper's landing zone, they were able to find and analyze hundreds of minute particles on Cooper's tie using [[electron microscopy]]. ''[[Lycopodium]]'' spores (likely from a pharmaceutical product) were identified, as well as fragments of [[bismuth]] and [[aluminum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;citizensleuths&quot; /&gt;

In November 2011, Kaye announced that particles of pure (unalloyed) [[titanium]] had also been found on the tie. He explained that titanium, which was much rarer in the 1970s than in the 2010s, was at that time found only in metal fabrication or production facilities, or at chemical companies using it (combined with aluminum) to store extremely corrosive substances.&lt;ref&gt;

==Theories and conjectures==
[[File:Dbc.jpg|thumb|FBI sketches of Cooper, with age progression]]

Over the 45-year span of its active investigation, the FBI periodically made public some of its working hypotheses and tentative conclusions, drawn from witness testimony and the scarce physical evidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPR&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title = F.B.I.

===Suspect profiling===
Cooper appeared to be familiar with the Seattle area and may have been an Air Force veteran, based on testimony that he recognized the city of Tacoma from the air as the jet circled Puget Sound, and his accurate comment to Mucklow that McChord AFB was approximately 20&amp;nbsp;minutes' driving time from the Seattle-Tacoma Airport—a detail most civilians would not know, or comment upon.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=53}} His financial situation was very likely desperate. According to the FBI's retired chief investigator, Ralph Himmelsbach, [[extortion]]ists and other criminals who steal large amounts of money nearly always do so because they need it urgently; otherwise, the crime is not worth the considerable risk.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=96}} Alternatively, Cooper may have been &quot;a thrill seeker&quot; who made the jump &quot;just to prove it could be done.&quot;{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=115}}

Agents theorized that Cooper took his alias from a popular [[Belgian comics|Belgian comic book]] series of the 1970s featuring the fictional hero [[Dan Cooper (comics)|Dan Cooper]], a [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] test pilot who took part in numerous heroic adventures, including parachuting. (One cover from the series, reproduced on the FBI web site, depicts test pilot Cooper skydiving in full paratrooper regalia.)&lt;ref name=&quot;isodbc&quot; /&gt; Because the Dan Cooper comics were never translated into English, nor imported to the U.S., they speculated that he may have encountered them during a tour of duty in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;isodbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = In Search of D.B.

Evidence suggested that Cooper was knowledgeable about flying technique, aircraft, and the terrain. He demanded four parachutes to force the assumption that he might compel one or more hostages to jump with him, thus ensuring he would not be deliberately supplied with sabotaged equipment.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=44}} He chose a 727-100 aircraft because it was ideal for a bail-out escape, due to not only its aft airstair but also the high, aftward placement of all three engines, which allowed a reasonably safe jump despite the proximity of the engine exhaust. It had &quot;single-point fueling&quot; capability, a then-recent innovation that allowed all tanks to be refueled rapidly through a single fuel port. It also had the ability (unusual for a commercial jet airliner) to remain in slow, low-altitude flight without stalling; and Cooper knew how to control its air speed and altitude without entering the cockpit, where he could have been overpowered by the three pilots.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=46}} In addition, Cooper was familiar with important details, such as the appropriate flap setting of 15 degrees (which was unique to that aircraft), and the typical refueling time. He knew that the aft airstair could be lowered during flight—a fact never disclosed to civilian flight crews, since there was no situation on a passenger flight that would make it necessary—and that its operation, by a single switch in the rear of the cabin, could not be overridden from the cockpit.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=136}} Some of this knowledge was virtually unique to [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] paramilitary units.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=43}}

In addition to planning his escape, Cooper retrieved the note and wore dark glasses, which indicated that he had a certain level of sophistication in avoiding the things that had aided the identification of the perpetrator of the best-known case of a ransom: the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]]. It is not clear how he could have reasonably expected to ever spend the money, [[fence (criminal)|fence]] it at a discount or otherwise profit. Although Cooper made the familiar-from-fiction demand of non-sequentially numbered small bills, mass publicity over the Lindbergh case had long made it public knowledge that even with 1930s technology, getting non-sequential bills in a ransom was no defense against the numbers being logged and used to track down a perpetrator. In the Lindbergh case, fencing what he could as hot money and being very careful with what he did personally pass, the perpetrator had been caught through the ransom money nonetheless, with identification and handwriting evidence brought in only at the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Acamstoday|title=The Lindbergh Case: How Bankers Helped Solve It|url=http://www.acamstoday.org/the-lindberg-case-how-banker-helped-solve-it/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although unconscionably perilous by the high safety, training and equipment standards of [[skydiver]]s, whether Cooper's jump was virtually suicidal is a matter of dispute. The author of an overview and comparison of [[World War II]] aircrew bail-outs with Cooper's drop asserts a probability for his survival, and suggests that like copycat Martin McNally, Cooper lost the ransom during descent. The mystery of how the ransom could have been washed into Tena Bar from any Cooper jump area remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Survival Probability Analysis of the D.B.

According to Kaye's research team, Cooper's meticulous planning may also have extended to the timing of his operation and even his choice of attire. &quot;The FBI searched but couldn't find anyone who disappeared that weekend,&quot; Kaye wrote, suggesting that the perpetrator may have returned to his normal occupation. &quot;If you were planning on going 'back to work on Monday', then you would need as much time as possible to get out of the woods, find transportation and get home. The very best time for this is in front of a four-day weekend, which is the timing Dan Cooper chose for his crime.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;if he was planning ahead, he knew he had to hitchhike out of the woods, and it is much easier to get picked up in a suit and tie than in old blue jeans.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;conclusions&quot; /&gt;

The Bureau was more skeptical, concluding that Cooper lacked crucial skydiving skills and experience. &quot;We originally thought Cooper was an experienced jumper, perhaps even a [[paratrooper]],&quot; said Special Agent Larry Carr, leader of the investigative team from 2006 until its dissolution in 2016. &quot;We concluded after a few years this was simply not true. A Boeing 727 at flaps 15 degrees and light weight probably flies at 150 knots or 172 mph.  No experienced parachutist would have jumped in the pitch-black night, in the rain, with a 172 mph wind in his face wearing loafers and a trench coat. It was simply too risky. He also missed that his reserve parachute was only for training and had been sewn shut—something a skilled skydiver would have checked.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;isodbc&quot; /&gt; He also failed to bring or request a helmet,{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=15}} chose to jump with the older and technically inferior of the two primary parachutes supplied to him,&lt;ref name=&quot;new&quot; /&gt; and jumped into a probable 15 degrees Fahrenheit wind at 10,000 feet in November over Washington state without proper protection against the extreme wind chill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper = USA Today|title=D.B.

The FBI speculated from the beginning that Cooper did not survive his jump.&lt;ref name=&quot;isodbc&quot; /&gt; &quot;Diving into the wilderness without a plan, without the right equipment, in such terrible conditions, he probably never even got his chute open,&quot; said Carr.&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI-Redux&quot; /&gt; Even if he did land safely, agents contended that survival in the mountainous terrain at the onset of winter would have been all but impossible without an [[accomplice]] at a predetermined landing point. This would have required a precisely timed jump—necessitating, in turn, cooperation from the flight crew. There is no evidence that Cooper requested or received any such help from the crew, nor that he had any clear idea where he was when he jumped into the stormy, overcast darkness.&lt;ref name=&quot;enigma&quot;&gt;&quot;It's an Enigma.&quot; [http://www.jcs-group.com/enigma/crimes/cooper.html JCS-Group.com] Recovered January 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recovered ransom money===
The 1980 cash discovery launched several new rounds of conjecture and ultimately raised more questions than it answered. Initial statements by investigators and scientific consultants were founded on the assumption that the bundled bills washed freely into the Columbia River from one of its many connecting tributaries. An [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] [[Hydrology|hydrologist]] noted that the bills had disintegrated in a &quot;rounded&quot; fashion and were matted together, indicating that they had been deposited by river action, as opposed to having been deliberately buried.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=110}} That conclusion, if correct, supported the opinion that Cooper had not landed near Lake Merwin nor any tributary of the Lewis River, which feeds into the Columbia well downstream from Tina Bar. It also lent credence to supplemental speculation (see [[#Later developments|Later developments]] above) that placed the drop zone near the Washougal River, which merges with the Columbia upstream from the discovery site.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=110–111}}

But the &quot;free-floating&quot; hypothesis presented its own difficulties; it did not explain the ten bills missing from one packet, nor was there a logical reason that the three packets would have remained together after separating from the rest of the money. Physical evidence was incompatible with geologic evidence: Himmelsbach observed that free-floating bundles would have had to wash up on the bank &quot;within a couple of years&quot; of the hijacking; otherwise the rubber bands would have long since deteriorated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foia2.fbi.gov/cooper_d_b/cooper_d_b_part07.pdf |title=FBI Freedom of Information Act documents, part 7, p. 15 |format=PDF |access-date=April 23, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721035908/http://foia2.fbi.gov/cooper_d_b/cooper_d_b_part07.pdf |archivedate=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; an observation confirmed experimentally by the Cooper Research Team (see [[#Subsequent FBI disclosures|Subsequent FBI disclosures]] above).&lt;ref name=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Geological evidence suggested that the bills arrived at Tina Bar well after 1974, the year of a Corps of Engineers [[dredging]] operation on that stretch of the river. Geologist Leonard Palmer of [[Portland State University]] found two distinct layers of sand and sediment between the clay deposited on the riverbank by the dredge and the sand layer in which the bills were buried, indicating that the bills arrived long after dredging had been completed.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=110}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Cash linked to 'D.B.

That finding, if true, favors an arrival time of less than one year after the event (based on the rubber band experiment), but does not help to explain how the bundles got to Tina Bar, nor from where they came.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citizensleuths.com/palmer-report.html ''Palmer Report'': Cooper Research Team web site].

Alternative theories were advanced. Some surmised that the money had been found at a distant location by someone (or possibly even a wild animal), carried to the riverbank, and reburied there. The sheriff of Cowlitz County proposed that Cooper accidentally dropped a few bundles on the airstair, which then blew off the aircraft and fell into the Columbia River. One local newspaper editor theorized that Cooper, knowing he could never spend the money, dumped it in the river, or buried portions of it at Tena Bar (and possibly elsewhere) himself.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=203}} No hypothesis offered to date satisfactorily explains all of the existing evidence.&lt;ref name = &quot;conclusions&quot; /&gt;

==Statute of limitations==
In 1976, discussion arose over impending expiration of the [[statute of limitations]] on the hijacking.

===Kenneth Christiansen===
&lt;!-- [[Kenneth Christiansen (D. B. Cooper suspect)]] redirects here --&gt;
In 2003, a [[Minnesota]] resident named Lyle Christiansen watched a television documentary about the Cooper hijacking and became convinced that his late brother Kenneth was Cooper.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-NYmag2007-10-21&quot; /&gt; After repeated futile attempts to convince first the FBI, and then the author and film director [[Nora Ephron]] (who he hoped would make a movie about the case), he contacted a [[private investigator]] in [[New York City]]. In 2010 the detective, Skipp Porteous, published a book{{sfn|Porteous|Blevins|2010}} postulating that Christiansen was the hijacker. The following year, an episode of the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] series ''[[Brad Meltzer's Decoded]]'' also summarized the circumstantial evidence linking Christiansen to the Cooper case.&lt;ref name=BradMeltzer&gt;{{cite episode|series=[[Brad Meltzer's Decoded]]|title=D.B. Cooper|network= [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]]|airdate=January 6, 2011|season=1|number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christiansen enlisted in the Army in 1944 and was trained as a paratrooper. The war had ended by the time he was deployed in 1945, but he made occasional training jumps while stationed in [[Japan]] with [[Allied occupation of Japan|occupation forces]] in the late 1940s. After leaving the Army, he joined Northwest Orient in 1954 as a mechanic in the [[South Sea Islands|South Pacific]], and subsequently became a flight attendant, and then a [[purser]], based in Seattle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-NYmag2007-10-21&quot; /&gt; Christiansen was 45 years old at the time of the hijacking, but he was shorter (5&amp;nbsp;ft 8 in or 173&amp;nbsp;cm), thinner (150 pounds or 68&amp;nbsp;kg), and lighter complected than eyewitness descriptions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-NYmag2007-10-21&quot; /&gt; Christiansen smoked (as did the hijacker), and displayed a particular fondness for bourbon (Cooper's preferred beverage). He was also [[left-handed]] (evidence photos of Cooper's black tie show the tie clip applied from the left side, suggesting a left-handed wearer).&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI-Redux&quot; /&gt; Schaffner told a reporter that photos of Christiansen fit her memory of the hijacker's appearance more closely than those of other suspects she had been shown, but could not conclusively identify him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-NYmag2007-10-21&quot; /&gt; (Mucklow, who had the most contact with Cooper, has never granted a press interview.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tina Mucklow, D.B.

Christiansen reportedly had purchased a house with cash a few months after the hijacking. While dying of [[cancer]] in 1994, he told Lyle, &quot;There is something you should know, but I cannot tell you.&quot; Lyle said he never pressed his brother to explain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-NYmag2007-10-21&quot; /&gt; After Christiansen's death, family members discovered gold coins and a valuable stamp collection, along with over $200,000 in bank accounts. They also found a folder of Northwest Orient news clippings which began about the time he was hired in the 1950s, and stopped just prior to the date of the hijacking, despite the fact that the hijacking was by far the most momentous news event in the airline's history. Christiansen continued to work part-time for the airline for many years after 1971, but apparently never clipped another Northwest news story.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-NYmag2007-10-21&quot; /&gt;

Research by internet web sleuths would later uncover proof that Christiansen did not pay cash for the house he bought after the hijacking, but instead had a mortgage on the house and took 17 years to pay it off. The same search would also uncover proof that Christiansen had sold off almost two dozen acres of land for $17,000 per acre in the mid '90s, thus accounting for the large sum of money in his account at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://website.thedbcooperforum.com/Suspects/ | title=Suspects}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the publicity generated by Porteous's book and the 2011 television documentary, the FBI is standing by its position that Christiansen cannot be considered a [[prime suspect]].&lt;ref name=&quot;new&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN2011-08-01&quot; /&gt; It cites a poor match to eyewitness physical descriptions, a level of skydiving expertise above that predicted by their suspect profile, and an absence of direct incriminating evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = F.B.I. rejects latest D.B.

He said he landed near [[Mount Hood]], about {{convert|50|mi|km}} southeast of Ariel, injuring himself and losing the ransom money in the process. Photos of Coffelt bear a resemblance to the composite drawings, although he was in his mid-fifties in 1971.

According to Galen Cook, a lawyer who has collected information related to Gossett for years, Gossett once showed his sons a key to a [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[safe deposit box]] which, he claimed, contained the long-missing ransom money.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Canadian PressF.B.I.&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = U.S. lawyer believes notorious fugitive D.B.

Walter R. Reca (born Walter R.

Reca gave Laurin permission in a notarized letter to share his story after he died in 2014, aged&amp;nbsp;80. He also allowed Laurin to tape their phone conversations about the crime over a six-week period in late 2008. In the over three&amp;nbsp;hours of recordings, Reca gave new details about the hijacking that the public had not heard before. He also confessed to his niece, Lisa Story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/today/index.ssf/2018/05/db_cooper_case_drops_another_s.html |title=D.B. Cooper case drops another surprising suspect into the spotlight |publisher=OregonLive.com |access-date=July 19, 2018 |language=en-US |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using his years of training to determine the location of the jump, Laurin concluded that D.B. Cooper landed near [[Cle Elum, Washington|Cle&amp;nbsp;Elum, Washington]].

According to written testimony, Jeff Osiadacz, a Cle&amp;nbsp;Elum, Washington native, was driving his dump truck near Cle&amp;nbsp;Elum the night of November&amp;nbsp;24, 1971, when he saw a man walking down the side of the road in the inclement weather. He assumed the man's car had broken down and was walking to get assistance. He did not have room in his truck to pick him up, and continued toward his destination, the Teanaway Junction Café just outside Cle&amp;nbsp;Elum. After ordering coffee, the man from the side of the road also entered the café looking like a &quot;drowned rat&quot;, according to Osiadacz. The man sat next to him and asked if he would be able to give his friend directions if he called him on the phone. Osiadacz agreed to this and spoke with the man's friend, giving him directions to the café. Shortly after that, Osiadacz left for the Grange Hall to play in a band. The man offered to pay for his coffee, and the two amicably parted.

Laurin began his search for the witness, after Reca described the landscape he saw while on his way to the drop zone: two bridges, some distinct lights; and his description of the exterior and interior of the café, as well as his encounter with Osiadacz. He described Osiadacz in detail, recalling that he was wearing western gear and had a guitar case. He dubbed him &quot;Cowboy&quot;.

Laurin consulted a map to find these landmarks and began making phone calls about the &quot;Cowboy who had driven a dump truck.&quot; Laurin was put in contact with Osiadacz, who recalled meeting a man that night, described what he was wearing and what he looked like, and confirmed his identity as Reca after seeing a photo Laurin sent him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2018/05/db_cooper_lived_and_died_in_mi.html |title=D.B.

In 2016, Laurin took the information to publisher Principia Media, who consulted with Joe Koenig, a forensic linguist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.grandhaventribune.com/Local/2018/07/26/GH-residents-play-big-part-in-solving-hi-jacking-mystery|title=GH residents help solve hijacking mystery|newspaper=Grand Haven Tribune|access-date=November 29, 2018|author=Becky Vargo|date=July 26, 2018|df=dmy-all|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130202014/https://www.grandhaventribune.com/Local/2018/07/26/GH-residents-play-big-part-in-solving-hi-jacking-mystery|archive-date=November 30, 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; He evaluated all documents, including passports, identification cards, photographs, and newspaper clippings. Koenig found no evidence of tampering or manipulation and deemed all documentation authentic and contemporaneous. After comparing Laurin's research to the available FBI records, he found no discrepancies that eliminated Reca as a suspect. He also thought it particularly significant that Osiadacz's statement of events on the night of November&amp;nbsp;24, 1971, was identical to the account that Reca made five years earlier. Koenig publicly stated at the Principia Media press conference on May&amp;nbsp;17, 2018, that he believes that Walter R. Reca was D.B.&amp;nbsp;Cooper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.king5.com/video/news/forensic-investigator-explains-why-he-believes-walter-reca-is-db-cooper/281-8131681 |title=Forensic investigator explains why he believes Walter Reca is D.B.

===William J. Smith===
[[File:William Smith a Yardmaster at Newark rail yard.jpg|thumb|William J. Smith (1985 photo)]]
In November 2018, ''[[The Oregonian]]'' published an article that identified William J. Smith (1928–2018), of Bloomfield, New Jersey,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://obits.nj.com/obituaries/starledger/obituary.aspx?n=william-smith&amp;pid=187988854&amp;fhid=17104|title=WILLIAM SMITH Obituary - Bloomfield, NJ &amp;#124; The Star-Ledger|website=Obits.nj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a possible suspect. The article was based on research from a U.S. Army data analyst who sent his findings to the FBI in mid-2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;oregonlive.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oregonlive.com/expo/news/erry-2018/11/e18eba2aa14557/new-suspect-in-db-cooper-skyja.html|title=New suspect in D.B.

After high school he enlisted in the Navy and volunteered for combat air crew training, citing his desire to fly. After the Navy, he worked for the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]], and was impacted by the [[Penn Central Transportation Company]] bankruptcy in 1970, the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history up until that time. The article theorized that the loss of his pension created a grudge against the corporate establishment and transportation industry. It also created a sudden need for money due to that loss of pension. In Smith's high school yearbook, a list of alumni killed in World War II lists an Ira Daniel Cooper, possibly the source for the hijacker's given name of “Dan Cooper.”&lt;ref name=&quot;oregonlive.com&quot;/&gt; The analyst stated that Smith's Naval aviation experience would have given him knowledge of planes and parachutes, and that his railroad experience would have helped him find railroad tracks and hop on a train to escape the area after his jump.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/us/fresh-db-cooper-theory-emerges-years-after-infamous-hijacking|title=DB Cooper revealed? New suspect emerges years after infamous hijacking|first=Ryan|last=Gaydos|date=November 15, 2018|website=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Army analyst stated that his research began after he made connections between William J. Smith and the 1985 book ''D.B. Cooper: What Really Happened'' by [[Max Gunther]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oregonlive.com&quot;/&gt;

''The Oregonian'' article states that particles such as aluminum spiral chips found on the clip-on tie could have come from a locomotive maintenance facility. Furthermore, it states that Smith's information about the Seattle area may have come from his close friend from the railroad, Dan Clair, who was stationed at Fort Lewis during World War II. Smith and Clair worked together in Newark, New Jersey, at the [[Oak Island Yard]], with Smith retiring as a [[Yardmaster]] for [[Conrail]]. The article also noted that a website devoted to the Lehigh Valley Railroad contained a picture of Smith, and stated that “the resemblance to the wanted-poster sketches was remarkable.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lvrr.com/jersey-city-employee/|title=Jersey City Employees|website=Lvrr.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI responded to media requests on Smith by saying it would be &quot;inappropriate&quot; to comment about specific suspects.&lt;ref name=&quot;oregonlive.com&quot;/&gt;

===Duane Weber===
Duane L. Weber was a World War II Army veteran who served time in at least six prisons from 1945 to 1968 for burglary and forgery. He was proposed as a suspect by his widow, based primarily on a deathbed confession: Three days before he died in 1995, Weber told his wife, &quot;I am Dan Cooper.&quot; The name meant nothing to her, she said; but months later, a friend told her of its significance in the hijacking. She went to her local library to research D.B. Cooper, found [[Max Gunther]]'s book, and discovered notations in the margins in her husband's handwriting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pasternak-USNWR2000-07-24&quot; /&gt;

She then recalled, in retrospect, that Weber once had a nightmare during which he talked in his sleep about jumping from a plane, leaving his fingerprints on the &quot;aft stairs&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CrimeLibrary10&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = The D.B. Cooper Story: &quot;I'm Dan Cooper. So Am I.&quot; | last = Krajicek | first = David | url = http://www.crimelibrary.com/criminal_mind/scams/DB_Cooper/10.html | work = [[Crime Library]] | access-date = March 12, 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080406133146/http://www.crimelibrary.com/criminal_mind/scams/DB_Cooper/10.html | archivedate = April 6, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also reportedly told her that an old knee injury had been incurred by &quot;jumping out of a plane&quot;. Like the hijacker, Weber drank bourbon and chain smoked. Other circumstantial evidence included a 1979 trip to Seattle and the Columbia River, during which Weber took a walk alone along the river bank in the Tina Bar area; four months later Brian Ingram made his ransom cash discovery in the same area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pasternak-USNWR2000-07-24&quot; /&gt;

The FBI eliminated Weber as an active suspect in July 1998 when his fingerprints did not match any of those processed in the hijacked plane,&lt;ref name=&quot;CrimeLibrary10&quot; /&gt; and no other direct evidence could be found to implicate him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pasternak-USNWR2000-07-24&quot; /&gt; Later, his DNA also failed to match the samples recovered from Cooper's tie,&lt;ref name=&quot;new&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN2011-08-01&quot; /&gt; though the bureau has since conceded that they cannot be certain that the organic material on the tie came from Cooper.&lt;ref name=&quot;no match&quot; /&gt;

==Copycat hijackings==
Cooper was not the first to attempt air piracy for personal gain. In early November 1971, for example, a Canadian man named Paul Joseph Cini hijacked an [[Air Canada]] DC-8 over Montana, but was overpowered by the crew when he put down his shotgun to strap on the parachute he had brought with him.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=94}}&lt;ref&gt;Koerner, B (June 14, 2013).

Amid multiple lawsuits charging that such searches violated [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] protections against search and seizure, federal courts ruled that they were acceptable when applied universally, and when limited to searches for weapons and explosives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wu&quot; /&gt; Only two hijackings were attempted in 1973, both by psychiatric patients, [[Samuel Byck|one of whom]] intended to crash the airliner into the [[White House]] to kill [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]].{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=120}}

In the wake of multiple &quot;copycat&quot; hijackings in 1972, the FAA required that all Boeing&amp;nbsp;727 aircraft be fitted with a device, later dubbed the &quot;[[Cooper vane]]&quot;, that prevents lowering of the aft airstair during flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wu&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ST&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = D.B.

This made it possible for the cockpit crew to observe people in the passenger cabin without having to open the cockpit door.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=50}}

===Subsequent history of N467US===
In 1978, the hijacked 727-100 aircraft was sold by Northwest to [[Piedmont Airlines (1948-89)|Piedmont Airlines]] where it was re-registered N838N and continued in domestic carrier service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jetpiedmont.com/|title=JetPiedmont.com &amp;#124;&amp;#124; A Tribute to Piedmont Airlines 1948 - 1989 &amp;#124; Official Web Site of The Piedmont Aviation Historical Society|website=Jetpiedmont.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 it was purchased by the now-defunct charter company [[Key Airlines]], re-registered N29KA, and incorporated into the Air Force's civilian charter fleet that shuttled workers between [[Nellis Air Force Base]] and the [[Tonopah Test Range]] during the top-secret [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk|F-117 Nighthawk]] development program.&lt;ref&gt;Hengi, B.I. Airlines Remembered. Midland (June 10, 2000). {{ISBN|1-85780-091-5}}, pp. 56-7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the aircraft was scrapped for parts in a Memphis [[Aircraft boneyard|boneyard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot; /&gt;

===Earl Cossey===
In late April 2013, Earl Cossey – the owner of the skydiving school that furnished the four parachutes that were given to Cooper – was found dead in his home in [[Woodinville, Washington|Woodinville]], a suburb of Seattle. His death was ruled a homicide due to blunt-force trauma to the head.

==Cultural phenomena==
{{Main|D. B. Cooper in popular culture}}
Himmelsbach famously called Cooper a &quot;rotten sleazy crook&quot;{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=116}} but his bold and adventurous crime inspired a cult following that was expressed in song, film, and literature. Restaurants and bowling alleys in the Pacific Northwest hold regular Cooper-themed promotions and sell tourist souvenirs. A &quot;Cooper Day&quot; celebration has been held at the Ariel General Store and Tavern each November since 1974 with the exception of 2015, the year its owner, Dona Elliot, died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://themountainnewswa.net/2015/11/16/death-in-the-db-cooper-family-dona-elliott/|title=Death in the DB Cooper &quot;family&quot; – Dona Elliott|date=November 17, 2015|website=Themountainnewswa.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooper has appeared in the story lines of the television series ''[[Prison Break]]'', ''[[The Blacklist (TV series)|The Blacklist]]'', ''[[NewsRadio]]'', ''[[Leverage (TV series)|Leverage]]'', ''[[Journeyman (TV series)|Journeyman]]'', ''[[Renegade (TV series)|Renegade]]'' and ''[[Numbers (TV series)|Numb3rs]]'', ''[[Drunk History]]'', the 1981 film ''[[The Pursuit of D.

When Schaffner's description was relayed to the FBI command post in Portland, agents pointed out that dynamite sticks are typically brown or beige in color; the eight red cylinders were probably highway or railroad flares. But because they could not be certain, intervention could not be recommended. ({{harvnb|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=40–41}})
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;twenty&quot;&gt;
According to most sources, Cooper directed that the ransom be supplied in the form of 20-dollar bills; but Himmelsbach, who was present when the demands were first received, wrote that he specified only &quot;negotiable American currency, denomination not important.&quot; ({{harvnb|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=18}}) All sources agree that the ransom was supplied in the form of 20-dollar bills.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;parachutes&quot;&gt;
Earl Cossey, the skydiving instructor who supplied the parachutes, told some sources that three of the four parachutes (one primary and both reserves) were returned to him. The FBI has always maintained that only two parachutes, a primary and a cannibalized reserve, were found aboard the plane. ({{harvnb|Gunther|1985|p=50}})
