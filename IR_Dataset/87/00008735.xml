The software was originally designed at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (UCB) in the early 1980s. The name originates as an acronym of ''Berkeley Internet Name Domain'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Terry&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The software consists, most prominently, of the DNS server component, called ''named'', a contracted form of ''name [[Daemon (computing)|daemon]]''. In addition, the suite contains various administration tools, and a DNS resolver interface library. The latest version of BIND is BIND 9, first released in 2000. BIND 9 is actively maintained, with new releases issued several times a year.

Starting in 2009, the [[Internet Software Consortium]] (ISC) developed a software suite, initially called BIND10. With release version 1.2.0 the project was renamed ''Bundy''&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundy-dns.de Bundy, authoritative DNS and DHCP server]&lt;/ref&gt; to terminate ISC involvement in the project.

==Key features==
BIND 9 is intended to be fully compliant with the [https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/dnsop/documents/ IETF DNS standards and draft standards].  Important features of BIND 9 include: [[TSIG]], [[nsupdate]], [[IPv6]], RNDC (remote name daemon control), views, multiprocessor support, Response Rate Limiting (RRL), [[Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions|DNSSEC]], and broad portability.  RNDC enables remote configuration updates, using a [[shared secret]] to provide encryption for local and remote terminals during each session.

==Database support==
While earlier versions of BIND offered no mechanism to store and retrieve [[Zone file|zone data in anything other than flat text files]], in 2007 BIND 9.4&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=https://lists.isc.org/pipermail/bind-announce/2007-February/000210.html
| title=BIND 9.4.0 is now available.

| accessdate=2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://bind-dlz.sourceforge.net/ DLZ] provided a compile-time option for zone storage in a variety of database formats including [[LDAP]], [[Berkeley DB]], [[PostgreSQL]], [[MySQL]], and [[ODBC]].

BIND 10 planned to make the data store modular, so that a variety of databases may be connected.&lt;ref name=&quot;bind10-design&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In 2016 ISC added support for the 'dyndb' interface, contributed by RedHat, with BIND version 9.11.0. &lt;ref&gt;https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01420/219/What-is-dyndb-and-how-is-it-better-than-DLZ.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security==
Security issues that are discovered in BIND 9 are patched and publicly disclosed in keeping with common principles of open source software.  A complete list of security defects that have been discovered and disclosed in BIND9 is maintained by Internet Systems Consortium, the current authors of the software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The BIND 4 and BIND 8 releases both had serious security vulnerabilities. Use of these ancient versions, or any un-maintained, non-supported version is strongly discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;P. Hudson, A. Hudson, B. Ball, H. Duff: Red Hat Fedora 4 Unleashed, page 723. Sams Publishing, 2005 {{ISBN|0-672-32792-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; BIND 9 was a [[Rewrite (programming)|complete rewrite]], in part to mitigate these ongoing security issues. The [https://www.isc.org/downloads/ downloads page on the ISC web site] clearly shows which versions are currently maintained and which are end of life.

==History==
Originally written by four [[graduate student]]s at the [[Computer Systems Research Group]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (UCB), BIND was first released with [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] 4.3BSD. [[Paul Vixie]] started maintaining it in 1988 while working for [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]. {{As of | 2012}}, the [[Internet Systems Consortium]] maintains, updates, and writes new versions of BIND.

BIND was written by Douglas Terry, Mark Painter, David Riggle and Songnian Zhou in the early 1980s at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] as a result of a [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]] grant. The acronym ''BIND'' is for ''Berkeley Internet Name Domain'', from a technical paper published in 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;Terry&quot;/&gt;

Versions of BIND through 4.8.3 were maintained by the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) at UC Berkeley.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web
| url=https://www.isc.org/downloads/bind/history-of-bind/
| title=History of BIND
| author=ISC
| date=2016-10-31
| accessdate=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1980s, Paul Vixie of [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] took over BIND development, releasing versions 4.9 and 4.9.1. Vixie continued to work on BIND after leaving DEC.  BIND Version 4.9.2 was sponsored by Vixie Enterprises.  Vixie eventually founded the [[Internet Software Consortium|ISC]], which became the entity responsible for BIND versions starting with 4.9.3.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt;

BIND 8 was released by ISC in May 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt;

Version 9 was developed by [[Nominum]], Inc. under an ISC outsourcing contract, and the first version was released 9 October 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=https://www.usenix.org/legacy/about/newsroom/press/archive/bind9.html
| title=BIND 9 Authored by Nominum Development Team Now Available on Internet Software Consortium Site
| date=2000-10-06
| accessdate=2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was written from scratch in part to address the architectural difficulties with [[Code audit|auditing]] the earlier BIND code bases, and also to support [[DNSSEC]] (DNS Security Extensions). The development of BIND 9 took place under a combination of commercial and military contracts. Most of the features of BIND 9 were funded by UNIX vendors who wanted to ensure that BIND stayed competitive with Microsoft's DNS offerings;{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} the [[DNSSEC]] features were funded by the US military, which regarded DNS security as important.  BIND 9 was released in September 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt;

In 2009, ISC started an effort to develop a new version of the software suite, called BIND10. In addition to DNS service, the BIND10 suite also included [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]] DHCP server components.  In April 2014, with the BIND10 release 1.2.0 the ISC concluded its development work of the project and renamed the project to ''Bundy''&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundy-dns.de Bundy, authoritative DNS and DHCP server]&lt;/ref&gt;, moving the source code repository to GitHub&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/bundy-dns/bundy bundy repo at GitHub]&lt;/ref&gt; for further development by outside public efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=https://www.isc.org/downloads/platform/
| title=BIND 10 Release 1.2 available
| date=2014-04-17
| accessdate=2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;. ISC discontinued its involvement in the project due to cost-cutting measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate=2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of DHCP components was split off to become a new  [[Kea (software)|Kea]] project.
