{{infobox bohrium}}
'''Bohrium''' is a [[synthetic element|synthetic]] [[chemical element]] with the [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]] '''Bh''' and [[atomic number]] 107. It is named after Danish physicist [[Niels Bohr]]. As a synthetic element, it can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature. All known [[isotopes of bohrium]] are extremely [[radioactive]]; the most stable known [[isotope]] is &lt;sup&gt;270&lt;/sup&gt;Bh with a [[half-life]] of approximately 61&amp;nbsp;seconds, though the unconfirmed &lt;sup&gt;278&lt;/sup&gt;Bh may have a longer half-life of about 690&amp;nbsp;seconds.

In the [[periodic table]], it is a [[d-block]] [[transactinide element]]. It is a member of the [[period 7|7th period]] and belongs to the [[group 7 element]]s as the fifth member of the 6d series of [[transition metal]]s. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that bohrium behaves as the heavier [[homology (chemistry)|homologue]] to [[rhenium]] in group 7. The [[chemical properties]] of bohrium are characterized only partly, but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 7 elements.

==History==
[[File:Niels Bohr.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Element 107 was originally proposed to be named after [[Niels Bohr]], a Danish nuclear physicist, with the name ''nielsbohrium'' (Ns). This name was later changed by [[IUPAC]] to ''bohrium'' (Bh).]]

===Discovery===
Two groups claimed [[Timeline of chemical element discoveries|discovery of the element]]. Evidence of bohrium was first reported in 1976 by a Soviet research team led by [[Yuri Oganessian]], in which targets of [[bismuth-209]] and [[lead]]-208 were bombarded with accelerated nuclei of [[chromium]]-54 and [[manganese]]-55 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=|doi=10.1016/0375-9474(76)90607-2|title= On spontaneous fission of neutron-deficient isotopes of elements }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two activities, one with a half-life of one to two milliseconds, and the other with an approximately five-second half-life, were seen. Since the ratio of the intensities of these two activities was constant throughout the experiment, it was proposed that the first was from the [[isotope]] bohrium-261 and that the second was from its daughter [[dubnium]]-257. Later, the dubnium isotope was corrected to dubnium-258, which indeed has a five-second half-life (dubnium-257 has a one-second half-life); however, the half-life observed for its parent is much shorter than the half-lives later observed in the definitive discovery of bohrium at [[Darmstadt]] in 1981. The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]]/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) concluded that while dubnium-258 was probably seen in this experiment, the evidence for the production of its parent bohrium-262 was not convincing enough.&lt;ref name=&quot;93TWG&quot;/&gt;

In 1981, a German research team led by [[Peter Armbruster]] and [[Gottfried Münzenberg]] at the [[GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research]] (GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung) in Darmstadt bombarded a target of bismuth-209 with accelerated nuclei of chromium-54 to produce 5 atoms of the isotope bohrium-262:&lt;ref name=&quot;262Bh&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

This discovery was further substantiated by their detailed measurements of the alpha decay chain of the produced bohrium atoms to previously known isotopes of [[fermium]] and [[californium]]. The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]]/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) recognised the GSI collaboration as official discoverers in their 1992 report.&lt;ref name=&quot;93TWG&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

===Proposed names===
[[File:Bohrium hassium meitnerium ceremony.jpg|thumb|left|Naming ceremony conducted at the GSI on 7 September 1992 for the namings of elements 107, 108, and 109 as nielsbohrium, hassium, and meitnerium]]
In September 1992, the German group suggested the name ''nielsbohrium'' with symbol ''Ns'' to honor the Danish physicist [[Niels Bohr]]. The Soviet scientists at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] in [[Dubna]], Russia had suggested this name be given to element 105 (which was finally called dubnium) and the German team wished to recognise both Bohr and the fact that the Dubna team had been the first to propose the cold fusion reaction to solve the controversial problem of the naming of element 105. The Dubna team agreed with the German group's naming proposal for element 107.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi =10.1351/pac199365081815

There was an [[element naming controversy]] as to what the elements from 104 to 106 were to be called; the [[IUPAC]] adopted ''unnilseptium'' (symbol ''Uns'') as a temporary, [[systematic element name]] for this element.&lt;ref name=IUPAC97&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac199769122471|title=Names and symbols of transfermium elements (IUPAC Recommendations 1997)|date=1997|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume=69|pages=2471–2474|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 107 be named ''bohrium'', not ''nielsbohrium'', since there was no precedent for using a scientist's complete name in the naming of an element.&lt;ref name=IUPAC97/&gt;&lt;ref name=IUPAC94&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac199466122419|title=Names and symbols of transfermium elements (IUPAC Recommendations 1994)|date=1994|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume=66|pages=2419–2421|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was opposed by the discoverers as there was some concern that the name might be confused with [[boron]] and in particular the distinguishing of the names of their respective [[oxyanion]]s, ''bohrate'' and ''borate''. The matter was handed to the Danish branch of IUPAC which, despite this, voted in favour of the name ''bohrium'', and thus the name ''bohrium'' for element 107 was recognized internationally in 1997;&lt;ref name=IUPAC97/&gt; the names of the respective oxyanions of boron and bohrium remain unchanged despite their homophony.&lt;ref&gt;{{RedBook2005|pages=337–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bohrium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements. Twelve different isotopes of bohrium have been reported with atomic masses 260–262, 264–267, 270–272, 274, and 278, one of which, bohrium-262, has a known [[metastable state]]. All of these but the unconfirmed &lt;sup&gt;278&lt;/sup&gt;Bh decay only through alpha decay, although some unknown bohrium isotopes are predicted to undergo spontaneous fission.&lt;ref name=nuclidetable/&gt;

The lighter isotopes usually have shorter half-lives; half-lives of under 100&amp;nbsp;ms for &lt;sup&gt;260&lt;/sup&gt;Bh, &lt;sup&gt;261&lt;/sup&gt;Bh, &lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt;Bh, and &lt;sup&gt;262m&lt;/sup&gt;Bh were observed. &lt;sup&gt;264&lt;/sup&gt;Bh, &lt;sup&gt;265&lt;/sup&gt;Bh, &lt;sup&gt;266&lt;/sup&gt;Bh, and &lt;sup&gt;271&lt;/sup&gt;Bh are more stable at around 1&amp;nbsp;s, and &lt;sup&gt;267&lt;/sup&gt;Bh and &lt;sup&gt;272&lt;/sup&gt;Bh have half-lives of about 10&amp;nbsp;s. The heaviest isotopes are the most stable, with &lt;sup&gt;270&lt;/sup&gt;Bh and &lt;sup&gt;274&lt;/sup&gt;Bh having measured half-lives of about 61&amp;nbsp;s and 40&amp;nbsp;s respectively, and the even heavier unconfirmed isotope &lt;sup&gt;278&lt;/sup&gt;Bh appearing to have an even longer half-life of about 690&amp;nbsp;s.

The proton-rich isotopes with masses 260, 261, and 262 were directly produced by cold fusion, those with mass 262 and 264 were reported in the decay chains of meitnerium and roentgenium, while the neutron-rich isotopes with masses 265, 266, 267 were created in irradiations of actinide targets. The five most neutron-rich ones with masses 270, 271, 272, 274, and 278 (unconfirmed) appear in the decay chains of &lt;sup&gt;282&lt;/sup&gt;Nh, &lt;sup&gt;287&lt;/sup&gt;Mc, &lt;sup&gt;288&lt;/sup&gt;Mc, &lt;sup&gt;294&lt;/sup&gt;Ts, and &lt;sup&gt;290&lt;/sup&gt;Fl respectively. These eleven isotopes have half-lives ranging from about ten&amp;nbsp;milliseconds for &lt;sup&gt;262m&lt;/sup&gt;Bh to about one&amp;nbsp;minute for &lt;sup&gt;270&lt;/sup&gt;Bh and &lt;sup&gt;274&lt;/sup&gt;Bh, extending to about twelve minutes for the unconfirmed &lt;sup&gt;278&lt;/sup&gt;Bh, one of the longest-lived known superheavy nuclides.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doi_&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Münzenberg|first1=G.|last2=Gupta|first2=M. |chapter=Production and Identification of Transactinide Elements |editor-first=Attila |editor-last=Vértes |editor-first2=Sándor |editor-last2=Nagy |editor-first3=Zoltán |editor-last3=Klencsár |editor-first4=Rezső G. |editor-last4=Lovas |editor-first5=Frank |editor-last5=Rösch |title=Handbook of Nuclear Chemistry: Production and Identification of Transactinide Elements |page=877 |date=2011 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-0720-2_19 |isbn=978-1-4419-0719-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predicted properties==
Very few properties of bohrium or its compounds have been measured; this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloomberg&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-08-28/making-new-elements-doesn-t-pay-just-ask-this-berkeley-scientist|title=Making New Elements Doesn’t Pay. Just Ask This Berkeley Scientist|last=Subramanian|first=S.|website=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|access-date=2020-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fact that bohrium (and its parents) decays very quickly. A few singular chemistry-related properties properties have been measured, but properties of bohrium metal remain unknown and only predictions are available.
===Chemical===
Bohrium is the fifth member of the 6d series of transition metals and the heaviest member of [[group 7 element|group 7]] in the periodic table, below [[manganese]], [[technetium]] and [[rhenium]]. All the members of the group readily portray their group oxidation state of +7 and the state becomes more stable as the group is descended. Thus bohrium is expected to form a stable +7 state. Technetium also shows a stable +4 state whilst rhenium exhibits stable +4 and +3 states. Bohrium may therefore show these lower states as well.&lt;ref name=BFricke/&gt; The higher +7 oxidation state is more likely to exist in oxyanions, such as perbohrate, {{chem|BhO|4|-}}, analogous to the lighter [[permanganate]], [[pertechnetate]], and [[perrhenate]]. Nevertheless, bohrium(VII) is likely to be unstable in aqueous solution, and would probably be easily reduced to the more stable bohrium(IV).&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;

Technetium and rhenium are known to form volatile heptoxides M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (M = Tc, Re), so bohrium should also form the volatile oxide Bh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. The oxide should dissolve in water to form perbohric acid, HBhO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.
Rhenium and technetium form a range of oxyhalides from the halogenation of the oxide. The chlorination of the oxide forms the oxychlorides MO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl, so BhO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl should be formed in this reaction. Fluorination results in MO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F and MO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; for the heavier elements in addition to the rhenium compounds ReOF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and ReF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. Therefore, oxyfluoride formation for bohrium may help to indicate eka-rhenium properties.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Georg Nadler &quot;Rhenium and Rhenium Compounds&quot; Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2000. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a23_199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the oxychlorides are asymmetrical, and they should have increasingly large [[dipole]] moments going down the group, they should become less volatile in the order TcO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl &amp;gt; ReO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl &amp;gt; BhO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl: this was experimentally confirmed in 2000 by measuring the [[enthalpy|enthalpies]] of [[adsorption]] of these three compounds. The values are for TcO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl and ReO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl are −51&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol and −61&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol respectively; the experimental value for BhO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl is −77.8&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, very close to the theoretically expected value of −78.5&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;

===Physical and atomic===
Bohrium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a [[hexagonal close-packed]] crystal structure (&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.62), similar to its lighter [[congener (chemistry)|congener]] rhenium.&lt;ref name=hcp/&gt; It should be a very heavy metal with a [[density]] of around 37.1&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which would be the third-highest of any of the 118 known elements, lower than only [[meitnerium]] (37.4&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[hassium]] (41&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), the two following elements in the periodic table. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, [[osmium]], has a density of only 22.61&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This results from bohrium's high atomic weight, the [[lanthanide contraction|lanthanide and actinide contractions]], and [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], although production of enough bohrium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;

The atomic radius of bohrium is expected to be around 128&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Bh&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is predicted to have an electron configuration of [Rn] 5f&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; 6d&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; 7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, giving up a 6d electron instead of a 7s electron, which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues manganese and technetium. Rhenium, on the other hand, follows its heavier congener bohrium in giving up a 5d electron before a 6s electron, as relativistic effects have become significant by the sixth period, where they cause among other things the yellow color of [[gold]] and the low melting point of [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. The Bh&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is expected to have an electron configuration of [Rn] 5f&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; 6d&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; 7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; in contrast, the Re&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is expected to have a [Xe] 4f&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; 5d&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; configuration, this time analogous to manganese and technetium.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; The ionic radius of hexacoordinate heptavalent bohrium is expected to be 58&amp;nbsp;pm (heptavalent manganese, technetium, and rhenium having values of 46, 57, and 53&amp;nbsp;pm respectively). Pentavalent bohrium should have a larger ionic radius of 83&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;

==Experimental chemistry==
In 1995, the first report on attempted isolation of the element was unsuccessful, prompting new theoretical studies to investigate how best to investigate bohrium (using its lighter homologs technetium and rhenium for comparison) and removing unwanted contaminating elements such as the trivalent [[actinide]]s, the [[group 5 element]]s, and [[polonium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chemical Separation Procedure Proposed for Studies of Bohrium|last1=Malmbeck|first1=R.|last2=Skarnemark|first2=G.|last3=Alstad|first3=J.|last4=Fure|first4=K.|last5=Johansson|first5=M.|last6=Omtvedt|first6=J. P.|journal=Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry|volume=246|pages=349|date=2000|doi=10.1023/A:1006791027906|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, it was confirmed that although relativistic effects are important, bohrium behaves like a typical group 7 element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gäggeler|first1=H. W.|last2=Eichler|first2=R.|last3=Brüchle|first3=W.|last4=Dressler|first4=R.|last5=Düllmann|first5=Ch. E.|last6=Eichler|first6=B.|last7=Gregorich|first7=K. E.|last8=Hoffman|first8=D.

The resulting atoms were thermalised and reacted with a HCl/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixture to form a volatile oxychloride. The reaction also produced isotopes of its lighter homologues, technetium (as &lt;sup&gt;108&lt;/sup&gt;Tc) and rhenium (as &lt;sup&gt;169&lt;/sup&gt;Re). The isothermal adsorption curves were measured and gave strong evidence for the formation of a volatile oxychloride with properties similar to that of rhenium oxychloride. This placed bohrium as a typical member of group 7.&lt;ref name=00Ei01&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsi.de/informationen/wti/library/scientificreport2000/Chemistry/9/r_eichler_jb2000.pdf|title=Gas chemical investigation of bohrium (Bh, element 107)|last=Eichler |first=R. |display-authors=etal |work=GSI Annual Report 2000|accessdate=2008-02-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219002121/http://www.gsi.de/informationen/wti/library/scientificreport2000/Chemistry/9/r_eichler_jb2000.pdf|archivedate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adsorption enthalpies of the oxychlorides of technetium, rhenium, and bohrium were measured in this experiment, agreeing very well with the theoretical predictions and implying a sequence of decreasing oxychloride volatility down group 7 of TcO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl &amp;gt; ReO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl &amp;gt; BhO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;

The longer-lived heavy isotopes of bohrium, produced as the daughters of heavier elements, offer advantages for future radiochemical experiments. Although the heavy isotope &lt;sup&gt;274&lt;/sup&gt;Bh requires a rare and highly radioactive [[berkelium]] target for its production, the isotopes &lt;sup&gt;272&lt;/sup&gt;Bh, &lt;sup&gt;271&lt;/sup&gt;Bh, and &lt;sup&gt;270&lt;/sup&gt;Bh can be readily produced as daughters of more easily produced [[moscovium]] and [[nihonium]] isotopes.&lt;ref name=Moody&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Synthesis of Superheavy Elements |last1=Moody |first1=Ken |editor1-first=Matthias |editor1-last=Schädel |editor2-first=Dawn |editor2-last=Shaughnessy |title=The Chemistry of Superheavy Elements |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |edition=2nd |pages=24–8 |isbn=9783642374661|date=2013-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
