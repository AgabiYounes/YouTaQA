'''Bronze''' is an [[alloy]] consisting primarily of [[copper]], commonly with about 12–12.5% [[tin]] and often with the addition of other metals (such as [[aluminium]], [[manganese]], [[nickel]] or [[zinc]]) and sometimes non-metals or [[metalloids]] such as [[arsenic]], [[phosphorus]] or [[silicon]]. These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than copper alone, or have other useful properties, such as stiffness, [[ductility]], or machinability.

The archeological period in which bronze was the hardest metal in widespread use is known as the [[Bronze Age]]. The beginning of the Bronze Age in India and western [[Eurasia]] is conventionally dated to the mid-4th millennium BC, and to the early 2nd millennium BC in China;&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Thorp, ''China in the Early Bronze Age: Shang Civilization'',  University of Pennsylvania Press (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; elsewhere it gradually spread across regions.  The Bronze Age was followed by the [[Iron Age]] starting from about 1300 BC and reaching most of Eurasia by about 500 BC, although bronze continued to be much more widely used than it is in modern times.

Because historical pieces were often made of [[brass]]es (copper and zinc) and bronzes with different compositions, modern museum and scholarly descriptions of older objects increasingly use the generalized term &quot;[[copper alloy]]&quot; instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?scopeType=Terms&amp;scopeId=18864|title=British Museum, &quot;Scope Note&quot; for &quot;copper alloy&quot;|work=British Museum|accessdate=14 September 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818004043/http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?scopeType=Terms&amp;scopeId=18864|archivedate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:HouMuWuDingFullView.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Houmuwu ding|Houmuwu]] ''[[Houmuwu ding|ding]]'' ({{zh|s=后母戊鼎|p=Hòumǔwù dǐng}}), the largest ancient bronze ever found; 1300-1046 BC; [[National Museum of China]] (Beijing). This ding's name is based on the inscription in the bronze interior wall, which reads Hòumǔwù, meaning “Queen Mother Wu”]]
The word ''bronze'' (1730–40) is borrowed from French ''bronze'' (1511), itself borrowed from Italian ''bronzo'' &quot;bell metal, brass&quot; (13th century) (transcribed in [[Medieval Latin]] as ''bronzium'') from either,

Berthelot, &quot;Sur le nom du bronze chez les alchimistes grecs&quot;, in ''Revue archéologique'', 1888, pp. 294–98.&lt;/ref&gt; or originally,

==History==
[[File:ALB - Hortfund Groß Gaglow.jpg|thumb|A hoard of bronze socketed axes from the [[Bronze Age]] found in modern Germany. This was the top tool of the period, and also seems to have been used as a store of value.]]
[[File:Magical Roman Nails.jpg|thumb|Roman bronze nails with magical signs and inscriptions, 3rd-4th century AD.]]

The discovery of bronze enabled people to create metal objects which were harder and more durable than previously possible. Bronze tools, weapons, armor, and [[building material]]s such as decorative tiles were harder and more durable than their stone and copper (&quot;[[Chalcolithic]]&quot;) predecessors. Initially, bronze was made out of copper and [[arsenic]], forming [[arsenic bronze]], or from naturally or artificially mixed ores of copper and arsenic,&lt;ref&gt;

Tin bronze was superior to arsenic bronze in that the alloying process could be more easily controlled, and the resulting alloy was stronger and easier to cast. Also, [[Arsenic poisoning|unlike arsenic]], metallic tin and fumes from tin refining are [[Tin poisoning|not toxic]]. The earliest tin-alloy bronze dates to 4500 BC in a [[Vinča culture]] site in [[Pločnik (archaeological site)|Pločnik]] ([[Serbia]]).&lt;ref name=antiquity1312/&gt; Other early examples date to the late 4th millennium BC in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;[[History of Africa#Metallurgy]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susa]] ([[Iran]]) and some ancient sites in China, [[Luristan]] (Iran) and [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Iraq]]).{{citation needed|reason=according to what evidence??|date=December 2012}}

[[Ore]]s of copper and the far rarer tin are not often found together (exceptions include Cornwall in Britain, one ancient site in [[Thailand]] and one in Iran), so serious bronze work has always involved trade. [[Tin sources and trade in ancient times]] had a major influence on the development of cultures.  In [[Europe]], a major source of tin was the British deposits of ore in [[Cornwall]], which were traded as far as [[Phoenicia]] in the eastern [[Mediterranean]].

In many parts of the world, large hoards of bronze artifacts are found, suggesting that bronze also represented a store of value and an indicator of social status.  In [[Europe]], large hoards of bronze tools, typically socketed axes (illustrated above), are found, which mostly show no signs of wear. With [[Chinese ritual bronze]]s, which are documented in the inscriptions they carry and from other sources, the case is very clear. These were made in enormous quantities for elite burials, and also used by the living for ritual offerings.

===Transition to iron===
Though bronze is generally harder than [[wrought iron]], with [[Vickers hardness test|Vickers hardness]] of 60–258 vs. 30–80,&lt;ref&gt;''Smithells Metals Reference Book'', 8th Edition, ch. 22&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bronze Age]] gave way to the [[Iron Age]] after a serious disruption of the tin trade: the population migrations of around 1200–1100 BC reduced the shipping of tin around the Mediterranean and from Britain, limiting supplies and raising prices.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton E. Cramer. [http://www.claytoncramer.com/unpublished/Iron2.pdf What Caused The Iron Age?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228194159/http://www.claytoncramer.com/unpublished/Iron2.pdf |date=2010-12-28 }} claytoncramer.com. December 10, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; As the art of working in iron improved, iron became cheaper and improved in quality. As cultures advanced from hand-wrought iron to machine-forged iron (typically made with [[trip hammer]]s powered by water), blacksmiths learned how to make [[steel]]. Steel is stronger than bronze and holds a sharper edge longer.&lt;ref&gt;Oleg D. Sherby and Jeffrey Wadsworth. [http://www.llnl.gov/tid/lof/documents/pdf/238547.pdf Ancient Blacksmiths, the Iron Age, Damascus Steels, and Modern Metallurgy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626190201/http://www.llnl.gov/tid/lof/documents/pdf/238547.pdf |date=2007-06-26 }}. Tbermec 2000, Las Vegas, Nevada December 4–8, 2000. Retrieved on 2012-06-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bronze was still used during the Iron Age, and has continued in use for many purposes to the modern day.

==Composition==
[[File:Bronze bell with visible material structure.jpg|thumb|left|Bronze bell with a visible [[crystallite]] structure.]]

There are many different bronze alloys, but typically modern bronze is 88% [[copper]] and 12% [[tin]].&lt;ref&gt;Knapp, Brian. (1996) ''Copper, Silver and Gold''. Reed Library, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Alpha bronze'''  consists of the alpha [[solid solution]] of tin in copper. Alpha bronze alloys of 4–5% tin are used to make [[coin]]s, [[spring (device)|springs]], [[turbine]]s and [[blade]]s. Historical &quot;bronzes&quot; are highly variable in composition, as most metalworkers probably used whatever scrap was on hand; the metal of the 12th-century English [[Gloucester Candlestick]] is bronze containing a mixture of copper, zinc, tin, lead, nickel, iron, antimony, arsenic with an unusually large amount of silver – between 22.5% in the base and 5.76% in the pan below the candle. The proportions of this mixture suggests that the candlestick was made from a hoard of old coins.  The [[Benin Bronzes]] are in fact brass, and the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Liège]] is described as both bronze and brass.

In the [[Bronze Age]], two forms of bronze were commonly used: &quot;classic bronze&quot;, about 10% tin, was used in casting; and &quot;mild bronze&quot;, about 6% tin, was hammered from ingots to make sheets. Bladed weapons were mostly cast from classic bronze, while helmets and armor were hammered from mild bronze.

Commercial bronze (90% copper and 10% zinc) and architectural bronze (57% copper, 3% [[lead]], 40% zinc) are more properly regarded as [[brass]] alloys because they contain [[zinc]] as the main alloying ingredient. They are commonly used in architectural applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/copper_alloys/intro.html|title=Copper alloys|accessdate=14 September 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911022109/http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/copper_alloys/intro.html|archivedate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copper.org/resources/properties/standard-designations/introduction.html|title=CDA UNS Standard Designations for Wrought and Cast Copper and Copper Alloys: Introduction|accessdate=14 September 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924132326/http://www.copper.org/resources/properties/standard-designations/introduction.html|archivedate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bismuth bronze]] is a bronze alloy with a composition of 52% copper, 30% nickel, 12% zinc, 5% lead, and 1% bismuth. It is able to hold a good polish and so is sometimes used in light reflectors and mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southerncrossmetalrecyclers.com.au/scrap/bismuth-bronze.html|title=Bismuth Bronze|accessdate=14 September 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316175726/http://www.southerncrossmetalrecyclers.com.au/scrap/bismuth-bronze.html|archivedate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other bronze alloys include [[aluminium bronze]], [[phosphor bronze]], manganese bronze, [[bell metal]], [[arsenical bronze]], [[speculum metal]] and [[cymbal alloys]].

==Properties==
Bronzes are typically very ductile alloys, considerably less [[brittle]] than cast iron. Typically bronze only oxidizes superficially; once a copper oxide (eventually becoming copper carbonate) layer is formed, the underlying metal is [[Passivation (chemistry)|protected from further corrosion]]. This can be seen on statues from the Hellenistic period. However, if copper chlorides are formed, a corrosion-mode called &quot;[[bronze disease]]&quot; will eventually completely destroy it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://proteus.brown.edu/greekpast/4867|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226134131/http://proteus.brown.edu/greekpast/4867|url-status=dead|archive-date=26 February 2015|title=Bronze Disease, Archaeologies of the Greek Past|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copper-based [[alloy]]s have lower [[melting point]]s than steel or iron and are more readily produced from their constituent metals. They are generally about 10 percent denser than steel, although alloys using [[aluminium]] or [[silicon]] may be slightly less dense. Bronze is a better conductor of heat and electricity than most steels. The cost of copper-base alloys is generally higher than that of steels but lower than that of [[nickel]]-base alloys.

Copper and its alloys have a huge variety of uses that reflect their versatile physical, mechanical, and [[Chemical property|chemical properties]]. Some common examples are the high [[electrical conductivity]] of pure copper, low-friction properties of bearing bronze (bronze which has a high lead content— 6–8%), resonant qualities of bell bronze (20% tin, 80% copper), and resistance to corrosion by [[seawater]] of several bronze alloys.

The melting point of bronze varies depending on the ratio of the alloy components and is about {{convert|950|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Bronze is usually nonmagnetic, but certain alloys containing iron or nickel may have magnetic properties.

==Uses==
Bronze, or bronze-like alloys and mixtures, were used for coins over a longer period. Bronze was especially suitable for use in boat and ship fittings prior to the wide employment of [[stainless steel]] owing to its combination of toughness and resistance to salt water corrosion. Bronze is still commonly used in ship propellers and submerged bearings.

In the 20th century, [[silicon]] was introduced as the primary alloying element, creating an alloy with wide application in industry and the major form used in contemporary [[statuary]]. Sculptors may prefer silicon bronze because of the ready availability of silicon bronze brazing rod, which allows colour-matched repair of defects in castings. Aluminium is also used for the structural metal [[aluminium bronze]].

It is also widely used for casting [[bronze sculpture]]s. Many common bronze alloys have the unusual and very desirable property of expanding slightly just before they set, thus filling in the finest details of a [[molding (process)|mould]]. Bronze parts are [[Toughness|tough]] and typically used for [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], clips, [[electrical connector]]s and [[Spring (device)|springs]].

Bronze also has very low [[friction]] against dissimilar metals, making it important for [[cannon]]s prior to modern [[Engineering tolerance|tolerancing]], where iron cannonballs would otherwise stick in the barrel.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlavudeenVenkateshwaran2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=A. Alavudeen|author2=N. Venkateshwaran|author3=J. T.

[[Phosphor bronze]] is particularly suited to precision-grade bearings and springs. It is also used in guitar and piano strings.

Unlike steel, bronze struck against a hard surface will not generate sparks, so it (along with [[beryllium copper]]) is used to make [[hammer]]s, [[mallet]]s, [[wrench]]es and other durable tools to be used in explosive atmospheres or in the presence of flammable vapors.  Bronze is used to make [[bronze wool]] for woodworking applications where [[steel wool]] would discolour [[oak]].

[[Phosphor bronze]] is used for ships' propellers, musical instruments, and electrical contacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copper.org/resources/properties/microstructure/phos_bronze.html Resources: Standards &amp; Properties – Copper &amp; Copper Alloy Microstructures: Phosphor Bronze&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208043816/http://www.copper.org/resources/properties/microstructure/phos_bronze.html |date=2015-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plain bearing#Bronze|Bearings]] are often made of bronze for its friction properties.  It can be filled with oil to make the proprietary [[Oilite]] and similar material for bearings. [[Aluminium bronze]] is very hard and wear-resistant, and is used for bearings and machine tool ways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copper.org/resources/properties/microstructure/al_bronzes.html Resources: Standards &amp; Properties – Copper &amp; Copper Alloy Microstructures: Aluminum Bronzes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205130419/http://www.copper.org/resources/properties/microstructure/al_bronzes.html |date=2013-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sculptures===
{{See also|Bronze sculpture}}
The [[Assyria]]n king [[Sennacherib]] (704–681 BC) claims to have been the first to cast monumental bronze statues (of up to 30 tonnes) using two-part moulds instead of the [[Lost-wax casting|lost-wax method]].&lt;ref&gt;for a translation of his inscription see the appendix in [[Stephanie Dalley]], (2013) ''The Mystery of the Hanging Garden of Babylon: an elusive World Wonder traced,'' OUP. {{ISBN|978-0-19-966226-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bronze statues were regarded as the highest form of sculpture in [[Ancient Greek art]], though survivals are few, as bronze was a valuable material in short supply in the [[Late Antique]] and medieval periods.  Many of the most famous Greek bronze sculptures are known through Roman copies in marble, which were more likely to survive.

In India, bronze sculptures from the [[Kushana]] ([[Chausa hoard]]) and [[Gupta]] periods ([[Brahma from Mirpur-Khas]], Akota Hoard, [[Sultanganj Buddha]]) and later periods ([[Hansi]] Hoard) have been found.&lt;ref&gt;Indian bronze masterpieces: the great tradition: specially published for the Festival of India, Asharani Mathur, Sonya Singh, Festival of India, Brijbasi Printers, Dec 1, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;   Indian Hindu artisans from the period of the [[Chola dynasty|Chola empire]] in [[Tamil Nadu]] used bronze to create intricate statues via the [[lost-wax casting]] method with ornate detailing depicting the deities of [[Hinduism]]. The art form survives to this day, with many silpis, craftsmen, working in the areas of [[Swamimalai]] and [[Chennai]].

In antiquity other cultures also produced works of [[High culture|high art]] using bronze. For example: in Africa, the [[Benin Bronzes|bronze heads]] of the [[Benin Empire|Kingdom of Benin]]; in [[Europe]], Grecian bronzes typically of figures from [[Greek mythology]]; in [[east Asia]], [[Chinese ritual bronze]]s of the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] and [[Zhou dynasty]]—more often ceremonial vessels but including some figurine examples. Bronze sculptures, although known for their longevity, still undergo microbial degradation; such as from certain species of yeasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Microorganisms Attack Synthetic Polymers in Items Representing Our Cultural Heritage|author1=Francesca Cappitelli|author2=Claudia Sorlini|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=2008|volume=74|pmc=2227722|pmid=18065627|doi=10.1128/AEM.01768-07|issue=3|pages=564–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mirrors===
{{See also|Bronze mirror}}

Before it became possible to produce glass with acceptably flat surfaces, bronze was a standard material for mirrors. The reflecting surface was typically made slightly convex so that the whole face could be seen in a small mirror. Bronze was used for this purpose in many parts of the world, probably based on independent discoveries.

Bronze mirrors survive from the [[Egypt]]ian [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (2040–1750 BC). In Europe, the [[Etruscans]] were making bronze mirrors in the sixth century BC, and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] mirrors followed the same pattern. Although other materials such as [[speculum metal]] had come into use, bronze mirrors were still being made in Japan in the eighteenth century AD.

===Musical instruments===

Bronze is the preferred metal for [[bell (instrument)|bells]] in the form of a high tin bronze alloy known colloquially as [[bell metal]], which is about 23% tin.

Nearly all professional [[cymbal]]s are made from bronze, which gives a desirable balance of durability and [[timbre]]. Several types of bronze are used, commonly [[B20 (bronze)|B20 bronze]], which is roughly 20% tin, 80% copper, with traces of silver, or the tougher B8 bronze which is made from 8% tin and 92% copper. As the tin content in a bell or cymbal rises, the timbre drops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Lothar|last=Von Falkenhausen|title=Suspended Music: Chime-Bells in the Culture of Bronze Age China|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|page=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ve1h53NTNW0C&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106|isbn=978-0-520-07378-4|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160526225554/https://books.google.com/books?id=ve1h53NTNW0C&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106|archivedate=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bronze is also used for the windings of steel and nylon strings of various [[String instrument|stringed instruments]] such as the [[double bass]], [[piano]], [[harpsichord]], and [[guitar]]. Bronze strings are commonly reserved on pianoforte for the lower pitch tones, as they possess a superior sustain quality to that of high-tensile steel.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;McCreight, Tim. ''Metals technic: a collection of techniques for metalsmiths''. Brynmorgen Press, 1992. {{ISBN|0-9615984-3-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bronzes of various metallurgical properties are widely used in struck [[idiophones]] around the world, notably bells, singing bowls, gongs, cymbals, and other idiophones from [[Asia]]. Examples include Tibetan [[singing bowls]], temple [[bell (instrument)|bells]] of many sizes and shapes, gongs, [[Javanese people|Javanese]] [[gamelan]], and other bronze [[musical instrument]]s. The earliest bronze archeological finds in [[Indonesia]] date from 1–2 BC, including flat plates probably suspended and struck by a wooden or bone mallet.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LaPlantz, David. ''Jewelry – Metalwork 1991 Survey: Visions – Concepts – Communication'': S. LaPlantz: 1991. {{ISBN|0-942002-05-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient bronze drums from Thailand and Vietnam date back 2,000 years. Bronze bells from [[Thailand]] and [[Cambodia]] date back to 3,600 BC.

Some companies are now making [[saxophone]]s from [[phosphor bronze]] (3.5 to 10% tin and up to 1% phosphorus content).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sax.co.uk/signature-custom-alto-sax-phosphor-bronze-big-bell.ir |title=www.sax.co.uk |accessdate=18 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811002147/http://www.sax.co.uk/signature-custom-alto-sax-phosphor-bronze-big-bell.ir |archivedate=11 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell bronze is used to make the tone rings of many professional model banjos.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The tone ring is a heavy (usually 3&amp;nbsp;lbs.) folded or arched metal ring attached to a thick wood rim, over which a skin, or most often, a plastic membrane (or head) is stretched – it is the bell bronze that gives the banjo a crisp powerful lower register and clear bell-like treble register, especially in bluegrass music.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Coins and medals===
{{See also|Bronze medal}}

Bronze has also been used in coins; most “copper” coins are actually bronze, with about 4 percent tin and 1 percent zinc.&lt;ref name=&quot;bronze {{!}} alloy&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/bronze-alloy|title=bronze {{!}} alloy|access-date=2016-07-21|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730212401/https://www.britannica.com/technology/bronze-alloy|archivedate=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with coins, bronze has been used in the manufacture of various types of [[medal]]s for centuries, and are known in contemporary times for being awarded for third place in sporting competitions and other events. The later usage was in part attributed to the choices of [[gold]], [[silver]] and bronze to represent the first three [[Ages of Man]] in [[Greek mythology]]: the [[Golden Age]], when men lived among the gods; the [[Silver age]], where youth lasted a hundred years; and the [[Greek Heroic Age|Bronze Age]], the era of heroes, and was first adopted at the [[1904 Summer Olympics]]. At the 1896 event, silver was awarded to winners and bronze to runners-up, while at 1900 other prizes were given, not medals.
