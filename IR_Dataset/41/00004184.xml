'''''Bacillus thuringiensis''''' (or '''Bt''') is a [[Gram-positive]], soil-dwelling [[bacterium]], commonly used as a [[biological pesticide]]. ''B. thuringiensis'' also occurs naturally in the gut of [[caterpillar]]s of various types of [[moth]]s and [[butterfly|butterflies]], as well on leaf surfaces, aquatic environments, animal feces, insect-rich environments, and flour mills and grain-storage facilities.&lt;ref name=Brock&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Madigan |editor1-first=Michael T. |editor2-last=Martinko |editor2-first=John M. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Brock Biology of Microorganisms |edition=11th |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-13-144329-7}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = effective&gt;{{cite thesis |first=Nicolette |last=du Rand |title=Isolation of Entomopathogenic Gram Positive Spore Forming Bacteria Effective Against Coleoptera |type=PhD Thesis |publisher=University of KwaZulu-Natal |location= Pietermaritzburg, South Africa |date=July 2009 |hdl=10413/1235}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been observed to parasitize other moths such as ''[[Cadra calidella]]''—in laboratory experiments working with ''C. calidella'', many of the moths were diseased due to this parasite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cox PD | year = 1975 | title = The influence of photoperiod on the life-cycles of Ephestia calidella (Guenee) and Ephestia figulilella Gregson (Lepidoptera: Phycitidae) | journal = J.

During [[sporulation]], many Bt strains produce [[crystal protein]]s (proteinaceous inclusions), called [[Delta endotoxin|δ-endotoxins]], that have [[Insecticide|insecticidal]] action. This has led to their use as insecticides, and more recently to [[genetically modified crops]] using Bt genes, such as [[Genetically modified maize#Bt corn|Bt corn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8865583&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kumar PA, Sharma RP, Malik VS | title = The insecticidal proteins of Bacillus thuringiensis | journal = Advances in Applied Microbiology | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 1–43 | date = 1996 | pmid = 8865583 | doi = 10.1016/s0065-2164(08)70371-x| url =https://zenodo.org/record/1259743 | isbn = 9780120026425 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many crystal-producing Bt [[strain (biology)|strains]], though, do not have insecticidal properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roh&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roh JY, Choi JY, Li MS, Jin BR, Je YH | title = Bacillus thuringiensis as a specific, safe, and effective tool for insect pest control | journal = Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 547–59 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 18051264 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis|subspecies ''israelensis'']] is commonly used for control of mosquitoes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bti for Mosquito Control |url=https://www.epa.gov/mosquitocontrol/bti-mosquito-control |website=EPA.gov |accessdate=28 June 2018 |publisher=US EPA |language=en|date=2016-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[fungus gnat|fungus gnats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fungus Gnats Management Guidelines--UC IPM |url=http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7448.html |website=ipm.ucanr.edu |publisher=University of California Integrated Pest Management |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy and discovery==
In 1902, ''B. thuringiensis'' was first discovered in [[silkworm]]s by Japanese sericultural engineer {{nihongo|Ishiwatari Shigetane|石渡 繁胤}}. He named it ''B. sotto'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New Innovative Pesticides|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZR3uH7O713QC&amp;pg=PA61|year=1977|publisher=EPA|page=61|quote= In 1915 the bacterium was re-examined and named ''Bacillus sotto''. [...] At about the same time, Beriner was isolating the organism}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the Japanese word {{nihongo||卒倒|sottō|'collapse'}}, here referring to bacillary paralysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Natural Enemies in the Pacific Area: Biological Control|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ynweAQAAMAAJ|year=1967|publisher=Fukuoka Entomological Society|page=99|quote= &quot;Sotto&quot; in Japanese means &quot;sudden collapse&quot; or &quot;fainting&quot;, and &quot;sotto&quot; of ''Bacillus thuringiensis'' var. ''sotto'' derives its name from the &quot;sotto&quot; disease.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, German microbiologist [[Ernst Berliner]] rediscovered it when he isolated it as the cause of a disease called ''{{lang|de|[[Schlaffsucht]]}}'' in [[Ephestia kuehniella|flour moth]] caterpillars in [[Thuringia]] (hence the [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] ''thuringiensis'', &quot;Thuringian&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Richard C. | last1 = Reardon | first2 = Normand R. | last2 = Dubois | first3 = Winfred | last3 = McLane | name-list-format = vanc |title=''Bacillus thuringiensis'' for managing gypsy moth: a review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lebeWthmik4C|year=1994|publisher=USDA Forest Service|quote= Mediterranean flour moths, ''Ephestia'' (=''Anagasta'') ''kuehniella'' (Zeller), that were found in stored grain in [[Thuringia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''B. sotto'' would later be reassigned as ''B. thuringiensis'' var.

In 1976, Robert A. Zakharyan reported the presence of a plasmid in a strain of ''B. thuringiensis'' and suggested the plasmid's involvement in endospore and crystal formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zakharyan R.A ''et. el.'' |year=1979 |title=Plasmid DNA from Bacillus thuringiensis |journal=Microbiologiya |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=226–9 |issn=0026-3656}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Thomas Clement |editor1-last=Cheng |name-list-format=vanc |year=1984 |title=Pathogens of invertebrates: application in biological control and transmission mechanisms |isbn=978-0-306-41700-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/pathogensofinver07chen/page/159 159] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/pathogensofinver07chen/page/159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''B. thuringiensis'' is closely related to ''[[Bacillus cereus|B. cereus]]'', a soil bacterium, and ''[[Bacillus anthracis|B. anthracis]]'', the cause of [[Anthrax disease|anthrax]]; the three organisms differ mainly in their [[plasmid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Ole Andreas | last1= Økstad | first2 = Anne-Brit | last2 = Kolstø | name-list-format = vanc | chapter = Chapter 2: Genomics of Bacillus Species | veditors = Wiedmann M, Zhang W | title = Genomics of Foodborne Bacterial Pathogens, 29 Food Microbiology and Food Safety. | pages= 29–53 | publisher = Springer Science+Business Media, LLC | year = 2011 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4419-7686-4_2 | isbn= 978-1-4419-7685-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34–35}} Like other members of the genus, all three are [[aerobe]]s capable of producing [[endospore]]s.&lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;

Tubulin was long thought to be specific to [[eukaryote]]s.

===Subspecies===
There are several dozen recognized subspecies of ''B. thuringiensis''. Subspecies commonly used as insecticides include ''B. thuringiensis'' [[Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki|subspecies ''kurstaki'']] (Btk), subspecies ''israelensis'' (Bti) and subspecies ''aizawa''.

==Mechanism of insecticidal action==
Upon sporulation, ''B. thuringiensis'' forms crystals of [[proteinaceous]] insecticidal [[δ-endotoxin]]s (called crystal proteins or Cry proteins), which are encoded by ''cry'' genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Circkmore N |url=http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/home/Neil_Crickmore/Bt/index.html |title=Bacillus thuringiensis toxin nomenclature |access-date=2008-11-23| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081009193337/http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/home/Neil_Crickmore/Bt/index.html| archive-date= 9 October 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most strains of ''B. thuringiensis'', the ''cry'' genes are located on a [[plasmid]] (''cry'' is not a chromosomal gene in most strains).&lt;ref name=Stahly&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dean DH | title = Biochemical genetics of the bacterial insect-control agent Bacillus thuringiensis: basic principles and prospects for genetic engineering | journal = Biotechnology &amp; Genetic Engineering Reviews | volume = 2 | pages = 341–63 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6443645 | doi = 10.1080/02648725.1984.10647804 | url = http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/ncmh/BGER/pdf/Volume%202/BGER2-12.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Clayton1992&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4039/Ent124587-4 |title=Invitation Paper (C.p.

Cry toxins have specific activities against insect species of the orders [[Lepidoptera]] (moths and butterflies), [[Diptera]] (flies and mosquitoes), [[Coleoptera]] (beetles) and [[Hymenoptera]] ([[wasp]]s, [[bee]]s, [[ant]]s and [[sawfly|sawflies]]), as well as against [[nematode]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9729609&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schnepf E, Crickmore N, Van Rie J, Lereclus D, Baum J, Feitelson J, Zeigler DR, Dean DH | title = Bacillus thuringiensis and its pesticidal crystal proteins | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 62 | issue = 3 | pages = 775–806 | date = September 1998 | pmid = 9729609 | pmc = 98934 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12598644&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wei JZ, Hale K, Carta L, Platzer E, Wong C, Fang SC, Aroian RV | title = Bacillus thuringiensis crystal proteins that target nematodes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2760–5 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12598644 | pmc = 151414 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0538072100 | bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2760W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''B. thuringiensis'' serves as an important reservoir of Cry toxins for production of biological insecticides and insect-resistant [[Genetically modified food|genetically modified crops]].

It has been shown that a [[small RNA]] called '''BtsR1''' can silence the Cry toxin when outside the host by binding to the RBS site of the Cry5Ba toxin transcript and inhibiting its expression. The silencing results in increased ingestion by ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'' and is relieved inside the host, resulting in host death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Peng D, Luo X, Zhang N, Guo S, Zheng J, Chen L, Sun M | title = Small RNA-mediated Cry toxin silencing allows Bacillus thuringiensis to evade Caenorhabditis elegans avoidance behavioral defenses | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 159–173 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29069426 | pmc = 5758910 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkx959 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of spores and proteins in pest control==

==Use of Bt genes in genetic engineering of plants for pest control==
The Belgian company [[Plant Genetic Systems]] (now part of [[Bayer CropScience]]) was the first company (in 1985) to develop [[genetically modified crops]] ([[tobacco]]) with insect tolerance by expressing ''cry'' genes from ''B. thuringiensis''; the resulting crops contain [[delta endotoxin]].&lt;ref name=Hofte_1986&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Höfte H, de Greve H, Seurinck J, Jansens S, Mahillon J, Ampe C, Vandekerckhove J, Vanderbruggen H, van Montagu M, Zabeau M | title = Structural and functional analysis of a cloned delta endotoxin of Bacillus thuringiensis berliner 1715 | journal = European Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 161 | issue = 2 | pages = 273–80 | date = December 1986 | pmid = 3023091 | doi = 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1986.tb10443.x | displayauthors = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vaeck&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/328033a0 |title=Transgenic plants protected from insect attack |year=1987 |last1=Vaeck |displayauthors=3|first1=Mark |last2=Reynaerts |first2=Arlette |last3=Höfte |first3=Herman |last4=Jansens |first4=Stefan |last5=de Beuckeleer |first5=Marc |last6=Dean |first6=Caroline |last7=Zabeau |first7=Marc |last8=Van Montagu |first8=Marc |last9=Leemans |first9=Jan | name-list-format = vanc |journal=Nature |volume=328 |issue=6125 |pages=33–7 |bibcode=1987Natur.328...33V}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bt tobacco was never commercialized; tobacco plants are used to test genetic modifications since they are easy to manipulate genetically and are not part of the food supply.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, GMO Compass.

In 1996, [[genetically modified maize]] producing Bt Cry protein was approved, which killed the European corn borer and related species; subsequent Bt genes were introduced that killed corn rootworm larvae.&lt;ref name=NatureEd&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hellmich RL, Hellmich KA | year = 2012 | title = Use and Impact of Bt Maize | url = http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/use-and-impact-of-bt-maize-46975413 | journal = Nature Education Knowledge | volume = 3 | issue = 10| page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bt genes engineered into crops and approved for release include, singly and stacked: Cry1A.105, CryIAb, CryIF, Cry2Ab, [[Cry3Bb1]], Cry34Ab1, Cry35Ab1, mCry3A, and VIP, and the engineered crops include corn and cotton.&lt;ref&gt;Ric Bessin, Extension Entomologist, University of Kentucky College of Agriculture.

===Safety studies===
The use of Bt [[toxin]]s as [[Insecticide#Plant-incorporated protectants|plant-incorporated protectants]] prompted the need for extensive evaluation of their safety for use in foods and potential unintended impacts on the environment.

====Dietary risk assessment====
Concerns over the safety of consumption of genetically-modified plant materials that contain [[Delta endotoxin|Cry proteins]] have been addressed in extensive dietary risk assessment studies. While the target pests are exposed to the toxins primarily through leaf and stalk material, Cry proteins are also expressed in other parts of the plant, including trace amounts in maize kernels which are ultimately consumed by both humans and animals.&lt;ref&gt;Fearing, P.L., Brown, D., Vlachos, D., Meghji, M., L. Privalle. 1997. Quantitative analysis of Cry1A(b) expression in Bt maize plants, tissues, and silage and stability of expression over generations. Mol. Breed. 3:169-176.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Toxicology studies=====
Animal models have been used to assess human health risk from consumption of products containing Cry proteins. The United States Environmental Protection Agency recognizes mouse acute oral feeding studies where doses as high as 5,000&amp;nbsp;mg/kg body weight resulted in [[No-observed-adverse-effect level|no observed adverse effects]].&lt;ref&gt;US EPA. 2001. [http://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/reg_actions/pip/bt_brad2/2-id_health.pdf Bt Plant-Incorporated Protectants October 15, 2001 Biopesticides Registration Action Document]&lt;/ref&gt; Research on other known toxic proteins suggests that toxicity occurs at much lower doses, further suggesting that Bt toxins are not toxic to mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sjoblad RD, McClintock JT, Engler R | title = Toxicological considerations for protein components of biological pesticide products | journal = Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–9 | date = February 1992 | pmid = 1553409 | doi = 10.1016/0273-2300(92)90078-n | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1258447 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of toxicology studies are further strengthened by the lack of observed toxicity from decades of use of ''B. thuringiensis'' and its crystalline proteins as an insecticidal spray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koch MS, Ward JM, Levine SL, Baum JA, Vicini JL, Hammond BG | title = The food and environmental safety of Bt crops | journal = Frontiers in Plant Science | volume = 6 | pages = 283 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25972882 | pmc = 4413729 | doi = 10.3389/fpls.2015.00283 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Allergenicity studies=====
Introduction of a new protein raised concerns regarding the potential for allergic responses in sensitive individuals. [[Bioinformatics|Bioinformatic]] analysis of known [[allergen]]s has indicated there is no concern of [[Allergy|allergic reactions]] as a result of consumption of Bt toxins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Randhawa GJ, Singh M, Grover M | title = Bioinformatic analysis for allergenicity assessment of Bacillus thuringiensis Cry proteins expressed in insect-resistant food crops | journal = Food and Chemical Toxicology | volume = 49 | issue = 2 | pages = 356–62 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21078358 | doi = 10.1016/j.fct.2010.11.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Allergy#Skin prick testing|skin prick testing]] using purified Bt protein resulted in no detectable production of toxin-specific [[Immunoglobulin E|IgE]] antibodies, even in [[Atopy|atopic]] patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Batista R, Nunes B, Carmo M, Cardoso C, José HS, de Almeida AB, Manique A, Bento L, Ricardo CP, Oliveira MM | title = Lack of detectable allergenicity of transgenic maize and soya samples | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 116 | issue = 2 | pages = 403–10 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16083797 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2005.04.014 | url = http://repositorio.insa.pt/bitstream/10400.18/114/1/Lack%20of%20detectable%20allergenicity.pdf | hdl = 10400.18/114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Digestibility studies=====
Studies have been conducted to evaluate the fate of Bt toxins that are ingested in foods. Bt toxin proteins have been shown to digest within minutes of exposure to simulated [[Gastric acid|gastric fluids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Betz FS, Hammond BG, Fuchs RL | title = Safety and advantages of Bacillus thuringiensis-protected plants to control insect pests | journal = Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 156–73 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 11067772 | doi = 10.1006/rtph.2000.1426 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The instability of the proteins in digestive fluids is an additional indication that Cry proteins are unlikely to be allergenic, since most known food allergens resist degradation and are ultimately [[Small intestine#Absorption|absorbed]] in the small intestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Astwood JD, Leach JN, Fuchs RL | title = Stability of food allergens to digestion in vitro | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 14 | issue = 10 | pages = 1269–73 | date = October 1996 | pmid = 9631091 | doi = 10.1038/nbt1096-1269 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ecological risk assessment====
Ecological risk assessment aims to ensure there is no unintended impact on non-target organisms and no contamination of natural resources as a result of the use of a new substance, such as the use of Bt in genetically-modified crops. The impact of Bt toxins on the environments where transgenic plants are grown has been evaluated to ensure no adverse effects outside of targeted crop pests.&lt;ref&gt;US EPA. 2001. Bt Plant-Incorporated Protectants Biopesticides Registration Action Document [http://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/reg_actions/pip/1-overview.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Persistence in environment=====
Concerns over possible environmental impact from accumulation of Bt toxins from plant tissues, pollen dispersal, and direct secretion from roots have been investigated. Bt toxins may persist in soil for over 200 days, with [[half-life|half-lives]] between 1.6 and 22 days. Much of the toxin is initially degraded rapidly by microorganisms in the environment, while some is [[adsorbed]] by organic matter and persists longer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helassa&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Helassa N, Quiquampoix H, Staunton S | veditors = Xu J, Sparks D | title=Molecular Environmental Soil Science|date=2013|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=978-94-007-4177-5|pages=49–77|chapter=Structure, Biological Activity and Environmental Fate of Insecticidal Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) Cry Proteins of Bacterial and Genetically Modified Plant Origin| doi = 10.1007/978-94-007-4177-5_3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies, in contrast, claim that the toxins do not persist in the soil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helassa&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dubelman S, Ayden BR, Bader BM, Brown CR, Jiang, Vlachos D | year = 2005 | title = Cry1Ab Protein Does Not Persist in Soil After 3 Years of Sustained Bt Corn Use | url = http://ee.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/4/915.full#ref-25 | journal = Environ.

=====Impact on non-target organisms=====
The toxic nature of Bt proteins has an adverse impact on many major crop pests, but ecological risk assessments have been conducted to ensure safety of beneficial non-target organisms that may come into contact with the toxins. Widespread concerns over toxicity in [[Bacillus thuringiensis#Lepidopteran toxicity|non-target lepidopterans]], such as the monarch butterfly, have been disproved through proper exposure characterization, where it was determined that non-target organisms are not exposed to high enough amounts of the Bt toxins to have an adverse effect on the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sears MK, Hellmich RL, Stanley-Horn DE, Oberhauser KS, Pleasants JM, Mattila HR, Siegfried BD, Dively GP | title = Impact of Bt corn pollen on monarch butterfly populations: a risk assessment | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 98 | issue = 21 | pages = 11937–42 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11559842 | pmc = 59819 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.211329998 | bibcode = 2001PNAS...9811937S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil-dwelling organisms, potentially exposed to Bt toxins through root exudates, are not impacted by the growth of Bt crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Saxena D, Stotzky G | year = 2000 | title = ''Bacillus thuringiensis'' (Bt) toxin released from root exudates and biomass of Bt corn has no apparent effect on earthworms, nematodes, protozoa, bacteria, and fungi in soil | url = http://www.ask-force.org/web/Bt/Saxena-Stotzky-2001.pdf | journal = Soil Biology &amp; Biochemistry | volume = 33 | issue = 9| pages = 1225–1230 | doi=10.1016/s0038-0717(01)00027-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insect resistance===
Multiple insects have developed a resistance to ''B. thuringiensis''. In November 2009, [[Monsanto]] scientists found the [[pink bollworm]] had become [[Pesticide resistance|resistant]] to the first-generation [[Bt cotton]] in parts of [[Gujarat]], India - that generation expresses one Bt gene, ''Cry1Ac''. This was the first instance of Bt resistance confirmed by Monsanto anywhere in the world.&lt;ref name=MonsantoWebCotton&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/Pages/india-pink-bollworm.aspx |title=Cotton in India |publisher=Monsanto.com |date=2008-11-03 |access-date=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bagla P | title = India.

===Secondary pests===
Several studies have documented surges in &quot;sucking pests&quot; (which are not affected by Bt toxins) within a few years of adoption of Bt cotton. In China, the main problem has been with [[mirids]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lu Y, Wu K, Jiang Y, Xia B, Li P, Feng H, Wyckhuys KA, Guo Y | title = Mirid bug outbreaks in multiple crops correlated with wide-scale adoption of Bt cotton in China | journal = Science | volume = 328 | issue = 5982 | pages = 1151–4 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20466880 | doi = 10.1126/science.1187881 | bibcode = 2010Sci...328.1151L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=David R. |last1=Just |first2=Shenghui |last2=Wang |first3=Per |last3=Pinstrup-Andersen | name-list-format = vanc |year=2006 |title=Tarnishing Silver Bullets: Bt Technology Adoption, Bounded Rationality and the Outbreak of Secondary Pest Infestations in China |conference=American Agricultural Economics Association Annual Meeting |location=Long Beach, CA |url=http://purl.umn.edu/21230 |laysource=Cornell Chronicle |lay-url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/July06/Bt.cotton.China.ssl.html |laydate=July 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have in some cases &quot;completely eroded all benefits from Bt cotton cultivation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1504/IJBT.2008.018348 |title=Bt-cotton and secondary pests |year=2008 |last1=Wang |first1=Shenghui |last2=Just |first2=David R. |last3=Pinstrup-Andersen |first3=Per | name-list-format = vanc |journal=International Journal of Biotechnology |volume=10 |issue=2/3 |pages=113–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in sucking pests depended on local temperature and rainfall conditions and increased in half the villages studied. The increase in insecticide use for the control of these secondary insects was far smaller than the reduction in total insecticide use due to Bt cotton adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1671-2927(09)60012-2 |title=Bt Cotton in China: Are Secondary Insect Infestations Offsetting the Benefits in Farmer Fields? |year=2009 |last1=Wang |first1=Zi-jun |last2=Lin |first2=Hai |last3=Huang |first3=Ji-kun |last4=Hu |first4=Rui-fa |last5=Rozelle |first5=Scott |last6=Pray |first6=Carl | name-list-format = vanc |journal=Agricultural Sciences in China |volume=8 |pages=83–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study in five provinces in China found the reduction in pesticide use in Bt cotton cultivars is significantly lower than that reported in research elsewhere, consistent with the hypothesis suggested by recent studies that more pesticide sprayings are needed over time to control emerging secondary pests, such as aphids, spider mites, and lygus bugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhao JH, Ho P, Azadi H | title = Benefits of Bt cotton counterbalanced by secondary pests?

===Controversies===
{{Main|Genetically modified food controversies}}
There are controversies around GMOs on several levels, including whether making them is ethical, whether food produced with them is safe, whether such food should be labeled and if so how, whether agricultural biotech is needed to address world hunger now or in the future, and more specifically to GM crops—intellectual property and market dynamics; environmental effects of GM crops; and GM crops' role in industrial agricultural more generally.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, Frontline. [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/harvest/viewpoints/ Harvest of Fear: Viewpoints]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also issues specific to Bt transgenic crops.

====Lepidopteran toxicity====
The most publicised problem associated with Bt crops is the claim that pollen from Bt maize could kill the [[monarch butterfly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Losey JE, Rayor LS, Carter ME | title = Transgenic pollen harms monarch larvae | journal = Nature | volume = 399 | issue = 6733 | pages = 214 | date = May 1999 | pmid = 10353241 | doi = 10.1038/20338 | bibcode = 1999Natur.399..214L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper produced a public uproar and demonstrations against Bt maize; however by 2001 several follow-up studies coordinated by the USDA had asserted that &quot;the most common types of Bt maize pollen are not toxic to monarch larvae in concentrations the insects would encounter in the fields.&quot;&lt;ref name=Waltz&gt;Emily Waltz for Nature News.

However, ''[[Spodoptera littoralis|S. littoralis]]'' showed resistance to many strains of ''B. thuriginesis'' and were only effectively controlled by few strains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Salama HS, Foda MS, Sharaby A |title=A proposed new biological standard for bioassay of bacterial insecticides vs. Spodoptera spp.|journal=Tropical Pest Management|date=1989|volume=35|issue=3|pages=326–330|url=https://www.cabi.org/isc/abstract/19901181560|doi=10.1080/09670878909371391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wild maize genetic mixing====
A study published in ''Nature'' in 2001 reported Bt-containing maize genes were found in maize in its center of origin, [[Oaxaca]], Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Quist D, Chapela IH | title = Transgenic DNA introgressed into traditional maize landraces in Oaxaca, Mexico | journal = Nature | volume = 414 | issue = 6863 | pages = 541–3 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11734853 | doi = 10.1038/35107068 | bibcode = 2001Natur.414..541Q }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, paper concluded, &quot;the evidence available is not sufficient to justify the publication of the original paper.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaplinsky N, Braun D, Lisch D, Hay A, Hake S, Freeling M | title = Biodiversity (Communications arising): maize transgene results in Mexico are artefacts | journal = Nature | volume = 416 | issue = 6881 | pages = 601–2; discussion 600, 602 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11935145 | doi = 10.1038/nature739 | bibcode = 2002Natur.416..601K }}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant controversy happened over the paper and ''Nature''{{'}}s unprecedented notice.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs.org&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/now/science/genenature.html | title=NOW with Bill Moyers. Science &amp; Health. Seeds of Conflict - NATURE Article Debate &amp;#124; PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subsequent large-scale study in 2005 failed to find any evidence of genetic mixing in Oaxaca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ortiz-García S, Ezcurra E, Schoel B, Acevedo F, Soberón J, Snow AA | title = Absence of detectable transgenes in local landraces of maize in Oaxaca, Mexico (2003-2004) | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 35 | pages = 12338–43 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16093316 | pmc = 1184035 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0503356102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..10212338O | jstor = 3376579 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study found the &quot;transgenic proteins expressed in maize were found in two (0.96%) of 208 samples from farmers' fields, located in two (8%) of 25 sampled communities.&quot; Mexico imports a substantial amount of maize from the U.S., and due to formal and informal seed networks among rural farmers, many potential routes are available for transgenic maize to enter into food and feed webs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1890/1540-9295(2007)5[247:TPIMIT]2.0.CO;2 |year=2007 |volume=5 |pages=247–52 |title=Transgenic proteins in maize in the Soil Conservation area of Federal District, Mexico |last1=Serratos-Hernández |first1=José-Antonio |last2=Gómez-Olivares |first2=José-Luis |last3=Salinas-Arreortua |first3=Noé |last4=Buendía-Rodríguez |first4=Enrique |last5=Islas-Gutiérrez |first5=Fabián |last6=De-Ita |first6=Ana | name-list-format = vanc |journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment |issue=5 |issn=1540-9295}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found small-scale (about 1%) introduction of transgenic sequences in sampled fields in Mexico; it did not find evidence for or against this introduced genetic material being inherited by the next generation of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Piñeyro-Nelson A, Van Heerwaarden J, Perales HR, Serratos-Hernández JA, Rangel A, Hufford MB, Gepts P, Garay-Arroyo A, Rivera-Bustamante R, Alvarez-Buylla ER | title = Transgenes in Mexican maize: molecular evidence and methodological considerations for GMO detection in landrace populations | journal = Molecular Ecology | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 750–61 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19143938 | pmc = 3001031 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03993.x | displayauthors = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dalton R | title = Modified genes spread to local maize | journal = Nature | volume = 456 | issue = 7219 | pages = 149 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 19005518 | doi = 10.1038/456149a }}&lt;/ref&gt; That study was immediately criticized, with the reviewer writing, &quot;Genetically, any given plant should be either non-transgenic or transgenic, therefore for leaf tissue of a single transgenic plant, a GMO level close to 100% is expected. In their study, the authors chose to classify leaf samples as transgenic despite GMO levels of about 0.1%. We contend that results such as these are incorrectly interpreted as positive and are more likely to be indicative of contamination in the laboratory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schoel B, Fagan J | title = Insufficient evidence for the discovery of transgenes in Mexican landraces | journal = Molecular Ecology | volume = 18 | issue = 20 | pages = 4143–4; discussion 4145–50 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19793201 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04368.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Colony collapse disorder====
As of 2007, a new phenomenon called [[colony collapse disorder]] (CCD) began affecting [[Honey bee|bee]] hives all over North America. Initial speculation on possible causes included new parasites, pesticide use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/News/docs.htm?docid=15572 |title=ARS : Questions and Answers: Colony Collapse Disorder |work=ARS News |date=2008-05-29 | access-date=2008-11-23| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081105121119/http://www.ars.usda.gov/News/docs.htm?docid=15572| archive-date= 5 November 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of Bt transgenic crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Latsch |first=Gunther |title=Are GM Crops Killing Bees? |work=[[Spiegel Online]] |date=March 22, 2007 |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/collapsing-colonies-are-gm-crops-killing-bees-a-473166.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mid-Atlantic Apiculture Research and Extension Consortium]] found no evidence that pollen from Bt crops is adversely affecting bees.&lt;ref name=Waltz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1051/apido:2007022 |title=Effects of Bt corn pollen on honey bees: Emphasis on protocol development |year=2007 |last1=Rose |first1=Robyn |last2=Dively |first2=Galen P. |last3=Pettis |first3=Jeff | name-list-format = vanc |journal=Apidologie |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=368–77|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00892271/document }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the USDA, &quot;Genetically modified (GM) crops, most commonly Bt corn, have been offered up as the cause of CCD. But there is no correlation between where GM crops are planted and the pattern of CCD incidents. Also, GM crops have been widely planted since the late 1990s, but CCD did not appear until 2006. In addition, CCD has been reported in countries that do not allow GM crops to be planted, such as Switzerland. German researchers have noted in one study a possible correlation between exposure to Bt pollen and compromised immunity to ''Nosema''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;USDA. [http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/jul12/colony0712.htm Colony Collapse Disorder: An Incomplete Puzzle]  Agricultural Research Magazine.

==Beta-exotoxins==

Some isolates of ''B. thuringiensis'' produce a class of insecticidal small molecules called beta-[[exotoxin]], the common name for which is thuringiensin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ofmpub.epa.gov/apex/pesticides/f?p=CHEMICALSEARCH:3:0::NO:1,3,31,7,12,25:P3_XCHEMICAL_ID:4063 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130409224957/http://ofmpub.epa.gov/apex/pesticides/f?p=CHEMICALSEARCH:3:0::NO:1,3,31,7,12,25:P3_XCHEMICAL_ID:4063 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-04-09 |title=EPA pesticide database |publisher=Ofmpub.epa.gov |date=2010-11-17 |access-date=2013-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A consensus document produced by the OECD says: &quot;Beta-exotoxins are known to be toxic to humans and almost all other forms of life and its presence is prohibited in ''B. thuringiensis'' microbial products&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Environment Directorate, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
