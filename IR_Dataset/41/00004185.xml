A '''bacteriophage''' ({{IPAc-en|b|æ|k|ˈ|t|ɪər|i|əʊ|f|eɪ|dʒ}}), also known informally as a '''''phage''''' ({{IPAc-en|f|eɪ|dʒ}}), is a [[virus]] that infects and replicates within [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. The term was derived from &quot;bacteria&quot; and the [[Greek language|Greek]] φαγεῖν (''{{lang|grc-Latn|phagein}}''), meaning &quot;to devour&quot;. Bacteriophages are composed of [[protein]]s that [[Capsid|encapsulate]] a [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] [[genome]], and may have structures that are either simple or elaborate. Their genomes may encode as few as four genes (e.g. [[Bacteriophage MS2|MS2]]) and as many as hundreds of [[genes]]. Phages replicate within the bacterium following the injection of their genome into its [[cytoplasm]].

Bacteriophages are among the most common and diverse entities in the [[biosphere]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = McGrath S and van Sinderen D (editors). | title = Bacteriophage: Genetics and Molecular Biology | edition = 1st | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2007 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/phage | isbn = 978-1-904455-14-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacteriophages are ubiquitous viruses, found wherever bacteria exist.

== Classification ==
Bacteriophages occur abundantly in the biosphere, with different genomes, and lifestyles. Phages are classified by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) according to [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and nucleic acid.

Nineteen families are currently recognized by the ICTV that infect [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. Of these, only two families have RNA genomes, and only five families are surrounded by an envelope. Of the viral families with DNA genomes, only two have single-stranded genomes. Eight of the viral families with DNA genomes have circular genomes, while nine have linear genomes. Nine families infect bacteria only, nine infect archaea only, and one (''Tectiviridae'') infects both bacteria and archaea.

== History ==

In 1896, [[Ernest Hanbury Hankin]] reported that something in the waters of the [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] rivers in [[India]] had a marked [[antibacterial]] action against [[cholera]] and it could pass through a very fine porcelain filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hankin E H. |title=L'action bactericide des eaux de la Jumna et du Gange sur le vibrion du cholera|journal=Annales de l'Institut Pasteur|year=1896|volume=10|pages=511–523|language=French|url=https://archive.org/stream/annalesdelinstit10inst#page/511/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, [[United Kingdom|British]] [[bacteriologist]] [[Frederick Twort]], superintendent of the Brown Institution of London, discovered a small agent that infected and killed bacteria. He believed the agent must be one of the following:
# a stage in the [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] of the bacteria 
# an [[enzyme]] produced by the bacteria themselves, or
# a virus that grew on and destroyed the bacteria&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Twort | first1 = F.

Twort's research was interrupted by the onset of [[World War I]] and a shortage of funding.

{{Main|Phage therapy}}

Phages were discovered to be antibacterial agents and were used in the former [[Soviet]] Republic of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (pioneered there by [[Giorgi Eliava]] with help from the co-discoverer of bacteriophages, [[Félix d'Herelle]]) during the 1920s and 1930s for treating bacterial infections. They had widespread use, including treatment of soldiers in the [[Red Army]]. However, they were abandoned for general use in the West for several reasons:

* Antibiotics were discovered and marketed widely. They were easier to make, store, and to prescribe.
* Medical trials of phages were carried out, but a basic lack of understanding raised questions about the validity of these trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kutter|first1=Elizabeth|last2=De Vos|first2=Daniel|last3=Gvasalia|first3=Guram|last4=Alavidze|first4=Zemphira|last5=Gogokhia|first5=Lasha|last6=Kuhl|first6=Sarah|last7=Abedon|first7=Stephen|title=Phage Therapy in Clinical Practice: Treatment of Human Infections|journal=Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology|date=1 January 2010|volume=11|issue=1|pages=69–86|doi=10.2174/138920110790725401|pmid=20214609|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c4536f7c0fed5b32b600b8f61ceb69209b4bf819}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Publication of research in the Soviet Union was mainly in the [[Russian language|Russian]] or [[Georgian language]]s and for many years, was not followed internationally.

The use of phages has continued since the end of the Cold War in Russia,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gol&quot;&gt;''Сергей Головин'' [https://www.nkj.ru/archive/articles/31498/ Бактериофаги: убийцы в роли спасителей] // [[Наука и жизнь]]. – 2017. – № 6. – С. 26–33&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia and elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe. The first regulated, randomized, double-blind [[clinical trial]] was reported in the Journal of Wound Care in June 2009, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of a bacteriophage cocktail to treat infected venous ulcers of the leg in human patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhoads2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rhoads|first1=DD|last2=Wolcott|first2=RD|last3=Kuskowski|first3=MA|last4=Wolcott|first4=BM|last5=Ward|first5=LS|last6=Sulakvelidze|first6=A|title=Bacteriophage therapy of venous leg ulcers in humans: results of a phase I safety trial|journal=Journal of Wound Care|date=June 2009|volume=18|issue=6|pages=237–8, 240–3|pmid=19661847|doi=10.12968/jowc.2009.18.6.42801}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA approved the study as a Phase I clinical trial. The study's results demonstrated the safety of therapeutic application of bacteriophages, but did not show efficacy. The authors explained that the use of certain chemicals that are part of standard wound care (e.g. [[lactoferrin]] or silver) may have interfered with bacteriophage viability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhoads2009&quot; /&gt; Shortly after that, another controlled clinical trial in Western Europe (treatment of ear infections caused by ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'') was reported in the journal, Clinical Otolaryngology in August 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=A.|last2=Hawkins|first2=C.H.|last3=Änggård|first3=E.E.|last4=Harper|first4=D.R.|title=A controlled clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteriophage preparation in chronic otitis due to antibiotic-resistant ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''; a preliminary report of efficacy|journal=Clinical Otolaryngology|date=August 2009|volume=34|issue=4|pages=349–357|doi=10.1111/j.1749-4486.2009.01973.x|pmid=19673983}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study concludes that bacteriophage preparations were safe and effective for treatment of chronic ear infections in humans. Additionally, there have been numerous animal and other experimental clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of bacteriophages for various diseases, such as infected burns and wounds, and cystic fibrosis associated lung infections, among others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright2009&quot;/&gt;

Meanwhile, bacteriophage researchers have been developing engineered viruses to overcome [[antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistance]], and engineering the phage genes responsible for coding enzymes that degrade the biofilm matrix, phage structural proteins, and the enzymes responsible for [[lysis]] of the bacterial cell wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;mmbr&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Prescott&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;horizon&quot;/&gt; There have been results showing that T4 phages that are small in size and short-tailed, can be helpful in detecting ''E.coli'' in the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tawil|first=Nancy|date=April 2012|title=Surface plasmon resonance detection of E. coli and mathicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteriophages|journal=PLOS Genetics|volume=3|issue=5|pages=e78|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0030078|pmid=17530925|pmc=1877875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therapeutic efficacy of a phage cocktail was evaluated in a mice model with nasal infection of multidrug-resistant (MDR) ''A. baumannii''. Mice treated with the phage cocktail showed a 2.3-fold higher survival rate than those untreated in seven days post infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cha|first=Kyoungeun|last2=Oh|first2=Hynu K.|last3=Jang|first3=Jae Y.|last4=Jo|first4=Yunyeol|last5=Kim|first5=Won K.|last6=Ha|first6=Geon U.|last7=Ko|first7=Kwan S.|last8=Myung|first8=Heejoon|date=10 April 2018|title=Characterization of Two Novel Bacteriophages Infecting Multidrug-Resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii and Evaluation of Their Therapeutic Efficacy in Vivo|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=9|pages=696|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2018.00696|pmid=29755420|issn=1664-302X|pmc=5932359}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 a patient with a pancreas compromised by MDR ''A. baumannii'' was put on several antibiotics, despite this the patient's health continued to deteriorate during a four-month period. Without effective antibiotics the patient was subjected to phage therapy using a phage cocktail containing nine different phages that had been demonstrated to be effective against MDR ''A. baumannii''. Once on this therapy the patient's downward clinical trajectory reversed, and returned to health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schooley|first=Robert T.|last2=Biswas|first2=Biswajit|last3=Gill|first3=Jason J.|last4=Hernandez-Morales|first4=Adriana|last5=Lancaster|first5=Jacob|last6=Lessor|first6=Lauren|last7=Barr|first7=Jeremy J.|last8=Reed|first8=Sharon L.|last9=Rohwer|first9=Forest|date=October 2017|title=Development and Use of Personalized Bacteriophage-Based Therapeutic Cocktails To Treat a Patient with a Disseminated Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Infection|journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy|volume=61|issue=10|doi=10.1128/AAC.00954-17|issn=0066-4804|pmc=5610518|pmid=28807909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Counteracting bioweapons and toxins''' – Government agencies in the West have for several years been looking to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and the former [[Soviet Union]] for help with exploiting phages for counteracting bioweapons and toxins, such as [[anthrax]] and [[botulism]].&lt;ref&gt;Vaisman, Daria (25 May 2007) [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/world/americas/25iht-institute.4.5869943.html Studying anthrax in a Soviet-era lab – with Western funding]. ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Developments are continuing among research groups in the U.S. Other uses include spray application in horticulture for protecting plants and vegetable produce from decay and the spread of bacterial disease. Other applications for bacteriophages are as biocides for environmental surfaces, e.g., in hospitals, and as preventative treatments for catheters and medical devices before use in clinical settings.

'''[[Phage display]]''' is a different use of phages involving a library of phages with a variable peptide linked to a surface protein. Each phage genome encodes the variant of the protein displayed on its surface (hence the name), providing a link between the peptide variant and its encoding gene. Variant phages from the library may be selected through their binding affinity to an immobilized molecule (e.g., botulism toxin) to neutralize it. The bound, selected phages can be multiplied by reinfecting a susceptible bacterial strain, thus allowing them to retrieve the peptides encoded in them for further study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith GP, Petrenko VA | title = Phage Display | journal = Chem.

== Replication ==
[[File:Phage injection.png|thumb|right|upright=2|Diagram of the DNA injection process]]
Bacteriophages may have a [[lytic cycle]] or a [[lysogenic cycle]]. With ''lytic phages'' such as the [[T4 phage]], bacterial cells are broken open (lysed) and destroyed after immediate replication of the virion. As soon as the cell is destroyed, the phage progeny can find new hosts to infect. Lytic phages are more suitable for [[phage therapy]]. Some lytic phages undergo a phenomenon known as lysis inhibition, where completed phage progeny will not immediately lyse out of the cell if extracellular phage concentrations are high. This mechanism is not identical to that of [[Temperateness (virology)|temperate phage]] going dormant and usually, is temporary.

In contrast, the ''[[lysogenic cycle]]'' does not result in immediate lysing of the host cell. Those phages able to undergo lysogeny are known as [[temperate phage]]s. Their viral genome will integrate with host DNA and replicate along with it, relatively harmlessly, or may even become established as a [[plasmid]]. The virus remains dormant until host conditions deteriorate, perhaps due to depletion of nutrients, then, the [[endogenous]] phages (known as [[prophage]]s) become active. At this point they initiate the reproductive cycle, resulting in lysis of the host cell. As the lysogenic cycle allows the host cell to continue to survive and reproduce, the virus is replicated in all offspring of the cell. An example of a bacteriophage known to follow the lysogenic cycle and the lytic cycle is the [[phage lambda]] of ''E. coli.''&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Kenneth A., Jonathan B. Losos, Susan R. Singer, Peter H Raven, and George B. Johnson. (2011). ''Biology'', p. 533. McGraw-Hill, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-07-893649-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes prophages may provide benefits to the host bacterium while they are dormant by adding new functions to the bacterial [[genome]], in a phenomenon called [[lysogenic conversion]]. Examples are the conversion of harmless strains of ''[[Corynebacterium diphtheriae]]'' or ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' by bacteriophages, to highly virulent ones that cause [[diphtheria]] or [[cholera]], respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19007916&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mokrousov I |title=''Corynebacterium diphtheriae'': genome diversity, population structure and genotyping perspectives |journal=Infection, Genetics and Evolution |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=1–15 |date= 2009 |pmid=19007916 |doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2008.09.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21799407&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Charles RC, Ryan ET |title=Cholera in the 21st century |journal=Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=472–7 |date=October 2011 |pmid=21799407 |doi=10.1097/QCO.0b013e32834a88af }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strategies to combat certain bacterial infections by targeting these toxin-encoding prophages have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Keen | first1 = E.

=== Attachment and penetration ===

Bacterial cells are protected by a cell wall of [[polysaccharides]], which are important virulence factors protecting bacterial cells against both immune host defenses and [[antibiotics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2174/0929867322666150209152851|pmid=25666799|pmc=4468916|title=Bacteriophages and Phage-Derived Proteins – Application Approaches|journal=Current Medicinal Chemistry|volume=22|issue=14|pages=1757–1773|year=2015|last1=Drulis-Kawa|first1=Zuzanna|last2=Majkowska-Skrobek|first2=Grazyna|last3=MacIejewska|first3=Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt; To enter a host cell, bacteriophages attach to specific receptors on the surface of bacteria, including [[lipopolysaccharide]]s, [[teichoic acid]]s, [[protein]]s, or even [[flagella]]. This specificity means a bacteriophage can infect only certain bacteria bearing receptors to which they can bind, which in turn, determines the phage's host range. Polysaccharide-degrading enzymes, like endolysins are virion-associated proteins to enzymatically degrade the capsular outer layer of their hosts, at the initial step of a tightly programmed phage infection process.
Host growth conditions also influence the ability of the phage to attach and invade them.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9356254&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

Myovirus bacteriophages use a [[hypodermic syringe]]-like motion to inject their genetic material into the cell. After contacting the appropriate receptor, the tail fibers flex to bring the base plate closer to the surface of the cell. This is known as reversible binding. Once attached completely, irreversible binding is initiated and the tail contracts, possibly with the help of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], present in the tail,&lt;ref name=&quot;Prescott&quot; /&gt; injecting genetic material through the bacterial membrane. The injection is accomplished through a sort of bending motion in the shaft by going to the side, contracting closer to the cell and pushing back up. Podoviruses lack an elongated tail sheath like that of a myovirus, so instead, they use their small, tooth-like tail fibers enzymatically to degrade a portion of the cell membrane before inserting their genetic material.

=== Synthesis of proteins and nucleic acid ===
Within minutes, bacterial [[ribosome]]s start translating viral mRNA into protein. For RNA-based phages, [[RNA replicase]] is synthesized early in the process. Proteins modify the bacterial [[RNA polymerase]] so it preferentially transcribes viral mRNA. The host's normal synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids is disrupted, and it is forced to manufacture viral products instead. These products go on to become part of new virions within the cell, helper proteins that contribute to the assemblage of new virions, or proteins involved in cell [[lysis]]. In 1972, [[Walter Fiers]] ([[University of Ghent]], [[Belgium]]) was the first to establish the complete nucleotide sequence of a gene and in 1976, of the viral genome of [[bacteriophage MS2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some dsDNA bacteriophages encode ribosomal proteins, which are thought to modulate protein translation during phage infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mizuno |first1=CM |last2=Guyomar |first2=C |last3=Roux |first3=S |last4=Lavigne |first4=R |last5=Rodriguez-Valera |first5=F |last6=Sullivan |first6=MB |last7=Gillet |first7=R |last8=Forterre |first8=P |last9=Krupovic |first9=M |title=Numerous cultivated and uncultivated viruses encode ribosomal proteins. |journal=Nature Communications |date=2019 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=752 |doi=10.1038/s41467-019-08672-6 |pmid=30765709|pmc=6375957 |bibcode=2019NatCo..10..752M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Virion assembly ===
In the case of the [[T4 phage]], the construction of new virus particles involves the assistance of helper proteins. The base plates are assembled first, with the tails being built upon them afterward. The head capsids, constructed separately, will spontaneously assemble with the tails. The DNA is packed efficiently within the heads. The whole process takes about 15 minutes.
[[File:Tevenphage.svg|thumb|right|300px|Diagram of a typical tailed bacteriophage structure]]

=== Release of virions ===
Phages may be released via cell lysis, by extrusion, or, in a few cases, by budding. Lysis, by tailed phages, is achieved by an enzyme called [[endolysin]], which attacks and breaks down the cell wall [[peptidoglycan]]. An altogether different phage type, the [[filamentous phage]], make the host cell continually secrete new virus particles. Released virions are described as free, and, unless defective, are capable of infecting a new bacterium. Budding is associated with certain ''[[Mycoplasma]]'' phages. In contrast to virion release, phages displaying a [[lysogenic]] cycle do not kill the host but, rather, become long-term residents as [[prophage]].

== Genome structure ==
Given the millions of different phages in the environment, phage genomes come in a variety of forms and sizes. RNA phage such as [[Bacteriophage MS2|MS2]] have the smallest genomes, of only a few kilobases. However, some DNA phage such as [[Enterobacteria phage T4|T4]] may have large genomes with hundreds of genes; the size and shape of the [[capsid]] varies along with the size of the genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Black|first1=LW|last2=Thomas|first2=JA|title=Condensed genome structure|date=2012|volume=726|pages=469–87|pmid=22297527|pmc=3559133|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-0980-9_21|series=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology|isbn=978-1-4614-0979-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacteriophage genomes can be highly [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]], i.e. the genome of many phage species appear to be composed of numerous individual modules. These modules may be found in other phage species in different arrangements. [[Mycobacteriophage]]s, bacteriophages with [[mycobacteria]]l hosts, have provided excellent examples of this mosaicism. In these mycobacteriophages, genetic assortment may be the result of repeated instances of [[site-specific recombination]] and [[illegitimate recombination]] (the result of phage genome acquisition of bacterial host genetic sequences).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18178732&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morris P, Marinelli LJ, Jacobs-Sera D, Hendrix RW, Hatfull GF |title=Genomic characterization of mycobacteriophage Giles: evidence for phage acquisition of host DNA by illegitimate recombination |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=190 |issue=6 |pages=2172–82 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18178732 |pmc=2258872 |doi=10.1128/JB.01657-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary mechanisms shaping the genomes of bacterial viruses vary between different families and depend upon the type of the nucleic acid, characteristics of the virion structure, as well as the mode of the viral life cycle.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid22126996&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krupovic M, Prangishvili D, Hendrix RW, Bamford DH |title=Genomics of bacterial and archaeal viruses: dynamics within the prokaryotic virosphere |journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews |volume=75 |issue=4 |pages=610–35 |date=December 2011 |pmid=22126996 |pmc=3232739 |doi=10.1128/MMBR.00011-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems biology ==
Phages often have dramatic effects on their hosts. As a consequence, the transcription pattern of the infected bacterium may change considerably. For instance, infection of ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' by the temperate phage PaP3 changed the expression of 38% (2160/5633) of its host's genes. Many of these effects are probably indirect, hence the challenge becomes to identify the direct interactions among bacteria and phage.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid26750429&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhao X, Chen C, Shen W, Huang G, Le S, Lu S, Li M, Zhao Y, Wang J, Rao X, Li G, Shen M, Guo K, Yang Y, Tan Y, Hu F |title=Global Transcriptomic Analysis of Interactions between ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' and Bacteriophage PaP3 |journal=Sci Rep |volume=6 |pages=19237 |year=2016 |pmid=26750429 |doi=10.1038/srep19237 |pmc=4707531|bibcode=2016NatSR...619237Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several attempts have been made to map [[protein–protein interaction]]s among phage and their host. For instance, bacteriophage lambda was found to interact with its host, [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]], by 31 interactions. However, a large-scale study revealed 62 interactions, most of which were new. Again, the significance of many of these interactions remains unclear, but these studies suggest that there most likely are several key interactions and many indirect interactions whose role remains uncharacterized.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid24049175&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blasche S, Wuchty S, Rajagopala SV, Uetz P |title=The protein interaction network of bacteriophage lambda with its host, Escherichia coli |journal=J.
