'''Bali''' is a [[Provinces of Indonesia|province of Indonesia]] and the westernmost of the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]]. Located east of [[Java]] and west of [[Lombok]], the province includes the island of Bali and a few smaller neighbouring islands, notably [[Nusa Penida]], [[Nusa Lembongan]], and [[Nusa Ceningan]]. The provincial capital, [[Denpasar]], is the [[List of Indonesian cities by population|most populous city]] in the Lesser Sunda Islands and the second largest, after [[Makassar]], in [[Eastern Indonesia]]. Bali is the only [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Hindu-majority province]] in Indonesia, with 83.5% of the population adhering to [[Balinese Hinduism]].&lt;ref name=census2010/&gt;

Bali is Indonesia's main tourist destination, with a significant rise in tourism since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y17MAgAAQBAJ|title=Bali: A Paradise Created|last=Vickers|first=Adrian|date=2013-08-13|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=9781462900084|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism-related business makes up 80% of its economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;tourism&quot;/&gt; It is renowned for its highly developed arts, including traditional and modern dance, sculpture, painting, leather, metalworking, and music. The Indonesian International Film Festival is held every year in Bali. Other international events held in Bali include the [[Miss World 2013]] and 2018 [[Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group]]. In March 2017, [[TripAdvisor]] named Bali as the world's top destination in its Traveller's Choice award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/travel/news/article.cfm?c_id=7&amp;objectid=11823142|title=Bali named as best destination in the world by TripAdvisor|work=Nzherald.co.nz|date=March 22, 2017|accessdate=April 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The confederation is the successor of the [[Bali Kingdom]]. The royal houses are not recognised by the government of Indonesia; however, they originated before [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3Gfir3Ju70C|title=The Dark Side of Paradise: Political Violence in Bali|last=Robinson|first=Geoffrey|date=1995|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0801481724|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of Bali}}

===Ancient===
Bali was inhabited around 2000 BCE by [[Austronesian people]] who migrated originally from Southeast Asia and [[Oceania]] through [[Maritime Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Taylor|Taylor]], pp. 5, 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hinzler/&gt; Culturally and linguistically, the Balinese are closely related to the people of the Indonesian archipelago, Malaysia, the Philippines and Oceania.&lt;ref name=Hinzler/&gt; Stone tools dating from this time have been found near the village of Cekik in the island's west.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Taylor|Taylor]], p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lonely/&gt;

In ancient Bali, nine Hindu sects existed, namely [[Pashupata Shaivism|Pasupata]], Bhairawa, Siwa Shidanta, Vaishnava, Bodha, [[Brahma]], Resi, Sora and [[Ganapatya]]. Each sect revered a specific deity as its personal Godhead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/04/28/the-birthplace-balinese-hinduism.html |title=The birthplace of Balinese Hinduism |work=The Jakarta Post |date=28 April 2011 |accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inscriptions from 896 and 911 do not mention a king, until 914, when Sri Kesarivarma is mentioned. They also reveal an independent Bali, with a distinct dialect, where [[Buddhism]] and [[Sivaism]] were practiced simultaneously. [[Mpu Sindok]]'s great-granddaughter, [[Mahendradatta]] (Gunapriyadharmapatni), married the Bali king [[Udayana Warmadewa]] (Dharmodayanavarmadeva) around 989, giving birth to [[Airlangga]] around 1001. This marriage also brought more [[Hinduism]] and Javanese culture to Bali. Princess Sakalendukirana appeared in 1098. Suradhipa reigned from 1115 to 1119, and Jayasakti from 1146 until 1150. Jayapangus appears on inscriptions between 1178 and 1181, while Adikuntiketana and his son Paramesvara in 1204.&lt;ref name=indianized&gt;{{Cite book

Balinese culture was strongly influenced by Indian, Chinese, and particularly [[Hindu]] culture, beginning around the 1st century AD. The name ''Bali dwipa'' (&quot;Bali island&quot;) has been discovered from various inscriptions, including the Blanjong pillar inscription written by [[Sri Kesari Warmadewa]] in 914 AD and mentioning '''Walidwipa'''. It was during this time that the people developed their complex irrigation system ''[[Subak (irrigation)|subak]]'' to grow rice in [[wet-field cultivation]]. Some religious and cultural traditions still practiced today can be traced to this period.

The Hindu [[Majapahit Empire]] (1293–1520 AD) on eastern [[Java (island)|Java]] founded a Balinese colony in 1343. The uncle of [[Hayam Wuruk]] is mentioned in the charters of 1384–86. A mass Javanese immigration to Bali occurred in the next century when the [[Majapahit Empire]] fell in 1520.&lt;ref name=indianized/&gt;{{rp|234,240}} Bali's government then became an independent collection of Hindu kingdoms which led to a Balinese national identity and major enhancements in culture, arts, and economy. The nation with various kingdoms became independent for up to 386 years until 1906, when the Dutch subjugated and repulsed the natives for economic control and took it over.&lt;ref&gt;Barski, p.46&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portuguese contacts===
The first known [[European ethnic groups|European]] contact with Bali is thought to have been made in 1512, when a Portuguese expedition led by Antonio Abreu and [[Francisco Serrão]] sighted its northern shores. It was the first expedition of a series of bi-annual fleets to the Moluccas, that throughout the 16th century usually traveled along the coasts of the Sunda Islands. Bali was also mapped in 1512, in the chart of Francisco Rodrigues, aboard the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

(2004) ''Bali Chronicles''. Periplus, Singapore, {{ISBN|0-7946-0272-X}}, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dutch East Indies===
[[File:1906 Puputan monument in Denpasar.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Puputan monument]]
In 1597, the Dutch explorer [[Cornelis de Houtman]] arrived at Bali, and the [[Dutch East India Company]] was established in 1602. The Dutch government expanded its control across the Indonesian archipelago during the second half of the 19th century (see [[Dutch East Indies]]). Dutch political and economic control over Bali began in the 1840s on the island's north coast, when the Dutch pitted various competing Balinese realms against each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctpqur&quot;/&gt; In the late 1890s, struggles between Balinese kingdoms in the island's south were exploited by the Dutch to increase their control.

In June 1860, the famous Welsh naturalist, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], travelled to Bali from Singapore, landing at Buleleng on the north coast of the island. Wallace's trip to Bali was instrumental in helping him devise his [[Wallace Line]] theory. The Wallace Line is a faunal boundary that runs through the strait between Bali and [[Lombok]]. It has been found to be a boundary between species. In his travel memoir ''[[The Malay Archipelago]],'' Wallace wrote of his experience in Bali, of which has strong mention of the [[Subak (irrigation)|unique Balinese irrigation methods]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was both astonished and delighted; for as my visit to Java was some years later, I had never beheld so beautiful and well-cultivated a district out of Europe. A slightly undulating plain extends from the seacoast about {{convert|10|or|12|mi|km|spell=in|abbr=off}} inland, where it is bounded by a fine range of wooded and cultivated hills. Houses and villages, marked out by dense clumps of [[coconut palms]], [[tamarind]] and other fruit trees, are dotted about in every direction; while between them extend luxurious rice-grounds, watered by an elaborate system of irrigation that would be the pride of the best cultivated parts of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=The Malay Archipelago|year=1869|isbn=9780794605636|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Dutch mounted large naval and ground [[Dutch intervention in Bali (1906)|assaults at the Sanur region]] in 1906 and were met by the thousands of members of the royal family and their followers who rather than yield to the superior Dutch force committed ritual suicide (''[[puputan]]'') to avoid the humiliation of surrender.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctpqur&quot; /&gt; Despite Dutch demands for surrender, an estimated 200 Balinese killed themselves rather than surrender.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Haer|Haer]], p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Dutch intervention in Bali (1908)|Dutch intervention in Bali]], a similar mass suicide occurred in the face of a Dutch assault in [[Klungkung]]. Afterward the Dutch governors exercised administrative control over the island, but local control over religion and culture generally remained intact. Dutch rule over Bali came later and was never as well established as in other parts of Indonesia such as Java and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]].

In the 1930s, anthropologists [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Gregory Bateson]], artists [[Miguel Covarrubias]] and [[Walter Spies]], and musicologist [[Colin McPhee]] all spent time here. Their accounts of the island and its peoples created a western image of Bali as &quot;an enchanted land of [[aesthetes]] at peace with themselves and nature&quot;. Western tourists began to visit the island.&lt;ref name=Friend&gt;Friend, Theodore. ''Indonesian Destinies'', Harvard University Press, 2003 {{ISBN|0-674-01137-6}}, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; The sensuous image of Bali was enhanced in the West by a quasi-pornographic 1932 documentary ''Virgins of Bali'' about a day in the lives of two teenage Balinese girls whom the film's narrator Deane Dickason notes in the first scene &quot;bathe their shamelessly nude bronze bodies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, Thomas ''Pre-Code Hollywood: Sex, Immorality, and Insurrection in American Cinema, 1930–1934'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1999 page 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the looser version of the [[Hays code]] that existed up to 1934, nudity involving &quot;civilised&quot; (i.e. white) women was banned, but permitted with &quot;uncivilised&quot; (i.e. all non-white women), a loophole that was exploited by the producers of ''Virgins of Bali''.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, Thomas ''Pre-Code Hollywood: Sex, Immorality, and Insurrection in American Cinema, 1930–1934'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1999 page 133.&lt;/ref&gt; The film, which mostly consisted of scenes of topless Balinese women was a great success in 1932, and almost single-handedly made Bali into a popular spot for tourists.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, Thomas ''Pre-Code Hollywood: Sex, Immorality, and Insurrection in American Cinema, 1930–1934'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1999 page 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Imperial Japan]] occupied Bali during World War II. It was not originally a target in their Netherlands East Indies Campaign, but as the airfields on [[Borneo]] were inoperative due to heavy rains, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] decided to occupy Bali, which did not suffer from comparable weather. The island had no regular [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] (KNIL) troops. There was only a Native Auxiliary Corps ''Prajoda'' (Korps Prajoda) consisting of about 600 native soldiers and several Dutch KNIL officers under the command of KNIL Lieutenant Colonel W.P. Roodenburg. On 19 February 1942 the Japanese forces landed near the town of Senoer [Senur]. The island was quickly captured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Klemen, L |url= http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/bali.html |title= The Capture of Bali Island, February 1942 |date=1999–2000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941–1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Japanese occupation, a Balinese military officer, [[I Gusti Ngurah Rai|Gusti Ngurah Rai]], formed a Balinese 'freedom army'. The harshness of Japanese occupation forces made them more resented than the Dutch colonial rulers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Haer|Haer]], pp.&amp;nbsp;39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence from the Dutch===
In  1945 Bali was liberated by the British and Indian [[5th Infantry Division (India)|5th infantry Division]] under the command of Major-General [[Robert Mansergh]] who took the Japanese surrender. Once the Japanese forces had been repatriated the island was handed over to the Dutch the following year.

In 1946, the Dutch constituted Bali as one of the 13 administrative districts of the newly proclaimed [[State of East Indonesia]], a rival state to the Republic of Indonesia, which was proclaimed and headed by [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Hatta|Hatta]]. Bali was included in the &quot;Republic of the United States of Indonesia&quot; when the Netherlands recognised Indonesian independence on 29 December 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andy Barski, Albert Beaucort  |author2=Bruce Carpenter, Barski|title=Bali and Lombok|year=2007|publisher=Dorling Kindersley, London|isbn=978-0-7566-2878-9|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first governor of Bali, [[Anak Agung Bagus Suteja]], was appointed by President Sukarno in 1958, when Bali became a province.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pringle|Pringle]], p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1963 eruption of [[Mount Agung]] killed thousands, created economic havoc and forced many displaced Balinese to be [[Transmigration program|transmigrated]] to other parts of Indonesia. Mirroring the widening of social divisions across Indonesia in the 1950s and early 1960s, Bali saw conflict between supporters of the traditional [[caste system]], and those rejecting this system. Politically, the opposition was represented by supporters of the [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI) and the [[Indonesian Nationalist Party]] (PNI), with tensions and ill-feeling further increased by the PKI's land reform programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctpqur&quot; /&gt; [[30 September Movement|An attempted coup]] in Jakarta was put down by forces led by General Suharto.

The army became the dominant power as it instigated [[Indonesian killings of 1965–66|a violent anti-communist purge]], in which the army blamed the PKI for the coup. Most estimates suggest that at least 500,000 people were killed across Indonesia, with an estimated 80,000 killed in Bali, equivalent to 5% of the island's population.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctpqur&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Friend/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ricklefs/&gt; With no Islamic forces involved as in Java and Sumatra, upper-caste PNI landlords led the extermination of PKI members.&lt;ref name=Ricklefs/&gt;

As a result of the 1965–66 upheavals, Suharto was able to manoeuvre Sukarno [[Transition to the New Order|out of the presidency]]. His [[New Order (Indonesia)|&quot;New Order&quot;]] government reestablished relations with western countries. The pre-War Bali as &quot;paradise&quot; was revived in a modern form. The resulting large growth in tourism has led to a dramatic increase in Balinese standards of living and significant foreign exchange earned for the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctpqur&quot; /&gt; [[2002 Bali bombings|A bombing in 2002]] by militant [[Islamist]]s in the tourist area of [[Kuta]] killed 202 people, mostly foreigners. This attack, and [[2005 Bali bombings|another in 2005]], severely reduced tourism, producing much economic hardship to the island.

[[File:A small island made of pillow lava near Bali in Indonesia.jpg|thumb|An islet just south of Bali made of [[pillow basalt]]. Much of Bali is made of volcanic rock.|upright]]
The island of Bali lies {{cvt|3.2|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Java (island)|Java]], and is approximately [[8th parallel south|8 degrees south]] of the [[equator]]. Bali and Java are separated by the Bali Strait. East to west, the island is approximately {{cvt|153|km|mi}} wide and spans approximately {{cvt|112|km|mi}} north to south; administratively it covers {{cvt|5,780|km2}}, or {{cvt|5,577|km2}} without [[Nusa Penida]] District;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kabupaten Klungkung, Data Agregat per Kecamatan|url=http://sp2010.bps.go.id/files/ebook/5105.pdf|date=2010|website=Sp2010.bps.go.id}}&lt;/ref&gt; its population density is roughly {{cvt|750|/km2|/mi2|disp=preunit|people}}.

Bali's central mountains include several peaks over {{convert|2,000|m|ft|abbr=off}} in elevation and active volcanoes such as [[Mount Batur]]. The highest is [[Mount Agung]] ({{convert|3,031|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=comma}}), known as the &quot;mother mountain&quot;, which is an active [[volcano]] rated as one of the world's most likely sites for a massive eruption within the next 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volcanocafe.org/romantic-paradise-destination-the-new-decade-volcano-program-6-bali/|title=Romantic Paradise Destination – The New Decade Volcano Program #6, Bali|date=10 July 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2017 [[Mount Agung#2017 seismic activity and eruption|Mount Agung started erupting]] and large numbers of people were evacuated, temporarily closing the island's airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-42132912|title=Mount Agung: Bali volcano alert raised to highest level|date=27 November 2017|accessdate=8 May 2018|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mountains range from centre to the eastern side, with Mount Agung the easternmost peak. Bali's volcanic nature has contributed to its exceptional fertility and its tall mountain ranges provide the high rainfall that supports the highly productive agriculture sector. South of the mountains is a broad, steadily descending area where most of Bali's large rice crop is grown. The northern side of the mountains slopes more steeply to the sea and is the main coffee-producing area of the island, along with rice, vegetables and cattle. The longest river, [[Ayung River]], flows approximately {{cvt|75|km|mi}} (see [[List of rivers of Bali]]).

The island is surrounded by [[coral reefs]]. Beaches in the south tend to have white sand while those in the north and west have [[black sand]]. Bali has no major waterways, although the Ho River is navigable by small ''[[sampan]]'' boats. Black sand beaches between Pasut and Klatingdukuh are being developed for tourism, but apart from the seaside temple of [[Tanah Lot]], they are not yet used for significant tourism.

[[File:Bali panorama.jpg|thumb|[[Subak (irrigation)|Subak]] irrigation system]]
The largest city is the provincial capital, [[Denpasar]], near the southern coast. Its population is around 491,500 (2002). Bali's second-largest city is the old colonial capital, [[Singaraja]], which is located on the north coast and is home to around 100,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/travel/beach/829926/Bali-holiday-travel-tips-beach|title=Picture perfect beaches, romantic sunsets and delicious Asian food: Discover Bali|last=Stafford|first=Stephanie|date=2017-07-22|work=Express.co.uk|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important cities include the beach resort, [[Kuta]], which is practically part of Denpasar's urban area, and [[Ubud]], situated at the north of Denpasar, is the island's cultural centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/apr/09/indonesia-holiday-guide-bali-lombok-java-flores|title=Indonesia beginners’ guide: Bali, Lombok, Java and Flores|last=Sutcliffe|first=Theodora|date=2016-04-09|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three small islands lie to the immediate south east and all are administratively part of the [[Klungkung]] regency of Bali: [[Nusa Penida]], [[Nusa Lembongan]] and [[Nusa Ceningan]]. These islands are separated from Bali by the Badung Strait.

To the east, the [[Lombok Strait]] separates Bali from [[Lombok]] and marks the [[Biogeography|biogeographical]] division between the fauna of the [[Indomalaya]]n [[ecozone]] and the distinctly different fauna of [[Australasia]]. The transition is known as the [[Wallace Line]], named after [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], who first proposed a transition zone between these two major [[biome]]s. When sea levels dropped during the [[quaternary glaciation|Pleistocene ice age]], Bali was connected to Java and [[Sumatra]] and to the mainland of Asia and shared the Asian fauna, but the deep water of the Lombok Strait continued to keep Lombok Island and the [[Lesser Sunda Islands|Lesser Sunda archipelago]] isolated.

==Climate==
Being just 8 degrees south of the equator, Bali has a fairly even climate all year round. Average year-round temperature stands at around {{convert|30|°C}} with a humidity level of about 85%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.neotravellers.com/exhaustive-guide-romantic-things-to-do-in-bali// |title=Climate of Bali |publisher=neotravellers.com |date= |accessdate=2017-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day time temperatures at low elevations vary between {{convert|20|to|33|°C|°F}}, but the temperatures decrease significantly with increasing elevation.

The west monsoon is in place from approximately October to April, and this can bring significant rain, particularly from December to March. During rainy season there are comparatively fewer tourists seen in Bali. During the Easter and Christmas holidays the weather is very unpredictable. Outside of the monsoon period, humidity is relatively low and any rain is unlikely in lowland areas.

There are around 280 species of birds, including the critically endangered [[Bali myna]], which is [[endemism|endemic]]. Others include [[barn swallow]], [[black-naped oriole]], [[black racket-tailed treepie]], [[crested serpent-eagle]], [[crested treeswift]], [[dollarbird]], [[Java sparrow]], [[lesser adjutant]], [[long-tailed shrike]], [[milky stork]], [[Pacific swallow]], [[red-rumped swallow]], [[sacred kingfisher]], [[Sea eagle (bird)|sea eagle]], [[woodswallow]], [[savanna nightjar]], [[stork-billed kingfisher]], [[yellow-vented bulbul]] and [[great egret]].

Until the early 20th century, Bali was home to several large mammals: the wild [[banteng]], [[leopard]] and the endemic [[Bali tiger]]. The banteng still occurs in its domestic form, whereas leopards are found only in neighbouring Java, and the Bali tiger is extinct. The last definite record of a tiger on Bali dates from 1937, when one was shot, though the subspecies may have survived until the 1940s or 1950s.&lt;ref name= &quot;P.tigris&quot;&gt;{{cite iucn |author= Jackson, P.|author2= Nowell, K.|title= ''Panthera tigris'' ssp.

[[File:Bali – Uluwatu Sunset Temple (2688001517).jpg|thumb|Monkeys in Uluwatu]]
[[Squirrel]]s are quite commonly encountered, less often is the [[Asian palm civet]], which is also kept in coffee farms to produce [[kopi luwak]]. [[Bat]]s are well represented, perhaps the most famous place to encounter them remaining is the Goa Lawah (Temple of the Bats) where they are worshipped by the locals and also constitute a tourist attraction. They also occur in other cave temples, for instance at Gangga Beach. Two species of [[Old World monkey|monkey]] occur. The [[crab-eating macaque]], known locally as &quot;kera&quot;, is quite common around human settlements and temples, where it becomes accustomed to being fed by humans, particularly in any of the three &quot;monkey forest&quot; temples, such as the popular one in the [[Ubud]] area. They are also quite often kept as pets by locals. The second monkey, endemic to Java and some surrounding islands such as Bali, is far rarer and more elusive and is the [[Javan langur]], locally known as &quot;lutung&quot;. They occur in few places apart from the [[Bali Barat National Park]]. They are born an orange colour, though by their first year they would have already changed to a more blackish colouration.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} In Java however, there is more of a tendency for this species to retain its juvenile orange colour into adulthood, and a mixture of black and orange monkeys can be seen together as a family. Other rarer mammals include the [[leopard cat]], [[Sunda pangolin]] and [[black giant squirrel]].

Snakes include the [[king cobra]] and [[reticulated python]]. The [[Asian water monitor|water monitor]] can grow to at least {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|50|kg|lb|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Water Monitor (Varanus salvator) |url=http://www.waza.org/en/zoo/choose-a-species/reptiles/lizards-and-tuatara/varanus-salvator |publisher=World Association of Zoos and Aquariums |accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can move quickly.

The rich coral reefs around the coast, particularly around popular diving spots such as [[Tulamben]], [[Amed (Bali)|Amed]], Menjangan or neighbouring [[Nusa Penida]], host a wide range of marine life, for instance [[hawksbill turtle]], [[Mola mola|giant sunfish]], [[Manta ray|giant manta ray]], [[Giant moray|giant moray eel]], [[bumphead parrotfish]], [[hammerhead shark]], [[Grey reef shark|reef shark]], [[barracuda]], and [[sea snake]]s.

A team of scientists conducted a survey from 29 April 2011 to 11 May 2011 at 33 sea sites around Bali. They discovered 952 species of reef fish of which 8 were new discoveries at Pemuteran, Gilimanuk, [[Nusa Dua]], [[Tulamben]] and [[Candidasa]], and 393 coral species, including two new ones at [[Padangbai]] and between Padangbai and [[Amed (Bali)|Amed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/05/13/new-fish-coral-species-found.html |title=New fish, coral species found |work=The Jakarta Post |date=13 May 2011 |accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average coverage level of healthy coral was 36% (better than in [[Raja Ampat]] and [[Halmahera]] by 29% or in [[Fakfak]] and [[Kaimana]] by 25%) with the highest coverage found in Gili Selang and Gili Mimpang in [[Candidasa]], [[Karangasem Regency|Karangasem regency]].&lt;ref&gt;Nurhayati, Desy (16 May 2011) [http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/05/16/coral-reefs’-health-‘improves’.html Coral reefs' health 'improves'].

Among the larger trees the most common are: [[banyan]] trees, [[jackfruit]], [[coconut]]s, [[bamboo]] species, [[acacia]] trees and also endless rows of coconuts and banana species. Numerous flowers can be seen: [[hibiscus]], [[frangipani]], [[bougainvillea]], [[poinsettia]], [[oleander]], [[jasmine]], [[Nymphaeaceae|water lily]], [[Nelumbo|lotus]], [[rose]]s, [[begonia]]s, orchids and [[hydrangea]]s exist. On higher grounds that receive more moisture, for instance around [[Kintamani, Bali|Kintamani]], certain species of [[fern]] trees, [[mushroom]]s and even [[pine]] trees thrive well. Rice comes in many varieties. Other plants with agricultural value include: [[salak]], [[mangosteen]], [[Maize|corn]], kintamani orange, coffee and [[water spinach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.balitours.co.id/bali-island-ecology#ad-image-0|title=Bali Ecology – Ecology in Bali|website=www.balitours.co.id|access-date=2019-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Some of the worst erosion has occurred in Lebih Beach, where up to {{convert|7|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} of land is lost every year. Decades ago, this beach was used for holy pilgrimages with more than 10,000 people, but they have now moved to [[Masceti Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/05/05/once-was-a-beach.html |title=Once was a beach |work=The Jakarta Post |date=5 May 2011 |accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From ranked third in previous review, in 2010 Bali got score 99.65 of Indonesia's environmental quality index and the highest of all the 33 provinces. The score measured three water quality parameters: the level of [[total suspended solids]] (TSS), [[dissolved oxygen]] (DO) and [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD).&lt;ref&gt;Simamora, Adianto P. (15 June 2011) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120118114434/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/06/15/bali-named-ri%E2%80%99s-cleanest-province.html Bali named RI's cleanest province]. ''The Jakarta Post''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of over-exploitation by the tourist industry which covers a massive land area, 200 out of 400 rivers on the island have dried up and based on research, the southern part of Bali would face a water shortage up to 2,500 litres of clean water per second by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/09/02/bali-must-stop-over-exploiting-environment-tourism-activists.html |title=Bali must stop over- exploiting environment for tourism: Activists |date=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To ease the shortage, the central government plans to build a water catchment and processing facility at Petanu River in Gianyar. The 300 litres capacity of water per second will be channelled to Denpasar, Badung and Gianyar in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/09/17/govt-build-water-catchment-petanu-river.html |title=Govt to build water catchment at Petanu River |date=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plastic pollution===

Last year Bali received nearly 5.7 million tourists, according to the regional government. In late 2017 officials declared a “garbage emergency” in response to the covering of 3.6 mile stretch of coastline in plastic waste brought in by the tide, amid concerns that the pollution could dissuade visitors from returning.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph plastic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/03/06/british-diver-exposes-sea-plastic-rubbish-bali-coast/ |title=British diver exposes sea of plastic rubbish off Bali coast |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=6 March 2018 |accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indonesia is one of the world's worst plastic polluters, with some estimates suggesting that the 260 million-population, 3,000-mile-wide, 17,000-island archipelago is the source of around 10 per cent of the world's plastic waste. Indonesia's capital city Jakarta features several huge rubbish dumps and it is common to see swaths of plastics bobbing on the city's few waterways.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph plastic&quot;/&gt;

==Administrative divisions==

==Economy==
In 1970s, the Balinese economy was largely agriculture-based in terms of both output and employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lfPJAwAAQBAJ|title=The Territories of Indonesia|last=Brown|first=Iem|date=2004-06-17|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781135355418|location=|pages=149|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism is now the largest single industry in terms of income, and as a result, Bali is one of Indonesia's wealthiest regions. In 2003, around 80% of Bali's economy was tourism related.&lt;ref name=&quot;tourism&quot;&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,393799,00.html Desperately Seeking Survival] ''Time''. 25 November 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; By end of June 2011, [[non-performing loan]] of all banks in Bali were 2.23%, lower than the average of Indonesian banking industry non-performing loan (about 5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/07/25/only-223-percent-loans-bali-are-bad.html |title=Only 2.23 percent of loans in Bali are bad |work=The Jakarta Post |date=25 July 2011 |accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economy, however, suffered significantly as a result of the [[Islamists]]' terrorist bombings in [[2002 Bali bombing|2002]] and [[2005 Bali bombing|2005]]. The tourism industry has since recovered from these events.

[[File:Wood carving in Bali.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|Wood carving in Bali]]
Although tourism produces the GDP's largest output, agriculture is still the island's biggest employer.&lt;ref&gt;On history of rice-growing related to museology and the rice terraces as part of Bali's cultural heritage see: Marc-Antonio Barblan, &quot;D'Orient en Occident: histoire de la riziculture et muséologie&quot; in ''ICOFOM Study Series'', Vol.35 (2006), pp.114–131. [https://archive.is/20120805230658/http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~iims/icofom/press.htm LRZ-Muenchen.de] and &quot;Dans la lumière des terrasses: paysage culturel balinais, ''Subek Museum''et patrimoine mondial (1er volet) &quot;in ''Le Banian'' (Paris), juin 2009, pp.80–101, [http://pasarmalam.free.fr/ Pasarmalam.free.fr]&lt;/ref&gt; Fishing also provides a significant number of jobs. Bali is also famous for its [[artisan]]s who produce a vast array of handicrafts, including [[batik]] and [[ikat]] [[Bali Nusra Tangi|cloth and clothing]], [[Woodworking|wooden carvings]], stone carvings, painted art and silverware. Notably, individual villages typically adopt a single product, such as wind chimes or wooden furniture.

The Arabica coffee production region is the highland region of Kintamani near [[Mount Batur]]. Generally, Balinese coffee is processed using the wet method. This results in a sweet, soft coffee with good consistency. Typical flavours include lemon and other citrus notes.&lt;ref name=&quot;SCAI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sca-indo.org/diverse-coffees-indonesia/ |title=Diverse coffees of Indonesia |work=Specialty Coffee Association of Indonesia |accessdate=8 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802030333/http://www.sca-indo.org/diverse-coffees-indonesia/ |archivedate=2 August 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many coffee farmers in Kintamani are members of a traditional farming system called [[Subak (irrigation)|Subak Abian]], which is based on the [[Hindu]] philosophy of &quot;[[Tri Hita Karana]]&quot;. According to this philosophy, the three causes of happiness are good relations with God, other people, and the environment. The Subak Abian system is ideally suited to the production of [[fair trade coffee|fair trade]] and [[organic coffee]] production. Arabica coffee from Kintamani is the first product in Indonesia to request a [[geographical indication]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BaliKintamani&quot;&gt;&quot;Book of Requirements for Kopi Kintamani Bali&quot;, page 12, July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963 the Bali Beach Hotel in [[Sanur, Bali|Sanur]] was built by [[Sukarno]], and boosted tourism in Bali. Before the construction of the Bali Beach Hotel, there were only three significant tourist-class hotels on the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vickers89&quot;&gt;Adrian Vickers: Bali. A Paradise Created, Periplus 1989, p. 252, {{ISBN|0-945971-28-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of hotels and restaurants began to spread throughout Bali. Tourism further increased on Bali after the [[Ngurah Rai International Airport]] opened in 1970. The Buleleng regency government encouraged the tourism sector as one of the mainstays for economic progress and social welfare.

The [[tourism industry]] is primarily focused in the south, while also significant in the other parts of the island. The main tourist locations are the town of [[Kuta]] (with its beach), and its outer suburbs of Legian and [[Seminyak]] (which were once independent townships), the east coast town of [[Sanur (Bali)|Sanur]] (once the only tourist hub), [[Ubud]] towards the centre of the island, to the south of the [[Ngurah Rai International Airport]], [[Jimbaran]] and the newer developments of [[Nusa Dua]] and [[Pecatu]].

The United States government lifted its travel warnings in 2008. The Australian government issued an advisory on Friday, 4 May 2012, with the overall level of this advisory lowered to 'Exercise a high degree of caution'. The Swedish government issued a new warning on Sunday, 10 June 2012 because of one tourist who died from methanol poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.makemyholidaytrips.com/|title=Make My Holiday Trips|last=|first=|date=30 June 2012|website=|publisher=thelocal.se|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://www.makemyholidaytrips.com/2018/01/best-of-bali-luxury-tour-packages-for.html|archivedate=2 November 2019|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia last issued an advisory on Monday, 5 January 2015 due to new terrorist threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.smartraveller.gov.au/siteassets/indonesia/index.htm |publisher=Australian Government |title=Smart Traveller |date=15 January 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115201907/http://www2.smartraveller.gov.au/siteassets/indonesia/index.htm |archivedate=15 January 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bali – Kuta (2692344570).jpg|thumb|[[Kuta Beach]] is a popular tourist spot in Bali.]]
An offshoot of tourism is the growing real estate industry. Bali's real estate has been rapidly developing in the main tourist areas of Kuta, Legian, Seminyak and Oberoi. Most recently, high-end 5-star projects are under development on the Bukit peninsula, on the south side of the island. Expensive villas are being developed along the cliff sides of south Bali, with commanding panoramic ocean views. Foreign and domestic, many Jakarta individuals and companies are fairly active, investment into other areas of the island also continues to grow. Land prices, despite the worldwide economic crisis, have remained stable.

In the last half of 2008, Indonesia's currency had dropped approximately 30% against the US dollar, providing many overseas visitors improved value for their currencies.

Bali's tourism economy survived the [[Islamists]] terrorist bombings of 2002 and 2005, and the tourism industry has slowly recovered and surpassed its pre-terrorist bombing levels; the longterm trend has been a steady increase of visitor arrivals. In 2010, Bali received 2.57 million foreign tourists, which surpassed the target of 2.0–2.3 million tourists. The average occupancy of starred hotels achieved 65%, so the island still should be able to accommodate tourists for some years without any addition of new rooms/hotels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebalitimes.com/2011/02/17/up-to-2-8m-foreign-tourists-this-year/ |title=Up to 2.8m Foreign Tourists This Year |publisher=Thebalitimes.com |date=17 February 2011 |accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although at the peak season some of them are fully booked.

Bali received the Best Island award from [[Travel and Leisure]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amarigepanache.com/2010/10/16/travel-all-we-want-for-christmas-a-spa-voucher/ |title=The Best Search Links on the Net |publisher=amarigepanache.com |date=16 October 2010 |accessdate=30 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426061733/http://amarigepanache.com/2010/10/16/travel-all-we-want-for-christmas-a-spa-voucher/ |archivedate=26 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bali won because of its attractive surroundings (both mountain and coastal areas), diverse tourist attractions, excellent international and local restaurants, and the friendliness of the local people. The Balinese culture and its religion are also considered as the main factor of the award. One of the most prestigious events that symbolizes a strong relationship between a god and its followers is Kecak Dance. According to BBC Travel released in 2011, Bali is one of the World's Best Islands, ranking second after [[Santorini]], Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beatmag.com/daily/latest-news/bali-named-as-one-of-the-five-best-islands-in-the-world.html |title=Bali Named as One of the Five Best Islands in the World |work=The Beat Magazine (Jakarta) |date=1 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204030756/http://beatmag.com/daily/latest-news/bali-named-as-one-of-the-five-best-islands-in-the-world.html |archivedate=4 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, the film ''[[Eat Pray Love]]'' was released. The film was based on [[Elizabeth Gilbert]]'s best-selling memoir ''[[Eat, Pray, Love]]''. It took place at Ubud and Padang-Padang Beach at Bali. The 2006 book, which spent 57 weeks at the No. 1 spot on the ''New York Times'' paperback nonfiction best-seller list, had already fuelled a boom in ''Eat, Pray, Love''-related tourism in Ubud, the hill town and cultural and tourist centre that was the focus of Gilbert's quest for balance through traditional spirituality and healing that leads to love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/LH18Ae01.html |title=Southeast Asia news and business from Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam |work=Asia Times |date=18 August 2010 |accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, after musician [[David Bowie]] died, it was revealed that in his [[will and testament|will]], Bowie asked for his ashes to be scattered in Bali, conforming to [[Buddhist]] rituals. He had visited and performed in a number of [[Southeast Asian]] cities early in his career, including [[Bangkok]] and [[Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/ashes-to-ashes-david-bowie-rests-in-bali-as-details-of-will-revealed-20160130-gmhm9y.html David Bowie rests in Bali], date:Jan 31, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011, China has displaced Japan as the second-largest supplier of tourists to Bali, while Australia still tops the list while India has also emerged as a greater supply of tourists. 
Chinese tourists increased by 17% from last year due to the impact of [[ASEAN–China Free Trade Area|ACFTA]] and new direct flights to Bali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/01/06/china-now-2nd-largest-source-isle-tourists.html |title=China now 2nd-largest source of isle tourists|work=The Jakarta Post |date=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ngurah Rai Airport|Ngurah Rai International Airport]] is located near Jimbaran, on the [[isthmus]] at the southernmost part of the island. [[Lt. Col. Wisnu Airfield]] is on the north-west Bali.

A coastal road circles the island, and three major two-lane arteries cross the central mountains at passes reaching to 1,750 m in height (at Penelokan). The Ngurah Rai Bypass is a four-lane expressway that partly encircles Denpasar. Bali has no railway lines.

On 21 December 2011 construction started on the Nusa Dua-Benoa-[[Ngurah Rai International Airport]] toll road which will also provide a special lane for motorcycles. This has been done by seven state-owned enterprises led by PT Jasa Marga with 60% of shares. PT Jasa Marga Bali Tol will construct the {{convert|9.91|km|mi|2|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} toll road (totally {{convert|12.7|km|mi|2|abbr=off}} with access road). The construction is estimated to cost Rp.2.49 trillion ($273.9 million). The project goes through {{convert|2|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} of mangrove forest and through {{convert|2.3|km|mi|1|abbr=off}} of beach, both within {{convert|5.4|ha|abbr=off}} area. The elevated toll road is built over the mangrove forest on 18,000 concrete pillars which occupied 2 hectares of mangroves forest. This was compensated by the planting of 300,000 mangrove trees along the road.

==Demographics==
The population of Bali was 3,890,757 as of the 2010 Census, and 4,148,588 at the 2015 Intermediate Census; the latest estimate (for mid 2019) is 4,362,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;BPS2019&quot; /&gt; There are an estimated 30,000 [[expatriate]]s living in Bali.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/30/barack-obama-absentee-voting-bali Ballots in paradise].

===Ethnic origins===

A DNA study in 2005 by Karafet et al.&lt;ref&gt;Karafet, Tatiana M.; Lansing, J S.; Redd, Alan J.; and Reznikova, Svetlana (2005) &quot;Balinese Y-Chromosome Perspective on the Peopling of Indonesia: Genetic Contributions from Pre-Neolithic Hunter- Gatherers, Austronesian Farmers, and Indian Traders,&quot; Human Biology: Vol. 77: Iss. 1, Article 8. Available at: http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/humbiol/vol77/iss1/8&lt;/ref&gt; found that 12% of Balinese [[Y-chromosome]]s are of likely Indian origin, while 84% are of likely [[Austronesian]] origin, and 2% of likely [[Melanesian]] origin.

===Caste system===
{{main|Balinese caste system}}
Pre-modern Bali had four castes, as Jeff Lewis and Belinda Lewis state, but with a &quot;very strong tradition of communal decision-making and interdependence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeff Lewis|author2=Belinda Lewis|title=Bali's silent crisis: desire, tragedy, and transition|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yuNMcfJHeyUC |year= 2009|publisher= Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-3243-2|pages=56, 83–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four castes have been classified as Soedra ([[Shudra]]), Wesia ([[Vaishya]]s), [[Balinese Kshatriya|Satrias]] ([[Kshatriya]]s) and Brahmana ([[Brahmin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Geoffrey Robinson|title= The Dark Side of Paradise: Political Violence in Bali|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=m3Gfir3Ju70C |year=1995| publisher= Cornell University Press|isbn= 0-8014-8172-4|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th-century scholars such as Crawfurd and Friederich suggested that the Balinese caste system had Indian origins, but Helen Creese states that scholars such as Brumund who had visited and stayed on the island of Bali suggested that his field observations conflicted with the &quot;received understandings concerning its Indian origins&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Creese2016p305&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Helen M.

Unlike most of Muslim-majority Indonesia, about 83.5% of Bali's population adheres to [[Balinese Hinduism]], formed as a combination of existing [[Balinese mythology|local beliefs]] and [[Hindu]] influences from mainland Southeast Asia and South Asia. Minority religions include Islam (13.37%), Christianity (2.47%), and [[Buddhism]] (0.5%).&lt;ref name=&quot;BPS̠Religion̠2010&quot;/&gt;

The general beliefs and practices of ''Agama Hindu Dharma'' mix ancient traditions and contemporary pressures placed by Indonesian laws that permit only monotheist belief under the national ideology of [[Pancasila (politics)|''panca sila'']].&lt;ref name=junemcdaniel&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDaniel|first=June|title=Agama Hindu Dharma Indonesia as a New Religious Movement:  Hinduism Recreated in the Image of Islam| journal= Nova Religio|year= 2010|volume= 14|issue= 1|pages= 93–111|doi=10.1525/nr.2010.14.1.93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=syamashita&gt;Shinji Yamashita (2002), Bali and Beyond: Explorations in the Anthropology of Tourism, Berghahn, {{ISBN|978-1571813275}}, pp. 57-65&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, Hinduism in Indonesia had a pantheon of deities and that tradition of belief continues in practice; further, Hinduism in Indonesia granted freedom and flexibility to Hindus as to when, how and where to pray.&lt;ref name=syamashita/&gt; However, officially, Indonesian government considers and advertises Indonesian Hinduism as a monotheistic religion with certain officially recognised beliefs that comply with its national ideology.&lt;ref name=junemcdaniel/&gt;&lt;ref name=syamashita/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Picard (2003), in Hinduism in Modern Indonesia (Editor: Martin Ramstedt), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700715336}}, pp. 56–72&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesian school text books describe Hinduism as having one supreme being, Hindus offering three daily mandatory prayers, and Hinduism as having certain common beliefs that in part parallel those of Islam.&lt;ref name=syamashita/&gt;&lt;ref name=jmcdaniel2013&gt;June McDaniel (2013), A Modern Hindu Monotheism: Indonesian Hindus as ‘People of the Book’, Journal of Hindu Studies, Oxford University Press, Volume 6, Issue 1, {{doi|10.1093/jhs/hit030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars&lt;ref name=syamashita/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Forge (1980), Balinese Religion and Indonesian Identity, in Indonesia: The Making of a Culture (Editor: James Fox), Australian National University, {{ISBN|978-0909596590}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Putu Setia (1992), Cendekiawan Hindu Bicara, Denpasar: Yayasan Dharma Naradha, {{ISBN|978-9798357008}}, pp. 217–229&lt;/ref&gt; contest whether these Indonesian government recognised and assigned beliefs reflect the traditional beliefs and practices of Hindus in Indonesia before Indonesia gained independence from Dutch colonial rule.

Balinese Hinduism has roots in Indian Hinduism and Buddhism, that arrived through [[Java]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Becker | first=J. | title=The Study of Time IV | chapter=Hindu-Buddhist Time in Javanese Gamelan Music | publisher=Springer | year=1981 | isbn=978-1-4612-5949-7 | doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-5947-3_13 | pages=161–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu influences reached the [[List of islands of Indonesia|Indonesian Archipelago]] as early as the first century.&lt;ref name=jgonda&gt;[[Jan Gonda]], The Indian Religions in Pre-Islamic Indonesia and their survival in Bali, in {{Google books|X7YfAAAAIAAJ|Handbook of Oriental Studies. Section 3 Southeast Asia, Religions|page=1}}, pp. 1–54&lt;/ref&gt; Historical evidence is unclear about the diffusion process of cultural and spiritual ideas from India. Java legends refer to Saka-era, traced to [[78 AD]]. Stories from the [[Mahabharata]] Epic have been traced in Indonesian islands to the 1st century; however, the versions mirror those found in southeast Indian peninsular region (now [[Tamil Nadu]] and southern [[Karnataka]] [[Andhra Pradesh]]).&lt;ref name=jgonda/&gt;

The Bali tradition adopted the pre-existing animistic traditions of the indigenous people. This influence strengthened the belief that the gods and goddesses are present in all things. Every element of nature, therefore, possesses its own power, which reflects the power of the gods. A rock, tree, dagger, or woven cloth is a potential home for spirits whose energy can be directed for good or evil. Balinese Hinduism is deeply interwoven with art and ritual. Ritualising states of self-control are a notable feature of religious expression among the people, who for this reason have become famous for their graceful and decorous behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Slattum, J. (2003) ''Balinese Masks: Spirits of an Ancient Drama. Indonesia, Asia Pacific, Japan, North America, Latin America and Europe'' Periplus Editions (H) Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the majority of Balinese Hindus, there also exist [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]] immigrants whose traditions have melded with that of the locals. As a result, these Sino-Balinese not only embrace their original religion, which is a mixture of Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism and Confucianism, but also find a way to harmonise it with the local traditions. Hence, it is not uncommon to find local Sino-Balinese during the local temple's ''[[odalan]]''. Moreover, Balinese Hindu priests are invited to perform rites alongside a Chinese priest in the event of the death of a Sino-Balinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/04/short-post.html |title=Short Post |publisher=Voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com |date=24 April 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708072104/http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/04/short-post.html |archivedate=8 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Sino-Balinese claim to embrace Buddhism for administrative purposes, such as their Identity Cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/05/hectic-yet-void-week.html |title=Hectic, yet void, week |publisher=Voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com |date=7 May 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708072220/http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/05/hectic-yet-void-week.html |archivedate=8 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
[[Balinese language|Balinese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] are the most widely spoken languages in Bali, and the vast majority of [[Balinese people]] are [[bilingual]] or [[trilingual]]. The most common spoken language around the tourist areas is Indonesian, as many people in the tourist sector are not solely Balinese, but migrants from [[Java]], [[Lombok]], [[Sumatra]], and other parts of Indonesia. There are several indigenous Balinese languages, but most Balinese can also use the most widely spoken option: modern common Balinese. The usage of different Balinese languages was traditionally determined by the [[Balinese caste system]] and by clan membership, but this tradition is diminishing. [[Kawi language|Kawi]] and [[Sanskrit]] are also commonly used by some Hindu priests in Bali, as Hindu literature was mostly written in Sanskrit.

[[English language|English]] and Chinese are the next most common languages (and the primary foreign languages) of many Balinese, owing to the requirements of the [[tourism industry]], as well as the English-speaking community and huge Chinese-Indonesian population. Other foreign languages, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]] or [[German language|German]] are often used in multilingual signs for foreign tourists.

[[File:Bali-Danse 0729a.jpg|thumb|upright|Dancer, Bali, c. 2007]]
Bali is renowned for its diverse and sophisticated art forms, such as painting, sculpture, woodcarving, handcrafts, and performing arts. [[Balinese cuisine]] is also distinctive. Balinese percussion orchestra music, known as ''[[gamelan]]'', is highly developed and varied. Balinese performing arts often portray stories from Hindu epics such as the [[Ramayana]] but with heavy Balinese influence. Famous [[Balinese dance]]s include ''[[pendet]]'', ''[[legong]]'', ''[[baris (dance)|baris]]'', ''[[topeng]]'', ''[[barong (mythology)|barong]]'', ''[[Gamelan gong kebyar|gong keybar]]'', and ''[[kecak]]'' (the monkey dance). Bali boasts one of the most diverse and innovative performing arts cultures in the world, with paid performances at thousands of temple festivals, private ceremonies, or public shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Masked Performance: The Play of Self and Other in Ritual and Theatre|last=Emigh|first=John|authorlink=John Emigh|year=1996|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1336-X}} The author is a Western theatre professor who has become a performer in Balinese [[topeng]] theater himself.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Festivals===
[[File:Sanur Beach.JPG|thumb|A scene in Bali on ''Nyepi'', the Hindu festival of silence. Everything is deserted, human footprint minimised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Lyon|author2=Paul Greenway|author3=Tony Wheeler|title=Bali and Lombok|year=2001|isbn=978-1-86450-252-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/lonelyplanetbali00jame/page/109 109]|url=https://archive.org/details/lonelyplanetbali00jame/page/109}}; Quote: &quot;Nyepi - The Day of Silence The major festival for the Hindu Balinese is Nyepi, usually held around the end of March or early April.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Throughout the year, there are a number of festivals celebrated locally or island-wide according to the traditional calendars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FaTTAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT25|title= Rough Guide to Bali &amp; Lombok|isbn=978-1405381352|publisher=[[Rough Guides]]|year=2011|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hindu New Year, ''[[Nyepi]]'', is celebrated in the spring by a day of silence. On this day everyone stays at home and tourists are encouraged (or required) to remain in their hotels. On the day before New Year, large and colourful sculptures of ''ogoh-ogoh'' monsters are paraded and finally burned in the evening to drive away evil spirits. Other festivals throughout the year are specified by the Balinese ''[[pawukon]]'' [[calendar|calendrical]] system.

Celebrations are held for many occasions such as a tooth-filing (coming-of-age ritual), [[Ngaben|cremation]] or ''odalan'' (temple festival). One of the most important concepts that Balinese ceremonies have in common is that of ''désa kala patra'', which refers to how ritual performances must be appropriate in both the specific and general social context.&lt;ref name=Herbst/&gt; Many of the ceremonial art forms such as ''[[wayang|wayang kulit]]'' and ''[[topeng]]'' are highly improvisatory, providing flexibility for the performer to adapt the performance to the current situation.&lt;ref name=Foley/&gt; Many celebrations call for a loud, boisterous atmosphere with lots of activity and the resulting aesthetic, ''ramé'', is distinctively Balinese. Often two or more ''[[Music of Bali|gamelan]]'' ensembles will be performing well within earshot, and sometimes compete with each other to be heard. Likewise, the audience members talk amongst themselves, get up and walk around, or even cheer on the performance, which adds to the many layers of activity and the liveliness typical of ''ramé''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ubud Cremation 4.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ngaben|Cremation]] in [[Ubud]]]]
''Kaja'' and ''kelod'' are the Balinese equivalents of North and South, which refer to ones orientation between the island's largest mountain Gunung Agung (''kaja''), and the sea (''kelod''). In addition to spatial orientation, ''kaja'' and ''kelod'' have the connotation of good and evil; gods and ancestors are believed to live on the mountain whereas demons live in the sea. Buildings such as temples and residential homes are spatially oriented by having the most sacred spaces closest to the mountain and the unclean places nearest to the sea.&lt;ref name=Herbst/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most temples have an inner courtyard and an outer courtyard which are arranged with the inner courtyard furthest ''kaja''. These spaces serve as performance venues since most Balinese rituals are accompanied by any combination of music, dance and drama. The performances that take place in the inner courtyard are classified as ''wali'', the most sacred rituals which are offerings exclusively for the gods, while the outer courtyard is where ''bebali'' ceremonies are held, which are intended for gods and people. Lastly, performances meant solely for the entertainment of humans take place outside the walls of the temple and are called ''bali-balihan''. This three-tiered system of classification was standardised in 1971 by a committee of Balinese officials and artists to better protect the sanctity of the oldest and most sacred Balinese rituals from being performed for a paying audience.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gold|Gold]], pp.&amp;nbsp;18–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A collage of scenes from Barong dance of Bali Indonesia.jpg|thumb|left|Barong dance]]
Tourism, Bali's chief industry, has provided the island with a foreign audience that is eager to pay for entertainment, thus creating new performance opportunities and more demand for performers. The impact of [[tourism in indonesia|tourism]] is controversial since before it became integrated into the economy, the Balinese performing arts did not exist as a capitalist venture, and were not performed for entertainment outside of their respective ritual context. Since the 1930s sacred rituals such as the ''[[barong (mythology)|barong]]'' [[Balinese dance|dance]] have been performed both in their original contexts, as well as exclusively for paying tourists. This has led to new versions of many of these performances which have developed according to the preferences of foreign audiences; some villages have a ''barong'' mask specifically for non-ritual performances as well as an older mask which is only used for sacred performances.&lt;ref name=Sanger/&gt;

Balinese society continues to revolve around each family's ancestral village, to which the cycle of life and religion is closely tied.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Belford|first=Aubrey|title=Customary Law Revival Neglects Some Balinese|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/world/asia/13iht-bali.html|accessdate=12 October 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130207064353/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/world/asia/13iht-bali.html| archivedate=7 February 2013&lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coercive aspects of traditional society, such as [[customary law]] sanctions imposed by traditional authorities such as village councils (including &quot;[[kasepekang]]&quot;, or [[shunning]]) have risen in importance as a consequence of the democratisation and decentralisation of Indonesia since 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot; /&gt;

Other than Balinese sacred rituals and festivals, the government presents [[Bali Arts Festival]] to showcase Bali's performing arts and various artworks produced by the local talents that they have. It is held once a year, from second week of June until end of July. Southeast Asia's biggest annual festival of words and ideas [[Ubud Writers and Readers Festival]] is held at [[Ubud]] in October, which is participated by the world's most celebrated writers, artists, thinkers and performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://asiancorrespondent.com/2018/10/ubud-writers-readers-festival-2018-what-to-expect/ |title=What to expect at Southeast Asia’s biggest festival of words and ideas|newspaper=Asian Correspondent|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bali was the host of [[Miss World 2013]] (63rd edition of the Miss World pageant). It was the first time Indonesia hosted an international beauty pageant.

In [[association football|football]], Bali is home to [[Bali United]] football club, which plays in [[Liga 1 (Indonesia)|Liga 1]].
The team was relocated from [[Samarinda]], [[East Kalimantan]] to [[Gianyar]], Bali. Harbiansyah Hanafiah, the main commissioner of Bali United explained that he changed the name and moved the homebase because there was no representative from Bali in the highest football tier in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribunnews.com/superball/2014/12/17/putra-samarinda-berubah-jadi-bali-united-pusam|title=Putra Samarinda Berubah Jadi Bali United Pusam|accessdate= 14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason was due to local fans in Samarinda preferring to support [[Pusamania Borneo F.C.]] rather than Persisam.
