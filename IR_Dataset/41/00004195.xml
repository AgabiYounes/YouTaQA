(September 13, 2001). [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/13/us/barbara-olson-45-advocate-and-conservative-commentator.html?ref=barbaraolson &quot;Barbara Olson, 45, Advocate And Conservative Commentator&quot;]. ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; She was a passenger on [[American Airlines Flight 77]] en route to a taping of [[Bill Maher]]'s television show ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' when it was flown into [[the Pentagon]] in the [[September 11 attacks]].  Her original plan had been to fly to [[California]] on September 10, but she delayed her departure until the next morning so that she could wake up with her husband on his birthday, September 11.&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_2HsqxuUH4&amp;t=1m46s|title=What Barbara Olson Knew|last=composerguy|date=7 April 2008|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Olson was born Barbara Kay Bracher in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], on December 27, 1955. Her older sister, Toni Bracher-Lawrence, was a member of the Houston City Council from 2004 to 2010. She graduated from [[Waltrip High School]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://hs.houstonisd.org/WaltripHS/TriviaFolder/trivia.htm Waltrip Trivia Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831194046/http://hs.houstonisd.org/WaltripHS/TriviaFolder/trivia.htm |date=2012-08-31 }},&quot; ''[[Waltrip High School]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from the [[University of St. Thomas (Houston)|University of Saint Thomas]] in Houston. She earned a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from the [[Yeshiva University]] [[Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law]].

==Career==
As a newcomer, she achieved a surprising measure of success, working for [[HBO]] and Stacy Keach Productions.{{When|date=May 2012}} In the early 1990s, she worked as an associate at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm of [[Wilmer Cutler &amp; Pickering]] where she did civil litigation for several years before becoming an [[Assistant U.S. Attorney]].

Olson's support in 1991 of Supreme Court nominee [[Clarence Thomas]] led to the formation of the [[Independent Women's Forum]]. At that time, Olson and friend [[Rosalie (Ricky) Gaull Silberman]] started an informal network of women who supported the Thomas nomination to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual harassment by [[Anita Hill]], a former subordinate of Thomas at the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]. Olson, who had also worked under Thomas at the EEOC and was a close friend of Thomas, spoke out on his behalf during his contentious Senate confirmation hearings. Olson later helped edit ''[[The Real Anita Hill]]'', a book by [[David Brock]] that savaged Hill and portrayed the harassment claim as a political dirty trick (Brock later recanted his claims and apologized to Hill). The Independent Women's Forum continued on with a goal of retaining a high profile group of women to advocate for economic and political freedom and personal responsibility.

In 1994, Olson became chief investigative counsel for the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]]. In that position, she led the [[Travelgate]] and [[Filegate]] investigations into the Clinton administration. She was later a partner in the Washington, D.C. office of the [[Birmingham, Alabama]] law firm [[Balch &amp; Bingham]].

==Personal life==
She married [[Theodore Olson]] in 1996, becoming his third wife.&lt;ref name=napanuptials&gt;{{cite news |title= Napa Nuptials for Olson and His Lady |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/22/AR2006102200052.html?nav=rss_opinion/columns |date= October 22, 2006 |accessdate= August 19, 2009 |work= [[The Washington Post]] |first1= Amy |last1= Argetsinger |first2= Roxanne |last2= Roberts |lastauthoramp= yes |authorlink1= Amy Argetsinger |authorlink2= Roxanne Roberts |department= The Reliable Source }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theodore went on to successfully represent [[2000 United States presidential election|presidential candidate]] [[George W. Bush]] in the Supreme Court case of ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', and subsequently served as [[United States Solicitor General|U.S. Solicitor General]] in the Bush administration.

Olson was a frequent critic of the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton administration]] and wrote a book about then [[First Lady]] [[Hillary Clinton]], ''Hell to Pay: The Unfolding Story of Hillary Rodham Clinton'' (1999). Olson's  second book, ''The Final Days: The Last, Desperate Abuses of Power by the Clinton White House'' was published posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_final_days.html?id=xANcUb7FY1UC | title=The final days: the last, desperate abuses of power by the Clinton White House | publisher=Regnery Pub. | author=Olson, Barbara | date=October 25, 2001| isbn=9780895261670 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was a resident of [[Great Falls, Virginia]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}
