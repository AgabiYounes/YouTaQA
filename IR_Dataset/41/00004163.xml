In the early 20th century, Russell led the British &quot;revolt against [[British idealism|idealism]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Russell and G.&amp;nbsp;E. Moore broke themselves free from British [[Idealism]] which, for nearly 90 years, had dominated British philosophy. Russell would later recall in &quot;My Mental Development&quot; that &quot;with a sense of escaping from prison, we allowed ourselves to think that grass is green, that the sun and stars would exist if no one was aware of them{{nbsp}}...&quot;—Russell B, (1944) &quot;My Mental Development&quot;, in Schilpp, Paul Arthur: ''The Philosophy of Bertrand Russell'', New York: Tudor, 1951, pp. 3–20.&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered one of the founders of [[analytic philosophy]] along with his predecessor [[Gottlob Frege]], colleague [[G.&amp;nbsp;E. Moore]] and protégé [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. He is widely held to be one of the 20th century's premier [[logician]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;stanford&quot; /&gt; With [[Alfred North Whitehead|A. N.

Bertrand Arthur William Russell was born on 18 May 1872 at Ravenscroft, [[Trellech]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], into an influential and liberal family of the [[British aristocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Hook, &quot;Lord Russell and the War Crimes Trial&quot;, ''Bertrand Russell: critical assessments'', Vol. 1, edited by A. D. Irvine, New York 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;178&lt;/ref&gt; His parents, [[John Russell, Viscount Amberley|Viscount]] and [[Katharine Russell, Viscountess Amberley|Viscountess Amberley]], were radical for their times. Lord Amberley consented to his wife's affair with their children's tutor, the biologist [[Douglas Spalding]]. Both were early advocates of [[birth control]] at a time when this was considered scandalous.&lt;ref name=&quot;calicut&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Paul |first=Ashley |title = Bertrand Russell: The Man and His Ideas |url = http://www.geocities.com/vu3ash/index.html |access-date=28 October 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060501064331/http://www.geocities.com/vu3ash/index.html |archive-date=1 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Amberley was an [[atheist]] and his atheism was evident when he asked the philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] to act as Russell's secular godfather.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand and [[Ray Perkins, Jr.|Perkins, Ray]] (ed.) ''Yours faithfully, Bertrand Russell''. Open Court Publishing, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt; Mill died the year after Russell's birth, but his writings had a great effect on Russell's life.

His paternal grandfather, the [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Earl Russell]], had been asked twice by [[Queen Victoria]] to form a government, serving her as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in the 1840s and 1860s.&lt;ref name=&quot;John R&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last = Bloy | first = Marjie, PhD | title = Lord John Russell (1792–1878) | url = http://www.victorianweb.org/history/pms/russell.html |access-date = 28 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russells had been prominent in England for several centuries before this, coming to power and the [[peerage]] with the rise of the [[Tudor dynasty]] (see: [[Duke of Bedford]]). They established themselves as one of the leading British [[British Whig Party|Whig]] families, and participated in every great political event from the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1536–1540 to the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688–1689 and the [[Great Reform Act]] in 1832.&lt;ref name=&quot;John R&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;peerage&quot;&gt;Cokayne, G.

Lady Amberley was the daughter of [[Edward Stanley, 2nd Baron Stanley of Alderley|Lord]] and [[Henrietta Stanley, Baroness Stanley of Alderley|Lady Stanley of Alderley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallery&quot;/&gt; Russell often feared the ridicule of his maternal grandmother,&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/moderndogmarhet00boot|title=Modern Dogma and the Rhetoric of Assent|last=Booth|first=Wayne C.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1974|isbn=0226065723|url-access=registration}}&lt;!--|access-date=6 December 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; one of the campaigners for [[education of women]].&lt;ref&gt;The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide, 1866–1928 By Elizabeth Crawford&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood and adolescence===
Russell had two siblings: brother [[Frank Russell, 2nd Earl Russell|Frank]] (nearly seven years older than Bertrand), and sister Rachel (four years older). In June 1874 Russell's mother died of [[diphtheria]], followed shortly by Rachel's death. In January 1876, his father died of [[bronchitis]] following a long period of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. Frank and Bertrand were placed in the care of their staunchly [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] paternal grandparents, who lived at [[Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park|Pembroke Lodge]] in [[Richmond Park]]. His grandfather, former Prime Minister [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Earl Russell]], died in 1878, and was remembered by Russell as a kindly old man in a wheelchair. His grandmother, the [[Frances Russell, Countess Russell|Countess Russell]] (née Lady Frances Elliot), was the dominant family figure for the rest of Russell's childhood and youth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallery&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;calicut&quot;/&gt;

The countess was from a Scottish [[Presbyterian]] family, and successfully petitioned the [[Court of Chancery]] to set aside a provision in Amberley's will requiring the children to be raised as agnostics. Despite her religious conservatism, she held progressive views in other areas (accepting [[Darwinism]] and supporting [[Home Rule|Irish Home Rule]]), and her influence on Bertrand Russell's outlook on [[social justice]] and standing up for principle remained with him throughout his life. (One could challenge the view that Bertrand stood up for his principles, based on his own well-known quotation: &quot;I would never die for my beliefs because I might be wrong.&quot;) Her favourite Bible verse, &quot;Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil&quot; ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 23:2), became his motto. The atmosphere at Pembroke Lodge was one of frequent prayer, emotional repression, and formality; Frank reacted to this with open rebellion, but the young Bertrand learned to hide his feelings.

Russell's adolescence was very lonely, and he often contemplated suicide. He remarked in his autobiography that his keenest interests were in &quot;nature and books and (later) mathematics saved me from complete despondency;&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell'' (Volume I, 1872-1914) George Allen and Unwin Ltd., 1971, page 31;&lt;/ref&gt; only his wish to know more mathematics kept him from suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Autobiography|page=38|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=9780415189859 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC |author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at home by a series of tutors.&lt;ref name=&quot;nobel prize&quot;&gt;The Nobel Foundation (1950).

Retrieved 11 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; When Russell was eleven years old, his brother Frank introduced him to the work of [[Euclid]], which he described in his autobiography as &quot;one of the great events of my life, as dazzling as first love.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |title=The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell: 1872–1914 |orig-year=1967 |year=2000 |url={{Google books|dVBpAwAAQBAJ|page=30|plainurl=y}} |page=30 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Paul|first=Ashley|title=Bertrand Russell: The Man and His Ideas – Chapter 2 |url = http://www.geocities.com:80/vu3ash/index.htm2.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101073812/http://www.geocities.com/vu3ash/index.htm2.htm |archive-date=1 January 2009 |access-date=6 December 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During these formative years he also discovered the works of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]. Russell wrote: &quot;I spent all my spare time reading him, and learning him by heart, knowing no one to whom I could speak of what I thought or felt, I used to reflect how wonderful it would have been to know Shelley, and to wonder whether I should meet any live human being with whom I should feel so much sympathy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography|page=35|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell claimed that beginning at age 15, he spent considerable time thinking about the validity of [[Dogma#In religion|Christian religious dogma]], which he found very unconvincing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP4FDLegX9s |title=1959 Bertrand Russell CBC interview|year=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this age, he came to the conclusion that there is no [[free will]] and, two years later, that there is no life after death. Finally, at the age of 18, after reading Mill's ''Autobiography'', he abandoned the &quot;[[First Cause]]&quot; argument and became an [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Autobiography|chapter=2: Adolescence|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=9780415189859 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://richarddawkins.net/articles/4833 |title=Bertrand Russell on God |year=1959 |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |access-date=8 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100126090302/http://richarddawkins.net/articles/4833 |archive-date=26 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He traveled to the continent in 1890 with an American friend, [[Edward FitzGerald (mountaineer)|Edward FitzGerald]], and with FitzGerald's family he visited the [[Paris Exhibition of 1889]] and was able to climb the [[Eiffel Tower]] soon after it was completed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell1967a&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |title=The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell: 1872–1914 |orig-year=1967 |year=2000 |url = {{Google books|dVBpAwAAQBAJ|page=39|plainurl=y}} |page=39 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University and first marriage===
[[File:Portrait of Bertrand Russell in 1893.jpg|thumb|Russell at Trinity College in 1893]]

Russell won a scholarship to read for the [[Mathematical Tripos]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and commenced his studies there in 1890,&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=RSL890BA|name=Russell, the Hon. Bertrand Arthur William}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking as coach [[Robert Rumsey Webb]]. He became acquainted with the younger [[George Edward Moore]] and came under the influence of [[Alfred North Whitehead]], who recommended him to the [[Cambridge Apostles]]. He quickly distinguished himself in mathematics and [[philosophy]], graduating as seventh [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Wrangler]] in the former in 1893 and becoming a Fellow in the latter in 1895.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitehead&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Whitehead.html |title=Alfred North Whitehead |access-date=8 November 2007 |last=O'Connor|first=J.

Russell was 17&amp;nbsp;years old in the summer of 1889 when he met the family of [[Alys Pearsall Smith]], an American [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] five years older, who was a graduate of [[Bryn Mawr College]] near [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell1967b&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |title=The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell: 1872–1914 |orig-year=1967 |year=2000 |url = {{Google books|dVBpAwAAQBAJ|page=72|plainurl=y}} |page=72 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Monk1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Monk |first=Ray |title=Bertrand Russell: The Spirit of Solitude, 1872–1921 |url={{Google books|AzssomBIDRIC|page=37|plainurl=y}} |year=1996 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-684-82802-2 |page=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a friend of the Pearsall Smith family – they knew him primarily as &quot;Lord John's grandson&quot; and enjoyed showing him off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Monk |first=Ray |title=Bertrand Russell: The Spirit of Solitude, 1872–1921 |url={{Google books|AzssomBIDRIC|page=37|plainurl=y}} |year=1996 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-684-82802-2 |page=48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He soon fell in love with the puritanical, high-minded Alys, and, contrary to his grandmother's wishes, married her on 13 December 1894. Their marriage began to fall apart in 1901 when it occurred to Russell, while he was cycling, that he no longer loved her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |quote=I went out bicycling one afternoon, and suddenly, as I was riding along a country road, I realised that I no longer loved Alys |title=Autobiography|page=150|isbn=9780415189859 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC |author=Bertrand Russell |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; She asked him if he loved her and he replied that he did not. Russell also disliked Alys's mother, finding her controlling and cruel. It was to be a hollow shell of a marriage. A lengthy period of separation began in 1911 with Russell's affair with [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]],&lt;ref name=&quot;the Journal of the Bertrand Russell Archives&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1353&amp;context=russelljournal&amp;sei-redir=1 |title=Bertrand Russell Meets His Muse: The Impact of Lady Ottoline Morrell (1911–12) |access-date=1 March 2012 |last=Moran|first=Margaret|year=1991|publisher=McMaster University Library Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he and Alys finally divorced in 1921 to enable Russell to remarry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Griffin |editor-first=Nicholas|editorlink=Nicholas Griffin (philosopher)|last=Russell |first=Bertrand

During his years of separation from Alys, Russell had passionate (and often simultaneous) affairs with a number of women, including Morrell and the actress [[Lady Constance Malleson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;private&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://newcriterion.com:81/archive/11/sept92/brussell.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205032455/http://newcriterion.com/archive/11/sept92/brussell.htm |archive-date=5 December 2006 |title=Love, logic &amp; unbearable pity: The private Bertrand Russell |accessdate=15 November 2007 |last=Kimball |first=Roger |work=The New Criterion |volume=11 |issue=1 |date=September 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have suggested that at this point he had an affair with [[Vivienne Haigh-Wood]], the English governess and writer, and first wife of [[T.

===Early career===
[[File:Russell1907-2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Russell in 1907]]

Russell began his published work in 1896 with ''German Social Democracy'', a study in politics that was an early indication of a lifelong interest in political and social theory. In 1896 he taught German social democracy at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LSE&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.lse.ac.uk/aboutLSE/keyFacts/nobelPrizeWinners/russell.aspx |title=London School of Economics |website=Lse.ac.uk|date=26 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Coefficients (dining club)|Coefficients dining club]] of social reformers set up in 1902 by the [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] campaigners [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LettersPg16&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell|first=Bertrand|editor=Ray Perkins|title=Yours Faithfully, Bertrand Russell: Letters to the Editor 1904–1969|year=2001|publisher=Open Court Publishing|location=Chicago|isbn=0-8126-9449-X|page=16|url = https://books.google.com/?id=EayyTTpXL-QC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16 |access-date=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He now started an intensive study of the [[foundations of mathematics]] at Trinity.
In 1898 he wrote ''An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry'' which discussed the [[Cayley–Klein metric]]s used for [[non-Euclidean geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand (1898) ''An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry'', p.&amp;nbsp;32, re-issued 1956 by [[Dover Books]]&lt;/ref&gt;
He attended the [[International Congress of Philosophy]] in Paris in 1900 where he met [[Giuseppe Peano]] and [[Alessandro Padoa]]. The Italians had responded to [[Georg Cantor]], making a science of [[set theory]]; they gave Russell their literature including the ''[[Formulario mathematico]]''. Russell was impressed by the precision of Peano's arguments at the Congress, read the literature upon returning to England, and came upon [[Russell's paradox]]. In 1903 he published ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'', a work on foundations of mathematics. It advanced a thesis of [[logicism]], that mathematics and logic are one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1950/russell-bio.html |title=Bertrand Russell, biography |website=Nobelprize.org |access-date=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 29, in February 1901, Russell underwent what he called a &quot;sort of mystic illumination&quot;, after witnessing [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s wife's acute suffering in an [[Angina pectoris|angina]] attack. &quot;I found myself filled with semi-mystical feelings about beauty ... and with a desire almost as profound as that of the [[Buddha]] to find some philosophy which should make human life endurable&quot;, Russell would later recall. &quot;At the end of those five minutes, I had become a completely different person.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Autobiography |publisher=Psychology Press |year=1998 |chapter=6: Principia Mathematica |isbn=9780415189859 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC |author=Bertrand Russell }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905 he wrote the essay &quot;[[On Denoting]]&quot;, which was published in the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]''. Russell was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1908|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1908]].&lt;ref name=&quot;frs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallery&quot; /&gt; The three-volume ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', written with Whitehead, was published between 1910 and 1913. This, along with the earlier ''The Principles of Mathematics'', soon made Russell world-famous in his field.

In 1910 he became a [[University of Cambridge]] lecturer at Trinity College, where he had studied. He was considered for a Fellowship, which would give him a vote in the college government and protect him from being fired for his opinions, but was passed over because he was &quot;anti-clerical&quot;, essentially because he was agnostic. He was approached by the Austrian engineering student [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who became his PhD student. Russell viewed Wittgenstein as a genius and a successor who would continue his work on logic. He spent hours dealing with Wittgenstein's various [[phobia]]s and his frequent bouts of despair. This was often a drain on Russell's energy, but Russell continued to be fascinated by him and encouraged his academic development, including the publication of Wittgenstein's ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' in 1922.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittgenstein&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/philos/history/rvw001.htm |title=Russell on Wittgenstein |website=Rbjones.com |access-date=1 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell delivered his lectures on [[logical atomism]], his version of these ideas, in 1918, before the end of [[World War I]]. Wittgenstein was, at that time, serving in the Austrian Army and subsequently spent nine months in an Italian [[prisoner of war]] camp at the end of the conflict.

===First World War===
During World War I, Russell was one of the few people to engage in active [[opposition to World War I|pacifist activities]]. In 1916, because of his lack of a Fellowship, he was dismissed from Trinity College following his conviction under the [[Defence of the Realm Act 1914]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last = Hochschild|first = Adam|year = 2011|title = I Tried to Stop the Bloody Thing|periodical = The American Scholar|url = http://www.theamericanscholar.org/i-tried-to-stop-the-bloody-thing/|accessdate =10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later described this as an illegitimate means the state used to violate freedom of expression, in [[Free Thought and Official Propaganda]]. Russell played a significant part in the ''Leeds Convention'' in June 1917, a historic event which saw well over a thousand &quot;anti-war socialists&quot; gather; many being delegates from the [[Independent Labour Party]] and the Socialist Party, united in their pacifist beliefs and advocating a peace settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Scharfenburger |first=Paul |title=1917 |url = http://musicandhistory.com/music-and-history-by-the-year/178-1917.html |website=MusicandHistory.com |date=17 October 2012 |access-date=7 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120117062625/http://musicandhistory.com/music-and-history-by-the-year/178-1917.html|archive-date=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international press reported that Russell appeared with a number of Labour [[Member of Parliament|MPs]], including [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and [[Philip Snowden]], as well as former [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] MP and anti-conscription campaigner, Professor [[Arnold Lupton]]. After the event, Russell told [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]] that, &quot;to my surprise, when I got up to speak, I was given the greatest ovation that was possible to give anybody&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell|first=Bertrand|title=Pacifism and Revolution |page=xxxiv |chapter=A Summer of Hope |year=1995 |publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=British Socialists – Peace Terms Discussed |url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15731745 |date=5 June 1917|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trinity incident resulted in Russell being fined £100, which he refused to pay in hope that he would be sent to prison, but his books were sold at auction to raise the money. The books were bought by friends; he later treasured his copy of the [[King James Version|King James Bible]] that was stamped &quot;Confiscated by Cambridge Police&quot;.

A later conviction for publicly lecturing against inviting the United States to enter the war on the United Kingdom's side resulted in six months' imprisonment in [[Brixton (HM Prison)|Brixton prison]] (see ''[[Bertrand Russell's views on society]]'') in 1918.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pacifist&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Bertrand Russell and the Pacifists in the First World War|last=Vellacott|first=Jo|isbn=0-85527-454-9|publisher=Harvester Press|location=Brighton|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later said of his imprisonment:

{{quote|I found prison in many ways quite agreeable. I had no engagements, no difficult decisions to make, no fear of callers, no interruptions to my work. I read enormously; I wrote a book, &quot;Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy&quot;... and began the work for &quot;Analysis of Mind&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|chapter=8: The First War |isbn=9780415189859 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC |author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He found the Brixton period so much agreeable that while he was reading [[Lytton Strachey|Strachey]]'s [[Eminent Victorians]] chapter about [[Charles George Gordon|Gordon]] he laughed out loud in his cell prompting the warden to intervene and reminding him that &quot;prison was a place of punishment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Selected Letters of Bertrand Russell'' by Bertrand Russell, [[Nicholas Griffin (philosopher)|Nicholas Griffin]] 2002, letter to Gladys Rinder on May 1918&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell was reinstated to Trinity in 1919, resigned in 1920, was Tarner Lecturer 1926 and became a Fellow again in 1944 until 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Trinity College |url = https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/about/historical-overview/trinity-in-literature/ |title=Trinity in Literature|access-date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, Bertrand again gained press attention when attending a &quot;banquet&quot; in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] with well-known campaigners, including [[Arnold Lupton]], who had been a [[Members of Parliament|Member of Parliament]] and had also endured imprisonment for &quot;passive resistance to military or naval service&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=M.

===G. H. Hardy on the Trinity controversy and Russell's personal life===
In 1941, [[G. H. Hardy]] wrote a 61-page pamphlet titled ''Bertrand Russell and Trinity'' – published later as a book by Cambridge University Press with a foreword by [[C. D. Broad]] – in which he gave an authoritative account about Russell's 1916 dismissal from Trinity College, explaining that a reconciliation between the college and Russell had later taken place and gave details about Russell's personal life. Hardy writes that Russell's dismissal had created a scandal since the vast majority of the Fellows of the College opposed the decision. The ensuing pressure from the Fellows induced the Council to reinstate Russell. In January 1920, it was announced that Russell had accepted the reinstatement offer from Trinity and would begin lecturing from October. In July 1920, Russell applied for a one year leave of absence; this was approved. He spent the year giving lectures in China and Japan. In January 1921, it was announced by Trinity that Russell had resigned and his resignation had been accepted. This resignation, Hardy explains, was completely voluntary and was not the result of another altercation.

The reason for the resignation, according to Hardy, was that Russell was going through a tumultuous time in his personal life with a divorce and subsequent remarriage. Russell contemplated asking Trinity for another one-year leave of absence but decided against it, since this would have been an &quot;unusual application&quot; and the situation had the potential to snowball into another controversy. Although Russell did the right thing, in Hardy's opinion, the reputation of the College suffered due to Russell's resignation since the ‘world of learning’ knew about Russell's altercation with Trinity but not that the rift had healed. In 1925, Russell was asked by the Council of Trinity College to give the ''Tarner Lectures'' on the Philosophy of the Sciences; these would later be the basis for one of Russell's best received books according to Hardy: ''The Analysis of Matter'', published in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bertrand Russell and Trinity|author=G. H. Hardy|pages=57–8|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the preface to the Trinity pamphlet, Hardy wrote:

{{quote|I wish to make it plain that Russell himself is not responsible, directly or indirectly, for the writing of the pamphlet ... I wrote it without his knowledge and, when I sent him the typescript and asked for his permission to print it, I suggested that, unless it contained misstatement of fact, he should make no comment on it. He agreed to this ... no word has been changed as the result of any suggestion from him.}}

===Between the wars===
In August 1920, Russell travelled to [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] as part of an official delegation sent by the British government to investigate the effects of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FreeLib&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) |publisher=Farlex, Inc. |url = http://russell.thefreelibrary.com/|accessdate=11 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a four-part series of articles, titled &quot;Soviet Russia{{emdash}}1920&quot;, for the US magazine ''[[The Nation]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;nation1&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |url = http://www.unz.org/Pub/Nation-1920jul31-00121 |title=Soviet Russia{{emdash}}1920 |magazine=The Nation |date=31 July 1920 |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |pages=121–125 |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sov1920&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url = https://www.thenation.com/article/lenin-trotzky-and-gorky/ |title=Lenin, Trotzky and Gorky |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |journal=The Nation |date=20 February 2008 |orig-year=First published 1920 |access-date=20 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He met [[Vladimir Lenin]] and had an hour-long conversation with him. In his autobiography, he mentions that he found Lenin disappointing, sensing an &quot;impish cruelty&quot; in him and comparing him to &quot;an opinionated professor&quot;. He cruised down the [[Volga]] on a steamship. His experiences destroyed his previous tentative support for the revolution. He subsequently wrote a book, ''The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Practice &amp;&quot;&gt;Russell, Bertrand [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17350 The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism by Bertrand Russell], 1920&lt;/ref&gt; about his experiences on this trip, taken with a group of 24 others from the UK, all of whom came home thinking well of the Soviet regime, despite Russell's attempts to change their minds. For example, he told them that he had heard shots fired in the middle of the night and was sure that these were clandestine executions, but the others maintained that it was only cars backfiring.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

[[File:Russell with John and Kate.jpg|thumb|left|Russell with his children, [[John Conrad Russell, 4th Earl Russell|John]] and [[Lady Katharine Tait|Kate]]]]
Russell's lover [[Dora Russell|Dora Black]], a British author, [[feminist]] and socialist campaigner, visited Soviet Russia independently at the same time; in contrast to his reaction, she was enthusiastic about the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Practice &amp;&quot; /&gt;

The following autumn, Russell, accompanied by Dora, visited [[Beijing|Peking]] (as it was then known in the West) to lecture on philosophy for a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;nobel prize&quot;/&gt; He went with optimism and hope, seeing China as [[History of the Republic of China#Fight against warlordism and the First United Front|then being]] on a new path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell|first=Bertrand|title=The Problem of China|date=1972|publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd. |location=London|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars present in China at the time included [[John Dewey]]&lt;ref name=&quot;pneumonia&quot;/&gt; and [[Rabindranath Tagore]], the Indian Nobel-laureate poet.&lt;ref name=&quot;nobel prize&quot;/&gt; Before leaving China, Russell became gravely ill with [[pneumonia]], and [[List of premature obituaries|incorrect reports]] of his death were published in the Japanese press.&lt;ref name=&quot;pneumonia&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Bertrand Russell Reported Dead|newspaper=The New York Times|date=21 April 1921 |access-date=11 December 2007 |url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/04/21/107014047.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the couple visited Japan on their return journey, Dora took on the role of spurning the local press by handing out notices reading &quot;Mr. Bertrand Russell, having died according to the Japanese press, is unable to give interviews to Japanese journalists&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;papers&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Uncertain Paths to Freedom: Russia and China, 1919–22|work=The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell|volume=15|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=0-415-09411-9|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|editor=Richard A.

We don't use irony (fundamentally, because it interferes with consistently clearly stating the verifiable facts). It is also unlikely that even BR's use of it in this circumstance, even if verifiable as his words, rises above chit-chat and to the level of being worthy of mention as a *notable* utterance or opinion of his.}}

Dora was six months pregnant when the couple returned to England on 26 August 1921. Russell arranged a hasty divorce from Alys, marrying Dora six days after the divorce was finalised, on 27 September 1921. Russell's children with Dora were [[John Conrad Russell, 4th Earl Russell]], born on 16 November 1921, and [[Lady Katharine Tait|Katharine Jane Russell]] (now Lady Katharine Tait), born on 29 December 1923. Russell supported his family during this time by writing popular books explaining matters of [[physics]], ethics, and education to the layman.

From 1922 to 1927 the Russells divided their time between London and [[Cornwall]], spending summers in [[Porthcurno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|page=386|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]] and [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 general elections]] Russell stood as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate in the [[Chelsea (UK Parliament constituency)|Chelsea constituency]], but only on the basis that he knew he was extremely unlikely to be elected in such a safe Conservative seat, and he was unsuccessful on both occasions.

Together with Dora, Russell founded the experimental Beacon Hill School in 1927. The school was run from a succession of different locations, including its original premises at the Russells' residence, Telegraph House, near [[Harting]], West Sussex. On 8 July 1930 Dora gave birth to her third child Harriet Ruth. After he left the school in 1932, Dora continued it until 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beacon&quot;&gt;Inside Beacon Hill: Bertrand Russell as Schoolmaster.

On a tour through the US in 1927, Russell met Barry Fox (later [[Barry Stevens (therapist)|Barry Stevens]]), who became a well-known [[Gestalt therapy|Gestalt therapist]] and writer in later years.&lt;ref&gt;Kranz, D. (2011): [http://www.gestalt.de/kranz_stevens_leben.html Barry Stevens: Leben Gestalten]. In: Gestaltkritik, 2/2011, p.&amp;nbsp;4–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell and Fox developed an intensive relationship. In Fox's words: &quot;...{{nbsp}}for three years we were very close.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, B. (1970): Don't Push the River. Lafayette, Cal. (Real People Press), p.&amp;nbsp;26.&lt;/ref&gt; Fox sent her daughter Judith to Beacon Hill School for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Gorham, D.

(1981): Recent Acquisitions: Correspondence, in: Russell: the Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies, Vol 1, Iss. 1, Article 6, 43–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the death of his elder brother Frank, in 1931, Russell became the 3rd Earl Russell.

Russell's marriage to Dora grew increasingly tenuous, and it reached a breaking point over her having two children with an American journalist, Griffin Barry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dora&quot; /&gt; They separated in 1932 and finally divorced. On 18 January 1936, Russell married his third wife, an [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] undergraduate named [[Patricia Russell (nee Spence)|Patricia (&quot;Peter&quot;) Spence]], who had been his children's governess since 1930. Russell and Peter had one son, [[Conrad Russell, 5th Earl Russell|Conrad Sebastian Robert Russell]], 5th Earl Russell, who became a prominent historian and one of the leading figures in the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] party.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallery&quot; /&gt;

Russell returned to the [[London School of Economics]] to lecture on the science of power in 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;LSE&quot; /&gt;

During the 1930s, Russell became a close friend and collaborator of [[V. K. Krishna Menon]], then secretary of the India League, the foremost lobby in the [[United Kingdom]] for Indian self-rule.{{vague|date=July 2014|reason= was Menon *at that point* AIML sec'y, or was it BR who *later* became sec'y?}}

===Second World War===
[[Bertrand Russell's political views|Russell's political views]] changed over time, mostly about war. He opposed rearmament against [[Nazi Germany]]. In 1937 he wrote in a personal letter: &quot;If the Germans succeed in sending an invading army to England we should do best to treat them as visitors, give them quarters and invite the commander and chief to dine with the prime minister.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2014/02/19/museum-of-tolerance-acquires-bertrand-russells-nazi-appeasement-letter/ |title = Museum Of Tolerance Acquires Bertrand Russell's Nazi Appeasement Letter |website=Losangeles.cbslocal.com |date=19 February 2014 |access-date=29 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, he changed his [[appeasement]] view that avoiding a full-scale world war was more important than defeating Hitler. He concluded that Adolf Hitler taking over all of Europe would be a permanent threat to democracy. In 1943, he adopted a stance toward large-scale warfare called &quot;relative political pacifism&quot;: &quot;War was always a great evil, but in some particularly extreme circumstances, it may be the lesser of two evils.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand, &quot;The Future of Pacifism&quot;, The American Scholar, (1943) 13: 7–13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |quote = I found the Nazis utterly revolting – cruel, bigoted, and stupid.

I found this possibility unbearable, and at last consciously and definitely decided that I must support what was necessary for victory in the Second War, however difficult victory might be to achieve, and however painful in its consequences|title=Autobiography|chapter=12: Later Years of Telegraph House|isbn=9780415189859|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before World War II, Russell taught at the [[University of Chicago]], later moving on to Los Angeles to lecture at the [[UCLA Department of Philosophy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=xj8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=bertrand%20russell&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Bertrand Russell Rides Out Collegiate Cyclone] [[Life (magazine)|LIFE]], Vol. 8, No. 14, 1 Apr 1940&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed professor at the [[City College of New York]] (CCNY) in 1940, but after a public outcry the appointment was annulled by a court judgment that pronounced him &quot;morally unfit&quot; to teach at the college due to his opinions, especially those relating to [[sexual morality]], detailed in ''[[Marriage and Morals]]'' (1929).

===Later life===
[[File:Bertrand Russell 1954.jpg|thumb|Russell in 1954]]
Russell participated in many broadcasts over the [[BBC]], particularly ''[[The Brains Trust]]'' and the [[BBC Third Programme|Third Programme]], on various topical and philosophical subjects. By this time Russell was world-famous outside academic circles, frequently the subject or author of magazine and newspaper articles, and was called upon to offer opinions on a wide variety of subjects, even mundane ones. En route to one of his lectures in [[Trondheim]], Russell was one of 24 survivors (among a total of 43 passengers) of an [[Bukken Bruse disaster|aeroplane crash in Hommelvik]] in October 1948. He said he owed his life to smoking since the people who drowned were in the non-smoking part of the plane.&lt;ref name=&quot;letters&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Selected Letters of Bertrand Russell|page=660|publisher=Routledge|editor=Griffin, Nicholas|editorlink=Nicholas Griffin (philosopher)|year=2002|isbn=0-415-26012-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography|page=512|isbn=9780415189859|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'' (1945) became a best-seller and provided Russell with a steady income for the remainder of his life.

In 1942 Russell argued in favour of a moderate [[socialism]], capable of overcoming its metaphysical principles, in an inquiry on [[dialectical materialism]], launched by the Austrian artist and philosopher [[Wolfgang Paalen]] in his journal ''[[DYN (magazine)|DYN]]'', saying &quot;I think the metaphysics of both [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Karl Marx|Marx]] plain nonsense – Marx's claim to be 'science' is no more justified than [[Mary Baker Eddy]]'s. This does not mean that I am opposed to socialism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Russell to Edward Renouf, assistant of [[Wolfgang Paalen]], 23 March 1942 (Succession Wolfgang Paalen, Berlin); this letter is cited in ''DYN'', No. 2, Mexico, July–August 1942, p.&amp;nbsp;52.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, Russell expressed support for [[Zionism]]: &quot;I have come gradually to see that, in a dangerous and largely hostile world, it is essential to [[Jews]] to have some country which is theirs, some region where they are not suspected aliens, some state which embodies what is distinctive in their culture&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Quote/Russell_On_Zionism.html |title=Bertrand Russell On Zionism |access-date = 13 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040128/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Quote/Russell_On_Zionism.html |archive-date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech in 1948, Russell said that if the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]'s aggression continued, it would be morally worse to go to war after the USSR possessed an [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] than before it possessed one, because if the USSR had no bomb the West's victory would come more swiftly and with fewer casualties than if there were atom bombs on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plymouth.edu/department/history-philosophy/files/2012/10/Bertrand-Russell-and-Preventive-War.pdf |title=Bertrand Russell and Preventive War |website=Plymouth.edu |accessdate=29 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305003733/http://www.plymouth.edu/department/history-philosophy/files/2012/10/Bertrand-Russell-and-Preventive-War.pdf |archive-date=5 March 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/books/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Story_ID=699582|work=The Economist|title=A philosopher's letters&amp;nbsp;– Love, Bertie | date=21 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, only the United States possessed an atomic bomb, and the USSR was pursuing an extremely aggressive policy towards the countries in Eastern Europe which were being absorbed into the Soviet Union's [[sphere of influence]]. Many understood Russell's comments to mean that Russell approved of a [[first strike]] in a war with the USSR, including [[Nigel Lawson]], who was present when Russell spoke of such matters. Others, including [[Nicholas Griffin (philosopher)|Griffin]], who obtained a transcript of the speech, have argued that he was merely explaining the usefulness of America's atomic arsenal in deterring the USSR from continuing its domination of Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;letters&quot; /&gt;

However, just after the atomic bombs exploded over [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], Russell wrote letters, and published articles in newspapers from 1945 to 1948, stating clearly that it was morally justified and better to go to war against the USSR using atomic bombs while the United States possessed them and before the USSR did. In September 1949, one week after the USSR tested its first A-bomb, but before this became known, Russell wrote that USSR would be unable to develop nuclear weapons because following Stalin's purges only science based on Marxist principles would be practiced in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;He wrote: &quot;There is reason to think Stalin will insist on a new orthodoxy in atomic physics, since there is much in quantum theory that runs contrary to Communist dogma. An atomic bomb' made on Marxist principles would probably not explode because, after all, Marxist science was that of a hundred years ago. For those who fear the military power of Russia there is, therefore, some reason to rejoice in the muzzling of Russian science.&quot; Russell, Bertrand &quot;Stalin Declares War on Science&quot;&amp;nbsp; Review of Langdon-Davies,&amp;nbsp;''Russia Puts Back the Clock'',&amp;nbsp;''Evening Standard''&amp;nbsp;(London), 7 September 1949, p.&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/ref&gt; After it became known that the USSR carried out [[List of nuclear weapons tests of the Soviet Union|its nuclear bomb tests]], Russell declared his position advocating for the total abolition of atomic weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The life of Bertrand Russell: Ronald William Clark: 9780394490595: Amazon.com: Books|isbn = 0394490592|last1 = Clark|first1 = Ronald William|year = 1976|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/lifeofbertrandru00clar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, Russell was invited by the BBC to deliver the inaugural [[Reith Lectures]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=–06:04|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00729d9|title=Radio 4 Programmes – The Reith Lectures|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;—what was to become an annual series of lectures, still broadcast by the BBC. His series of six broadcasts, titled ''Authority and the Individual'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=–06:04|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00h9lz3|title=Radio 4 Programmes – The Reith Lectures: Bertrand Russell: Authority and the Individual: 1948|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; explored themes such as the role of individual initiative in the development of a community and the role of state control in a progressive society. Russell continued to write about philosophy. He wrote a foreword to ''Words and Things'' by [[Ernest Gellner]], which was highly critical of the [[Philosophical Investigations|later thought]] of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and of [[ordinary language philosophy]]. [[Gilbert Ryle]] refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', which caused Russell to respond via ''[[The Times]]''. The result was a month-long correspondence in ''The Times'' between the supporters and detractors of ordinary language philosophy, which was only ended when the paper published an editorial critical of both sides but agreeing with the opponents of ordinary language philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;T. P. Uschanov, [http://www.helsinki.fi/~tuschano/writings/strange/ The Strange Death of Ordinary Language Philosophy]. The controversy has been described by the writer [[Ved Mehta]] in ''Fly and the Fly Bottle'' (1963).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[King's Birthday Honours]] of 9 June 1949, Russell was awarded the [[Order of Merit (Commonwealth)|Order of Merit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=38628 |supp=y|page=2796|date=3 June 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the following year he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallery&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nobel prize&quot;/&gt; When he was given the Order of Merit, [[George VI]] was affable but slightly embarrassed at decorating a former jailbird, saying, &quot;You have sometimes behaved in a manner that would not do if generally adopted&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald W. Clark, Bertrand Russell and His World, p.&amp;nbsp;94. (1981) {{isbn|0-500-13070-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell merely smiled, but afterwards claimed that the reply &quot;That's right, just like your [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|brother]]&quot; immediately came to mind.

In 1950, Russell attended the inaugural conference for the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], a [[C.I.A.]]-funded anti-communist organization committed to the deployment of culture as a weapon during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Frances Stonor Saunders, &quot;The Cultural Cold War: The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters.&quot; New York Press, 1999.

Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 Russell was divorced by Spence, with whom he had been very unhappy. Conrad, Russell's son by Spence, did not see his father between the time of the divorce and 1968 (at which time his decision to meet his father caused a permanent breach with his mother). Russell married his fourth wife, [[Edith Finch Russell|Edith Finch]], soon after the divorce, on 15 December 1952. They had known each other since 1925, and Edith had taught English at Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia, sharing a house for 20 years with Russell's old friend [[Lucy Donnelly]]. Edith remained with him until his death, and, by all accounts, their marriage was a happy, close, and loving one. Russell's eldest son John suffered from serious [[mental illness]], which was the source of ongoing disputes between Russell and his former wife Dora.

In September 1961, at the age of 89, Russell was jailed for seven days in [[HM Prison Brixton|Brixton Prison]] for &quot;breach of peace&quot; after taking part in [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)#1961|an anti-nuclear demonstration]] in London. The magistrate offered to exempt him from jail if he pledged himself to &quot;good behaviour&quot;, to which Russell replied: &quot;No, I won't.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation, ''Bertrand Russell, 1872–1970'' [1970], p.&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell, Vol. 3|page=157|publisher=Little, Brown|author=Russell, Bertrand|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 Russell played a public role in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis#Crisis deepens|Cuban Missile Crisis]]: in an exchange of telegrams with Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]], Khrushchev assured him that the Soviet government would not be reckless.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mulpress.mcmaster.ca/russelljournal/article/view/1632/1658 Russell and the Cuban missile crisis], by [[Al Seckel]], [[California Institute of Technology]] // [https://russell.humanities.mcmaster.ca/journal.htm Russell: the Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies], [[McMaster University]], [https://mulpress.mcmaster.ca/russelljournal/article/view/1632 Vol '''4''' (1984), Issue 2, Winter 1984–85, pages 253–261]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

J. Muste|publisher=Sanderson Beck|year=2003–2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell sent this telegram to [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;YOUR ACTION DESPERATE. THREAT TO HUMAN SURVIVAL. NO CONCEIVABLE JUSTIFICATION. CIVILIZED MAN CONDEMNS IT. WE WILL NOT HAVE MASS MURDER. ULTIMATUM MEANS WAR...

According to historian Peter Knight, after JFK's [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination]], Russell, &quot;prompted by the emerging work of the lawyer [[Mark Lane (author)|Mark Lane]] in the US ... rallied support from other noteworthy and left-leaning compatriots to form a Who Killed Kennedy Committee in June 1964, members of which included [[Michael Foot]] MP, [[Caroline Benn]], the publisher [[Victor Gollancz]], the writers [[John Arden]] and [[J. B. Priestley]], and the Oxford history professor [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]].&quot; Russell published a highly critical article weeks before the [[Warren Commission]] Report was published, setting forth ''16 Questions on the Assassination'' and equating the [[Lee Harvey Oswald|Oswald]] case with the [[Dreyfus affair]] of late 19th-century France, in which the state wrongly convicted an innocent man. Russell also criticised the American press for failing to heed any voices critical of the official version.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Knight, ''The Kennedy Assassination'', Edinburgh University Press Ltd., 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political causes===
[[File:Bertrand Russell leads anti-nuclear march in London, Feb 1961.jpg|thumb|left|Russell (centre) alongside his wife Edith, leading a [[CND]] anti-nuclear march in London, 18 February 1961]]
Bertrand Russell was opposed to war from early on, his opposition to World War I being used as grounds for his dismissal from Trinity College at Cambridge. This incident fused two of his most controversial causes, as he had failed to be granted Fellow status, which would have protected him from firing, because he was not willing to either pretend to be a devout Christian, or at least avoid admitting he was agnostic.

He later described the resolution of these issues as essential to freedom of thought and expression, citing the incident in [[Free Thought and Official Propaganda]], where he explained that the expression of any idea, even the most obviously &quot;bad&quot;, must be protected not only from direct State intervention, but also economic leveraging and other means of being silenced:

{{quote|The opinions which are still persecuted strike the majority as so monstrous and immoral that the general principle of toleration cannot be held to apply to them.

But this is exactly the same view as that which made possible the tortures of the Inquisition.&lt;ref name=&quot;free&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44932/44932-h/44932-h.htm|title=Free Thought and Official Propaganda|first=Bertrand|last=Russell|website=www.gutenberg.org|accessdate=14 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Russell spent the 1950s and 1960s engaged in political causes primarily related to [[nuclear disarmament]] and opposing the [[Vietnam War]]. The 1955 [[Russell–Einstein Manifesto]] was a document calling for nuclear disarmament and was signed by eleven of the most prominent nuclear physicists and intellectuals of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manifesto&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Russell Einstein Manifesto|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/texts/doc_russelleinstein_manif.html|author=Russell, Bertrand|author2=Albert Einstein |date=9 July 1955|accessdate=17 February 2008|author2-link=Albert Einstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966–1967, Russell worked with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and many other intellectual figures to form the [[Russell Tribunal|Russell Vietnam War Crimes Tribunal]] to investigate the conduct of the United States in Vietnam. He wrote a great many letters to world leaders during this period.

In 1956, immediately before and during the [[Suez Crisis]], Russell expressed his opposition to European imperialism in the Middle East. He viewed the crisis as another reminder of the pressing need for a more effective mechanism for international governance, and to restrict national sovereignty to places such as the [[Suez Canal]] area &quot;where general interest is involved&quot;. At the same time the Suez Crisis was taking place, the world was also captivated by the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] and the subsequent crushing of the revolt by intervening Soviet forces. Russell attracted criticism for speaking out fervently against the Suez war while ignoring Soviet repression in Hungary, to which he responded that he did not criticise the Soviets &quot;because there was no need. Most of the so-called Western World was fulminating&quot;. Although he later feigned a lack of concern, at the time he was disgusted by the brutal Soviet response, and on 16 November 1956, he expressed approval for a declaration of support for Hungarian scholars which [[Michael Polanyi]] had cabled to the Soviet embassy in London twelve days previously, shortly after Soviet troops had already entered Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;''Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell'' (Psychology Press, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1957 Russell wrote an article addressing US President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]], urging a summit to consider &quot;the conditions of co-existence&quot;. Khrushchev responded that peace could indeed be served by such a meeting. In January 1958 Russell elaborated his views in ''[[The Observer]]'', proposing a cessation of all nuclear-weapons production, with the UK taking the first step by unilaterally suspending its own nuclear-weapons program if necessary, and with Germany &quot;freed from all alien armed forces and pledged to neutrality in any conflict between East and West&quot;. US Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] replied for Eisenhower. The exchange of letters was published as ''The Vital Letters of Russell, Khrushchev, and Dulles''.&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;''Yours Faithfully, Bertrand Russell'' (pp. 212–213)&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell was asked by ''[[The New Republic]]'', a liberal American magazine, to elaborate his views on world peace. He urged that all nuclear-weapons testing and constant flights by planes armed with nuclear weapons be halted immediately, and negotiations be opened for the destruction of all [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bombs]], with the number of conventional nuclear devices limited to ensure a balance of power. He proposed that Germany be reunified and accept the [[Oder-Neisse line]] as its border, and that a neutral zone be established in Central Europe, consisting at the minimum of Germany, Poland, [[Hungary]], and [[Czechoslovakia]], with each of these countries being free of foreign troops and influence, and prohibited from forming alliances with countries outside the zone. In the Middle East, Russell suggested that the West avoid opposing [[Arab nationalism]], and proposed the creation of a United Nations peacekeeping force to guard Israel's frontiers to ensure that Israel was prevented from committing aggression and protected from it. He also suggested Western recognition of the [[China|People's Republic of China]], and that it be admitted to the UN with a permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]].&lt;ref name=ref1/&gt;

He was in contact with [[Lionel Rogosin]] while the latter was filming his anti-war film ''[[Good Times, Wonderful Times]]'' in the 1960s. He became a hero to many of the youthful members of the [[New Left]]. In early 1963, in particular, Russell became increasingly vocal in his disapproval of the [[Vietnam War]], and felt that the US government's policies there were near-[[genocide|genocidal]]. In 1963 he became the inaugural recipient of the [[Jerusalem Prize]], an award for writers concerned with the freedom of the individual in society.&lt;ref name=&quot;jerusalem prize&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerusalembookfair.com/main.html|title=Jerusalem International Book Fair|publisher=Jerusalembookfair.com|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 he was one of eleven world figures who issued an appeal to Israel and the [[Arab world|Arab countries]] to accept an [[arms embargo]] and international supervision of [[nuclear plants]] and rocket weaponry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1964/02/26/archive/bertrand-russell-appeals-to-arabs-and-israel-on-rocket-weapons|title=Bertrand Russell Appeals to Arabs and Israel on Rocket Weapons|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=26 February 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1965 he tore up his [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] card because he suspected [[Harold Wilson]]'s Labour government was going to send troops to support the United States in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallery&quot;/&gt;

Russell published his three-volume autobiography in 1967, 1968, and 1969. Russell made a [[cameo appearance]] playing himself in the anti-war [[Hindi]] film [[Aman (film)|''Aman'']], by [[Mohan Kumar]], which was released in India in 1967. This was Russell's only appearance in a feature film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bertrand Russell in Bollywood&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0233193/|title=Aman (1967)|publisher=Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 November 1969 he wrote to ''The Times'' newspaper saying that the preparation for show trials in [[Czechoslovakia]] was &quot;highly alarming&quot;. The same month, he appealed to Secretary General [[U Thant]] of the United Nations to support an international war crimes commission to investigate alleged torture and genocide by the United States in [[South Vietnam]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. The following month, he protested to [[Alexei Kosygin]] over the expulsion of [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] from the [[Soviet Union of Writers]].

On 31 January 1970 Russell issued a statement condemning &quot;Israel's aggression in the Middle East&quot;, and in particular, Israeli bombing raids being carried out deep in Egyptian territory as part of the [[War of Attrition]]. He called for an Israeli withdrawal to the pre-[[Six-Day War]] borders. This was Russell's final political statement or act. It was read out at the International Conference of Parliamentarians in [[Cairo]] on 3 February 1970, the day after his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Last Message&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.connexions.org/CxLibrary/Docs/CX5576-RussellMidEast.htm |title=Bertrand Russell's Last Message |website=Connexions.org |date=31 January 1970 |accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Infobox Bertrand Russell}}

===Philosophy===
{{Main|Bertrand Russell's philosophical views}}

Russell is generally credited with being one of the founders of [[analytic philosophy]]. He was deeply impressed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] (1646–1716), and wrote on every major area of philosophy except [[aesthetics]]. He was particularly prolific in the fields of [[metaphysics]], [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Logic and philosophy of mathematics|logic and the philosophy of mathematics]], the [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Philosophy of language|philosophy of language]], [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Ethics|ethics]] and [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Epistemology|epistemology]]. When [[Brand Blanshard]] asked Russell why he did not write on aesthetics, Russell replied that he did not know anything about it, though he hastened to add &quot;but that is not a very good excuse, for my friends tell me it has not deterred me from writing on other subjects&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Blanshard, in [[Paul Arthur Schilpp]], ed., ''The Philosophy of Brand Blanshard'', Open Court, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;88, quoting a private letter from Russell.&lt;/ref&gt;

On ethics, Russell wrote that he was a [[utilitarian]] in his youth, yet he later distanced himself from this view.&lt;ref&gt;''The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell'', London: Routledge, 2000 [London: Allen and Unwin, 1969, Vol. 1], p.&amp;nbsp;39 (&quot;It appeared to me obvious that the happiness of mankind should be the aim of all action, and I discovered to my surprise that there were those who thought otherwise. Belief in happiness, I found, was called Utilitarianism, and was merely one among a number of ethical theories. I adhered to it after this discovery, and was rash enough to tell my grandmother that I was a utilitarian.&quot; In a letter from 1902, in which Russell criticized utilitarianism, he wrote: &quot;I may as well begin by confessing that for many years it seemed to me perfectly self-evident that pleasure is the only good and pain the only evil. Now, however, the opposite seems to me self-evident. This change has been brought about by what I may call moral experience.&quot; Ibid, p. 161).&lt;/ref&gt;

For the advancement of science and protection of the right to freedom of expression, Russell advocated [[The Will to Doubt]], the recognition that all human knowledge is at most a best guess, that one should always remember:

{{quote|None of our beliefs are quite true; all have at least a penumbra of vagueness and error. The methods of increasing the degree of truth in our beliefs are well known; they consist in hearing all sides, trying to ascertain all the relevant facts, controlling our own bias by discussion with people who have the opposite bias, and cultivating a readiness to discard any hypothesis which has proved inadequate. These methods are practised in science, and have built up the body of scientific knowledge.

Every man of science whose outlook is truly scientific is ready to admit that what passes for scientific knowledge at the moment is sure to require correction with the progress of discovery; nevertheless, it is near enough to the truth to serve for most practical purposes, though not for all. In science, where alone something approximating to genuine knowledge is to be found, men’s attitude is tentative and full of doubt.}}

===Religion===
Russell described himself in 1947 as an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]], saying: &quot;Therefore, in regard to the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympic gods]], speaking to a purely philosophical audience, I would say that I am an Agnostic. But speaking popularly, I think that all of us would say in regard to those gods that we were Atheists. In regard to the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]], I should, I think, take exactly the same line.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell8.htm |title=Am I An Atheist or an Agnostic? |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |year=1947 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Things |accessdate=6 July 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050622001026/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell8.htm |archivedate=22 June 2005}}: &quot;I never know whether I should say 'Agnostic' or whether I should say 'Atheist'... As a philosopher, if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic, because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one prove (sic) that there is not a God. On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think I ought to say that I am an Atheist.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; For most of his adult life, Russell maintained religion to be little more than [[superstition]] and, despite any positive effects, largely harmful to people. He believed that religion and the religious outlook serve to impede knowledge and foster fear and dependency, and to be responsible for much of our world's wars, oppression, and misery. He was a member of the Advisory Council of the [[British Humanist Association]] and President of Cardiff Humanists until his death.&lt;ref&gt;'Humanist News', March 1970{{Nonspecific|date=January 2020|reason=Journal, title, author?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Society===

Political and social activism occupied much of Russell's time for most of his life. Russell remained politically active almost to the end of his life, writing to and exhorting world leaders and lending his name to various causes.

Russell argued for a &quot;scientific society&quot;, where war would be abolished, population growth would be limited, and prosperity would be shared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Impact of Science on Society|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/impactofscienceo0000russ|chapter-url-access=registration|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|chapter=Conclusions|year=1952|publisher=New York, Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested the establishment of a &quot;single supreme world government&quot; able to enforce peace,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Which Way to Peace? ''(Part 12)''|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|page=173|publisher=M. Joseph Ltd.|year=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that &quot;the only thing that will redeem mankind is co-operation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Society in Ethics and Politics|url=https://archive.org/details/humansocietyinet0000russ|url-access=registration|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|page=[https://archive.org/details/humansocietyinet0000russ/page/212 212]|publisher=London: G. Allen &amp; Unwin|year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell was an active supporter of the [[Homosexual Law Reform Society]], being one of the signatories of [[A. E. Dyson]]'s 1958 letter to ''The Times'' calling for a change in the law regarding male homosexual practices, which were partly legalised in 1967, when Russell was still alive.&lt;ref name=&quot;GALHA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Lesbian and Gay Rights: The Humanist and Religious Stances|url=http://www.galha.org/briefing/lgb_rights.html|author=Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association|date=2 November 1997|accessdate=17 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;Reflections on My Eightieth Birthday&quot; (&quot;Postscript&quot; in his ''Autobiography''), Russell wrote: &quot;I have lived in the pursuit of a vision, both personal and social. Personal: to care for what is noble, for what is beautiful, for what is gentle; to allow moments of insight to give wisdom at more mundane times. Social: to see in imagination the society that is to be created, where individuals grow freely, and where hate and greed and envy die because there is nothing to nourish them. These things I believe, and the world, for all its horrors, has left me unshaken&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell: 1944–1969|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|page=330|publisher=Little, Brown|year=1968}} Published separately as 'Reflections on My Eightieth Birthday' in ''Portraits from Memory''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of Opinion and Expression==

Like George Orwell, Russell was a champion of freedom of opinion and an opponent of both censorship and indoctrination. In 1928 he wrote: &quot;The fundamental argument for freedom of opinion is the doubtfulness of all our belief... when the State intervenes to ensure the indoctrination of some doctrine, it does so because there is no conclusive evidence in favour of that doctrine .. It is clear that thought is not free if the profession of certain opinions make it impossible to make a living.&lt;ref&gt;Skeptical Essays, 1928, {{ISBN|978-0415325080}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1957 he wrote: &quot;'Free thought' means thinking freely ... to be worthy of the name freethinker he must be free of two things: the force of tradition and the tyranny of his own passions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Understanding History and other Essays&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell was the author of more than sixty books and over two thousand articles.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Pigden in Bertrand Russell, ''Russell on Ethics: Selections from the Writings of Bertrand Russell'', Routledge (2013), p.&amp;nbsp;14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James C. Klagge, ''Wittgenstein: Biography and Philosophy'', Cambridge University Press (2001), p.&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he wrote many pamphlets, introductions, and letters to the editor. One pamphlet titled, '''I Appeal unto Caesar': The Case of the Conscientious Objectors'', ghostwritten for Margaret Hobhouse, the mother of imprisoned peace activist [[Stephen Hobhouse]], allegedly helped secure the release from prison of hundreds of [[conscientious objector]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hochschild |first=Adam |title=To end all wars: a story of loyalty and rebellion, 1914–1918 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780618758289/page/270 270–272] |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-618-75828-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780618758289/page/270 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His works can be found in anthologies and collections, including ''The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell'', which [[McMaster University]] began publishing in 1983. By March 2017 this collection of his shorter and previously unpublished works included 18 volumes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://russell.humanities.mcmaster.ca/brworks.htm |title=McMaster University: The Bertrand Russell Research Centre |website=Russell.humanities.mcmaster.ca |date=6 March 2017 |accessdate=11 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several more are in progress. A bibliography in three additional volumes catalogues his publications. The Russell Archives held by McMaster's [[William Ready Division of Archives and Research Collections]] possess over 40,000 of his letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bertrand Russell Archives Catalogue Entry and Research System|url=https://bracers.mcmaster.ca/|website=McMaster University Library|publisher=The William Ready Division of Archives and Research Collections|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
