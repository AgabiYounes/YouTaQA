      <text xml:space="preserve">Newsgroups are a form of mass mailing list.

Although there are many providers of access to newsgroups, one of the major and more well known sites is [[Google Groups]]

[[Google Groups]] is really easy to use, I've discovered--if you don't have a newsreader set up, it's a more than adequate substitute.

Groups we have posted to:
:soc.history.moderated
:soc.religion.christian.bible-study
:humanities.classics
:humanities.lit.authors.shakespeare
:sci.physics.relativity
:sci.stat.math
:sci.econ
:sci.anthropology

Here are a couple of direct Google links that may be of interest:
