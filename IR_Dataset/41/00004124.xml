The '''Bantu languages''' (English: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|n|t|uː}}, Proto-Bantu: *bantʊ̀) are a large family of languages spoken by the [[Bantu peoples]] throughout [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].

As part of the [[Bantoid languages|Bantoid]] group, they are part of the [[Benue–Congo]] language family, which in turn is part of the large [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]] phylum.

The total number of Bantu languages ranges in the hundreds, depending on the definition of [[Dialect#Dialect or language|&quot;language&quot; versus &quot;dialect&quot;]], and is estimated at between 440 and 680 distinct languages.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Guthrie (1967-71) names some 440 Bantu 'varieties', Grimes (2000) has 501 (minus a few 'extinct' or 'almost extinct', Bastin ''et al.'' (1999) have 542, Maho (this volume) has some 660, and Mann ''et al.'' (1987) have ''c.'' 680.&quot; Derek Nurse, 2006, &quot;Bantu Languages&quot;, in the ''Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics'', p. 2.
[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=73-16 Ethnologue report for Southern Bantoid] lists a total of 535 languages. The count includes 13 [[Mbam languages]] which are not always included under &quot;Narrow Bantu&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; For Bantuic, Linguasphere (Part 2, Transafrican phylosector, phylozone 99) has 260 outer languages (which are equivalent to languages, inner languages being dialects). McWhorter points out, using a comparison of 16 languages from Bangi-Moi, Bangi-Ntamba, Koyo-Mboshi, Likwala-Sangha, Ngondi-Ngiri, and Northern Mozambiqean, mostly from Guthrie Zone C, that many varieties are intercomprehensible.&lt;ref&gt;McWhorter, J. 2001. The Power of Babel (p. 81-82). Freeman-Times-Henry Holt, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

The total number of Bantu speakers is in the hundreds of millions, estimated around 350 million in the mid-2010s (roughly 30% of the total [[demographics of Africa|population of Africa]], or roughly 5% of [[world population]]).&lt;ref&gt;Total population cannot be established with any accuracy due to the unavailability of precise census data from Sub-Saharan Africa. A number just above 200 million was cited in the early 2000s (see [[:File:Niger-Congo speakers.png|Niger-Congo languages: subgroups and numbers of speakers]] for a 2007 compilation of data from [[SIL Ethnologue]], citing 210 million).  Population estimates for West-Central Africa were recognized as significantly too low by the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] in 2015 ({{cite web|url=https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2017_KeyFindings.pdf|title=World Population Prospects: The 2016 Revision – Key Findings and Advance Tables|date=July 2016|publisher=[[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]], Population Division|access-date=26 June 2017}}). [[Demographics of Africa#Population growth|Population growth]]
in Central-West Africa as of 2015 is estimated at between 2.5% and 2.8% p.a., for an annual increase of the Bantu population by about 8 to 10 million.&lt;/ref&gt;
Bantu languages are largely spoken  southeast of [[Cameroon]], throughout [[Central Africa]], [[Southeast Africa]] and [[Southern Africa]]. About one sixth of the Bantu speakers, and about one third of Bantu languages, are found in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] alone (c. 60 million speakers as of 2015).  See [[list of Bantu peoples]].

The Bantu language with the largest total number of speakers is [[Swahili language|Swahili]]; however, the majority of its speakers use it as a [[second language]] (L1: c. 16 million, L2: 80 million,  as of 2015).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ethnologue.com/language/swh Swahili], ''Ethnologue'' (18th ed., 2015): &quot;47,000,000 in Tanzania, all users. L1 users: 15,000,000 (2012), increasing. L2 users: 32,000,000 (2015 D. Nurse). Total users in all countries: 98,310,110 (as L1: 16,010,110; as L2: 82,300,000).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major Bantu languages include [[Zulu language|Zulu]], with 27 million speakers (15.7 million L2), and [[Shona language|Shona]], with about 11 million speakers (if [[Manyika dialect|Manyika]] and [[Ndau dialect|Ndau]] are included).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/zul|title=Ethnologue: Zulu|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/sna|title=Ethnologue: Shona|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethnologue]] separates the largely mutually intelligible [[Kinyarwanda]] and [[Kirundi]], which, if grouped together, have 20 million speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=size |title=Statistical Summaries |publisher=Ethnologue |date= |accessdate=2012-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
{{see|Bantu peoples#Name}}
The similarity between dispersed Bantu languages had been observed as early as in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;R. Blench, ''Archaeology, Language, and the African Past'' (2006), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=esFy3Po57A8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA119#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 119].&lt;/ref&gt;
The term &quot;Bantu&quot; as a name or the group was coined (as ''Bâ-ntu'') by [[Wilhelm Bleek]] in 1857 or 1858, and popularised in his ''Comparative Grammar'' of 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond O.  Silverstein, &quot;A note on the term 'Bantu' as first used by W. H. I. Bleek&quot;, ''African Studies'' 27 (1968), 211–212, [https://www.doi.org/10.1080/00020186808707298 doi:10.1080/00020186808707298].&lt;/ref&gt;
The name was coined to represent the word for &quot;people&quot; in loosely reconstructed [[Proto-Bantu]], from the plural 
[[noun class]] prefix ''[[:wikt:Appendix:Swahili noun classes#M-wa class|*ba-]]'' categorizing &quot;people&quot;, and the [[root (linguistics)|root]] ''*ntʊ̀ -'' &quot;some (entity), any&quot; (e.g. Zulu ''umuntu'' &quot;person&quot;, ''abantu'' &quot;people&quot;).
There is no native term for the group, as Bantu-speaking populations refer to themselves by their [[endonyms]] but did not have a concept for the larger ethno-linguistic phylum. Bleek's coinage was inspired by the anthropological observation of groups self-identifying as &quot;people&quot; or &quot;the true people&quot; (as is indeed the case, for example, with the term ''[[Khoekhoe]]'', which is really a ''kare'' &quot;praise address&quot; and not an ethnic name.).&lt;ref&gt;
R.K.Herbert and R. Bailey in Rajend Mesthrie (ed.), ''Language in South Africa'' (2002), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cqaGb_SEQHUC&amp;pg=PA50 p. 50].&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;narrow Bantu&quot;, excluding those languages classified as [[Bantoid]] by Guthrie (1948), was introduced in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in African Linguistics: Supplement, Issues 3-4, Department of Linguistics and the African Studies Center, University of California, Los Angeles (1969), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prefix ''ba-'' specifically refers to people. Endonymically, the term for cultural objects, including language, is formed with the [[:wikt:Appendix:Swahili noun classes#Ki-vi class|''ki-'' noun class]] (Nguni ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Nguni/ísi-|ísi-]]''), as in ''Kiswahili '' &quot;coast language and culture&quot; and ''isiZulu'' &quot;Zulu language and culture&quot;.

There was a suggestion in South Africa to refer to these languages as &quot;KiNtu&quot; in the 1980s. However, the word ''kintu'' exists in some places,  meaning &quot;thing&quot; with no relation to the concept of &quot;language&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Wantate Sempebwa ,''The Ontological and Normative Structure in the Social Reality of a Bantu Society: A Systematic Study of Ganda Ontology and Ethics'', 1978, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; it was also reported by  delegates at the African Languages Association of Southern Africa conference in 1984 that in some places, the term 'Kintu' has a derogatory significance,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02572117.1984.10587452 Addendum:    ALASA conference of 1984 doi:10.1080/02572117.1984.10587452]&lt;/ref&gt; that is, ''kintu'' refers to &quot;things&quot; and is used as a dehumanizing term of people who have lost their dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Molefi Kete Asante, Ama Mazama, ''Encyclopedia of African Religion'' (2009), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=B667ATiedQkC&amp;pg=PT173 p. 173].&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, ''[[Kintu]]'' is a figure in some mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;David William Cohen, ''The historical tradition of Busoga, Mukama and Kintu'' (1972). Joseph B. R. Gaie, Sana Mmolai, ''The Concept of Botho and HIV/AIDS in Botswana'' (2007), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ieiT9tZMqBgC&amp;pg=PA2  p. 2].&lt;/ref&gt;
The term &quot;Kintu&quot; apparently still saw occasional use in the 1990s in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;as in  Noverino N. Canonici, ''A Manual of Comparative Kintu Studies'', Zulu Language and Literature, University of Natal (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary decolonial South African linguistics, the term &quot;Ntu languages&quot; is used.{{cn|date=February 2020}}

==Origin==
The Bantu languages descend from a common [[Proto-Bantu language]], which is believed to have been spoken in what is now [[Cameroon]] in [[Central Africa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Adler&quot;&gt;Philip J. Adler, Randall L. Pouwels, ''World Civilizations: To 1700 Volume 1 of World Civilizations'', (Cengage Learning: 2007), p.169.&lt;/ref&gt; 
An estimated 2,500–3,000 years ago (1000 BC to 500 BC), although other sources put the start of the Bantu Expansion closer to 3000 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Gemma Berniell-Lee et al [http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/7/1581.abstract Genetic and Demographic Implications of the Bantu Expansion: Insights from Human Paternal Lineages.] Oxfordjournals.com&lt;/ref&gt; speakers of the Proto-Bantu language began a series of migrations eastward and southward, carrying agriculture with them. This [[Bantu expansion]] came to dominate Sub-Saharan Africa east of Cameroon, an area where [[Bantu peoples]] now constitute nearly the entire population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adler&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Falola&quot;&gt;Toyin Falola, Aribidesi Adisa Usman, ''Movements, borders, and identities in Africa'', (University Rochester Press: 2009), p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The technical term Bantu, meaning &quot;human beings&quot; or simply &quot;people&quot;, was first used by [[Wilhelm Bleek]] (1827–1875), as this is reflected in many of the languages of this group. A common characteristic of Bantu languages is that they use words such as ''muntu'' or ''mutu'' for &quot;human being&quot; or in simplistic terms &quot;person&quot;, and the plural prefix for human nouns starting with ''mu-'' (class 1) in most languages is ''ba-'' (class 2), thus giving ''bantu'' for &quot;people&quot;. Bleek, and later [[Carl Meinhof]], pursued extensive studies comparing the grammatical structures of Bantu languages.

==Classification==
{{main|Guthrie classification of Bantu languages}}
[[File:Bantu zones.png|thumb|upright=1.59|The approximate locations of the [[Guthrie classification of Bantu languages|sixteen Guthrie Bantu zones]], including the addition of a [[Great Lakes Bantu languages|zone J around the Great Lakes]]. The [[Jarawan languages]] are spoken in Nigeria.]]

The most widely used classification is an alphanumeric coding system developed by [[Malcolm Guthrie]] in his 1948 classification of the Bantu languages. It is mainly geographic. The term 'narrow Bantu' was coined by the ''Benue–Congo Working Group'' to distinguish Bantu as recognized by Guthrie, from the [[Bantoid languages]] not recognized as Bantu by Guthrie.{{citation needed||date=July 2017}}

In recent times,{{when|date=July 2017}} the distinctiveness of Narrow Bantu as opposed to the other [[Southern Bantoid languages]] has been called into doubt (cf. Piron 1995, Williamson &amp; Blench 2000, Blench 2011), but the term is still widely used. 
A coherent classification of Narrow Bantu will likely need to exclude many of the Zone A and perhaps Zone B languages.{{speculation inline|date=July 2017}}

There is no true genealogical classification of the (Narrow) Bantu languages. Until recently{{when|date=July 2017}} most attempted classifications only considered languages that happen to fall within traditional Narrow Bantu, but there seems to be a continuum with the related languages of South Bantoid.{{citation needed||date=July 2017}}

At a broader level, the family is commonly split in two depending on the reflexes of proto-Bantu tone patterns:  Many Bantuists group together parts of zones A through D (the extent depending on the author) as ''Northwest Bantu'' or ''Forest Bantu'', and the remainder as ''Central Bantu'' or ''Savanna Bantu''. The two groups have been described as having mirror-image tone systems: where Northwest Bantu has a high tone in a cognate, Central Bantu languages generally have a low tone, and vice versa.

Northwest Bantu is more divergent internally than Central Bantu, and perhaps less [[conservative (language)|conservative]] due to contact with non-Bantu Niger–Congo languages; Central Bantu is likely the innovative line cladistically. Northwest Bantu is clearly not a coherent family, but even for Central Bantu the evidence is lexical, with little evidence that it is a historically valid group.

Another attempt at a detailed genetic classification to replace the Guthrie system is the 1999 &quot;Tervuren&quot; proposal of Bastin, Coupez, and Mann.&lt;ref&gt;The Guthrie, Tervuren, and SIL lists are compared side by side in [https://web.archive.org/web/20090325021837/http://www.african.gu.se/maho/downloads/bantulineup.pdf Maho 2002].&lt;/ref&gt; However, it relies on [[lexicostatistics]], which, because of its reliance on overall similarity rather than [[synapomorphy|shared innovations]], may predict spurious groups of [[polyphyly|conservative languages that are not closely related]]. Meanwhile, ''[[Ethnologue]]'' has added languages to the Guthrie classification which Guthrie overlooked, while removing the [[Mbam languages]] (much of zone A), and shifting some languages between groups (much of zones D and E to a new zone J, for example, and part of zone L to K, and part of M to F) in an apparent effort at a semi-genetic, or at least semi-areal, classification. This has been criticized for sowing confusion in one of the few unambiguous ways to distinguish Bantu languages. Nurse &amp; Philippson (2006) evaluate many proposals for low-level groups of Bantu languages, but the result is not a complete portrayal of the family.{{citation needed||date=July 2017}} ''[[Glottolog]]'' has incorporated many of these into their classification.&lt;ref name=Glottolog/&gt;

The languages that share [[Dahl's law]] may also form a valid group, [[Northeast Bantu languages|Northeast Bantu]]. The infobox at right lists these together with various low-level groups that are fairly uncontroversial, though they continue to be revised. The development of a rigorous genealogical classification of many branches of Niger–Congo, not just Bantu, is hampered by insufficient data.{{citation needed||date=July 2017}}

==Language structure==
Guthrie reconstructed both the phonemic inventory and the vocabulary of Proto-Bantu.{{citation needed||date=July 2017}}

The most prominent [[Grammar|grammatical]] characteristic of Bantu languages is the extensive use of [[affix]]es (see [[Sotho grammar]] and [[Luganda#Noun classes|Ganda noun classes]] for detailed discussions of these affixes). Each noun belongs to a [[noun class|class]], and each language may have several numbered classes, somewhat like [[grammatical gender]] in European languages. The class is indicated by a prefix that is part of the noun, as well as agreement markers on verb and qualificative roots connected with the noun. Plural is indicated by a change of class, with a resulting change of prefix.{{citation needed||date=July 2017}}

The verb has a number of prefixes, though in the western languages these are often treated as independent words.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Nurse, 2008. ''Tense and aspect in Bantu'', p 70 (fn). In many of the Zone A, including [[Mbam languages|Mbam]], the verbs are clearly analytic.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Swahili language|Swahili]], for example, ''Kitoto kidogo kimekisoma'' (for comparison, ''Kamwana kadoko karikuverenga'' in [[Shona language]]) means 'The small child has read it [a book]'. ''Kitoto'' 'child' governs the adjective prefix ''ki-''('ki' being a prefix representing the diminutive form of the word) and the verb subject prefix ''a-''. Then comes perfect tense ''-me-'' and an object marker ''-ki-'' agreeing with implicit ''kitabu'' 'book' (from Arabic ''kitab''). Pluralizing to 'children' gives ''Vitoto vidogo vimekisoma'' (''Vana vadoko varikuverenga'' in Shona), and [[plural]]izing to 'books' (''vitabu'') gives ''Watoto wadogo wamevisoma''.{{citation needed||date=July 2017}}

Bantu words are typically made up of [[Syllable#Coda|open syllable]]s of the type CV (consonant-vowel) with most languages having syllables exclusively of this type. The [[Bushong language]] recorded by [[Jan Vansina|Vansina]], however, has final consonants,&lt;ref&gt;Vansina, J. ''Esquisse de Grammaire Bushong''. Commission de Linguistique Africaine, Tervuren, Belgique, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; while slurring of the final syllable (though written) is reported as common among the [[Tonga (Nyasa) language|Tonga]] of Malawi.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Rev. Wm. Y., ''Tumbuka–Tonga$1–$2 $3ictionEnglish Dictionary''  Hetherwick Press, Blantyre, Malawi 1952. pages i–ii.&lt;/ref&gt; The morphological shape of Bantu words is typically CV, VCV, CVCV, VCVCV, etc.; that is, any combination of CV (with possibly a V- syllable at the start). In other words, a strong claim for this language family is that almost all words end in a vowel, precisely because closed syllables (CVC) are not permissible in most of the documented languages, as far as is understood.{{citation needed||date=July 2017}}

This tendency to avoid [[consonant cluster]]s in some positions is important when words are imported from [[English language|English]] or other non-Bantu languages. An example from [[Chewa language|Chewa]]: the word &quot;school&quot;, borrowed from English, and then transformed to fit the sound patterns of this language, is ''sukulu''. That is, ''sk-'' has been broken up by inserting an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] ''-u-''; ''-u'' has also been added at the end of the word. Another example is ''buledi'' for &quot;bread&quot;. Similar effects are seen in [[loanword]]s for other non-African CV languages like [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. However, a clustering of sounds at the beginning of a syllable can be readily observed in such languages as Shona,&lt;ref&gt;Doke, Clement M., ''A Comparative Study in Shona Phonetics'' University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Makua languages]].&lt;ref&gt;''Relatório do I Seminário sobre a Padronização da Ortografia de Línguas Moçambicanas''  NELIMO, Universidade Eduardo Mondlane. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

With few exceptions, notably [[Swahili language|Swahili]], Bantu languages are [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal]] and have two to four register tones.

===Reduplication===
[[Reduplication]] is a common morphological phenomenon in Bantu languages and is usually used to indicate frequency or intensity of the action signalled by the (unreduplicated) verb stem.&lt;ref&gt;Abdulaziz Lodhi, &quot;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090325021837/http://www.african.gu.se/aa/pdfs/aa02004.pdf Verbal extensions in Bantu (the case of Swahili and Nyamwezi)]&quot;. ''Africa &amp; Asia,'' 2002, 2:4–26, Göteborg University&lt;/ref&gt;

*Example: in Swahili ''piga'' means &quot;strike&quot;, ''pigapiga'' means &quot;strike repeatedly&quot;.

Well-known words and names that have reduplication include
*[[South Africa national football team|Bafana Bafana]], a football team
*[[Zambia national football team|Chipolopolo]], a football team
*[[Eric Djemba-Djemba]], a footballer
*[[Lomana LuaLua]], a footballer
*[[Ngorongoro Conservation Area|Ngorongoro]], a conservation area
Repetition emphasizes the repeated word in the context that it is used. For instance, &quot;Mwenda pole hajikwai,&quot; while, &quot;Pole pole ndio mwendo,&quot; has two to emphasize the consistency of slowness of the pace. The meaning of the former in translation is, &quot;He who goes slowly doesn't trip,&quot; and that of the latter is, &quot;A slow but steady pace wins the race.&quot; Haraka haraka would mean hurrying just for the sake of hurrying, reckless hurry, as in &quot;Njoo! Haraka haraka&quot; [come here! Hurry, hurry].

In contrast, there are some words in some of the languages in which reduplication has the opposite meaning. It usually denotes short durations, and or lower intensity of the action and also means a few repetitions or a little bit more.

==By country==
{{see|List of Bantu peoples}}
Following is an incomplete list of the principal Bantu languages of each country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.org |title=According to Ethnologue |publisher=Ethnologue.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-29|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; Included are those languages that constitute at least 1% of the population and have at least 10% the number of speakers of the largest Bantu language in the country.
An attempt at a full list of Bantu languages (with various conflations and a puzzlingly diverse nomenclature) can be found in ''The Bantu Languages of Africa'', 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, M.A.(compiled by), ''The Bantu Languages of Africa''. Published for the International African Institute, Oxford University Press, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most languages are best known in English without the class prefix (''Swahili'', ''Tswana'', ''Ndebele''), but are sometimes seen with the (language-specific) prefix (''Kiswahili'', ''Setswana'', ''Sindebele''). In a few cases prefixes are used to distinguish languages with the same root in their name, such as [[Luba-Kasai language|Tshiluba]] and [[Luba-Katanga language|Kiluba]] (both ''Luba''), [[Umbundu]] and [[Kimbundu]] (both ''Mbundu''). The bare (prefixless) form typically does not occur in the language itself, but is the basis for other words based on the ethnicity. So, in the country of [[Botswana]] the people are the ''[[Tswana people|Batswana]]'', one person is a ''Motswana'', and the language is ''[[Setswana]]''; and in [[Uganda]], centred on the kingdom of ''[[Buganda]]'', the dominant ethnicity are the ''[[Baganda]]'' (sg. ''Muganda''), whose language is ''[[Luganda]]''.

==Bantu words popularised in western cultures==
A case has been made out for borrowings of many place-names and even misremembered rhymes – chiefly from one of the [[Luban languages|Luba]] varieties – in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vass|first1=Winifred Kellersberger|title=The Bantu Speaking Heritage of the United States|date=1979|publisher=Center for Afro-American Studies, University of California|page=73|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Sbp1AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Here+we|accessdate=7 September 2014|quote=&quot;“Here we go looby-loo; here we go looby-la (or looby-light) / Here we go looby-loo; all on a Saturday night!” Both of these Luba words, ''lubilu'' (quickly, in a hurry), and ''lubila'' (a shout) are words still in common usage in the Republic of Zaïre.&quot;|isbn=9780934934015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some words from various Bantu languages have been borrowed into western languages. These include: 
&lt;!-- The words Agogo, Askari, Banjo, Duppy and Zombie derive from WEST AFRICAN LANGUAGES and hence are non-Bantu --&gt;

==Writing systems==
Along with the [[Latin script]] and [[Arabic script]] orthographies, there are also some modern indigenous writing systems used for Bantu languages:
*The [[Mwangwego alphabet]] is an [[abugida]] that is used to write the [[Chewa language]] and other languages of [[Malawi]].
*The [[Mandombe script]] is an [[abugida]] that is used to write the Bantu [[languages of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]], mainly by the [[Kimbanguist]] movement.
*The Isibheqe Sohlamvu or [[Ditema tsa Dinoko]] script is a [[Featural writing system|featural]] syllabary used to write the siNtu or [[Southern Bantu languages]].
