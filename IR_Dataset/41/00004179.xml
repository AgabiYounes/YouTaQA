'''[[British English|British English]]''' is the [[standard dialect]] of the [[English language]] as spoken and written in the [[United Kingdom]].{{refn|The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' applies the term to English as &quot;spoken or written in the [[British Isles]]; esp[ecially] the forms of English usual in [[Great Britain]]&quot;, reserving &quot;[[Hiberno-English]]&quot; for the &quot;English language as spoken and written in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordenglishdic0015unse|url-access=registration|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|year=1989|edition=2|chapter=British English; Hiberno-English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as the ''Cambridge Academic Content Dictionary'', define it as the &quot;[[English language in England|English language as it is spoken and written in England]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge Academic Content Dictionary&quot;&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/american-english/british-english?q=British+English ''British English''], Cambridge Academic Content Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;}} Variations exist in formal, written English in the United Kingdom. For example, the adjective ''wee'' is almost exclusively used in parts of [[Scotland]], [[North East England]], [[Ireland]], and occasionally [[Yorkshire dialect|Yorkshire]], whereas ''little'' is predominant elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in written English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term ''British English''. The forms of [[Spoken language|spoken]] English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Stuart |last=Jeffries|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/mar/27/regional-english-dialects|title=The G2 Guide to Regional English|journal=[[The Guardian]]|date=27 March 2009|at=section G2, p.&amp;nbsp;12}}&lt;/ref&gt; so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language. According to Tom McArthur in the ''Oxford Guide to World English'', British English shares &quot;all the ambiguities and tensions in the word '[[British people|British]]' and as a result can be used and interpreted in two ways, more broadly or more narrowly, within a range of blurring and ambiguity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;McArthur (2002), p.&amp;nbsp;45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Colloquial portmanteau words for British English include: ''Bringlish'' (recorded from 1967), ''Britglish'' (1973), ''Britlish'' (1976), ''Brenglish'' (1993) and ''Brilish'' (2011).&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, James. 2018.

== History==
{{Main|History of the English language}}
[[English language|English]] is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] that originated from the [[Anglo-Frisian]] [[dialect]]s brought to Britain by [[Germanic tribes|Germanic settlers]] from various parts of what is now northwest [[Germany]] and the northern [[Netherlands]]. The resident population at this time was generally speaking [[Common Brittonic]]—the insular variety of [[continental Celtic]], which was influenced by the [[Roman army|Roman]] occupation. This group of languages ([[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Cumbric]]) cohabited alongside [[English language|English]] into the modern period, but due to their remoteness from the [[Germanic languages]], influence on English was [[Lists of English words of Celtic origin|notably limited]]. However, the degree of influence remains debated, and it has recently been argued that its grammatical influence accounts for the substantial innovations noted between English and the other West Germanic languages.&lt;ref&gt;[[English and Welsh]], 1955 J. R. R. Tolkien, also see references in [[Brittonicisms in English]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, [[Old English]] was a diverse group of dialects, reflecting the varied origins of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] Kingdoms of England. One of these dialects, [[Late West Saxon]], eventually came to dominate. The original [[Old English language]] was then influenced by two waves of invasion: the first was by speakers of the Scandinavian branch of the Germanic family, who conquered and colonised parts of Britain in the 8th and 9th centuries; the second was the [[Normans]] in the 11th century, who spoke [[Old Norman]] and ultimately developed an English variety of this called [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]. These two invasions caused English to become &quot;mixed&quot; to some degree (though it was never a truly [[mixed language]] in the strictest sense of the word; mixed languages arise from the cohabitation of speakers of different languages, who develop a hybrid tongue for basic communication).

The more idiomatic, concrete and descriptive English is, the more it is from Anglo-Saxon origins. The more intellectual and abstract English is, the more it contains [[Latin]] and [[French language|French]] influences e.g. swine (like the Germanic schwein) is the animal in the field bred by the occupied Anglo-Saxons and pork (like the French porc) is the animal at the table eaten by the occupying Normans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pandora.cii.wwu.edu/vajda/ling201/test3materials/HistEngoverhead.htm|title=Linguistics 201: History of English|website=pandora.cii.wwu.edu|access-date=29 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018113704/http://pandora.cii.wwu.edu/vajda/ling201/test3materials/HistEngoverhead.htm|archive-date=18 October 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohabitation with the Scandinavians resulted in a significant grammatical simplification and lexical enrichment of the [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]] core of English; the later Norman occupation led to the grafting onto that Germanic core of a more elaborate layer of words from the Romance branch of the European languages. This Norman influence entered English largely through the courts and government. Thus, English developed into a [[loanword|&quot;borrowing&quot; language]] of great flexibility and with a huge [[vocabulary]].

==Dialects==
{{IPA notice|lang=en}}[[List of dialects of the English language#Europe|Dialects]] and [[Regional accents of English|accents]] vary amongst the four [[countries of the United Kingdom]], as well as within the countries themselves.

The major divisions are normally classified as [[English language in England|English English]] (or English as spoken in [[England]], which encompasses [[Southern English English|Southern English]] dialects, [[West Country English|West Country]] dialects, [[East Midlands English|East]] and [[West Midlands English]] dialects and [[English in northern England|Northern English]] dialects), [[Ulster English]] in [[Northern Ireland]], [[Welsh English]] (not to be confused with the [[Welsh language]]), and [[Scottish English]] (not to be confused with the [[Scots language]] or [[Scottish Gaelic|Scottish Gaelic language]]). The various British dialects also differ in the words that they have borrowed from other languages. Around the middle of the 15th century, there were points where within the 5 major dialects there were almost 500 ways to spell the word ''though''.&lt;ref name=&quot;thehistoryofenglish.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofenglish.com/history_early_modern.html|title=The History of English - Early Modern English (c. 1500 - c. 1800)|website=www.thehistoryofenglish.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following its last major [[survey of English Dialects]] (1949–1950), the [[University of Leeds]] has started work on a new project. In May 2007 the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] awarded a grant to Leeds to study British regional dialects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050313183453/http://www.personal.leeds.ac.uk/~smlsaj/ Professor Sally Johnson] biography on the [[Leeds University]] website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MEO&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061003092355/http://reporter.leeds.ac.uk/press_releases/current/voices.htm Mapping the English language—from cockney to Orkney], [[Leeds University]] website, 25 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The team are{{efn|name=note}} sifting through a large collection of examples of regional slang words and phrases turned up by the &quot;Voices project&quot; run by the [[BBC]], in which they invited the public to send in examples of English still spoken throughout the country. The BBC Voices project also collected hundreds of news articles about how the British speak English from swearing through to items on language schools. This information will also be collated and analysed by Johnson's team both for content and for where it was reported. &quot;Perhaps the most remarkable finding in the Voices study is that the English language is as diverse as ever, despite our increased mobility and constant exposure to other accents and dialects through TV and radio&quot;.&lt;ref name=MEO/&gt; When discussing the award of the grant in 2007, Leeds University stated:
{{quote|that they were &quot;very pleased&quot;—and indeed, &quot;well chuffed&quot;—at receiving their generous grant. He could, of course, have been &quot;bostin&quot; if he had come from the [[Black Country]], or if he was a [[Scouser]] he would have been well &quot;made up&quot; over so many spondoolicks, because as a [[Geordie]] might say, £460,000 is a &quot;canny load of chink&quot;.&lt;ref name=Indi-20070601&gt;McSmith, Andy. ''Dialect researchers given a &quot;canny load of chink&quot; to sort &quot;pikeys&quot; from &quot;chavs&quot; in regional accents'', [[The Independent]], 1 June 2007. Page 20&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Regional===
Most people in Britain speak with a regional accent or dialect. However, about 2% of Britons speak with an accent called [[Received Pronunciation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/sounds/case-studies/received-pronunciation/|title=Received Pronunciation|publisher=|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also called &quot;the Queen's English&quot;, &quot;Oxford English&quot;  and &quot;[[BBC]] English&quot;&lt;ref&gt;BBC English because this was originally the form of English used on radio and television, although a wider variety of accents can be heard these days.&lt;/ref&gt;), that is essentially region-less.&lt;ref name=sweet&gt;{{cite book |last=Sweet |first=Henry |title=The Sounds of English |work= |page=[https://archive.org/details/soundsenglishan00sweegoog/page/n11 7] |url=https://archive.org/details/soundsenglishan00sweegoog  |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1908 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fowler&gt;{{cite news |last=Fowler |first=H.W. |editor=R.W. Birchfield |title=Fowler's Modern English Usage |work= |pages= |language= |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1996 |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from a mixture of the Midlands and Southern dialects spoken in London in the early modern period.&lt;ref name=fowler/&gt; It is frequently used as a model for teaching English to foreign learners.&lt;ref name=fowler/&gt;

In the South East there are significantly different accents; the [[Cockney]] accent spoken by some East Londoners is strikingly different from Received Pronunciation (RP). The Cockney [[rhyming slang]] can be (and was initially intended to be) difficult for outsiders to understand,&lt;ref name=&quot;Franklyn1975&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Franklyn|first=Julian|title=A dictionary of rhyming slang|year=1975|publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul|location=London|isbn=0-415-04602-5|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the extent of its use is often somewhat exaggerated.

[[Estuary English]] has been gaining prominence in recent decades: it has some features of RP and some of Cockney. In London itself, the broad local accent is still changing, partly influenced by Caribbean speech. Immigrants to the UK in recent decades have brought many more languages to the country. Surveys started in 1979 by the [[Inner London Education Authority]] discovered over 100 languages being spoken domestically by the families of the inner city's schoolchildren. As a result, [[London]]ers speak with a mixture of accents, depending on ethnicity, neighbourhood, class, age, upbringing, and sundry other factors.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Since the mass internal [[immigration]] to [[Northamptonshire]] in the 1940s and its position between several major accent regions, it has become a source of various accent developments. In Northampton the older accent has been influenced by overspill Londoners. There is an accent known locally as the [[Kettering]] accent, which is a transitional accent between the [[East Midlands]] and [[East Anglia]]n. It is the last southern Midlands accent to use the broad &quot;a&quot; in words like ''bath''/''grass'' (i.e. barth/grarss). Conversely ''crass''/''plastic'' use a slender &quot;a&quot;. A few miles northwest in Leicestershire the slender &quot;a&quot; becomes more widespread generally. In the town of [[Corby]], {{convert|5|mi|km|0|spell=in}} north, one can find Corbyite, which unlike the Kettering accent, is largely influenced by the West Scottish accent.

In addition, many British people can to some degree temporarily &quot;swing&quot; their accent towards a more neutral form of English at will, to reduce difficulty where very different accents are involved, or when speaking to foreigners.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

=== Ethnicity===
{{Main|Multicultural London English}}
{{Section empty|date=July 2018}}

== Features==
Phonological features characteristic of British English revolve around the pronunciation of the letter R, as well as the dental plosive T and some diphthongs specific to this dialect.

=== Glottal stop===
In a number of forms of spoken British English, it is common for the phoneme {{IPA|/t/}} to be realised as a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[ʔ]}} when it is in the intervocalic position, in a process called [[T-glottalisation]]. Once regarded as a Cockney feature, it has become much more widespread. It is still stigmatised when used in words like ''later'', but becoming very widespread at the end of words such as ''not'' (as in no{{IPA|[ʔ]}} interested).&lt;ref name=&quot;Trudghill56&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Trudgill|first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Trudgill|title=Language in the British Isles|year=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0-521-28409-0|pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other consonants subject to this usage in Cockney English are ''p'', as in pa{{IPA|[ʔ]}}er and ''k'' as in ba{{IPA|[ʔ]}}er.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trudghill56&quot; /&gt;

=== R-dropping===
In most areas of Britain outside [[Scottish English|Scotland and Northern Ireland]], the consonant R is not pronounced if not followed by a vowel, lengthening the preceding vowel instead. This phenomenon is known as [[Rhoticity in English|non-rhoticity]].
In these same areas, a tendency exists to insert an R between a word ending in a vowel and a next word beginning with a vowel. This is called the [[intrusive R]]. This could be understood as a merger, in that words that once ended in an R and words that did not are no longer treated differently.

=== Diphthongisation===
British dialects differ on the extent of diphthongisation of long vowels, with southern varieties extensively turning them into diphthongs, and with northern dialects normally preserving many of them. As a comparison, North American varieties could be said to be in-between.

==== In the south==== 
Long vowels /iː/ and /uː/ are diphthongised to [ɪi] and [ʊu] respectively (or, more technically, [ʏʉ], with a raised tongue), so that '''ee''' and '''oo''' in '''feed''' and '''food''' are pronounced with a movement. The diphthong [oʊ] is also pronounced with a greater movement, normally [əʊ], [əʉ] or [əɨ].

==== In the north====
Long vowels /iː/ and /uː/ are usually preserved, and in several areas also /oː/ and /eː/, as in '''go''' and '''say''' (unlike other varieties of English, that change them to [oʊ] and [eɪ] respectively). Some areas go as far as not diphthongising medieval /iː/ and /uː/, that give rise to modern /aɪ/ and /aʊ/; that is, for example, in the traditional accent of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], 'out' will sound as 'oot', and in parts of [[Scotland]] and North-West England, 'my' will be pronounced as 'me'.

=== Loss of grammatical number in collective nouns===
A tendency to drop the morphological [[grammatical number]] in [[collective noun]]s is stronger in British English than in North American English.&lt;ref name=BOD&gt;[http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2011/09/agreement-over-collective-nouns/], [[Oxford dictionary]] website, 02 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; This is to treat them, once grammatically singular, as plural, that is: the perceived natural number prevails. This applies especially to nouns of institutions and groups made of many people.

The noun 'police', for example, undergoes this treatment:

{{quote|'''Police are''' investigating the theft of work tools worth £500 from a van at the Sprucefield park and ride car park in Lisburn.&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-38547391], [[BBC]], 8 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A football team can be treated likewise:

{{quote|Arsenal '''have''' lost just one of 20 home Premier League matches against Manchester City.&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/39396482], [[BBC]], 2 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This tendency can be observed in texts produced already in the 19th century. For example, [[Jane Austen]], a British author, writes in Chapter 4 of [[Pride and Prejudice]], published in 1813:&lt;blockquote&gt;All '''the world are''' good and agreeable in your eyes. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1342/1342-h/1342-h.htm|title=Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen|website=www.gutenberg.org|access-date=2020-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, in Chapter 16, the grammatical number is used. &lt;blockquote&gt;'''The world is''' blinded by his fortune and consequence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Negative concord===
Some dialects of British English use negative concords, also known as [[double negatives]]. Rather than changing a word or using a positive, words like nobody, not, nothing, and never would be used in the same sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/grammar/british-grammar/types-of-english-formal-informal-etc/double-negatives-and-usage|title=Double negatives and usage - English Grammar Today - Cambridge Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While this does not occur in Standard English, it does occur in non-standard dialects. The double negation follows the idea of two different morphemes, one that causes the double negation, and one that is used for the point or the verb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Susagna |last=Tubau |title=Lexical variation and Negative Concord in Traditional Dialects of British English |journal=The Journal of Comparative Germanic Linguistics |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=143–177 |doi=10.1007/s10828-016-9079-4|year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standardisation==
As with English around the world, the English language as used in the [[United Kingdom]] is governed by convention rather than formal code: there is no body equivalent to the [[Académie française]] or the [[Real Academia Española]]. Dictionaries (for example, [[Oxford English Dictionary]], [[Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English]], [[Chambers Dictionary]], [[Collins Dictionary]]) record usage rather than attempting to prescribe it.&lt;ref name=&quot;courses.nus.edu.sg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://courses.nus.edu.sg/course/elltankw/history/standardisation/c.htm|title=The Standardisation of English|website=courses.nus.edu.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, vocabulary and usage change with time: words are freely borrowed from other languages and other strains of English, and [[neologisms]] are frequent.

For historical reasons dating back to the rise of [[London]] in the 9th century, the form of language spoken in London and the [[East Midlands]] became standard English within the Court, and ultimately became the basis for generally accepted use in the law, government, literature and education in Britain. The standardisation of British English is thought to be from both [[Dialect levelling in Britain|dialect leveling]] and a thought of social superiority. Speaking in the Standard dialect created class distinctions; those who did not speak the standard English would be considered of a lesser class or social status and often discounted or considered of a low intelligence.&lt;ref name=&quot;courses.nus.edu.sg&quot;/&gt;  Another contribution to the standardisation of British English was the introduction of the printing press to England in the mid-15th century. In doing so, William Caxton enabled a common language and spelling to be dispersed among the entirety of England at a much faster rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;thehistoryofenglish.com&quot;/&gt;

[[Samuel Johnson's A Dictionary of the English Language]] (1755) was a large step in the [[English-language spelling reform]], where the purification of language focused on standardising both speech and spelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~kemmer/Histengl/spelling.html|title=The History of English: Spelling and Standardization (Suzanne Kemmer)|website=www.ruf.rice.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 20th century, British authors had produced numerous books intended as guides to English grammar and usage, a few of which achieved sufficient acclaim to have remained in print for long periods and to have been reissued in new editions after some decades. These include, most notably of all, Fowler's [[Modern English Usage]] and [[The Complete Plain Words]] by [[Sir Ernest Gowers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/new-edition-of-the-complete-plain-words-will-delight-fans-of-no-frills-prose-but-can-breaking-the-9219926.html|title=New edition of The Complete Plain Words will delight fans of no-frills|date=27 March 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detailed guidance on many aspects of writing British English for publication is included in style guides issued by various publishers including [[The Times]] newspaper, the [[Oxford University Press]] and the [[Cambridge University Press]]. The Oxford University Press guidelines were originally drafted as a single broadsheet page by Horace Henry Hart, and were at the time (1893) the first guide of their type in English; they were gradually expanded and eventually published, first as [[Hart's Rules]], and in 2002 as part of ''The Oxford Manual of Style''. Comparable in authority and stature to [[The Chicago Manual of Style]] for published [[American English]], the Oxford Manual is a fairly exhaustive standard for published British English that writers can turn to in the absence of specific guidance from their publishing house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ox.ac.uk/sites/files/oxford/media_wysiwyg/University%20of%20Oxford%20Style%20Guide.pdf |work=[[University of Oxford]] |title=Style Guide |accessdate=14 Jun 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
