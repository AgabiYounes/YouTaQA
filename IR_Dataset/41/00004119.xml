'''Bock''' is a [[Pale lager#Strong lager|strong lager]] of German origin. Several substyles exist, including '''maibock''' ('''helles bock''', '''heller bock'''), a paler, more hopped version generally made for consumption at spring festivals; '''doppelbock''' ('''double bock'''), a stronger and maltier version; and '''eisbock''', a much stronger version made by partially freezing the beer and removing the ice that forms.

Originally a dark beer, a modern bock can range from light copper to brown in colour.&lt;ref name=DBB&gt;{{Cite book | title = Bockbier - starker Genuss mit langer Tradition | publisher = Deutscher Brauer-Bund | year = 2011 | url = http://www.brauer-bund.de/bier-ist-genuss/biersorten-im-portraet/bockbier.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The style is very popular, with many examples brewed internationally.

==History==

The style known now as ''bock'' was a dark, malty, lightly hopped [[ale]] first brewed in the 14th century by German brewers in the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] town of [[Einbeck]].&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000034.html |title=Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter - Original Bock: the beer the doctor ordered |publisher=www.beerhunter.com |accessdate=2010-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The style from Einbeck was later adopted by Munich brewers in the 17th century and adapted to the new [[lager]] style of brewing. Due to their Bavarian accent, citizens of Munich pronounced &quot;Einbeck&quot; as &quot;ein Bock&quot; (&quot;a [[billy goat]]&quot;), and thus the beer became known as &quot;bock&quot;. As a visual pun, a goat often appears on bock labels.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;

Bock is historically associated with special occasions, often religious festivals such as Christmas, Easter or Lent (the latter as ''{{lang|de|Lentenbock}}''). Bocks have a long history of being brewed and consumed by Bavarian monks as a source of nutrition during times of fasting.&lt;ref name=GBI&gt;{{cite web  | title = Doppelbock  | publisher = German Beer Institute  | year = 2006  | url = http://www.germanbeerinstitute.com/Doppelbock.html  | accessdate = 2010-10-07  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101022152031/http://germanbeerinstitute.com/Doppelbock.html#  | archive-date = 22 October 2010  | url-status = dead  | df = dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles of bock==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2017}}

===Traditional bock===
Traditional bock is a sweet, relatively strong (6.3%–7.2% by volume), lightly hopped (20-27 [[IBUs]]) lager. The beer should be clear, and colour can range from light copper to brown, with a bountiful and persistent off-white head. The aroma should be malty and toasty, possibly with hints of alcohol, but no detectable hops or fruitiness. The mouthfeel is smooth, with low to moderate carbonation and no astringency. The taste is rich and toasty, sometimes with a bit of caramel. Again, hop presence is low to undetectable, providing just enough bitterness so that the sweetness is not cloying and the aftertaste is muted.&lt;ref name=DBB /&gt; The following commercial products are indicative of the style: Point Bock (Stevens Point Brewery) [[Einbecker Brewery|Einbecker]] Ur-Bock Dunkel, [[Penn Brewery|Pennsylvania Brewing]] St. Nick Bock, [[Aass]] Bock, [[Great Lakes Brewing Company|Great Lakes]] Rockefeller Bock, [[Stegmaier Brewery|Stegmaier]] Brewhouse Bock.

===Maibock===
The '''maibock''' style, also known as '''helles bock''' or '''heller bock''', is a [[helles]] lager brewed to bock strength; therefore, still as strong as traditional bock, but lighter in colour and with more hop presence. It is a fairly recent development compared to other styles of bock beers, frequently associated with springtime and the month of May. Colour can range from deep gold to light amber with a large, creamy, persistent white head, and moderate to moderately high carbonation, while alcohol content ranges from 6.3% to 7.4% by volume. The flavour is typically less malty than a traditional bock, and may be drier, hoppier, and more bitter, but still with a relatively low hop flavour, with a mild spicy or peppery quality from the hops, increased carbonation and alcohol content. The following commercial products are indicative of the style: [[Ayinger]] Maibock, Mahr's Bock, [[Hacker-Pschorr]] Hubertus Bock, Capital Maibock, Einbecker Mai-Urbock, [[Staatliches Hofbräuhaus in München|Hofbräu]] Maibock, [[Victory Brewing Company|Victory]] St. Boisterous, [[Gordon Biersch]] Blonde Bock, [[Smuttynose Brewing Company|Smuttynose]] Maibock, [[Old Dominion Brewing Company]] Big Thaw Bock, [Brewery 85's Quittin' Time], [[Rogue Ales|Rogue]] Dead Guy [[Ale]], [[Franconia Brewing Company]] Maibock [[Ale]], Church Street maibock, and [[Tröegs Brewing Company|Tröegs]] Cultivator.

===Doppelbock===
''Doppelbock'' or ''double bock'' is a stronger version of traditional bock that was first brewed in Munich by the Paulaner Friars, a Franciscan order founded by [[Francis of Paola|St. Francis of Paula]].&lt;ref name=GBI /&gt; Historically, doppelbock was high in alcohol and sweet, thus serving as &quot;liquid bread&quot; for the Friars during times of fasting, when solid food was not permitted. Today, doppelbock is still strong—ranging from 7%–12% or more by volume. It isn't clear, with colour ranging from dark gold, for the paler version, to dark brown with ruby highlights for darker version. It has a large, creamy, persistent head (although head retention may be impaired by alcohol in the stronger versions). The aroma is intensely malty, with some toasty notes, and possibly some alcohol presence as well; darker versions may have a chocolate-like or fruity aroma. The flavour is very rich and malty, with toasty notes and noticeable alcoholic strength, and little or no detectable hops (16–26 IBUs). Paler versions may have a drier finish. The monks who originally brewed doppelbock named their beer &quot;Salvator&quot; (literally &quot;Savior&quot;, but actually a malapropism for &quot;Sankt Vater&quot;, &quot;St. Father&quot;, originally brewed for the feast of St. Francis of Paola on 2 April which often falls into Lent), which today is trademarked by [[Paulaner]].&lt;ref name=GBI /&gt; Brewers of modern doppelbocks often add &quot;[[wikt:-ator|-ator]]&quot; to their beer's name as a signpost of the style; there are 200 &quot;-ator&quot; doppelbock names registered with the German patent office.&lt;ref name=GBI /&gt; The following are representative examples of the style: [[Paulaner]] Salvator, [[Ayinger]] Celebrator, [[Weihenstephaner]] Korbinian, [[Andechser]] Doppelbock Dunkel, [[Spaten]] Optimator, [[Augustiner]] Maximator, Tucher Bajuvator, Weltenburger Kloster Asam-Bock, [[Capital Brewery|Capital]] Autumnal Fire, EKU 28, [[Eggenberg Castle, Vorchdorf|Eggenberg]] Urbock 23º, [[Bell's brewery|Bell's]] Consecrator, [[Birra Moretti|Moretti]] La Rossa, [[Samuel Adams]] Double Bock, [[Tröegs Brewing Company|Tröegs]] Tröegenator Double Bock, Wasatch Brewery Devastator, [[Great Lakes Brewing Company|Great Lakes]] Doppelrock, [[Abita Brewing Company|Abita]] Andygator, Wolverine State Brewing Company Predator, Burly Brewing's Burlynator, and Christian Moerlein Emancipator Doppelbock.

===Eisbock===
[[File:Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock.jpg|thumb|right|Eisbock beer, made by removing ice from partially frozen barrels of beer, resulting in higher alcohol content.]]
Eisbock is a traditional specialty beer of the [[Kulmbach (district)|Kulmbach district]] of Germany that is made by [[freeze distillation|partially freezing]] a doppelbock and removing the water ice to concentrate the flavour and alcohol content, which ranges from 9% to 13% by volume.  It is clear, with a colour ranging from deep copper to dark brown in colour, often with ruby highlights. Although it can pour with a thin off-white head, head retention is frequently impaired by the higher alcohol content. The aroma is intense, with no hop presence, but frequently can contain fruity notes, especially of prunes, raisins, and plums. Mouthfeel is full and smooth, with significant alcohol, although this should not be hot or sharp. The flavour is rich and sweet, often with toasty notes, and sometimes hints of chocolate, always balanced by a significant alcohol presence. The following are representative examples of the style: Colorado Team Brew &quot;Warning Sign&quot;, Kulmbacher Reichelbräu Eisbock, [[Schloss Eggenberg|Eggenberg]], [[G. Schneider &amp; Sohn|Schneider]] [[Aventinus (beer)|Aventinus]] Eisbock, Urbock Dunkel Eisbock, [[Franconia Brewing Company]] Ice Bock 17%.

The strongest ice-beer, Schorschbräu, is produced by a Franconian company; it has 57% [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]] (alcohol by volume), which claims to be a world record for beer ABV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schorschbraeu.de/portfolio-item/schorschbraeu-57-033/|title=Schorschbräu 57% 0,33|language=German|website=Schorschbraeu|date=  |author= |accessdate= 23 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weizenbock===
Weizenbock is a style of bock brewed using wheat instead of barley. It was first produced in [[Bavaria]] in 1907 by [[G. Schneider &amp; Sohn]] and was named ''[[Aventinus (beer)|Aventinus]]'' after a Bavarian historian. The style combines darker Munich malts and top-fermenting wheat beer yeast, brewed at the strength of a [[doppelbock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Klemp |first=K.
