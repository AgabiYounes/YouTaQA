'''William Frederick Schelter''' (1947&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160612195350/http://www.utexas.edu/faculty/council/2004-2005/memorials/schelter/schelter.html In memoriam]. Access in 2007-07-05.&lt;/ref&gt; â€“ July 30, 2001) was a professor of [[mathematics]] at [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas at Austin]] and a [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] [[software developer|developer]] and [[programmer]].  Schelter is credited with the development of the [[GNU Common Lisp]] (GCL) implementation of [[Common Lisp]] and the [[GPL]]'d version of the [[computer algebra system]] [[Macsyma]] called [[Maxima (software)|Maxima]]. Schelter authored [[Austin Kyoto Common Lisp]] (AKCL) under contract with [[IBM]]. AKCL formed the foundation for [[Axiom (computer algebra system)|Axiom]], another computer algebra system. AKCL eventually became GNU Common Lisp. He is also credited with the first port of the [[GNU C compiler]] to the [[IA-32|Intel 386]] architecture, used in the original implementation of the [[Linux kernel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://alamos.math.arizona.edu/symcomp/announcement.txt ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901072418/http://alamos.math.arizona.edu/symcomp/announcement.txt |date=September 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schelter obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] at [[McGill University]] in 1972. His mathematical specialties were [[noncommutative ring]] theory and [[symbolic computation|computational algebra]] and its applications, including [[automated theorem proving]] in geometry.

In the summer of 2001, age 54, he died suddenly of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] while traveling in [[Russia]].
