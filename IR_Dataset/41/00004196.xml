'''Barnard's Star''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɑr|n|ər|d|z}} is a [[red dwarf]] about 6 [[light-year]]s away from Earth in the [[constellation]] of [[Ophiuchus]]. It is the [[List of nearest stars and brown dwarfs|fourth-nearest-known]] individual star to the [[Sun]] after the three components of the [[Alpha Centauri]] system and the closest star in the [[northern celestial hemisphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://shiva.uwp.edu/p120/astro_survey.html |title=Astronomy Survey Fall 2010 |accessdate=5 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130626182912/http://shiva.uwp.edu/p120/astro_survey.html |archivedate=26 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[stellar mass]] is about 14% of the Sun's. Despite its proximity, the star has a dim [[apparent magnitude]] of +9.5 and is invisible to the [[unaided eye]]; it is much brighter in the [[infrared]] than in visible [[light]].

The star is named after the American [[astronomer]] [[E. E. Barnard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaler&quot;/&gt; He was not the first to observe the star (it appeared on Harvard University plates in 1888 and 1890), but in 1916 he measured its [[proper motion]] as 10.3 [[arcsecond]]s per year relative to the Sun, the highest known for any star.&lt;ref name=&quot;EEB&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barnard|first=E.

Although Barnard's Star is an ancient star, it still experiences [[Flare star|star flare]] events, one being observed in 1998.

From the early 1960s to the early 1970s, [[Peter van de Kamp]] argued that there were one or more [[gas giant]]s in orbit around it. His specific claims of large gas giants were refuted in the mid-1970s after much debate.
In November 2018 a candidate [[super-Earth]] planetary companion known as [[Barnard's Star b]] was reported to orbit Barnard's Star. It is believed to have a minimum of {{earth mass|3.2|link=y}} (Earth masses) and orbit at {{val|0.4|ul=AU}}.&lt;ref name=Ribas&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ribas|first=I.|last2=Tuomi|first2=M.|last3=Reiners|first3=A.|last4=Butler|first4=R.

== Description ==
[[File:Barnard2005.gif|thumb|left|Barnard's Star, showing position every 5 years in the period 1985–2005]]
Barnard's Star is a red dwarf of the dim [[stellar classification|spectral type]] M4, and it is too faint to see without a [[telescope]]. Its [[apparent magnitude]] is 9.5.

At 7–12 billion years of age, Barnard's Star is considerably older than the Sun, which is 4.5 billion years old, and it might be among the oldest stars in the [[Milky Way]] galaxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riedel2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Given its age, Barnard's Star was long assumed to be quiescent in terms of stellar activity. In 1998, astronomers observed an intense [[stellar flare]], showing that Barnard's Star is a [[flare star]].&lt;ref name=Flare&gt;{{cite web

 | work=Astronomy Magazine | publisher=Kalmbach Publishing Co }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnard's Star has the [[variable star designation]] V2500 Ophiuchi. In 2003, Barnard's Star presented the first detectable change in the [[radial velocity]] of a star caused by its motion. Further variability in the radial velocity of Barnard's Star was attributed to its stellar activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kurster&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Near-stars-past-future-en.svg|left|thumb|upright=1.2|Distances to the [[List of nearest stars|nearest stars]] from 20,000 years ago until 80,000 years in the future]]
The proper motion of Barnard's Star corresponds to a relative lateral speed of 90 [[Metre per second|km/s]]. The 10.3 seconds of arc it travels annually amount to a quarter of a degree in a human lifetime, roughly half the angular diameter of the full Moon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaler&quot;/&gt;

The radial velocity of Barnard's Star towards the Sun is measured from its [[blueshift]] to be −110 km/s. Combined with its proper motion, this gives a [[Stellar kinematics#Space velocity|space velocity]] (actual velocity relative to the Sun) of −142.6 ± 0.2 km/s. Barnard's Star will make its closest approach to the Sun around 11,800 AD, when it will approach to within about 3.75 light-years.&lt;ref name=al36_3_220&gt;{{citation | last1=Bobylev | first1=V. V. | title=Searching for stars closely encountering with the solar system | journal=Astronomy Letters | volume=36 | issue=3 | pages=220–226 |date=March 2010 | doi=10.1134/S1063773710030060 | bibcode=2010AstL...36..220B |arxiv = 1003.2160 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Proxima Centauri]] is the closest star to the Sun at a position currently 4.24 light-years distant from it. However, despite Barnard's Star's even closer pass to the Sun in 11,800 AD, it will still not then be the nearest star, since by that time Proxima Centauri will have moved to a yet-nearer proximity to the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Matthews | first=R. A.

M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the star's closest pass by the Sun, Barnard's Star will still be too dim to be seen with the naked eye, since its apparent magnitude will only have increased by one magnitude to about 8.5 by then, still being 2.5 magnitudes short of visibility to the naked eye.

Barnard's Star has a mass of about 0.14 [[solar mass]]es ({{Solar mass|link=y}}),&lt;ref name=al36_3_220/&gt; and a radius 15% to 20% of that of the Sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ochsenbein&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ochsenbein |first=F. |date=March 1982 |title=A list of stars with large expected angular diameters |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics Supplement Series |volume=47 |pages=523–531 | bibcode = 1982A&amp;AS...47..523O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, although Barnard's Star has roughly 150 times the mass of Jupiter ({{Jupiter mass|link=y}}), its radius is only 1.5 to 2.0 times larger, due to its much higher density. Its [[effective temperature]] is 3,100 [[kelvin]], and it has a visual luminosity of 0.0004 [[solar luminosity|solar luminosities]].&lt;ref name =&quot;Dawson&quot;/&gt; Barnard's Star is so faint that if it were at the same distance from Earth as the Sun is, it would appear only 100 times brighter than a full moon, comparable to the brightness of the Sun at 80 [[astronomical unit]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;SolStation&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.solstation.com/stars/barnards.htm | title = Barnard's Star | publisher = Sol Station|accessdate = 10 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060820111502/http://www.solstation.com/stars/barnards.htm| archivedate= 20 August 2006 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnard's Star has 10–32% of the solar [[metallicity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gizis&quot;/&gt; Metallicity is the proportion of stellar mass made up of elements heavier than [[helium]] and helps classify stars relative to the galactic population. Barnard's Star seems to be typical of the old, red dwarf [[Stellar population|population II stars]], yet these are also generally metal-poor [[Stellar halo|halo stars]]. While sub-solar, Barnard's Star's metallicity is higher than that of a halo star and is in keeping with the low end of the metal-rich [[Disc (galaxy)|disk star]] range; this, plus its high space motion, have led to the designation &quot;intermediate population II star&quot;, between a halo and disk star.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gizis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kurster&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kürster | first=M. | year = 2003 | title = The low-level radial velocity variability in Barnard's Star | journal = Astronomy and Astrophysics | bibcode = 2003A&amp;A...403.1077K | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361:20030396 | volume = 403 | issue = 6 | pages=1077–1088 | last2=Endl | first2=M. | last3=Rouesnel | first3=F. | last4=Els | first4=S. | last5=Kaufer | first5=A. | last6=Brillant | first6=S. | last7=Hatzes | first7=A.

In November 2018 an international team of astronomers announced the detection of a candidate [[super-Earth]] orbiting in relatively close proximity to Barnard's Star. The large team was led by Ignasi Ribas of Spain and their work included two decades of observation, with their observations giving strong evidence that the planet exists.&lt;ref name=Ribas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1837/|title=Super-Earth Orbiting Barnard's Star|publisher=[[European Southern Observatory]]|date=14 November 2018|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dubbed Barnard's Star b, the planet was found near the stellar system's [[Frost line (astrophysics)|snow line]], which is an ideal spot for the icy accretion of proto-planetary material. It orbits at 0.4 AU every 233 days and has a proposed mass of {{earth mass|3.2|link=y}}. The planet is most likely frigid, with an estimated surface temperature of about {{Convert|-170|C}}, and lies outside Barnard Star's presumed [[habitable zone]]. However, more work is needed on the planet's atmospherics to better understand surface conditions. Direct imaging of the planet and its tell-tale [[Spectral signature|light signature]] are possible in the decade after its discovery. Further faint and unaccounted for perturbations in the system suggest there may be a second planetary companion even further out.&lt;ref name=sciam&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-frozen-super-earth-may-orbit-barnards-star/ |title=A Frozen Super-Earth May Orbit Barnard's Star |last=Billings |first=Lee |work=Scientific American |date=14 November 2018 |access-date=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a decade from 1963 to about 1973, a substantial number of astronomers accepted a claim by [[Peter van de Kamp]] that he had detected, by using [[Methods of detecting exoplanets#Astrometry|astrometry]], a perturbation in the [[proper motion]] of Barnard's Star consistent with its having one or more planets comparable in mass with [[Jupiter]]. Van de Kamp had been observing the star from 1938, attempting, with colleagues at the [[Sproul Observatory]] at [[Swarthmore College]], to find minuscule variations of one [[micrometre]] in its position on [[photographic plate]]s consistent with [[perturbation (astronomy)|orbital perturbations]] that would indicate a planetary companion; this involved as many as ten people averaging their results in looking at plates, to avoid systemic individual errors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunder&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.astrobio.net/index.php?option=com_retrospection&amp;task=detail&amp;id=1635 | title = The Barnard's Star Blunder |date=July 2005| work = Astrobiology Magazine | accessdate = 26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van de Kamp's initial suggestion was a planet having about {{Jupiter mass|1.6}} at a distance of 4.4 AU in a slightly eccentric orbit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Van de Kamp, Peter. | year = 1963 | title = Astrometric study of Barnard's star from plates taken with the 24-inch Sproul refractor | journal = The Astronomical Journal | volume = 68 | issue = 7 | page = 515|bibcode = 1963AJ.....68..515V|doi = 10.1086/109001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and these measurements were apparently refined in a 1969 paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Van de Kamp, Peter. | year = 1969 | title = Parallax, proper motion acceleration, and orbital motion of Barnard's Star | journal = The Astronomical Journal | volume = 74 | issue = 2 | page = 238|bibcode = 1969AJ.....74..238V|doi = 10.1086/110799 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Van de Kamp suggested that there were two planets of 1.1 and {{Jupiter mass|0.8}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Van de Kamp, Peter. | year = 1969 | title = Alternate dynamical analysis of Barnard's star | journal = The Astronomical Journal | volume = 74 | issue = 8 | page = 757 | bibcode = 1969AJ.....74..757V | doi = 10.1086/110852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other astronomers subsequently repeated Van de Kamp's measurements, and two papers in 1973 undermined the claim of a planet or planets. [[George David Gatewood|George Gatewood]] and Heinrich Eichhorn, at a different observatory and using newer plate measuring techniques, failed to verify the planetary companion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gatewood, George |author2=Eichhorn, H. |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1973 | title = An unsuccessful search for a planetary companion of Barnard's star (BD +4 3561) | bibcode = 1973AJ.....78..769G | journal = The Astronomical Journal | volume = 78 | issue = 10 | page = 769 | doi = 10.1086/111480}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another paper published by John L.

Van de Kamp never acknowledged any error and published a further claim of two planets' existence as late as 1982;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Van de Kamp, Peter. | year = 1982 | title = The planetary system of Barnard's star | journal = Vistas in Astronomy | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | page = 141 | bibcode = 1982VA.....26..141V | doi = 10.1016/0083-6656(82)90004-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he died in 1995. [[Wulff-Dieter Heintz|Wulff Heintz]], Van de Kamp's successor at Swarthmore and an expert on [[double star]]s, questioned his findings and began publishing criticisms from 1976 onwards.

=== Refining planetary boundaries ===

For the more than four decades between van de Kamp's rejected claim and the eventual announcement of a planet candidate, Barnard's Star was carefully studied and the mass and orbital boundaries for possible planets were slowly tightened. M dwarfs such as Barnard's Star are more easily studied than larger stars in this regard because their lower masses render perturbations more obvious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Null results for planetary companions continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s, including [[Interferometry|interferometric]] work with the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] in 1999.&lt;ref name = Hubble99&gt;{{cite journal |last=Benedict |first=G.

In 2013, a research paper was published that further refined planet mass boundaries for the star. Using radial velocity measurements, taken over a period of 25 years, from the [[Lick Observatory|Lick]] and [[W. M. Keck Observatory|Keck]] Observatories and applying [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo analysis]] for both circular and eccentric orbits, upper masses for planets out to 1,000-day orbits were determined. Planets above two Earth masses in orbits of less than 10 days were excluded, and planets of more than ten Earth masses out to a two-year orbit were also confidently ruled out. It was also discovered that the habitable zone of the star seemed to be devoid of roughly Earth-mass planets or larger, save for face-on orbits.&lt;ref name=&quot;no-earth-dreams&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.centauri-dreams.org/2012/08/16/barnards-star-no-earth-mass-planets-found/ |title=Barnard's Star: No Sign of Planets |website=Centauri Dreams | last=Gilster |first=Paul |date=16 August 2012 |access-date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Choi2013&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1208.2273|last1=Choi|first1=Jieun|title=Precise Doppler Monitoring of Barnard's Star|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=764|issue=2|pages=131|last2=McCarthy|first2=Chris|last3=Marcy|first3=Geoffrey W|last4=Howard|first4=Andrew W|last5=Fischer|first5=Debra A|last6=Johnson|first6=John A|last7=Isaacson|first7=Howard|last8=Wright|first8=Jason T|year=2012|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/764/2/131|bibcode=2013ApJ...764..131C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though this research greatly restricted the possible properties of planets around Barnard's Star, it did not rule them out completely as [[terrestrial planet]]s were always going to be difficult to detect. [[NASA]]'s [[Space Interferometry Mission]], which was to begin searching for extrasolar Earth-like planets, was reported to have chosen Barnard's Star as an early search target.&lt;ref name=&quot;SolStation&quot;/&gt; This mission was shut down in 2010.&lt;ref name=SIM&gt;{{cite web | first = James | last = Marr | url = http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/SIM/projectNews/projectManagerUpdates/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110302135037/http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/SIM/projectNews/projectManagerUpdates/ | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2 March 2011 | title = Updates from the Project Manager | date = 8 November 2010 | publisher = NASA | accessdate = 26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[European Space Agency|ESA]]'s similar [[Darwin (ESA)|Darwin]] interferometry mission had the same goal, but was stripped of funding in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaSC/SEMZ0E1A6BD_index_0.html |title=Darwin factsheet: Finding Earth-like planets |publisher=[[European Space Agency]] |date=23 October 2009 |accessdate=12 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513085904/http://www.esa.int/esaSC/SEMZ0E1A6BD_index_0.html |archivedate=13 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of radial velocities that eventually led to discovery of the candidate super-Earth orbiting Barnard's Star was also used to set more precise upper mass limits for possible planets, up to and within the habitable zone: a maximum of {{earth mass|0.7|link=y}} up to the inner edge and {{earth mass|1.2}} on the outer edge of the optimistic habitable zone, corresponding to orbital periods of up to 10 and 40 days respectively. Therefore, it appears that Barnard's Star indeed does not host Earth-mass planets, or larger, in hot and temperate orbits, unlike other M-dwarf stars that commonly have these type of planets in close-in orbits.&lt;ref name=Ribas/&gt;&lt;!--It was much easier for the Kepler telescope to detect close-in larger planets than further out planets, or smaller close-in planets, so M-dwarfs may not in reality commonly host close-in larger planets. It might all just be down to an observational bias inherent to the way Kepler detects planets, and just an illusion.---&gt;

== Proposed exploration ==

=== Project Daedalus ===
{{main|Project Daedalus}}

&lt;!--Excepting the planet controversy, the best known study of --&gt;Barnard's Star was studied as part of [[Project Daedalus]]. Undertaken between 1973 and 1978, the study suggested that rapid, unmanned travel to another star system was possible with existing or near-future technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daedalus76&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Bond, A. | author2 = Martin, A.R. | lastauthoramp = yes | year = 1976 | title = Project Daedalus – The mission profile | journal = [[Journal of the British Interplanetary Society]] | url = http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=TRD&amp;recid=A7618970AH&amp;q=project+daedalus&amp;uid=788304424&amp;setcookie=yes | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | page = 101 | accessdate = 15 August 2006 | bibcode = 1976JBIS...29..101B | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071020144727/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=TRD&amp;recid=A7618970AH&amp;q=project+daedalus&amp;uid=788304424&amp;setcookie=yes | archivedate = 20 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnard's Star was chosen as a target partly because it was believed to have planets.&lt;ref name=DarlingDaedalus&gt;{{cite web | first = David | last = Darling | url = http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/D/Daedalus.html | title = Daedalus, Project |date=July 2005 | work = The Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, Astronomy, and Spaceflight | accessdate = 10 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060831043940/http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/D/Daedalus.html| archivedate= 31 August 2006 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical model suggested that a nuclear pulse rocket employing [[nuclear fusion]] (specifically, electron bombardment of [[deuterium]] and [[helium-3]]) and accelerating for four years could achieve a velocity of 12% of the [[speed of light]]. The star could then be reached in 50 years, within a human lifetime.&lt;ref name=&quot;DarlingDaedalus&quot;/&gt; Along with detailed investigation of the star and any companions, the [[interstellar medium]] would be examined and baseline astrometric readings performed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daedalus76&quot;/&gt;

The initial Project Daedalus model sparked further theoretical research. In 1980, [[Robert Freitas]] suggested a more ambitious plan: a [[self-replicating spacecraft]] intended to search for and make contact with [[extraterrestrial life]].&lt;ref name=Repro&gt;{{cite journal | first=Robert A., Jr. | last=Freitas | title=A Self-Reproducing Interstellar Probe | journal=[[Journal of the British Interplanetary Society]] | volume=33 |date=July 1980 | pages=251–264 | url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ReproJBISJuly1980.htm | accessdate =1 October 2008|bibcode = 1980JBIS...33..251F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Built and launched in [[Jupiter]]'s orbit, it would reach Barnard's Star in 47 years under parameters similar to those of the original Project Daedalus. Once at the star, it would begin automated self-replication, constructing a factory, initially to manufacture exploratory probes and eventually to create a copy of the original spacecraft after 1,000 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Repro&quot;/&gt;

== 1998 flare ==
In 1998 a [[stellar flare]] on Barnard's Star was detected based on changes in the [[spectral emissions]] on 17 July during an unrelated search for variations in the proper motion. Four years passed before the flare was fully analyzed, at which point it was suggested that the flare's temperature was 8,000 K, more than twice the normal temperature of the star.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paulson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | first = Diane B. | last = Paulson | year = 2006 | title = Optical Spectroscopy of a Flare on Barnard's Star | journal = Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific | volume = 118 | issue = 1 | page = 227 | doi=10.1086/499497| last2 = Allred | first2 = Joel C. | last3 = Anderson | first3 = Ryan B. | last4 = Hawley | first4 = Suzanne L. | last5 = Cochran | first5 = William D. | last6 = Yelda | first6 = Sylvana | bibcode=2006PASP..118..227P|arxiv = astro-ph/0511281 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the essentially random nature of flares, Diane Paulson, one of the authors of that study, noted that &quot;the star would be fantastic for amateurs to observe&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flare&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:RedDwarfNASA-hue-shifted.jpg|right|thumb|Artist's conception of a [[red dwarf]]]]
The flare was surprising because intense stellar activity is not expected in stars of such age. Flares are not completely understood, but are believed to be caused by strong [[magnetic field]]s, which suppress [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] [[convection]] and lead to sudden outbursts: strong magnetic fields occur in rapidly rotating stars, while old stars tend to rotate slowly. For Barnard's Star to undergo an event of such magnitude is thus presumed to be a rarity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paulson&quot;/&gt; Research on the star's periodicity, or changes in stellar activity over a given timescale, also suggest it ought to be quiescent; 1998 research showed weak evidence for periodic variation in the star's brightness, noting only one possible starspot over 130 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benedict1998&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last= Benedict | first=G. Fritz | year = 1998 | title = Photometry of Proxima Centauri and Barnard's star using Hubble Space Telescope fine guidance senso 3 | journal = The Astronomical Journal | bibcode = 1998AJ....116..429B | volume = 116 | issue = 1 | page = 429 | doi= 10.1086/300420 | last2= McArthur | first2= Barbara | last3= Nelan | first3= E. | last4= Story | first4= D. | last5= Whipple | first5= A.

Stellar activity of this sort has created interest in using Barnard's Star as a proxy to understand similar stars. It is hoped that photometric studies of its [[X-ray]] and [[UV]] emissions will shed light on the large population of old M dwarfs in the galaxy. Such research has [[astrobiological]] implications: given that the habitable zones of M dwarfs are close to the star, any planets would be strongly influenced by solar flares, winds, and plasma ejection events.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riedel2005&quot;/&gt;

== Environment ==
Barnard's Star shares much the same neighborhood as the Sun. The neighbors of Barnard's Star are generally of red dwarf size, the smallest and most common star type. Its closest neighbor is currently the red dwarf [[Ross 154]], at 1.66 [[parsec]]s' (5.41 light-years) distance. The Sun and [[Alpha Centauri]] are, respectively, the next closest systems.&lt;ref name=SolStation/&gt; From Barnard's Star, the Sun would appear on the diametrically opposite side of the sky at coordinates RA={{RA|5|57|48.5}}, Dec={{DEC|−04|41|36}}, in the eastern part of the constellation [[Monoceros (constellation)|Monoceros]]. The absolute magnitude of the Sun is 4.83, and at a distance of 1.834 parsecs, it would be a first-magnitude star, as [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]] is from the Earth.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;The Sun's apparent magnitude from Barnard's Star, assuming negligible [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]]: &lt;math&gt;\begin{smallmatrix} m = 4.83 + 5\cdot((\log_{10} 1.834) - 1) = 1.15 \end{smallmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
