==History==
Capcom's predecessor, I.R.M. Corporation, was founded on May 30, 1979&lt;ref name=&quot;ign25th&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/881/881137p1.html |title=Capcom Marks 25th Anniversary |author=Ocampo, Jason |date=June 11, 2008 |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc |accessdate=July 21, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004235215/http://pc.ign.com/articles/881/881137p1.html |archivedate=October 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Kenzo Tsujimoto]]. Tsujimoto was still president of [[Irem|Irem Corporation]] when he founded I.R.M. Tsujimoto worked concomitantly in both companies until leaving the former in 1983.

The original companies that spawned Capcom's Japanese branch were I.R.M. as well as its subsidiary Japan Capsule Computers Co., Ltd., both of which were devoted to the manufacturing and distribution of electronic game machines.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; The two companies underwent a name change to Sambi Co., Ltd. in September 1981,&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; while Capcom Co., Ltd. was first established on June 11, 1983 by Kenzo Tsujimoto,&lt;ref name=&quot;ign25th&quot; /&gt; for the purpose of taking over the internal sales department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/company/history.html |script-title=ja:会社情報 カプコンの歴史 |language=Japanese |date=September 30, 2009 |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd |accessdate=July 21, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305061106/http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/company/history.html |archivedate=March 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1989, the old affiliate company Capcom Co., Ltd. merged with Sambi Co., Ltd., resulting in the current Japanese branch.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; The name Capcom is a [[clipped compound]] of &quot;'''Cap'''sule '''Com'''puters&quot;, a term coined by the company to describe the [[Video game arcade cabinet|arcade machines]] it solely manufactured in its early years, designed to set themselves apart from [[personal computer]]s that were becoming widespread at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;name&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/company/name.html |script-title=ja:会社情報 社名の由来 |language=Japanese |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd |accessdate=July 22, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305061111/http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/company/name.html |archivedate=March 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word capsule alludes to how Capcom likened its game software to &quot;a capsule packed to the brim with gaming fun&quot;, as well as to the company's desire to protect its intellectual property with a hard outer shell, preventing illegal copies and inferior imitations.&lt;ref name=&quot;name&quot; /&gt;

While Capcom's first product was the coin-operated ''Little League'' from July 1983, its first real video game, the [[Arcade game|arcade title]] ''[[Vulgus]]'', was released in May 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; Beginning with a [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] port of ''[[1942 (video game)|1942]]'' published in December 1985, the company started to venture into the market of [[home console]] video games,&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; which became its main business segment a few years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;businesssegments&quot; /&gt; Its division Capcom USA had a brief stint in the late 1980s as a [[video game publisher]] for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[IBM PC DOS]] computers although the development of these arcade ports were handled by other companies. Capcom has created 15 multi-million-selling game series, the most successful of which is ''[[Resident Evil]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;salesdata&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/salesdata.html |title=Business Strategies &amp; IR Data: Total Sales Units Data |date=March 31, 2010 |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd |accessdate=July 21, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327174103/http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/salesdata.html |archivedate=March 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capcom has been noted as the last major publisher to be committed to 2D games, though this was not entirely by choice. The company's commitment to the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] as its platform of choice caused them to lag behind other leading publishers in developing 3D-capable arcade boards.&lt;ref name=&quot;NGen17&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Capcom |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=17|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=May 1996|pages=67–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the 2D animated cartoon-style graphics seen in games such as ''[[Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors]]'' and ''[[X-Men: Children of the Atom (video game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom]]'' proved popular, leading Capcom to adopt it as a signature style and use it in more games.&lt;ref name=&quot;NGen17&quot;/&gt;

In 1994, Capcom adapted its ''Street Fighter'' series of fighting games into [[Street Fighter (1994 film)|a film of the same name]]. While commercially successful, it was critically panned. [[Resident Evil (film)|A 2002 adaptation of its ''Resident Evil'']] series faced similar criticism but was also successful in theaters. The company sees films as a way to build sales for its video games.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaudiosi&quot;&gt;Gaudiosi, John. &quot;Capcom Seeks More Playtime in HWood.&quot; Hollywood Reporter 397 (2006): 4,4,29. ProQuest Research Library. Web. May 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Capcom partnered with [[Nyu Media]] in 2011 to publish and distribute the Japanese [[independent games|independent]] ([[dōjin soft]]) games that Nyu [[game localization|localized]] into the English language.&lt;ref name=&quot;IG: 2011-12&quot;/&gt; The company works with the Polish localization company QLoc to [[Porting of video games|port]] Capcom's games to other platforms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egmnow.com/articles/news/dustforce-sweeping-onto-xbox-live-arcade-and-psn-for-ps3-vita-january-2014/ |title=Dustforce Sweeping onto Xbox Live Arcade and PSN for PS3, Vita January 2014 |accessdate=December 30, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705094515/http://www.egmnow.com/articles/news/dustforce-sweeping-onto-xbox-live-arcade-and-psn-for-ps3-vita-january-2014/ |archivedate=July 5, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; notably examples are ''[[DmC: Devil May Cry]]''{{'}}s PC version and its [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] remasters, ''[[Dragon's Dogma]]''{{'}}s PC version released in January 2016, and ''[[Dead Rising (video game)|Dead Rising]]''{{'}}s version on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC released on September 13, 2016.

On August 27, 2014, Capcom filed a [[patent infringement]] lawsuit against [[Koei Tecmo Games]] at the Osaka District Court for 980 million yen in damage. Capcom claimed Koei Tecmo Games infringed a patent it obtained in 2002 regarding a play feature in video games.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koei Tecmo Games&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-08-26-capcom-files-lawsuit-against-koei-tecmo-for-patent-infringement |title=Capcom files lawsuit against Koei Tecmo for patent infringement |first=Jeffrey |last=Matulef |date=August 27, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816072456/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-08-26-capcom-files-lawsuit-against-koei-tecmo-for-patent-infringement |archivedate=August 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate structure==

===Development studios===
In the first few years after its establishment, the Japanese branch of Capcom had three development groups referred to as &quot;Planning Rooms&quot;, led by [[Tokuro Fujiwara]], Takashi Nishiyama and [[Yoshiki Okamoto]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Gameside |script-title=ja:ゲーム業界を&quot;爆発&quot;させた&quot;ストライダー&quot;の父 「四井浩一」 　ディスコグラフィー |date=February 2009 |issue=16 |language=Japanese |publisher=Micro Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=[[Strider (arcade game)|Strider Hiryū]] |developer=Capcom Co., Ltd |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd. |date=March 7, 1989 |scene=staff credits}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, games developed internally used to be created by several numbered &quot;Production Studios&quot;, each assigned to different games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/775/775450p1.html |title=The Future of PSP – Capcom |author=Nix, Marc |date=March 23, 2007 |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc |accessdate=May 11, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223004104/http://psp.ign.com/articles/775/775450p1.html |archivedate=February 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;annualreport2009&quot; /&gt; Starting in 2002, the development process was reformed to better share technologies and expertise, and all of the individual studios were gradually restructured into bigger departments responsible for different tasks.&lt;ref name=&quot;annualreport2009&quot; /&gt; While there are self-contained departments for the creation of arcade, pachinko and pachislo, online, and mobile games, the Consumer Games R&amp;D Division instead is an amalgamation of subsections in charge of various game development stages.&lt;ref name=&quot;annualreport2009&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/interview/2008/ |title=Developer Interview 2008 |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd |accessdate=July 24, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101004135608/http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/interview/2008/ |archivedate=October 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;annualreport2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/2007annual/Annual2007e.pdf |title=Annual Report 2007 |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd |accessdate=July 22, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020035102/http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/2007annual/Annual2007e.pdf |archivedate=October 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capcom has three internal divisions to make games. Those are Consumer games division 1 with ''[[Resident Evil]]'', ''[[Devil May Cry]]'', ''[[Dead Rising]]'', and other worldwide franchises (usually targeted towards North American and European audiences), Consumer games division 2 with ''[[Street Fighter]]'', ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom]]'', and other online focused franchises (usually targeted towards worldwide audiences), and Consumer games division 3 with ''[[Monster Hunter]]'', ''[[Ace Attorney]]'', and other franchises with more traditional IP (usually targeted towards Japanese audiences).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/interview/2015/|title=Developer Interview 2015|author=Capcom|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these internal teams, Capcom also commissions outside development studios to ensure a steady output of titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/interview/2009/vol08/index.html |title=Developer Interview 2009: vol08.Keiji Inafune |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd |accessdate=November 6, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407010514/http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/interview/2009/vol08/index.html |archivedate=April 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/interview/2010/vol01/03.html |title=Developer Interview 2010: vol01.Jun Takeuchi |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd |accessdate=November 6, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003125751/http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/interview/2010/vol01/03.html |archivedate=October 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following poor sales of ''[[Dark Void]]'' and ''[[Bionic Commando (2009 video game)|Bionic Commando]]'', the company's management has decided to limit outsourcing to sequels and newer versions of installments in existing franchises, reserving the development of original titles for its in-house teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5540859/bionic-commando-dark-void-last-straws-for-capcom |title=Bionic Commando, Dark Void Last Straws For Capcom |author=Orsini, Lauren |date=May 17, 2010 |work=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=November 6, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620062228/http://kotaku.com/5540859/bionic-commando-dark-void-last-straws-for-capcom |archivedate=June 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of games, budgets, and platforms supported are decided upon in development approval meetings, attended by the company management and the marketing, sales, and quality control departments.&lt;ref name=&quot;annualreport2009&quot; /&gt;

==Games==
{{main|List of Capcom games}}
Capcom started its ''[[Street Fighter]]'' franchise in 1987. The series of [[fighting game]]s are among the most popular in their genre. Having sold over 30 million units, the series serves as Capcom's flagship franchise. That same year, the company introduced its ''[[Mega Man]]'' series, which also sells nearly 30 million units.

The company released the first entry in its ''[[Resident Evil]]'' survival horror series in 1996. The series has achieved financial success, selling over 90 million units. Following work on the second entry in the ''Resident Evil'' series, Capcom began work on a ''Resident Evil'' game for the [[PlayStation 2]]. Radically different from the existing series, Capcom decided to spin off the game into its own series, ''[[Devil May Cry]]''. While it released the first two entries exclusively for the PlayStation 2, the company brought further entries to non-[[Sony]] consoles. The series as a whole has seen sales in excess of 10 million units. Capcom began its ''[[Monster Hunter]]'' series in 2004. The series has seen sales of over 45 million units on a variety of consoles.

Although the company often relies on existing franchises, it also published and developed several titles for the [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Wii]], based on original intellectual property: ''[[Lost Planet: Extreme Condition]]'', ''[[Dead Rising (video game)|Dead Rising]]'', ''[[Dragon's Dogma]]'', ''[[Asura's Wrath]]'' and ''[[Zack and Wiki]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Blood&quot;&gt;&quot;Lost Planet &amp; Dead Rising; Capcom Brings New Blood to Xbox 360.&quot; EGM [i] 2006: 1-41.

==Criticism and controversy==
In 2012, Capcom was criticized for controversial sales tactics, such as having to pay for additional content which is already available within the game's files, most notably in ''[[Street Fighter X Tekken]]''. Capcom has defended the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamespot.com/news/capcom-defends-on-disc-dlc-report-6369371 |title=Capcom defends on-disc DLC - Report |website=[[GameSpot]] |first=Eddie |last=Makuch |date=April 2, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404121921/http://www.gamespot.com/news/capcom-defends-on-disc-dlc-report-6369371 |archivedate=April 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has been criticized for other business decisions, such as not releasing certain games outside Japan (most notably the ''[[Sengoku Basara|Sengoku BASARA]]'' series), abruptly cancelling anticipated projects (most notably ''[[Mega Man Legends 3]]''), and shutting down [[Clover Studio]]. In 2015, the company pulled the PlayStation 4 version of ''Ultra Street Fighter IV'' from the Capcom Pro Tour due to numerous technical issues and gameplay bugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wesley Yin-Poole|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-05-28-capcom-pulls-ps4-version-of-ultra-street-fighter-4-from-its-own-tournament |title=Capcom pulls PS4 Ultra Street Fighter 4 from its own tournament|accessdate=July 3, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816091817/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-05-28-capcom-pulls-ps4-version-of-ultra-street-fighter-4-from-its-own-tournament |archivedate=August 16, 2016|website=[[Eurogamer]]|date=June 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Capcom released ''[[Street Fighter V]]'' with very limited single player content. At launch, there were stability issues with the game's network that booted players mid-game even when they were not playing in an online mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=[[GameSpot]]|title=Capcom Responds to Street Fighter 5's Lack of Content Concerns|date=April 6, 2016|accessdate=January 31, 2018|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-responds-to-street-fighter-5s-lack-of-conte/1100-6438601/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Street Fighter V'' failed to meet its sales target of 2 million in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gamerant.com/street-fighter-5-capcom-sales-target-382/|website=[[GameRant]]|accessdate=January 31, 2018|date=2016|title=Street Fighter 5 Sales Miss Capcom Target By Huge Margin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
