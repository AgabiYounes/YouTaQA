The '''Columbia River''' is the largest [[river]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of North America.&lt;ref&gt;According to the United States Geological Survey fact sheet, [http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1987/ofr87-242/pdf/ofr87242.pdf &quot;Largest Rivers in the United States&quot;], &quot;Rivers are considered large on the basis of one or more of three characteristics: total length from source to mouth, area of basin (watershed) drained by the stream, and average rate of flow (discharge) at the mouth.&quot; The Columbia is the largest river of the Pacific Northwest in all three senses.&lt;/ref&gt; The river [[headwater|rises]] in the [[Rocky Mountains]] of [[British Columbia]], Canada. It flows northwest and then south into the US state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], then turns west to form most of the border between Washington and the state of [[Oregon]] before emptying into the Pacific Ocean. The river is {{convert|1243|mi|km}} long, and its largest [[tributary]] is the [[Snake River]]. Its [[drainage basin]] is roughly the size of France and extends into seven US states and a Canadian province. The fourth-largest river in the United States by volume, the Columbia has the greatest [[River flow|flow]] of any North American river entering the Pacific.

The Columbia and its tributaries have been central to the region's culture and economy for thousands of years. They have been used for transportation since ancient times, linking the region's many cultural groups. The river system hosts many species of [[anadromous]] fish, which [[fish migration|migrate]] between [[freshwater]] habitats and the [[saline water|saline]] waters of the Pacific Ocean. These fish—especially the [[salmon]] species—provided the core subsistence for [[Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Plateau|native peoples]].

In the late 18th century, a private American ship became the first non-indigenous vessel to enter the river; it was followed by a British explorer, who navigated past the [[Oregon Coast Range]] into the [[Willamette Valley]]. In the following decades, [[fur trade|fur trading]] companies used the Columbia as a key transportation route. Overland explorers entered the Willamette Valley through the scenic but treacherous [[Columbia River Gorge]], and [[Oregon Country|pioneers]] began to settle the valley in increasing numbers. [[Steamship]]s along the river linked communities and facilitated trade; the [[History of rail transport in the United States#Expansion and consolidation (1878–1916)|arrival of railroads]] in the late 19th century, many running along the river, supplemented these links.

Since the late 19th century, [[public sector|public]] and [[private sector]]s have heavily developed the river. To aid ship and barge navigation, [[lock (water transport)|locks]] have been built along the lower Columbia and its tributaries, and [[dredging]] has opened, maintained, and enlarged [[Nautical channel|shipping channels]]. Since the early 20th century, dams have been built across the river for power generation, navigation, [[irrigation]], and flood control. The [[list of dams in the Columbia River watershed|14 hydroelectric dams]] on the Columbia's [[main stem]] and many more on its tributaries produce more than 44&amp;nbsp;percent of total US [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric generation]]. Production of [[nuclear power]] has taken place at two sites along the river. Plutonium for [[nuclear weapon]]s was produced for decades at the [[Hanford Site]], which is now the [[National Priorities List|most contaminated nuclear site]] in the US. These developments have greatly altered river environments in the watershed, mainly through industrial pollution and barriers to fish migration.

== Course ==
The Columbia begins its {{convert|1243|mi|km|adj=on}} journey in the southern [[Rocky Mountain Trench]] in British Columbia (BC). [[Columbia Lake]]&amp;nbsp;– {{convert|2690|ft|m|}} above [[sea level]]&amp;nbsp;– and the adjoining [[Columbia Wetlands]] form the river's [[river source|headwaters]]. The trench is a broad, deep, and long [[glacial valley]] between the [[Canadian Rockies]] and the [[Columbia Mountains]] in BC. For its first {{convert|200|mi|km|}}, the Columbia flows northwest along the trench through [[Windermere Lake (British Columbia)|Windermere Lake]] and the town of [[Invermere, British Columbia|Invermere]], a region known in British Columbia as the [[Columbia Valley]], then northwest to [[Golden, British Columbia|Golden]] and into [[Kinbasket Lake]]. Rounding the northern end of the [[Selkirk Mountains]], the river turns sharply south through a region known as the [[Big Bend Country]], passing through [[Revelstoke Lake]] and the [[Arrow Lakes]]. Revelstoke, the Big Bend, and the Columbia Valley combined are referred to in BC parlance as the [[Columbia Country]]. Below the Arrow Lakes, the Columbia passes the cities of [[Castlegar, British Columbia|Castlegar]], located at the Columbia's [[confluence]] with the [[Kootenay River]], and [[Trail, British Columbia|Trail]], two major population centers of the [[West Kootenay]] region. The [[Pend Oreille River]] joins the Columbia about {{convert|2|mi|0}} north of the [[Canada–United States border|US–Canada border]].&lt;ref name=&quot;atlas of canada&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title = The Atlas of Canada: Toporama&amp;nbsp;– Topographic Maps |publisher = Natural Resources Canada |year = 2015 |access-date = September 30, 2015 |url = http://atlas.gc.ca/toporama/en/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maps shows that the river, although flowing on average in a southwesterly direction from source to mouth, changes direction sharply from northwest to south at Big Bend in Canada, from south to west near [[Grand Coulee Dam]] in Washington, from west to south near Wenatchee, Washington, and from south to west near the Tri-Cities area in Washington.|Course of the Columbia River]]

The Columbia enters [[eastern Washington]] flowing south and turning to the west at the [[Spokane River]] confluence. It marks the southern and eastern borders of the [[Colville Indian Reservation]] and the western border of the [[Spokane Indian Reservation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;colvillehealth&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last = Kowalski |first = Peter |last2 = Kaplan |first2 = Brian |last3 = Karus |first3 = Greg |title = Health Consultation |url = http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/hac/pha/pha.asp?docid=1302&amp;pg=1#back |work = Colville Federated Tribes |publisher = [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] |date = March 7, 2001 |access-date = October 2, 2015 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130403011248/http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/HAC/pha/pha.asp?docid=1302&amp;pg=1 |archivedate = April 3, 2013 |url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The river turns south after the [[Okanogan River]] confluence, then southeasterly near the confluence with the [[Wenatchee River]] in central Washington. This C‑shaped segment of the river is also known as the &quot;Big Bend&quot;. During the [[Missoula Floods]] 10,000 to 15,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, much of the floodwater took a more direct route south, forming the ancient river bed known as the [[Grand Coulee]]. After the floods, the river found its present course, and the Grand Coulee was left dry. The construction of the [[Grand Coulee Dam]] in the mid-20th&amp;nbsp;century impounded the river, forming [[Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake|Lake Roosevelt]], from which water was pumped into the dry [[coulee]], forming the [[reservoir]] of [[Banks Lake]].&lt;ref name=&quot;basinproj&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title = Columbia Basin Project |publisher = U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation |year = 2009 |access-date = September 2, 2009 |url = http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Project.jsp?proj_Name=Columbia%20Basin%20Project |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150215125327/http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Project.jsp?proj_Name=Columbia%20Basin%20Project |archivedate = February 15, 2015 |url-status = dead |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The river flows past [[The Gorge Amphitheatre]], a prominent concert venue in the Northwest, then through [[Priest Rapids Dam]], and then through the [[Hanford Site|Hanford Nuclear Reservation]]. Entirely within the reservation is [[Hanford Reach]], the only US stretch of the river that is completely free-flowing, unimpeded by dams and not a tidal [[estuary]]. The [[Snake River]] and [[Yakima River]] join the Columbia in the [[Tri-Cities, Washington|Tri‑Cities]] population center. The Columbia makes a sharp bend to the west at the Washington–Oregon border. The river defines that border for the final {{convert|309|mi|km}} of its journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oregon's {{Sic|hide=y|Publicly|-}}Owned Waterways|work=Public Ownership of Submerged and Submersible Land|publisher=Oregon Department of State Lands|access-date=March 9, 2008|url=http://www.oregon.gov/DSL/NAV/navigwaterways.shtml

The [[Deschutes River (Oregon)|Deschutes River]] joins the Columbia near [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]]. Between The Dalles and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], the river cuts through the [[Cascade Range]], forming the dramatic [[Columbia River Gorge]]. No other rivers except for the [[Klamath River|Klamath]] and [[Pit River]] completely breach the Cascades—the other rivers that flow through the range also originate in or very near the mountains. The headwaters and upper course of the Pit River are on the [[Modoc Plateau]]; downstream the Pit cuts a canyon through the southern reaches of the Cascades. In contrast, the Columbia cuts through the range nearly a thousand miles from its source in the Rocky Mountains. The gorge is known for its strong and steady winds, scenic beauty, and its role as an important transportation link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071209080927/http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/columbia/ |url = http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/columbia/ |publisher = U.S. Department of Agriculture: [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] |archivedate = December 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The river continues west, bending sharply to the north-northwest near Portland and [[Vancouver, Washington]], at the [[Willamette River]] confluence. Here the river slows considerably, dropping sediment that might otherwise form a [[river delta]]. Near [[Longview, Washington]] and the [[Cowlitz River]] confluence, the river turns west again. The Columbia empties into the Pacific Ocean just west of [[Astoria, Oregon]], over the [[Columbia Bar]], a shifting [[sandbar]] that makes the river's mouth one of the most hazardous stretches of water to navigate in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Columbia Pilot Pay Attracts Port's Eye |first = Ben |last = Jacklet |url = http://www.portlandtribune.com/news/story.php?story_id=26722 |work = [[Portland Tribune]] |date = October 19, 2004 |access-date = June 14, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120206213802/http://www.portlandtribune.com/news/story.php?story_id=26722 |archivedate = February 6, 2012 |url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the danger and the many shipwrecks near the mouth, it acquired a reputation as the &quot;Graveyard of Ships&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Gibbs |first = Rafe |title = Guarding the Graveyard of Ships |url = https://books.google.com/?id=oN0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January#v=onepage&amp;q=1954%20Popular%20Mechanics%20January&amp;f=true |journal = Popular Mechanics |date = May 1954 |pages = 128–32 |access-date = March 1, 2012 |via = Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[rift]]ing of [[Pangaea]], due to the process of [[plate tectonics]], pushed North America away from Europe and Africa and into the [[Panthalassic Ocean]] (ancestor to the modern Pacific Ocean), the Pacific Northwest was not part of the continent. As the North American continent moved westward, the [[Farallon Plate]] [[subduction|subducted]] under its western margin. As the plate subducted, it carried along [[island arc]]s which were accreted to the North American continent, resulting in the creation of the Pacific Northwest between 150 and 90&amp;nbsp;million years ago.{{sfn|Bishop|2003|pp=13–14}} The general outline of the Columbia Basin was not complete until between 60 and 40&amp;nbsp;million years ago, but it lay under a large inland sea later subject to uplift.&lt;ref name=&quot;bonneville geology&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title = The Geologic Story of the Columbia Basin |url = https://www.bpa.gov/power/pl/columbia/4-geology.htm |publisher = Bonneville Power Administration |access-date = June 20, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 50 and 20&amp;nbsp;million years ago, from the [[Eocene]] through the [[Miocene]] eras, tremendous volcanic eruptions frequently modified much of the landscape traversed by the Columbia.{{sfn|Bishop|2003|pp=86, 128}} The lower reaches of the ancestral river passed through a valley near where [[Mount Hood]] later arose.

Horses, originally acquired from [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México|Spanish New Mexico]], spread widely via native trade networks, reaching the Shoshone of the [[Snake River Plain]] by 1700. The Nez Perce, Cayuse, and [[Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation|Flathead]] people acquired their first horses around 1730.{{sfn|Meinig|1995|pp=23–25, 493, 496}}{{sfn|Boyd|1996|pp=12–13}} Along with horses came aspects of the emerging [[Plains Indian|plains culture]], such as equestrian and [[horse training]] skills, greatly increased mobility, hunting efficiency, trade over long distances, intensified warfare, the linking of wealth and prestige to horses and war, and the rise of large and powerful tribal confederacies. The Nez Perce and Cayuse kept large herds and made annual long-distance trips to the [[Great Plains]] for [[bison]] hunting, adopted the plains culture to a significant degree, and became the main conduit through which horses and the plains culture diffused into the Columbia River region. Other peoples acquired horses and aspects of the plains culture unevenly. The Yakama, Umatilla, Palus, Spokane, and Coeur d'Alene maintained sizable herds of horses and adopted some of the plains cultural characteristics, but fishing and fish-related economies remained important. Less affected groups included the [[Molala people|Molala]], [[Klickitat (tribe)|Klickitat]], [[Wenatchi]], Okanagan, and [[Sinkiuse-Columbia]] peoples, who owned small numbers of horses and adopted few plains culture features. Some groups remained essentially unaffected, such as the [[Sanpoil (tribe)|Sanpoil]] and [[Nespelem (tribe)|Nespelem]] people, whose culture remained centered on fishing.{{sfn|Meinig|1995|pp=23–25, 493, 496}}

Natives of the region encountered foreigners at several times and places during the 18th&amp;nbsp;and 19th&amp;nbsp;centuries. European and American vessels explored the coastal area around the mouth of the river in the late 18th&amp;nbsp;century, trading with local natives. The contact would prove devastating to the Indian tribes; a large portion of their population was wiped out by a [[smallpox]] epidemic. Canadian explorer [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]] crossed what is now interior British Columbia in 1793.{{sfn|Boyd|1996|pp=12–13}} From 1805 to 1807, the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] entered the [[Oregon Country]] along the [[Clearwater River (Idaho)|Clearwater]] and Snake rivers, and encountered numerous small settlements of natives. Their records recount tales of hospitable traders who were not above stealing small items from the visitors. They also noted brass teakettles, a British musket, and other artifacts that had been obtained in trade with coastal tribes.{{sfn|Ulrich|2007|p=8}} From the earliest contact with westerners, the natives of the mid- and lower Columbia were not tribal, but instead congregated in social units no larger than a village, and more often at a family level; these units would shift with the season as people moved about, following the salmon catch up and down the river's tributaries.{{sfn|Boyd|1996|pp=4–7}}

Some historians believe that Japanese or Chinese vessels blown off course reached the Northwest Coast long before Europeans—possibly as early as 219&amp;nbsp;[[Before Common Era|BCE]]. Historian Derek Hayes claims that &quot;It is a near certainty that Japanese or Chinese people arrived on the northwest coast long before any European.&quot;{{sfn|Hayes|1999|p=9}} It is unknown whether they landed near the Columbia.

In the 18th&amp;nbsp;century, there was strong interest in discovering a [[Northwest Passage]] that would permit navigation between the Atlantic (or inland North America) and the Pacific Ocean. Many ships in the area, especially those under Spanish and British command, searched the northwest coast for a large river that might connect to [[Hudson Bay]] or the [[Missouri River]]. The first documented European discovery of the Columbia River was that of [[Bruno de Heceta]], who in 1775 sighted the river's mouth. On the advice of his officers, he did not explore it, as he was short-staffed and the current was strong. He considered it a bay, and called it ''Ensenada de Asunción''.

What happened next would form the basis for decades of both cooperation and dispute between British and American exploration of, and ownership claim to, the region. [[Royal Navy]] commander [[George Vancouver]] sailed past the mouth in April 1792 and observed a change in the water's color, but he accepted Meares' report and continued on his journey northward.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistLinkGray&quot; /&gt; Later that month, Vancouver encountered the American captain [[Robert Gray (sea-captain)|Robert Gray]] at the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]].

Because the Columbia was at the same latitude as the headwaters of the Missouri River, there was some speculation that Gray and Vancouver had discovered the long-sought Northwest Passage. A 1798 British map showed a dotted line connecting the Columbia with the Missouri.{{sfn|Hayes|1999a|nopp=}} When the American explorers [[Meriwether Lewis]] and [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]] charted the vast, unmapped lands of the [[American West]] in their [[Lewis and Clark expedition|overland expedition]] (1803–05), they found no passage between the rivers. After crossing the [[Rocky Mountains]], Lewis and Clark built [[dugout canoe]]s and paddled down the Snake River, reaching the Columbia near the present-day Tri-Cities, Washington. They explored a few miles upriver, as far as [[Bateman Island]], before heading down the Columbia, concluding their journey at the river's mouth and establishing [[Fort Clatsop]], a short-lived establishment that was occupied for less than three months.{{sfn|Hayes|1999a|nopp=}}

Canadian explorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]], of the [[North West Company]], spent the winter of 1807–08 at [[Kootanae House]] near the source of the Columbia at present-day Invermere, British Columbia. Over the next few years he explored much of the river and its northern tributaries. In 1811 he traveled down the Columbia to the Pacific Ocean, arriving at the mouth just after [[John Jacob Astor]]'s [[Pacific Fur Company]] had founded Astoria. On his return to the north, Thompson explored the one remaining part of the river he had not yet seen, becoming the first Euro-descended person to travel the entire length of the river.{{sfn|Hayes|1999a|nopp=}}

In 1825, the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) established [[Fort Vancouver]] on the bank of the Columbia, in what is now Vancouver, Washington, as the headquarters of the company's [[Columbia District]], which encompassed everything west of the Rocky Mountains. [[Factor (agent)|Chief Factor]] [[John McLoughlin]], a physician who had been in the fur trade since 1804, was appointed superintendent of the Columbia District. The HBC reoriented its Columbia District operations toward the Pacific Ocean via the Columbia, which became the region's main trunk route.{{sfn|Meinig|1995|pp=73–79}} In the early 1840s Americans began to colonize the Oregon country in large numbers via the [[Oregon Trail]], despite the HBC's efforts to discourage American settlement in the region.

This prompted the 1846 construction of the [[Barlow Road]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eotot&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.endoftheoregontrail.org/road2oregon/sa21barlowrd.html |title = The Final Leg of the Trail |publisher = End of the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081012035621/http://www.endoftheoregontrail.org/road2oregon/sa21barlowrd.html |archivedate = October 12, 2008 |url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Treaty of 1818]] the United States and Britain agreed that both nations were to enjoy equal rights in Oregon Country for 10&amp;nbsp;years. By 1828, when the so-called &quot;joint occupation&quot; was renewed for an indefinite period, it seemed probable that the lower Columbia River would in time become the border between the two nations. For years the Hudson's Bay Company successfully maintained control of the Columbia River and American attempts to gain a foothold were fended off. In the 1830s, American religious missions were established at several locations in the lower Columbia River region. In the 1840s a mass migration of American settlers undermined British control. The Hudson's Bay Company tried to maintain dominance by shifting from the fur trade, which was in decline, to exporting other goods such as salmon and lumber. Colonization schemes were attempted, but failed to match the scale of American settlement. Americans generally settled south of the Columbia, mainly in the Willamette Valley. The Hudson's Bay Company tried to establish settlements north of the river, but nearly all the British colonists moved south to the Willamette Valley. The hope that the British colonists might dilute the American presence in the valley failed in the face of the overwhelming number of American settlers. These developments rekindled the issue of &quot;joint occupation&quot; and the [[Oregon boundary dispute|boundary dispute]]. While some British interests, especially the Hudson's Bay Company, fought for a boundary along the Columbia River, the [[Oregon Treaty]] of 1846 set the boundary at the 49th&amp;nbsp;parallel. As part of the treaty, the British retained all areas north of the line while the U.S. acquired the south. The Columbia River became much of the border between the U.S. territories of [[Oregon Territory|Oregon]] and [[Washington Territory|Washington]].{{sfn|Meinig|1995|pp=72–73, 75, 117, 146–47, 169–70}} [[Oregon]] became a U.S. state in 1859, while [[Washington (state)|Washington]] later entered into the Union in 1889.

By the turn of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, the difficulty of navigating the Columbia was seen as an impediment to the economic development of the [[Inland Empire (Pacific Northwest)|Inland Empire]] region east of the Cascades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Reeder |first = Lee B. |title = Open the Columbia to the Sea |publisher = Center for Columbia River History |url = http://www.ccrh.org/comm/umatilla/primary/opensea.htm |access-date = April 3, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160306103837/http://ccrh.org/comm/umatilla/primary/opensea.htm |archivedate = March 6, 2016 |url-status = dead }} URL is to a reprint of a 1902 magazine edition of the ''Pendleton Daily Tribune'' published by E.

American captain Robert Gray and British captain George Vancouver, who explored the river in 1792, proved that it was possible to cross the Columbia Bar. Many of the challenges associated with that feat remain today; even with modern engineering alterations to the mouth of the river, the strong currents and shifting sandbar make it dangerous to pass between the river and the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Crossing the Columbia Bar |publisher = Oregon State Marine Board |url = http://www.oregon.gov/OSMB/library/docs/30219_osmb_columbia_bar.pdf |access-date = September 4, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150806235653/http://www.oregon.gov/OSMB/library/docs/30219_osmb_columbia_bar.pdf |url-status = dead |archivedate = August 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opening the passage to Lewiston ===
As early as 1881, industrialists proposed altering the natural channel of the Columbia to improve navigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;opbtimeline&quot; /&gt; Changes to the river over the years have included the construction of [[jetty|jetties]] at the river's mouth, [[dredging]], and the construction of [[canal]]s and [[lock (water transport)|navigation locks]]. Today, ocean freighters can travel upriver as far as Portland and Vancouver, and barges can reach as far inland as [[Lewiston, Idaho]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ccrh-hist&quot; /&gt;

The shifting Columbia Bar makes passage between the river and the Pacific Ocean difficult and dangerous, and numerous rapids along the river hinder navigation. ''Pacific Graveyard,'' a 1964 book by [[James A. Gibbs]], describes the many shipwrecks near the mouth of the Columbia.{{sfn|Gibbs|1964|nopp=}} Jetties, first constructed in 1886,&lt;ref name=&quot;opbtimeline&quot; /&gt; extend the river's channel into the ocean. Strong currents and the shifting sandbar remain a threat to ships entering the river and necessitate continuous maintenance of the jetties.

In 1891 the Columbia was dredged to enhance shipping. The channel between the ocean and Portland and Vancouver was deepened from {{convert|17|ft|m}} to {{convert|25|ft|m}}. ''[[The Columbian]]'' called for the channel to be deepened to {{convert|40|ft|m}} as early as 1905, but that depth was not attained until 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Rewind—Editorials from Our Archives: 1905: 40-Ft.

An extensive system of locks allowed ships and barges to pass easily from one reservoir to the next. A [[Snake River#Dams|navigation channel reaching to Lewiston, Idaho]], along the Columbia and Snake rivers, was completed in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;opbtimeline&quot; /&gt; Among the main commodities are wheat and other grains, mainly for export.

Efforts to maintain and improve the navigation channel have continued to the present day. In 1990 a new round of studies examined the possibility of further dredging on the lower Columbia.

Irrigation efforts resumed after the war.

River development occurred within the structure of the 1909 [[International Boundary Waters Treaty]] between the US and Canada. The [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Rivers and Harbors Act#List of later acts|Rivers and Harbors Act of 1925]], which directed the Army Corps of Engineers and the [[Federal Power Commission]] to explore the development of the nation's rivers. This prompted agencies to conduct the first formal financial analysis of hydroelectric development; the reports produced by various agencies were presented in House Document&amp;nbsp;308. Those reports, and subsequent related reports, are referred to as [[308 Reports]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NWCflood&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title = Floods and Flood Control |url = http://www.nwcouncil.org/history/Floods.asp |publisher = Northwest Council |access-date = October 6, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130210064639/http://www.nwcouncil.org/history/Floods.asp |archivedate = February 10, 2013 |url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1920s, political forces in the Northwestern United States generally favored private development of hydroelectric dams along the Columbia. But the overwhelming victories of gubernatorial candidate [[George W. Joseph]] in the [[Oregon gubernatorial election, 1930|1930 Republican primary]], and later his law partner [[Julius Meier]], were understood to demonstrate strong public support for public ownership of dams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = The Movement for Public Ownership of Power in Oregon |first = Emerson P. |last = Schmidt |journal = The Journal of Land &amp; Public Utility Economics |volume = 7 |date = February 1931 |issue = 1 |pages = 52–60 |jstor = 3138633  |doi = 10.2307/3138633 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, President [[Franklin D.

By that time local communities had become wary of federal hydroelectric projects, and sought local control of new developments; a [[public utility district]] in [[Grant County, Washington]], ultimately began construction of the dam at Priest Rapids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Priest Rapids Hydroelectric Project No. 2114 Public Utility District No. 2 of Grant County Final Application for New License, Exhibit B: Project Operation and Resource Utilization |date = October 2003 |url = http://www.gcpud.org/pudDocuments/naturalResourcesDocs/disk3/GCPUDFLA3D/contents.pdf |access-date = October 5, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130117052759/http://www.gcpud.org/pudDocuments/naturalResourcesDocs/disk3/GCPUDFLA3D/contents.pdf |archivedate = January 17, 2013 |url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, the United States and Canada signed the [[Columbia River Treaty]], which focused on flood control and the maximization of downstream power generation.&lt;ref name=&quot;NWCflood&quot; /&gt; Canada agreed to build dams and provide reservoir storage, and the United States agreed to deliver to Canada one-half of the increase in US&amp;nbsp;downstream power benefits as estimated five years in advance.&lt;ref name=&quot;treaty&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title = Treaty Relating to Cooperative Development of the Water Resources of the Columbia River Basin (with Annexes) |publisher = Center for Columbia River History |url = http://www.ccrh.org/comm/river/docs/cotreaty.htm |access-date = September 4, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160405143110/http://www.ccrh.org/comm/river/docs/cotreaty.htm |archivedate = April 5, 2016 |url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's obligation was met by building three dams (two on the Columbia, and one on the [[Duncan River]]), the last of which was completed in 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;3 dams&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title = Dams of the Columbia Basin &amp; Their Effects on the Native Fishery |publisher = Center for Columbia River History |url = http://www.ccrh.org/comm/river/dams9.htm |access-date = September 4, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150915182548/http://www.ccrh.org/comm/river/dams9.htm |archivedate = September 15, 2015 |url-status = dead |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the main stem of the Columbia River has 14&amp;nbsp;dams, of which three are in Canada and 11 in the US.

The larger US dams are owned and operated by the federal government (some by the Army Corps of Engineers and some by the Bureau of Reclamation), while the smaller dams are operated by public utility districts, and private power companies. The federally operated system is known as the [[Federal Columbia River Power System]], which includes 31&amp;nbsp;dams on the Columbia and its [[List of tributaries of the Columbia River|tributaries]]. The system has altered the seasonal flow of the river in order to meet higher electricity demands during the winter. At the beginning of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, roughly 75&amp;nbsp;percent of the Columbia's flow occurred in the summer, between April and September. By 1980, the summer proportion had been lowered to about 50&amp;nbsp;percent, essentially eliminating the seasonal pattern.{{sfn|National Research Council (U.S.)|2004|pp=4, 22}}

The [[Bureau of Reclamation]]'s Columbia Basin Project focused on the generally dry region of central Washington known as the Columbia Basin, which features rich [[loess]] soil.&lt;ref name=&quot;basinproj&quot; /&gt; Several groups developed competing proposals, and in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the Columbia Basin Project. The Grand Coulee Dam was the project's central component; upon completion, it pumped water up from the Columbia to fill the formerly dry Grand Coulee, forming Banks Lake. By 1935, the intended height of the dam was increased from a range between {{convert|200|and|300|ft|m}} to {{convert|500|ft|m|}}, a height that would extend the lake impounded by the dam all the way to the Canada–US border; the project had grown from a local [[New Deal]] relief measure to a major national project.{{sfn|Pitzer|1994|nopp=}}

The project's initial purpose was irrigation, but the onset of World War&amp;nbsp;II created a high demand for electricity, mainly for aluminum production and for the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s at the Hanford Site. Irrigation began in 1951.&lt;ref name=&quot;USNPS&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title = Lake Roosevelt, Administrative History |publisher = U.S. National Park Service: Department of the Interior |chapter-url = https://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/laro/adhi/adhit.htm |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070716185155/https://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/laro/adhi/adhit.htm |archivedate = July 16, 2007 |chapter = Chapter 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project provides water to more than {{convert|670|e3acre|km2}} of fertile but arid land in central Washington,&lt;ref name=&quot;basinproj&quot; /&gt; transforming the region into a major agricultural center.

Since 1750, the Columbia has experienced six multi-year droughts. The longest, lasting 12&amp;nbsp;years in the mid‑19th century, reduced the river's flow to 20&amp;nbsp;percent below average. Scientists have expressed concern that a similar drought would have grave consequences in a region so dependent on the Columbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;UWdrought&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last = Hines |first = Sandra |last2 = Sands |first2 = Yasmeen |last3 = Hunt |first3 = Lori Bona |publisher = University of Washington Office of News and Information |title = Tree-Ring Data Reveals Multiyear Droughts Unlike Any in Recent Memory |date = February 14, 2005 |url = http://www.washington.edu/news/archive/id/8220 |access-date = January 26, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121010133118/http://www.washington.edu/news/archive/id/8220 |archivedate = October 10, 2012 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992–1993, a lesser drought affected farmers, hydroelectric power producers, shippers, and wildlife managers.&lt;ref name=&quot;UWdrought&quot; /&gt;

Many farmers in central Washington build dams on their property for irrigation and to control frost on their crops. The Washington Department of Ecology, using new techniques involving aerial photographs, estimated there may be as many as a hundred such dams in the area, most of which are illegal. Six such dams have failed in recent years, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage to crops and public roads. Fourteen farms in the area have gone through the permitting process to build such dams legally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = McNiel |first = Michelle |title = State Cracking Down on Illegal Frost-Control Dams |date = March 21, 2008 |work = Wenatchee World }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sockeye salmon]], [[Coho salmon|Coho]] and [[Chinook salmon|Chinook]] (also known as &quot;king&quot;) salmon, and [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]], all of the genus ''[[Oncorhynchus]]'', are ocean fish that migrate up the rivers at the end of their life cycles to spawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Salmon and Steelhead |publisher = Bonneville Power Administration |url = https://www.bpa.gov/efw/FishWildlife/SalmonSteelhead/Pages/default.aspx |access-date = July 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[White sturgeon]], which take 15 to 25&amp;nbsp;years to mature, typically migrate between the ocean and the upstream habitat several times during their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = White Sturgeon |url = http://www.psmfc.org/habitat/edu_wsturg_fact.html |publisher = Pacific Coast Marine Habitat Program |year = 1996 |access-date = September 4, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180521/http://www.psmfc.org/habitat/edu_wsturg_fact.html |archivedate = March 3, 2016 |url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salmon populations declined dramatically after the establishment of [[salmon cannery|canneries]] in 1867. In 1879 it was reported that 545,450 salmon, with an average weight of {{convert|22|lb|kg}} were caught (in a recent season) and mainly canned for export to England. A can weighing {{convert|1|lb|kg}} could be sold for [[penny (British pre-decimal coin)|8d or 9d]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Editorial |work = The Cornishman |issue = 75 |date = December 18, 1879 |page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1908, there was widespread concern about the decline of salmon and sturgeon. In that year, the people of Oregon passed two laws under their newly instituted program of [[Oregon System|citizens' initiatives]] limiting fishing on the Columbia and other rivers.{{sfn|Benson|1908|pp=44–57}} Then in 1948, another initiative banned the use of [[seine fishing|seine nets]] (devices already used by Native Americans, and refined by later settlers) altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Smith |first = Courtland L. |title = Seine Fishing |url = http://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/seine_fishing/ |work = [[The Oregon Encyclopedia]] |publisher = Portland State University and the Oregon Historical Society |date = April 17, 2016 |access-date = June 19, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dams interrupt the migration of anadromous fish. Salmon and steelhead return to the streams in which they were born to spawn; where dams prevent their return, entire populations of salmon die. Some of the Columbia and Snake River dams employ fish ladders, which are effective to varying degrees at allowing these fish to travel upstream. Another problem exists for the juvenile salmon headed downstream to the ocean. Previously, this journey would have taken two to three weeks. With river currents slowed by the dams, and the Columbia converted from wild river to a series of slackwater pools, the journey can take several months, which increases the mortality rate.{{sfn|Mueller|1997|p=229}} In some cases, the Army Corps of Engineers transports juvenile fish downstream by truck or river barge. The Chief Joseph Dam and several dams on the Columbia's tributaries entirely block migration, and there are no migrating fish on the river above these dams. Sturgeon have different migration habits and can survive without ever visiting the ocean. In many upstream areas cut off from the ocean by dams, sturgeon simply live upstream of the dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Upper Columbia White Sturgeon |url = http://www.uppercolumbiasturgeon.org/ |publisher = Upper Columbia White Sturgeon Recovery Initiative |year = 2007 |access-date = September 4, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170611145152/http://www.uppercolumbiasturgeon.org/ |archivedate = June 11, 2017 |url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all fish have suffered from the modifications to the river; the [[northern pikeminnow]] (formerly known as the ''squawfish'') thrives in the warmer, slower water created by the dams. Research in the mid-1980s found that juvenile salmon were suffering substantially from the predatory pikeminnow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = The Northern Pikeminnow Management Program |url = http://www.dfw.state.or.us/fish/OSCRP/CRI/Pikeminnow.asp |publisher = Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife |date = August 25, 2008 |access-date = September 20, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170109030133/http://www.dfw.state.or.us/fish/OSCRP/CRI/Pikeminnow.asp |archivedate = January 9, 2017 |url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1990, in the interest of protecting salmon, a &quot;bounty&quot; program was established to reward anglers for catching pikeminnow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Fishing for Dollars |first = Chris |last = Hansen |work = The Register-Guard |date = July 7, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pollution ===
In southeastern Washington, a {{convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of the river passes through the [[Hanford Site]], established in 1943 as part of the [[Manhattan Project]]. The site served as a [[plutonium]] production complex, with nine [[nuclear reactor]]s and related facilities along the banks of the river. From 1944 to 1971, pump systems drew cooling water from the river and, after treating this water for use by the reactors, returned it to the river. Before being released back into the river, the used water was held in large tanks known as retention basins for up to six hours. Longer-lived [[isotope]]s were not affected by this retention, and several [[becquerel|terabecquerels]] entered the river every day. By 1957, the eight plutonium production reactors at Hanford dumped a daily average of 50,000&amp;nbsp;[[curie]]s of radioactive material into the Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Washington Physicians for Social Responsibility |title = Hanford History |year = 2007 |url = http://www.psr.org/chapters/washington/hanford/hanford-history.html |access-date = April 4, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170619003042/http://www.psr.org/chapters/washington/hanford/hanford-history.html |archivedate = June 19, 2017 |url-status = dead |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These releases were kept secret by the federal government until the release of declassified documents in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;HHIN&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author = Hanford Health Information Network |year = 2000 |title = An Overview of Hanford and Radiation Health Effects |url = http://www.doh.wa.gov/hanford/publications/overview/overview.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100823040735/http://www.doh.wa.gov/hanford/publications/overview/overview.html |archivedate = August 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiation was measured downstream as far west as the Washington and [[Oregon]] coasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Radiation Flowed 200 Miles to Sea, Study Finds |work = The New York Times |url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0D8173FF934A25754C0A964958260 |date = July 17, 1992 |access-date = January 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have also found significant levels of toxins in fish and the waters they inhabit within the basin. Accumulation of toxins in fish threatens the survival of fish species, and human consumption of these fish can lead to health problems. Water quality is also an important factor in the survival of other wildlife and plants that grow in the Columbia River drainage basin. The states, Indian tribes, and federal government are all engaged in efforts to restore and improve the water, land, and air quality of the Columbia River drainage basin and have committed to work together to enhance and accomplish critical ecosystem restoration efforts.

In the United States and Canada the term watershed is often used to mean drainage basin. The term ''Columbia Basin'' is used to refer not only to the entire drainage basin but also to subsets of the river's full watershed, such as the relatively flat and unforested area in eastern Washington bounded by the Cascades, the Rocky Mountains, and the Blue Mountains.{{sfn|Meinig|1995|p=4}} Within the watershed are diverse landforms including mountains, arid plateaus, river valleys, rolling uplands, and deep gorges. [[Grand Teton National Park]] lies in the watershed, as well as parts of [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]], [[Mount Rainier National Park]], and [[North Cascades National Park]]. Canadian National Parks in the watershed include [[Kootenay National Park]], [[Yoho National Park]], [[Glacier National Park (Canada)|Glacier National Park]], and [[Mount Revelstoke National Park]]. Hells Canyon, the deepest gorge in North America,&lt;ref name=&quot;BLM&quot; /&gt; and the [[Columbia Gorge]] are in the watershed. Vegetation varies widely, ranging from [[Tsuga heterophylla|western hemlock]] and [[Thuja plicata|western redcedar]] in the moist regions to [[sagebrush]] in the arid regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISAB&quot; /&gt; The watershed provides habitat for 609&amp;nbsp;known fish and wildlife species, including the [[bull trout]], [[bald eagle]], [[gray wolf]], [[grizzly bear]], and [[Canada lynx]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BLM&quot; /&gt;

The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) divides the waters of the Columbia and its tributaries into three [[freshwater ecoregion]]s, naming them Columbia Glaciated, Columbia Unglaciated, and Upper Snake. The Columbia Glaciated ecoregion, making up about a third of the total watershed, lies in the north and was covered with ice sheets during the Pleistocene. The ecoregion includes the mainstem Columbia north of the Snake River and tributaries such as the Yakima, Okanagan, Pend Oreille, Clark Fork, and Kootenay rivers. The effects of [[glacier|glaciation]] include a number of large lakes and a relatively low diversity of freshwater fish. The Upper Snake ecoregion is defined as the Snake River watershed above [[Shoshone Falls]], which totally blocks fish migration. This region has 14&amp;nbsp;species of fish, many of which are [[endemism|endemic]]. The Columbia Unglaciated ecoregion makes up the rest of the watershed. It includes the mainstem Columbia below the Snake River and tributaries such as the Salmon, John Day, Deschutes, and lower Snake Rivers. Of the three ecoregions it is the richest in terms of freshwater species diversity. There are 35&amp;nbsp;species of fish, of which four are endemic. There are also high levels of mollusk endemism.{{sfn|Abell|Olsen|Dinerstein|Hurley|2000|pp=166–69}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.feow.org/ecoregion_details.php?eco=120 |title = Columbia Glaciated |publisher = World Wide Fund for Nature and The Nature Conservancy |year = 2008 |access-date = September 25, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131101053119/http://www.feow.org/ecoregion_details.php?eco=120 |archivedate = November 1, 2013 |url-status = dead }}; {{cite web |url = http://www.feow.org/ecoregion_details.php?eco=121 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131101052230/http://www.feow.org/ecoregion_details.php?eco=121 |archivedate = November 1, 2013 |url-status = dead |title = Columbia Unglaciated |publisher = World Wide Fund for Nature and The Nature Conservancy |year = 2008 |access-date = September 25, 2008 }}; {{cite web |url = http://www.feow.org/ecoregion_details.php?eco=122 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131101062512/http://www.feow.org/ecoregion_details.php?eco=122 |archivedate = November 1, 2013 |url-status = dead |title = Upper Snake |publisher = World Wide Fund for Nature and The Nature Conservancy |year = 2008 |access-date = September 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, over eight million people lived within the Columbia's drainage basin. Of this total about 3.5&amp;nbsp;million people lived in Oregon, 2.1&amp;nbsp;million in Washington, 1.7&amp;nbsp;million in Idaho, half a million in British Columbia, and 0.4&amp;nbsp;million in Montana. Population in the watershed has been rising for many decades and is projected to rise to about 10&amp;nbsp;million by 2030. The highest population densities are found west of the Cascade Mountains along the [[Interstate 5|I-5]] corridor, especially in the Portland-Vancouver urban area. High densities are also found around [[Spokane, Washington]], and [[Boise, Idaho]]. Although much of the watershed is rural and sparsely populated, areas with recreational and scenic values are growing rapidly. The central Oregon county of [[Deschutes County, Oregon|Deschutes]] is the fastest-growing in the state. Populations have also been growing just east of the Cascades in central Washington around the city of [[Yakima, Washington|Yakima]] and the Tri-Cities area. Projections for the coming decades assume growth throughout the watershed, including the interior. The Canadian part of the [[Okanagan]] subbasin is also growing rapidly.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISAB&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Bilby |first1 = Robert |last2 = Hanna |first2 = Susan |last3 = Huntly |first3 = Nancy |authorlink3=Nancy Huntly|title = Human Population Impacts on Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife |publisher = Independent Scientific Advisory Board |date = July 8, 2007 |url = http://www.nwcouncil.org/library/isab/isab2007-3.pdf |access-date = September 15, 2008 |display-authors = etal |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130117052954/http://www.nwcouncil.org/library/isab/isab2007-3.pdf |archivedate = January 17, 2013 |url-status = dead |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate varies greatly from place to place within the watershed. Elevation ranges from sea level at the river mouth to more than {{convert|14000|ft|m}} in the mountains, and temperatures vary with elevation. The highest peak is [[Mount Rainier]], at {{convert|14411|ft|m}}. High elevations have cold winters and short cool summers; interior regions are subject to great temperature variability and severe droughts. Over some of the watershed, especially west of the Cascade Mountains, precipitation maximums occur in winter, when Pacific storms come ashore. Atmospheric conditions block the flow of moisture in summer, which is generally dry except for occasional thunderstorms in the interior.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISAB&quot; /&gt; In some of the eastern parts of the watershed, especially [[shrub-steppe]] regions with [[Continental climate]] patterns, precipitation maximums occur in early summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;nwdwm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title = Columbia River Water Management Report, Chapter 2 |publisher = U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Water Management Division |year = 2005 |url = http://www.nwd-wc.usace.army.mil/crwmg/reports/bluebook/2005/Chapter2%202005.pdf |access-date = September 19, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140812175319/http://www.nwd-wc.usace.army.mil/crwmg/reports/bluebook/2005/Chapter2%202005.pdf |archivedate = August 12, 2014 |url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Annual precipitation varies from more than {{convert|100|in|cm}} a year in the Cascades to less than {{convert|8|in|cm}} in the interior.

Several major North American drainage basins and many minor ones share a common border with the Columbia River's drainage basin. To the east, in northern Wyoming and Montana, the [[Continental Divide]] separates the Columbia watershed from the Mississippi-Missouri watershed, which empties into the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. To the northeast, mostly along the southern border between British Columbia and [[Alberta]], the Continental Divide separates the Columbia watershed from the [[Nelson River|Nelson]]-[[Lake Winnipeg]]-[[Saskatchewan River|Saskatchewan]] watershed, which empties into Hudson Bay. The Mississippi and Nelson watersheds are separated by the [[Laurentian Divide]], which meets the Continental Divide at [[Triple Divide Peak (Montana)|Triple Divide Peak]] near the headwaters of the Columbia's [[Flathead River]] tributary.

The river and the low hills are in shade, while the hilltops and a large hillside in the foreground are sunlit.|The Deschutes River at its confluence with the Columbia]]
The Columbia receives more than 60&amp;nbsp;significant [[tributary|tributaries]]. The four largest that empty directly into the Columbia (measured either by [[discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] or by size of watershed) are the Snake River (mostly in Idaho), the Willamette River (in northwest Oregon), the Kootenay River (mostly in British Columbia), and the Pend Oreille River (mostly in northern Washington and Idaho, also known as the lower part of the Clark Fork). Each of these four averages more than {{convert|20000|cuft/s|m3/s}} and drains an area of more than {{convert|20000|mi2|km2}}.

The Snake is by far the largest tributary. Its watershed of {{convert|108000|mi2|km2}} is larger than the state of Idaho. Its discharge is roughly a third of the Columbia's at the rivers' confluence but compared to the Columbia upstream of the confluence the Snake is longer (113%) and has a larger drainage basin (104%).

The Pend Oreille River system (including its main tributaries, the Clark Fork and Flathead rivers) is also similar in size to the Columbia at their confluence. Compared to the Columbia River above the two rivers' confluence, the Pend Oreille-Clark-Flathead is nearly as long (about 86%), its basin about three-fourths as large (76%), and its discharge over a third (37%).&lt;ref name=&quot;wdr2007us&quot;&gt;Calculated mainly with data from: {{cite web |url = https://wdr.water.usgs.gov/wy2007/search.jsp |title = Water-resources data for the United States, Water Year 2007 |publisher = United States Geological Survey |access-date = September 16, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081206000126/http://wdr.water.usgs.gov/wy2007/search.jsp |archive-date = December 6, 2008 |url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
