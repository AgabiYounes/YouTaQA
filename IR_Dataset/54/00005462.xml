'''Politics of Cape Verde''' takes place in a framework of a [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]],&lt;ref name=&quot;SpL&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Neto |first1=Octávio Amorim |last2=Lobo |first2=Marina Costa |year=2010 |ssrn=1644026 |title=Between Constitutional Diffusion and Local Politics: Semi-Presidentialism in Portuguese-Speaking Countries |journal= |publisher=[[Social Science Research Network]] |volume= |issue= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby the [[Prime Minister of Cape Verde]] is the [[head of government]] and the [[List of heads of state of Cape Verde|President of the Republic of Cape Verde]] is the [[head of state]], and of a [[multi-party system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CRCV&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parlamento.cv/Downloads/Constituição%20da%20República%20de%20Cabo%20verde,%202010.pdf |year=2010 |language=Portuguese |title=Constituição da República de Cabo Verde |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=constitution&gt;{{cite web|url=http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/CapeVerde.pdf|title=Constitution of Cape Verde|year=1992|accessdate=2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Executive power]] is exercised by the [[President of Cape Verde|President]] and the [[Cabinet of Cape Verde|Government]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the Government and the [[National Assembly of Cape Verde|National Assembly]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.
The constitution first approved in 1980 and substantially revised in 1992 forms the basis of government organization. It declares that the government is the &quot;organ that defines, leads, and executes the general internal and external policy of the country&quot; and is responsible to the National Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cape Verde 1980 (rev. 1992)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Cape_Verde_1992?lang=en|website=Constitute|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political conditions==
Following independence in 1975, the [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]] (PAIGC) established a one-party political system. This became the [[African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde]] (PAICV) in 1980, as Cape Verde sought to distance itself from [[Guinea-Bissau]], following unrest in that country.

In 1991, following growing pressure for a more pluralistic society, multi-party elections were held for the first time. The opposition party, the [[Movement for Democracy (Cape Verde)|Movement for Democracy]] (''Movimento para a Democracia'', MpD), won the legislative elections, and formed the government. The MpD candidate also defeated the PAICV candidate in the presidential elections. In the 1996 elections, the MpD increased their majority, but in the 2001 the PAICV returned to power, winning both the Legislative and the Presidential elections.

Generally, Cape Verde enjoys a stable democratic system. The elections have been considered free and fair, there is a free press, and the rule of law is respected by the State. In acknowledgment of this, [[Freedom House]] granted Cape Verde two 1st in its annual [[Freedom in the World]] report, a perfect score. It is the only African country to receive this score.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The Prime Minister is the head of the government and as such proposes other ministers and secretaries of state. The Prime Minister is nominated by the National Assembly and appointed by the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Also in the legislative branch the [[National Assembly of Cape Verde|National Assembly]] (''Assembleia Nacional'') has 72 members, elected for a five-year term by [[proportional representation]].

Article 24 of the [[Cape Verde]] Constitution&lt;ref name=&quot;CRCV&quot;/&gt; states that 
*alinea 3.: &quot;''Rights not conferred to foreigners and [[wikt:apatrid|apatrid]]s may be attributed to citizens of countries with Portuguese as an official language, except for access to functions of sovereignty organs, service in the armed forces or in the diplomatic career.''&quot;
*alinea 4. &quot;''Active and passive electoral capacity can be attributed by law to foreigners and apatrid residents on the national territory for the elections of the members of the organs of the local municipalities.''&quot;

A law nr. 36/V/97 was promulgated on August 25, 1997 regulating the &quot;Statute of Lusophone Citizen&quot;, concerning nationals from any country member of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (article 2), stating in its article 3 that &quot;''The lusophone citizen with residence in Cape Verde is recognized the active and passive electoral capacity for municipal elections, under conditions of the law. The lusophone citizen with residence in Cape Verde has the right to exercise political activity related to his electoral capacity.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
