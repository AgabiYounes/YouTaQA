'''Chad''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Chad.ogg|tʃ|æ|d}}; {{lang-ar|تشاد}} {{transl|ar|Tshād}}, {{IPA-ar|tʃaːd}}; {{lang-fr|Tchad}}, {{IPA-fr|tʃa(d)|pron}}), officially known as the '''Republic of Chad''' ({{Lang-ar|جمهورية تشاد|links = no}} ''{{Transl|ar|Jumhūriyyat Tshād}}''; {{Lang-fr|République du Tchad|links = no}}), is a [[landlocked country]] in [[North Africa|north]]-[[central Africa]]. It is bordered by [[Libya]] to [[Chad–Libya border|the north]], [[Sudan]] to [[Chad–Sudan border|the east]], the [[Central African Republic]] to [[Central African Republic–Chad border|the south]], [[Cameroon]] to [[Cameroon–Chad border|the south-west]], [[Nigeria]] to [[Chad–Nigeria border|the southwest]] (at [[Lake Chad]]), and [[Niger]] to [[Chad–Niger border|the west]].

Chad has several regions: a [[desert]] zone in the north, an arid [[Sahel]]ian belt in the centre and a more fertile [[Sudanian Savanna]] zone in the south. [[Lake Chad]], after which the country is named, is the largest [[wetland]] in Chad and the second-largest in Africa. The capital [[N'Djamena]] is the largest [[List of cities in Chad|city]]. Chad's official languages are [[Arabic]] and [[French language|French]]. Chad is home to over 200 different [[List of ethnic groups in Chad|ethnic]] and [[Languages of Chad|linguistic groups]]. The most popular religion of Chad is [[Islam in Chad|Islam]] (at 55%), followed by [[Christianity in Chad|Christianity]] (at 40%). 

Beginning in the 7th millennium BC, human populations moved into the Chadian basin in great numbers. By the end of the 1st millennium AD, a series of states and empires had risen and fallen in Chad's Sahelian strip, each focused on controlling the [[trans-Saharan trade]] routes that passed through the region. 

[[France]] conquered the territory by 1920 and incorporated it as part of [[French Equatorial Africa]]. In 1960, Chad obtained independence under the leadership of [[François Tombalbaye]]. Resentment towards his policies in the Muslim north culminated in the eruption of a long-lasting [[The Tombalbaye Regime#Rebellion in Chad|civil war]] in 1965. In 1979 [[Transitional Government of National Unity|the rebels]] conquered the capital and put an end to the South's hegemony. But, the rebel commanders fought amongst themselves until [[Hissène Habré]] defeated his rivals. [[Chadian–Libyan conflict]] erupted in 1978 by the Libyan invasion which stopped in 1987 with a French military intervention ([[Operation Épervier]]). Hissène Habré was overthrown in turn in 1990 by his general [[Idriss Déby]]. With French support, a modernization of the [[Military of Chad|Chadian armed forces]] was initiated in 1991. Since 2003 the [[War in Darfur|Darfur crisis]] in Sudan has spilt over the border and [[Chadian Civil War (2005–2010)|destabilised the nation]]. Poor already, the nation and people struggled to accommodate the hundreds of thousands of [[Sudanese refugees]] who live in and around camps in eastern Chad.

While many political parties are active, power lies firmly in the hands of President Déby and his political party, the [[Patriotic Salvation Movement]]. Chad remains plagued by [[political violence]] and recurrent attempted [[coup d'état|coups d'état]]. Chad is one of the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|poorest]] and [[Corruption Perceptions Index|most corrupt]] countries in the world; most inhabitants live in poverty as [[Agriculture in Chad|subsistence herders and farmers]]. Since 2003 [[petroleum|crude oil]] has become the country's primary source of export earnings, superseding the traditional [[cotton]] industry.

== History ==
{{main|History of Chad}}

In the 7th millennium BCE, ecological conditions in the northern half of Chadian territory favored human settlement, and the region experienced a strong population increase. Some of the most important [[African archaeology|African archaeological]] sites are found in Chad, mainly in the [[Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region]]; some date to earlier than 2000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Collelo&quot;&gt;S. Collelo, ''Chad''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Group of Kanem-Bu warriors.jpg|thumb|Group of Kanem-Bu warriors. The [[Kanem-Bornu Empire]] controlled almost all of what is today Chad.|left]]

For more than 2,000 years, the Chadian Basin has been inhabited by agricultural and [[sedentism|sedentary]] people. The region became a crossroads of [[Civilization (series)|Civilizations]]. The earliest of these were the legendary [[Sao civilisation|Sao]], known from artifacts and oral histories. The Sao fell to the [[Kanem Empire]],&lt;ref name=Lange88&gt;D. Lange 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Decalo|Decalo]], p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; the first and longest-lasting of the empires that developed in Chad's [[Sahel]]ian strip by the end of the 1st millennium AD. Two other states in the region, [[Sultanate of Bagirmi]] and [[Wadai Empire]] emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries. The power of Kanem and its successors was based on control of the [[trans-Saharan trade]] routes that passed through the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collelo&quot;/&gt; These states, at least tacitly [[Islam in Africa|Muslim]], never extended their control to the southern grasslands except to [[Arab slave trade|raid for slaves]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; In Kanem, about a third of the population were slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 |title=Welcome to Encyclopædia Britannica's Guide to Black History |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=29 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006131931/http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 |archivedate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chadian soldier of WWII.jpg|thumb|left|A Chadian soldier fighting for [[Free French Forces|Free France]] during [[World War II]]. The Free French Forces included 15,000 soldiers from Chad.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Decalo|Decalo]], p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;]]

French colonial expansion led to the creation of the {{lang|fr|Territoire Militaire des Pays et Protectorats du Tchad}} in 1900. By 1920, France had secured full control of the colony and incorporated it as part of [[French Equatorial Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 8, 309&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colonial Chad|French rule in Chad]] was characterised by an absence of policies to unify the territory and sluggish modernisation compared to other French colonies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Decalo, pp. 8–9&quot;&gt;[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;

The French primarily viewed the colony as an unimportant source of untrained labour and raw cotton; France introduced large-scale cotton production in 1929. The colonial administration in Chad was critically understaffed and had to rely on the dregs of the French civil service. Only the [[Sara people|Sara]] of the south was governed effectively; French presence in the Islamic north and east was nominal. The educational system was affected by this neglect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collelo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Decalo, pp. 8–9&quot;/&gt;

After [[World War II]], France granted Chad the status of [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas territory]] and its inhabitants the right to elect representatives to the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] and a [[National Assembly (Chad)|Chadian assembly]]. The largest political party was the [[Chadian Progressive Party]] ({{lang-fr|Parti Progressiste Tchadien}}, PPT), based in the southern half of the colony. Chad was granted independence on 11 August 1960 with the PPT's leader, [[François Tombalbaye]], an ethnic [[Sara people|Sara]], as its first [[Heads of state of Chad|president]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Collelo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 248–249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nolutshungu|Nolutshungu]], p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, Tombalbaye banned opposition parties and established a one-party system. Tombalbaye's autocratic rule and insensitive mismanagement exacerbated inter-ethnic tensions. In 1965, Muslims in the north, led by the [[FROLINAT|National Liberation Front of Chad]] ({{lang-fr|Front de libération nationale du Tchad}}, FRONILAT), began a [[Transitional Government of National Unity|civil war]]. Tombalbaye was [[1975 Chadian coup d'état|overthrown and killed]] in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917376,00.html &quot;Death of a Dictator&quot;], ''Time'', (28 April 1975). Accessed on 3 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but the insurgency continued. In 1979 the rebel factions led by [[Hissène Habré]] took the capital, and all central authority in the country collapsed. Armed factions, many from the north's rebellion, contended for power.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 12–16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nolutshungu|Nolutshungu]], p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

The disintegration of Chad caused the collapse of France's position in the country. [[Libya]] moved to fill the power vacuum and became [[Chadian-Libyan conflict|involved in Chad's civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nolutshungu|Nolutshungu]], p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Libya's adventure [[Toyota War|ended in disaster]] in 1987; the French-supported president, [[Hissène Habré]], evoked a united response from Chadians of a kind never seen before&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nolutshungu|Nolutshungu]], p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; and forced the Libyan army off Chadian soil.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Pollack|Pollack, Kenneth M.]] (2002); ''Arabs at War: Military Effectiveness, 1948–1991''. Lincoln: [[University of Nebraska Press]]. {{ISBN|0-8032-3733-2}}, pp. 391–397&lt;/ref&gt;

Habré consolidated his dictatorship through a power system that relied on corruption and violence with thousands of people estimated to have been killed under his rule.&lt;ref&gt;Macedo, Stephen (2006); ''Universal Jurisdiction: National Courts and the Prosecution of Serious Crimes Under International Law''. University of Pennsylvania Press. {{ISBN|0-8122-1950-3}}, pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AFR20/004/2001/en &quot;Chad: the Habré Legacy&quot;].

[[File:Idriss Deby with Obamas (cropped)2014.png|thumb|Despite internal political opposition, coup attempts, and a civil war, [[Idriss Déby]] has continuously ruled Chad since 1990.]]
Déby attempted to reconcile the rebel groups and reintroduced multiparty politics. Chadians approved a [[Constitution of Chad|new constitution]] by [[Chadian constitutional referendum, 1996|referendum]], and in 1996, Déby easily won a [[Chadian presidential election, 1996|competitive presidential election]]. He won a [[Chadian presidential election, 2001|second term]] five years later.&lt;ref&gt;East, Roger &amp; Richard J. Thomas (2003); ''Profiles of People in Power: The World's Government Leaders''. Routledge. {{ISBN|1-85743-126-X}}, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; [[Petroleum|Oil]] exploitation began in Chad in 2003, bringing with it hopes that Chad would at last have some chances of peace and prosperity. Instead, internal dissent worsened, and a [[War in Chad (2005–present)|new civil war]] broke out. Déby [[Chadian constitutional referendum, 2005|unilaterally modified the constitution]] to remove the two-term limit on the presidency; this caused an uproar among the civil society and opposition parties.&lt;ref&gt;IPS, &quot;{{lang|fr|Le pétrole au cœur des nouveaux soubresauts au Tchad}}&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Déby won [[Chadian presidential election, 2006|a third mandate]] in elections that the opposition boycotted. Ethnic violence in eastern Chad has increased; the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] has warned that a [[genocide]] like that in [[Darfur conflict|Darfur]] may yet occur in Chad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6367545.stm Chad may face genocide, UN warns].

Chad is currently one of the leading partners in a [[Multinational Joint Task Force|West African coalition]] in the [[Boko Haram insurgency|fight]] against [[Boko Haram]]. Chad has also been included on Presidential Proclamation 9645, the expanded version of United States president [[Donald Trump|Donald Trump's]] [[Executive Order 13780]], which restricts entry by nationals from 8 countries, including Chad, into the US.

[[File:Lake in the Ounianga Basin in Chad.jpg|thumb|This astronaut photograph features one of the largest of a series of ten mostly fresh water lakes in the Ounianga Basin in the heart of the Sahara Desert of northeastern Chad.]]

Chad is bounded to the north by [[Libya]], to the east by [[Sudan]], to the west by [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]], and to the south by the [[Central African Republic]]. The country's capital is {{convert|1060|km|mi}} from the nearest seaport, [[Douala]], Cameroon.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UNHCHR&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/0/48f4be12f6c55e5a802565cd005d4e0e?Opendocument Chad]&quot;. Human Rights Instruments. [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]]. 12 December 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this distance from the sea and the country's largely [[desert]] climate, Chad is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Dead Heart of Africa&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = South African Journal of Economics | volume = 60 | issue= 4 | pages = 246–255 |date = December 1992 | title = S.H.

The dominant physical structure is a wide basin bounded to the north and east by the [[Ennedi Plateau]] and [[Tibesti Mountains]], which include [[Emi Koussi]], a dormant volcano that reaches {{convert|3414|m|ft|0}} above sea level. [[Lake Chad]], after which the country is named (and which in turn takes its name from the [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]] word for &quot;lake&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kperogi, F.A.

The region's tall grasses and extensive marshes make it favourable for birds, reptiles, and large mammals. Chad's major rivers—the [[Chari River|Chari]], [[Logone River|Logone]] and their tributaries—flow through the southern savannas from the southeast into Lake Chad.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|fr}} Chapelle, Jean (1981) ''Le Peuple Tchadien: ses racines et sa vie quotidienne''.

=== Climate ===
{{main|Climate of Chad}}
Each year a tropical weather system known as the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone|intertropical front]] crosses Chad from south to north, bringing a [[wet season]] that lasts from May to October in the south, and from June to September in the Sahel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Decalo|Decalo]], p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Variations in local rainfall create three major geographical zones. The [[Sahara]] lies in the country's northern third. Yearly precipitations throughout this belt are under {{convert|50|mm|in}}; only the occasional spontaneous palm grove survives, and the only ones to do so are south of the [[Tropic of Cancer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UNHCHR&quot;/&gt;

The Sahara gives way to a [[Sahel]]ian belt in Chad's centre; precipitation there varies from {{convert|300|to|600|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year. In the Sahel, a steppe of thorny bushes (mostly [[acacia]]s) gradually gives way to the south to [[East Sudanian savanna]] in Chad's [[Sudan (region)|Sudanese]] zone. Yearly rainfall in this belt is over {{convert|900|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNHCHR&quot;/&gt;

=== Wildlife ===
{{Main|Wildlife of Chad}}

[[File:African Bush Elephant Mikumi.jpg|thumb|An [[African bush elephant]].]]
Chad's animal and plant life correspond to the three climatic zones. In the Saharan region, the only flora is the date-palm groves of the oasis. Palms and [[acacia tree]]s grow in the Sahelian region. The southern, or Sudanic, zone consists of broad grasslands or prairies suitable for grazing. As of 2002, there were at least 134 species of mammals, 509 species of birds (354 species of residents and 155 migrants), and over 1,600 species of plants throughout the country.&lt;ref name=Bird/&gt;&lt;ref name=Flora&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pensoft.net/journal_home_page.php?journal_id=3&amp;page=article&amp;SESID=98556166bbcb445ae7ccd99343b1434e&amp;type=show&amp;article_id=4752&amp;issue_id=410&amp;ttar=da&amp;search=wildlife%20of%20chad&amp;IN=&amp;TIP=&amp;Image100_x=-678&amp;Image100_y=-48&amp;|title=The Flora of Chad: a checklist and brief analysis|accessdate=17 October 2013|publisher=Pensoft.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The small group of surviving [[West African crocodile]]s in the [[Ennedi Plateau]] represents one of the last colonies known in the Sahara today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brito|first1=José C.|last2=Martínez-Freiría|first2=Fernando|last3=Sierra|first3=Pablo|last4=Sillero|first4=Neftalí|last5=Tarroso|first5=Pedro|last6=Fenton|first6=Brock|title=Crocodiles in the Sahara Desert: An Update of Distribution, Habitats and Population Status for Conservation Planning in Mauritania|journal=[[PLOS ONE]]|date=25 February 2011|volume=6|issue=2|pages=e14734|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0014734|pmc=3045445|pmid=21364897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensive deforestation has resulted in loss of trees such as acacias, baobab, dates and palm trees. This has also caused loss of natural habitat for wild animals; one of the main reasons for this is also hunting and livestock farming by increasing human settlements. Populations of animals like lions, leopards and rhino have fallen significantly.&lt;ref name=Our&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.our-africa.org/chad/geography-wildlife|title=Our Africa|accessdate=17 October 2013|publisher=Our Africa organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts have been made by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] to improve relations between farmers, agro-pastoralists and pastoralists in the Zakouma National Park (ZNP), Siniaka-Minia, and Aouk reserve in southeastern Chad to promote sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/agriculture/lead/themes0/drylands/chad1/en/|title=Livestock-wildlife-environment interactions in Chad|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization|accessdate=17 October 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019103202/http://www.fao.org/agriculture/lead/themes0/drylands/chad1/en/|archivedate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the national conservation effort, more than 1.2 million trees have been replanted to check the advancement of the desert, which incidentally also helps the local economy by way of financial return from acacia trees, which produce [[gum arabic]], and also from fruit trees.&lt;ref name=Our/&gt;

Poaching is a serious problem in the country, particularly of elephants for the profitable [[ivory]] industry and a threat to lives of rangers even in the national parks such as Zakouma. Elephants are often massacred in herds in and around the parks by organized poaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.co.uk/news/2006/08/060830-elephants-chad.html |title=African Elephants Slaughtered in Herds Near Chad Wildlife Park |magazine=National Geographic |date=30 August 2006 |accessdate=17 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017173341/http://news.nationalgeographic.co.uk/news/2006/08/060830-elephants-chad.html |archivedate=17 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem is worsened by the fact that the parks are understaffed and that a number of wardens have been murdered by poachers.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/world/africa/central-africas-wildlife-rangers-face-deadly-risks.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1382003098-yauBx4MSdHcb4DxeUgSrUw|title=Rangers in Isolated Central Africa Uncover Grim Cost of Protecting Wildlife|newspaper=The New York Times|date=31 December 2012|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban life is concentrated in the capital, whose population is mostly engaged in commerce. The other major towns are [[Sarh]], [[Moundou]], [[Abéché]] and [[Doba, Chad|Doba]], which are considerably smaller but growing rapidly in population and economic activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt; Since 2003, 230,000 [[Sudanese refugees in Chad|Sudanese refugees]] have fled to eastern Chad from war-ridden Darfur.

[[Female genital cutting|Female genital mutilation]] is also prohibited, but the practice is widespread and deeply rooted in tradition; 45% of Chadian women undergo the procedure, with the highest rates among [[Arab]]s, [[Hadjarai]], and Ouaddaians (90% or more). Lower percentages were reported among the [[Sara people|Sara]] (38%) and the [[Toubou]] (2%). Women lack equal opportunities in education and training, making it difficult for them to compete for the relatively few formal-sector jobs. Although property and inheritance laws based on the French code do not discriminate against women, local leaders adjudicate most inheritance cases in favour of men, according to traditional practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRP&quot;/&gt;

Chad has more than 200 distinct ethnic groups,&lt;ref name=&quot;BGN&quot;/&gt; which create diverse social structures. The colonial administration and independent governments have attempted to impose a national society, but for most Chadians the local or regional society remains the most important influence outside the immediate family. Nevertheless, Chad's people may be classified according to the geographical region in which they live.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collelo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt;

In the south live sedentary people such as the [[Sara people|Sara]], the nation's main ethnic group, whose essential [[social unit]] is the lineage. In the Sahel sedentary peoples live side-by-side with nomadic ones, such as the Arabs, the country's second major ethnic group. The north is inhabited by nomads, mostly [[Toubous]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Collelo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt;

=== Languages ===

{{Main|Languages of Chad}}
Chad's official languages are [[Arabic]] and [[French language|French]], but over 100 languages and dialects are spoken. Due to the important role played by itinerant Arab traders and settled merchants in local communities, [[Chadian Arabic]] has become a [[lingua franca]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Collelo&quot;/&gt;

The majority of Muslims in the country are adherents of a moderate branch of mystical Islam ([[Sufism]]). Its most common expression is the [[Tijaniyah]], an order followed by the 35% of Chadian Muslims which incorporates some local African religious elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;pew128&quot;/&gt; A small minority of the country's Muslims hold more fundamentalist practices, which, in some cases, may be associated with Saudi-oriented [[Salafi movement]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;US-DoS-IRFR-2006&quot;/&gt;

Roman Catholics represent the largest Christian denomination in the country. Most Protestants, including the Nigeria-based &quot;Winners' Chapel&quot;, are affiliated with various evangelical Christian groups. Members of the [[Bahá'í]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] religious communities also are present in the country. Both faiths were introduced after independence in 1960 and therefore are considered to be &quot;new&quot; religions in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;US-DoS-IRFR-2006&quot;/&gt;

Chad is home to foreign missionaries representing both [[Christians|Christian]] and Islamic groups. Itinerant [[Muslim]] preachers, primarily from [[Sudan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Pakistan]], also visit. Saudi Arabian funding generally supports social and educational projects and extensive mosque construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;US-DoS-IRFR-2006&quot;/&gt;

== Government and politics ==
{{main|Politics of Chad}}

Chad's constitution provides for a strong executive branch headed by a president who dominates the political system. The president has the power to appoint the [[Prime Minister of Chad|prime minister]] and the cabinet, and exercises considerable influence over appointments of judges, generals, provincial officials and heads of Chad's para-statal firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chad 1996 (rev. 2005)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Chad_2005?lang=en#286|website=Constitute|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases of grave and immediate threat, the president, in consultation with the [[National Assembly (Chad)|National Assembly]], may declare a [[state of emergency]]. The president is [[Elections in Chad|directly elected]] by popular vote for a five-year term; in 2005 constitutional term limits were removed,&lt;ref name=&quot;Term2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4118482.stm|title=Chad votes to end two-term limit|work=BBC News|accessdate=20 September 2007|date=22 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs. November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chad's legal system is based on [[law of France|French civil law]] and Chadian customary law where the latter does not interfere with public order or constitutional guarantees of equality. Despite the constitution's guarantee of judicial independence, the president names most key judicial officials. The legal system's highest jurisdictions, the [[Supreme Court of Chad|Supreme Court]] and the [[Constitutional Council of Chad|Constitutional Council]], have become fully operational since 2000. The Supreme Court is made up of a chief justice, named by the president, and 15 councillors, appointed for life by the president and the National Assembly. The Constitutional Court is headed by nine judges elected to nine-year terms. It has the power to review legislation, treaties and international agreements prior to their adoption.&lt;ref name=&quot;BGN&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UNPACP&quot;/&gt;

The National Assembly makes legislation. The body consists of 155 members elected for four-year terms who meet three times per year. The Assembly holds regular sessions twice a year, starting in March and October, and can hold special sessions when called by the prime minister. Deputies elect a National Assembly president every two years. The president must sign or reject newly passed laws within 15 days. The National Assembly must approve the prime minister's plan of government and may force the prime minister to resign through a majority vote of no confidence. However, if the National Assembly rejects the executive branch's programme twice in one year, the president may disband the Assembly and call for new legislative elections. In practice, the president exercises considerable influence over the National Assembly through his party, the [[Patriotic Salvation Movement]] (MPS), which holds a large majority.&lt;ref name=&quot;BGN&quot;/&gt;

Until the legalisation of opposition parties in 1992, Déby's MPS was the sole legal party in Chad.&lt;ref name=&quot;BGN&quot;/&gt; Since then, [[list of political parties in Chad|78 registered political parties]] have become active.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRP&quot;&gt;&quot;[https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78726.htm Chad]&quot;.

[[ExxonMobil]] leads a consortium of [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] and [[Petronas]] that has invested $3.7 billion to develop oil reserves estimated at one billion barrels in southern Chad. Oil production began in 2003 with the [[Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project|completion of a pipeline]] (financed in part by the [[World Bank]]) that links the southern oilfields to terminals on the Atlantic coast of Cameroon. As a condition of its assistance, the World Bank insisted that 80% of oil revenues be spent on development projects. In January 2006 the World Bank suspended its loan programme when the Chadian government passed laws reducing this amount.&lt;ref name=&quot;BGN&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OECD&quot;/&gt; On 14 July 2006, the World Bank and Chad signed a memorandum of understanding under which the Government of Chad commits 70% of its spending to priority poverty reduction programmes.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank (14 July 2006).

The [[Communications in Chad|telecommunication system]] is basic and expensive, with fixed telephone services provided by the state telephone company [[SotelTchad]]. In 2000, there were only 14 fixed telephone lines per 10,000 inhabitants in the country, one of the lowest telephone densities in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;CCG&quot;/&gt;

{{Main|Media of Chad}}

Chad's television audience is limited to N'Djamena. The only television station is the state-owned Télé Tchad.

== Education ==
[[Education in Chad|Educators]] face considerable challenges due to the nation's dispersed population and a certain degree of reluctance on the part of parents to send their children to school. Although attendance is compulsory, only 68 percent of boys attend primary school, and more than half of the population is illiterate. [[List of universities in Chad|Higher education]] is provided at the [[University of N'Djamena]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BGN&quot;/&gt; At 33 percent, Chad has one of the lowest literacy rates of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= 50 Things You Didn't Know About Africa| work= [[World Bank]]| url= http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/polsc325-4.1-50-Things-you-didnt-know-about-Africa.pdf| accessdate= 7 May 2012| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130725192911/http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/polsc325-4.1-50-Things-you-didnt-know-about-Africa.pdf| archive-date= 25 July 2013| url-status= dead| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its great variety of peoples and languages, Chad possesses a rich cultural heritage. The Chadian government has actively promoted Chadian culture and national traditions by opening the [[Chad National Museum]] and the [[Chad Cultural Centre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt; Six [[public holidays in Chad|national holidays]] are observed throughout the year, and movable holidays include the Christian holiday of [[Easter Monday]] and the Muslim holidays of [[Eid ul-Fitr]], [[Eid ul-Adha]], and [[Mawlid|Eid Milad Nnabi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CCG&quot;/&gt;

The [[music of Chad]] includes a number of instruments such as the ''kinde'', a type of bow harp; the ''[[kakaki]]'', a long tin horn; and the ''hu hu'', a stringed instrument that uses [[calabash]]es as loudspeakers. Other instruments and their combinations are more linked to specific ethnic groups: the Sara prefer whistles, [[balafon]]es, harps and ''kodjo'' drums; and the [[Kanembu people|Kanembu]] combine the sounds of drums with those of flute-like instruments.&lt;ref name=&quot;culture&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/chad/chad_eng.pdf |title=Chad: A Cultural Profile |accessdate=19 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001212259/http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/chad/chad_eng.pdf |archivedate=1 October 2006 }} (PDF).

[[File:Tailor in Chad.jpg|thumb|A Chadian tailor sells traditional dresses.]]
[[Millet]] is the staple food of [[Chadian cuisine]]. It is used to make balls of paste that are dipped in sauces. In the north this dish is known as ''alysh''; in the south, as ''biya''. Fish is popular, which is generally prepared and sold either as ''salanga'' (sun-dried and lightly smoked ''[[Alestes]]'' and ''[[Hydrocynus]]'') or as ''banda'' (smoked large fish).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/D7238E/D7238E03.htm Symposium on the evaluation of fishery resources in the development and management of inland fisheries]&quot;. CIFA Technical Paper No. 2. [[FAO]]. 29 November – 1 December 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Carcaje'' is a popular sweet red tea extracted from hibiscus leaves. Alcoholic beverages, though absent in the north, are popular in the south, where people drink [[millet beer]], known as ''billi-billi'' when brewed from red millet, and as ''coshate'' when from [[Proso millet|white millet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;culture&quot;/&gt;

The music group [[Chari Jazz]] formed in 1964 and initiated Chad's modern music scene. Later, more renowned groups such as African Melody and International Challal attempted to mix modernity and tradition. Popular groups such as Tibesti have clung faster to their heritage by drawing on ''sai'', a traditional style of music from southern Chad. The people of Chad have customarily disdained modern music. However, in 1995 greater interest has developed and fostered the distribution of CDs and audio cassettes featuring Chadian artists. Piracy and a lack of legal protections for artists' rights remain problems to further development of the Chadian music industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;culture&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* {{in lang|fr}} Gondjé, Laoro (2003); &quot;[http://www.cefod.org/archives/spip.php?article231 {{lang|fr|La musique recherche son identité}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422134754/http://www.cefod.org/archives/spip.php?article231 |date=22 April 2014 }}&quot;, {{lang|fr|Tchad et Culture}} '''214'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other Sahelian countries, [[Chadian literature|literature in Chad]] has seen an economic, political and spiritual drought that has affected its best known writers. Chadian authors have been forced to write from exile or expatriate status and have generated literature dominated by themes of political oppression and historical discourse. Since 1962, 20 Chadian authors have written some 60 works of fiction. Among the most internationally renowned writers are [[Joseph Brahim Seïd]], [[Baba Moustapha]], [[Antoine Bangui]] and [[Koulsy Lamko]]. In 2003 Chad's sole literary critic, [[Ahmat Taboye]], published his {{lang|fr|Anthologie de la littérature tchadienne}} to further knowledge of Chad's literature internationally and among youth and to make up for Chad's lack of publishing houses and promotional structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;culture&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|fr}} Malo, Nestor H.

The development of a [[Cinema of Chad|Chadian film]] industry, which began with the short films of [[Edouard Sailly]] in the 1960s, was hampered by the devastations of civil wars and from the lack of [[movie theater|cinemas]], of which there is currently only one in the whole country (the ''Normandie'' in N'Djamena).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/619502| title= Dawn - ''Chad's only cinema dusts off its silver screen'' |date= 9 April 2011|accessdate=8 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/the-man-who-broughtcinema-to-war-hit-chad/article21352524.ece| title= The Hindu ''The man who brought cinema to war-hit Chad'' |date= 9 December 2017|accessdate=8 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chadian [[feature film]] industry began growing again in the 1990s, with the work of directors [[Mahamat-Saleh Haroun]], [[Issa Serge Coelo]] and [[Abakar Chene Massar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.closeupfilmcentre.com/vertigo_magazine/volume-3-issue-5-spring-2007/fatherlands-on-mahamat-saleh-haroun|author=White, Jerry| title= Vertigo - ''Fatherlands: On Mahamat-Saleh Haroun, Africa and an Evolving Political Cinema''|accessdate=8 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haroun's film ''[[Abouna]]'' was critically acclaimed, and his ''[[Daratt]]'' won the Grand Special Jury Prize at the [[63rd Venice International Film Festival]].
