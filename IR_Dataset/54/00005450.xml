&lt;!--This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Cameroon]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.--&gt;

The '''demographic profile of Cameroon''' is complex for a country of its population.  [[Cameroon]] comprises an estimated 250 distinct [[ethnic groups]], which may be formed into five large regional-cultural divisions:
* '''western highlanders''' ('''[[Semi-Bantu]]''' or '''grassfielders'''), including the [[Bamileke]], [[Bamum people|Bamum]] (or ''Bamoun''), and many smaller [[Tikar]] groups in the [[Northwest Province, Cameroon|Northwest]] (est. 38% of total population);
* '''coastal tropical forest peoples''', including the [[Bassa people (Cameroon)|Bassa]], [[Duala people|Duala]] (or ''Douala''), and many smaller groups in the [[Southwest Province, Cameroon|Southwest]] (12%);
* '''southern tropical forest peoples''', including the [[Beti-Pahuin]], Bulu (a subgroup of Beti-Pahuin), Fang (subgroup of Beti-Pahuin), [[Maka people|Maka]], [[Njem]], and [[Baka (nomadic Central African people)|Baka]] [[pygmy|pygmies]] (18%);
* '''predominantly [[Islam]]ic peoples''' of the northern semi-arid regions (the [[Sahel]]) and central highlands, including the [[Fula people|Fulani]] ({{lang-fr|Peul}} or ''Peuhl''; {{lang-ff|Fulɓe}}) (14%); ''and''
* '''the &quot;[[Kirdi]]&quot;''', non-Islamic or recently Islamic peoples of the northern desert and central highlands (18%).

113,000&lt;ref&gt;https://www.peoplegroups.org/Explore/groupdetails.aspx?peid=12623&lt;/ref&gt; [[Igbo people]] live in Cameroon. The Cameroon government held two national censuses during the country's first 44 years as an independent country, in 1976 and again in 1987.  Results from the second head count were never published.  A third census, expected to take years to produce results, began on November 11, 2005, with a three-week interviewing phase.  It is one of a series of projects and reforms required by the [[International Monetary Fund]] as prerequisites for foreign [[debt relief]]. The first results were published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slmp-550-104.slc.westdc.net/~stat54/nada/index.php/catalog/58 Cameroon - Third General Census of Population and Housing 2005 - IPUMS Subset] ([http://slmp-550-104.slc.westdc.net/~stat54/nada/index.php/catalog/58/download/571 download first findings &quot;Rapport de presentation des résultats définitifs&quot; - pdf])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population==
According to {{UN_Population|source}} the total population was {{UN_Population|Cameroon}} in {{UN_Population|Year}}, compared to only 4 466 000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 40.6%, 55.9% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 3.5% was 65 years or older.&lt;ref name=&quot;WPP 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm|title=Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision|website=Esa.un.org|accessdate=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 24 major African language groups in Cameroon; additionally, [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] are official languages. [[Cameroonian Pidgin English]] is also widely spoken.

Peoples concentrated in the Southwest and Northwest Provinces—around [[Buea]] and [[Bamenda]]—use standard [[English language|English]] and [[Cameroonian Pidgin English]], as well as their local languages. In the three northern provinces—[[Adamawa Province|Adamawa]], [[North Province, Cameroon|North]], and [[Far North Province|Far North]]—either [[French language|French]] or [[Fula language|Fulfulde]] (the language of the [[Fula people|Fulani]]) is widely spoken. Elsewhere, French is the principal second language, although pidgin and some local languages such as [[Ewondo language|Ewondo]], the dialect of a Beti clan from the [[Yaoundé]] area, have a wide currency.

Indigenous languages of Cameroon include:
*[[Basaa language|Basaa]]
*[[Bikya language|Bikya]]
