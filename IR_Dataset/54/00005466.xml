The '''Cape Verdean Armed Forces''' ({{lang-pt|Forças Armadas Cabo Verdeanas}}), '''Cabo Verdean Armed Forces''' or '''FACV''' are the [[armed forces|military]] of [[Cape Verde]]. They include two branches, the National Guard and the Coast Guard.

==History==
Before 1975, Cape Verde was an overseas province of [[Portugal]], having a small Portuguese military garrison that included both Cape Verdean and European Portuguese soldiers.

At the same time, some Cape Verdeans were serving in the People's Revolutionary Armed Forces ({{lang|pt|Forças Armadas Revolucionarias do Povo}}, FARP), the military wing of the [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]] that was fighting for the joint independence of Guinea and Cape Verde in the [[Guinea-Bissau War of Independence]]. The FARP became the national armed forces of [[Guinea-Bissau]] when its independence was recognized by Portugal in 1974.

The Armed Forces of Cape Verde were created when the country became independent in 1975, being also officially designated the People's Revolutionary Armed Forces ({{lang|pt|Forças Armadas Revolucionarias do Povo}}, FARP). The Cape Verdean FARP consisted of two independent branches, the Army ({{lang|pt|Exército}}) and the Coast Guard ({{lang|pt|Guarda Costeira}}).

In the early 1990s, the designation &quot;FARP&quot; was dropped and the military of Cape Verde started to be designated the Cape Verdean Armed Forces ({{lang|pt|Forças Armadas Cabo Verdeanas}}, FACV).

In 2007, the FACV started a major reorganization that included the transformation of the Army into the National Guard ({{lang|pt|Guarda Nacional}}).

Together with the Cape Verdean Police, the FACV carried out Operation ''Flying Launch'' ({{lang|pt|Operacão Lancha Voadora}}), a successful operation to put an end to a [[drug trafficking]] group which smuggled [[cocaine]] from [[Colombia]] to the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]] using Cape Verde as a reorder point. The operation took more than three years, being a secret operation during the first two years, and ended in 2010.

Although located in Africa, Cape Verde had always close relations with Europe. Because of this, several opinions defend that Cape Verde may enter the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] and [[NATO]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://davidnoack.net/v2/2010/01/sprungbrett-nach-westafrika sprungbrett-nach-westafrika]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent engagement of the FACV was the [[Monte Tchota massacre]] that resulted in 11 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-capeverde-killings-idUSKCN0XN2LA|title=Eleven shot dead in Cape Verde, including two Spanish citizens|date=2016-04-27|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The Cape Verdean Armed Forces are part of the Ministry of National Defense of Cape Verde and include:
* the Military bodies of command:
** Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces (CEMFA),
** Office of the CEMFA,
** Staff of the Armed Forces (EMFA),
** Personnel Command,
** Logistics Command;
* the National Guard;
* the Coast Guard.

The CEMFA is Colonel, being the highest rank officer of the Armed Forces.

===National Guard===
[[Image:Policia Militar Cabo Verde 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Military Police in [[Mindelo]]]]
The National Guard (''Guarda National'') is the main branch of the Cape Verdean Armed Forces for the military defense of the country, being responsible for the execution of land and maritime environment operations and the support to internal security. It includes:
* Territorial commands:
** 1st Military Region Command,
** 2nd Military Region Command,
** 3rd Military Region Command;
* Corps:
** Military Police Corps,
** Marine Corps,
** Artillery Corps.

There is not a general command of the National Guard. Each military region command is headed by a Lieutenant-Colonel directly subordinate to the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces and includes units of the three corps.

===Coast Guard===
[[Image:Tainha (P262).jpg|thumb|right|Coast Guard patrol boat ''Tainha'' (P 262)]]
The Coast Guard (''Guarda Costeira'') is the branch of the Cape Verdean Armed Forces responsible for the defense and protection of the country's economical interests at the sea under national jurisdiction and for providing air and naval support to land and amphibious operations. It includes:
* Coast Guard Command
* Maritime Security Operations Center (COSMAR)
* Naval Squadron
* Air Squadron

=== Aircraft ===

The Cape Verdean Army used to have its own air arm; after personnel training received from the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] in 1982, three [[Antonov An-26]] aircraft were delivered to Cape Verde – these were believed to be the only military aircraft possessed by the nation.&lt;ref&gt;* ''World Aircraft Information Files.'' Brightstar Publishing, London. File 337 Sheet 02&lt;/ref&gt; However these three aircraft were supplemented in 1991 by a [[Dornier Do 228]] light aircraft equipped for use by the Coast Guard, and, in the late 1990s by an [[EMB-110]] aircraft from Brazil, similarly equipped for maritime operations. The government has been in negotiations with China to acquire multirole helicopters for both military and civilian use.
