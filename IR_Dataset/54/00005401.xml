The '''Carboniferous''' ({{IPAc-en|,|k|a:r|.|b|ə|ˈ|n|ɪ|f|.|ər|.|ə|s}} {{Respell|KAHR|bə|NIF|ər|əs}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wells|first=John|authorlink=John C.

The name ''Carboniferous'' means &quot;coal-bearing&quot; and derives from the [[Latin]] words ''[[wikt:carbo#Latin|carbō]]'' (&quot;[[coal]]&quot;) and ''[[wikt:fero#Latin|ferō]]'' (&quot;I bear, I carry&quot;), and was coined by geologists [[William Conybeare (geologist)|William Conybeare]] and [[William Phillips (geologist)|William Phillips]] in 1822.{{sfn|Conybeare |Phillips |1822|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZcMQAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA323#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 323: &quot;Book III. Medial or Carboniferous Order.&quot;]}}

Based on a study of the British rock succession, it was the first of the modern 'system' names to be employed, and reflects the fact that many coal beds were formed globally during that time.{{sfn|Cossey|Adams |Purnell |Whiteley |2004 |page=3}} The Carboniferous is often treated in North America as two geological periods, the earlier [[Mississippian (geology)|Mississippian]] and the later [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Carboniferous Period |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/carboniferous/carboniferous.php |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210070913/http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/carboniferous/carboniferous.php |website=www.ucmp.berkeley.edu |archivedate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrestrial animal life was well established by the Carboniferous period.{{sfn| Garwood |Edgecombe |2011}} [[Amphibian]]s were the dominant land vertebrates, of which one branch would eventually evolve into [[amniote]]s, the first solely terrestrial vertebrates.

[[Arthropod]]s were also very common, and many (such as ''[[Meganeura]]'') were much larger than those of today. Vast swaths of forest covered the land, which would eventually be laid down and become the coal beds characteristic of the Carboniferous [[system (stratigraphy)|stratigraphy]] evident today. The atmospheric content of oxygen also reached its highest levels in [[geological history of Earth|geological history]] during the period, 35%{{sfn|Beerling|2007|page=47 }} compared with 21% today, allowing terrestrial invertebrates to evolve to great size.{{sfn|Beerling|2007|page=47 }}

The later half of the period experienced [[glaciation]]s, low sea level, and [[mountain building]] as the continents collided to form [[Pangaea]]. A minor marine and terrestrial extinction event, the [[Carboniferous rainforest collapse]], occurred at the end of the period, caused by climate change.&lt;ref name=&quot;SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Sahney, S. | author2=Benton, M.J. | author3=Falcon-Lang, H.J. | last-author-amp=yes | year=2010 | title=Rainforest collapse triggered Pennsylvanian tetrapod diversification in Euramerica | journal=Geology | volume=38 | pages=1079–1082 | doi=10.1130/G31182.1 | issue=12 | bibcode=2010Geo....38.1079S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subdivisions==
In the [[United States]] the Carboniferous is usually broken into [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]] (earlier) and [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] (later) subperiods. The Mississippian is about twice as long as the Pennsylvanian, but due to the large thickness of coal-bearing deposits with Pennsylvanian ages in Europe and North America, the two subperiods were long thought to have been more or less equal in duration.{{sfn|Menning|Alekseev|Chuvashov|Davydov|2006}}

In Europe the Lower Carboniferous sub-system is known as the [[Dinantian]], comprising the [[Tournaisian]] and [[Visean]] Series, dated at 362.5-332.9 Ma, and the Upper Carboniferous sub-system is known as the [[Silesian (series)|Silesian]], comprising the [[Namurian]], [[Westphalian (stage)|Westphalian]], and [[Stephanian (stage)|Stephanian]] Series, dated at 332.9-298.9 Ma. The Silesian is roughly contemporaneous with the late Mississippian Serpukhovian plus the Pennsylvanian. In Britain the Dinantian is traditionally known as the [[Carboniferous Limestone]], the Namurian as the [[Millstone Grit]], and the Westphalian as the [[Coal Measures]] and [[Pennant Sandstone]].

==Palaeogeography==
A global drop in [[sea level]] at the end of the [[Devonian]] reversed early in the Carboniferous; this created the widespread [[Inland sea (geology)|inland seas]] and the [[carbonate]] deposition of the Mississippian.{{sfn|Stanley|1999}} There was also a drop in south polar temperatures; southern [[Gondwana]]land was [[glaciation|glaciated]] throughout the period, though it is uncertain if the ice sheets were a holdover from the Devonian or not.{{sfn|Stanley|1999}} These conditions apparently had little effect in the deep tropics, where lush swamps, later to become coal, flourished to within 30 degrees of the northernmost [[glacier]]s.{{sfn|Stanley|1999}}

[[File:US pennsylvanian general USGS.jpg|thumb|270px|left|Generalized geographic map of the [[United States]] in Middle [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] time.]]

Mid-Carboniferous, a drop in sea level precipitated a major marine extinction, one that hit [[crinoids]] and [[ammonites]] especially hard.{{sfn|Stanley|1999}} This sea level drop and the associated [[unconformity]] in North America separate the Mississippian subperiod from the Pennsylvanian subperiod. This happened about 323 million years ago, at the onset of the [[Permo-Carboniferous Glaciation]].{{sfn|Stanley|1999}}

The Carboniferous was a time of active [[orogeny|mountain-building]] as the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]] came together. The southern [[continent]]s remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana, which collided with North America–Europe ([[Laurussia]]) along the present line of eastern North America. This continental collision resulted in the [[Variscan orogeny|Hercynian orogeny]] in Europe, and the [[Alleghenian orogeny]] in North America; it also extended the newly uplifted [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] southwestward as the [[Ouachita Mountains]].{{sfn|Stanley|1999}} In the same time frame, much of present eastern [[Eurasian plate]] welded itself to Europe along the line of the [[Ural Mountains]]. Most of the [[Mesozoic]] supercontinent of Pangea was now assembled, although North China (which would collide in the Latest Carboniferous), and [[South China (continent)|South China]] continents were still separated from [[Laurasia]]. The Late Carboniferous Pangaea was shaped like an &quot;O.&quot;

There were two major oceans in the Carboniferous—[[Panthalassa]] and [[Paleo-Tethys]], which was inside the &quot;O&quot; in the Carboniferous Pangaea. Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed - [[Rheic Ocean]] (closed by the assembly of [[South America|South]] and [[North America]]), the small, shallow [[Ural Ocean]] (which was closed by the collision of [[Baltica]] and Siberia continents, creating the [[Ural Mountains]]) and [[Proto-Tethys Ocean]] (closed by [[North China (continent)|North China]] collision with [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]]/[[Kazakhstania]]).

==Climate==
Average global temperatures in the Early Carboniferous Period were high: approximately 20&amp;nbsp;°C (68&amp;nbsp;°F). However, cooling during the Middle Carboniferous reduced average global temperatures to about 12&amp;nbsp;°C (54&amp;nbsp;°F). Lack of growth rings of fossilized trees suggest a lack of seasons of a tropical climate. Glaciations in [[Gondwana]], triggered by Gondwana's southward movement, continued into the [[Permian]] and because of the lack of clear markers and breaks, the deposits of this glacial period are often referred to as [[Permo-Carboniferous]] in age.

The cooling and drying of the climate led to the [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]] (CRC) during the late Carboniferous. Tropical rainforests fragmented and then were eventually devastated by climate change.&lt;ref name=&quot;SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse&quot;/&gt;

==Rocks and coal==
[[File:MississippianMarbleUT.JPG|thumb|right|Lower Carboniferous marble in Big Cottonwood Canyon, [[Wasatch Mountains]], [[Utah]].]]
Carboniferous rocks in Europe and eastern North America largely consist of a repeated sequence of [[limestone]], [[sandstone]], [[shale]] and [[coal]] beds.{{sfn|Stanley|1999|p=426}} In North America, the early Carboniferous is largely marine limestone, which accounts for the division of the Carboniferous into two periods in North American schemes. The Carboniferous coal beds provided much of the fuel for power generation during the [[Industrial Revolution]] and are still of great economic importance.

The large coal deposits of the Carboniferous may owe their existence primarily to two factors. The first of these is the appearance of [[wood]] tissue and [[bark (botany)|bark]]-bearing trees. The [[evolution]] of the wood fiber [[lignin]] and the bark-sealing, waxy substance [[suberin]] variously opposed decay organisms so effectively that dead materials accumulated long enough to fossilise on a large scale. The second factor was the lower sea levels that occurred during the Carboniferous as compared to the preceding [[Devonian]] period. This promoted the development of extensive lowland [[swamp]]s and [[forest]]s in North America and Europe. Based on a genetic analysis of mushroom fungi, it was proposed that large quantities of [[wood]] were buried during this period because animals and decomposing [[bacteria]] and fungi had not yet [[Evolution|evolved]] enzymes that could effectively digest the resistant phenolic lignin polymers and waxy suberin polymers. They suggest that fungi that could break those substances down effectively only became dominant towards the end of the period, making subsequent coal formation much rarer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Floudas|first1=D.|last2=Binder|first2=M.|last3=Riley|first3=R.|last4=Barry|first4=K.|last5=Blanchette|first5=R.

The Carboniferous trees made extensive use of lignin. They had bark to wood ratios of 8 to 1, and even as high as 20 to 1. This compares to modern values less than 1 to 4. This bark, which must have been used as support as well as protection, probably had 38% to 58% lignin. Lignin is insoluble, too large to pass through cell walls, too heterogeneous for specific enzymes, and toxic, so that few organisms other than [[Basidiomycetes]] fungi can degrade it. To oxidize it requires an atmosphere of greater than 5% oxygen, or compounds such as peroxides. It can linger in soil for thousands of years and its toxic breakdown products inhibit decay of other substances.{{sfn|Robinson |1990 |p=608}} One possible reason for its high percentages in plants at that time was to provide protection from insects in a world containing very effective insect herbivores (but nothing remotely as effective as modern plant eating insects) and probably many fewer protective toxins produced naturally by plants than exist today. As a result, undegraded carbon built up, resulting in the extensive burial of biologically fixed [[carbon]], leading to an increase in [[oxygen]] levels in the atmosphere; estimates place the peak oxygen content as high as 35%, as compared to 21% today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/library/docfree.asp?DOCID=1G1:16907261&amp;ctrlInfo=Round20:Mode20b:DocG:Result&amp;ao=|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130103013012/http://www.highbeam.com/library/docfree.asp?DOCID=1G1:16907261&amp;ctrlInfo=Round20:Mode20b:DocG:Result&amp;ao=|url-status=dead|archive-date=3 January 2013|title=Ancient Animals Got a Rise out of Oxygen|date=13 May 1995|website=highbeam.com|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This oxygen level may have increased [[wildfire]] activity. It also may have promoted [[gigantism]] of [[insect]]s and [[amphibian]]s — creatures that have been constrained in size by [[Respiration (physiology)|respiratory]] systems that are limited in their physiological ability to transport and distribute oxygen at the lower atmospheric concentrations that have since been available.{{sfn|Dudley| 1998}}

In eastern North America, marine beds are more common in the older part of the period than the later part and are almost entirely absent by the late Carboniferous. More diverse geology existed elsewhere, of course. Marine life is especially rich in [[crinoids]] and other [[echinodermata|echinoderms]]. [[Brachiopoda|Brachiopods]] were abundant. [[Trilobite]]s became quite uncommon. On land, large and diverse [[plant]] populations existed. Land [[vertebrata|vertebrates]] included large amphibians.

===Plants===
[[File:Meyers b15 s0272b.jpg|thumb|250 px|Etching depicting some of the most significant plants of the Carboniferous.]]
[[Mississippian age|Early Carboniferous]] land plants, some of which were [[permineralisation|preserved]] in [[coal ball]]s, were very similar to those of the preceding Late [[Devonian]], but new groups also appeared at this time.
[[File:Lycopsid joggins mcr1.JPG|thumb|left|Ancient ''in situ'' [[w:lycopsid|lycopsid]], probably ''[[w:Sigillaria|Sigillaria]]'', with attached [[w:stigmaria|stigmarian roots]].]]
[[File:Lycopsid mcr2.jpg|thumb|left|Base of a [[w:lycopsid|lycopsid]] showing connection with bifurcating [[w:Stigmaria|stigmarian]] roots.]]
The main Early Carboniferous plants were the [[Equisetales]] (horse-tails), [[Sphenophyllales]] (scrambling plants), [[Lycopodiales]] (club mosses), [[Lepidodendrales]] (scale trees), [[Filicales]] (ferns), [[Medullosales]] (informally included in the &quot;[[Pteridospermatophyta|seed ferns]]&quot;, an artificial assemblage of a number of early [[gymnosperm]] groups) and the [[Cordaitales]]. These continued to dominate throughout the period, but during [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|late Carboniferous]], several other groups, [[Cycadophyta]] (cycads), the [[Callistophytales]] (another group of &quot;seed ferns&quot;), and the [[Voltziales]] (related to and sometimes included under the [[conifers]]), appeared.

The Carboniferous lycophytes of the order Lepidodendrales, which are cousins (but not ancestors) of the tiny club-moss of today, were huge trees with trunks 30 meters high and up to 1.5 meters in diameter. These included ''[[Lepidodendron]]'' (with its cone called [[Lepidostrobus]]), ''[[Anabathra (plant)|Anabathra]]'', ''[[Lepidophloios]]'' and ''[[Sigillaria]]''. The roots of several of these forms are known as [[Stigmaria]]. Unlike present-day trees, their [[secondary growth]] took place in the [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]], which also provided stability, instead of the [[xylem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-muenster.de/GeoPalaeontologie/Palaeo/Palbot/ewald1.htm |title=A History of Palaeozoic Forests - Part 2 The Carboniferous coal swamp forests |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920012606/http://www.uni-muenster.de/GeoPalaeontologie/Palaeo/Palbot/ewald1.htm |website=Forschungsstelle für Paläobotanik |publisher=Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster |archive-date=2012-09-20 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cladoxylopsida|Cladoxylopsids]] were large trees, that were ancestors of ferns, first arising in the Carboniferous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=C. Michael |last=Hogan |date=2010 |url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Fern |title=Fern |website=Encyclopedia of Earth |publisher=National council for Science and the Environment |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109071540/http://www.eoearth.org/article/Fern |archive-date=November 9, 2011 |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{AmCyc Poster|Coal Plants}}

The fronds of some Carboniferous ferns are almost identical with those of living species. Probably many species were [[epiphytic]]. Fossil ferns and &quot;seed ferns&quot; include ''[[Pecopteris]]'', ''[[Cyclopteris]]'', ''[[Neuropteris]]'', ''[[Alethopteris]]'', and ''[[Sphenopteris]]''; ''[[Megaphyton]]'' and ''[[Caulopteris]]'' were tree ferns.

The Equisetales included the common giant form ''[[Calamites]]'', with a trunk diameter of 30 to {{convert|60|cm|0|abbr=on}} and a height of up to {{convert|20|m|0|abbr=on}}. ''[[Sphenophyllum]]'' was a slender climbing plant with whorls of leaves, which was probably related both to the calamites and the lycopods.

''[[Cordaites]]'', a tall plant (6 to over 30 meters) with strap-like leaves, was related to the cycads and conifers; the [[catkin]]-like reproductive organs, which bore ovules/seeds, is called ''[[Cardiocarpus]]''. These plants were thought to live in swamps. True coniferous trees (''[[Walchia]]'', of the order Voltziales) appear later in the Carboniferous, and preferred higher drier ground.

===Marine invertebrates===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
In the oceans the [[marine invertebrate]] groups are the [[Foraminifera]], [[Anthozoa|corals]], [[Bryozoa]], [[Ostracoda]], [[brachiopod]]s, [[Ammonoidea|ammonoids]], [[hederellid|hederelloids]], [[microconchids]] and [[echinoderm]]s (especially [[crinoid]]s). For the first time foraminifera take a prominent part in the marine faunas. The large spindle-shaped genus ''Fusulina'' and its relatives were abundant in what is now Russia, China, Japan, North America; other important genera include ''Valvulina'', ''Endothyra'', ''Archaediscus'', and ''Saccammina'' (the latter common in Britain and Belgium). Some Carboniferous genera are still [[Extant taxon|extant]].

The microscopic shells of [[radiolaria]]ns are found in [[chert]]s of this age in the [[Culm Measures|Culm]] of [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]], and in Russia, Germany and elsewhere. [[Porifera|Sponges]] are known from [[spicule (sponge)|spicule]]s and anchor ropes, and include various forms such as the Calcispongea ''Cotyliscus'' and ''Girtycoelia'', the [[demosponge]] ''Chaetetes'', and the genus of unusual colonial [[Hyalospongea|glass sponges]] ''[[Titusvillia]]''.

Both [[reef]]-building and solitary corals diversify and flourish; these include both [[Rugosa|rugose]] (for example, ''[[Caninia (genus)|Caninia]]'', ''Corwenia'', ''Neozaphrentis''), heterocorals, and [[Tabulata|tabulate]] (for example, ''Chladochonus'', ''Michelinia'') forms. [[Conularids]] were well represented by ''Conularia''

[[Bryozoa]] are abundant in some regions; the fenestellids including ''Fenestella'', ''Polypora'', and ''[[Archimedes (bryozoan)|Archimedes]]'', so named because it is in the shape of an [[Archimedean screw]]. [[Brachiopod]]s are also abundant; they include [[Productida|productids]], some of which (for example, ''[[Gigantoproductus]]'') reached very large (for brachiopods) size and had very thick shells, while others like ''[[Chonetes]]'' were more conservative in form. [[Athyridida|Athyridids]], [[Spiriferida|spiriferids]], [[Rhynchonellida|rhynchonellids]], and [[Terebratulida|terebratulids]] are also very common. Inarticulate forms include ''[[Discina (brachiopod)|Discina]]'' and ''[[Crania (genus)|Crania]]''. Some species and genera had a very wide distribution with only minor variations.

[[Annelid]]s such as ''Serpulites'' are common fossils in some horizons. Among the mollusca, the [[bivalve]]s continue to increase in numbers and importance. Typical genera include ''[[Aviculopecten]]'', ''[[Posidonomya]]'', ''[[Nucula]]'', ''[[Carbonicola]]'', ''Edmondia'', and ''Modiola''. [[Gastropod]]s are also numerous, including the genera ''Murchisonia'', ''[[Euomphalus]]'', ''Naticopsis''. [[Nautiloid]] [[cephalopod]]s are represented by tightly coiled [[Nautilida|nautilids]], with straight-shelled and curved-shelled forms becoming increasingly rare. [[Goniatite]] [[Ammonoidea|ammonoids]] are common.

[[Trilobite]]s are rarer than in previous periods, on a steady trend towards extinction, represented only by the proetid group. [[Ostracod]]a, a class of [[crustacean]]s, were abundant as representatives of the [[meiobenthos]]; genera included ''Amphissites'', ''Bairdia'', ''Beyrichiopsis'', ''Cavellina'', ''Coryellina'', ''Cribroconcha'', ''Hollinella'', ''Kirkbya'', ''Knoxiella'', and ''Libumella''.

Amongst the [[echinoderm]]s, the [[crinoid]]s were the most numerous. Dense submarine thickets of long-stemmed crinoids appear to have flourished in shallow seas, and their remains were consolidated into thick beds of rock. Prominent genera include ''Cyathocrinus'', ''Woodocrinus'', and ''Actinocrinus''. Echinoids such as ''[[Archaeocidaris]]'' and ''Palaeechinus'' were also present. The [[blastoid]]s, which included the Pentreinitidae and Codasteridae and superficially resembled crinoids in the possession of long stalks attached to the seabed, attain their maximum development at this time.

===Freshwater and lagoonal invertebrates===
Freshwater Carboniferous invertebrates include various [[bivalve]] [[mollusc]]s that lived in brackish or fresh water, such as ''[[Anthraconaia]]'', ''[[Naiadites]]'', and ''[[Carbonicola]]''; diverse [[crustacean]]s such as ''[[Candona]]'', ''[[Carbonita (genus)|Carbonita]]'', ''[[Darwinula]]'', ''[[Estheria (crustacean)|Estheria]]'', ''[[Acanthocaris]]'', ''[[Dithyrocaris]]'', and ''[[Anthrapalaemon]]''.

[[File:Megarachne BW.jpg|thumb|The upper Carboniferous giant spider-like eurypterid ''[[Megarachne]]'' grew to legspans of {{convert|50|cm|0|abbr=on}}.]]
The [[eurypterid]]s were also diverse, and are represented by such genera as ''[[Adelophthalmus]]'', ''[[Megarachne]]'' (originally misinterpreted as a giant spider, hence its name) and the specialised very large ''[[Hibbertopterus]]''. Many of these were amphibious.

Frequently a temporary return of marine conditions resulted in marine or brackish water genera such as ''[[Lingula (genus)|Lingula]]'', [[Orbiculoidea]], and ''[[Productus]]'' being found in the thin beds known as marine bands.

===Terrestrial invertebrates===
Fossil remains of air-breathing [[insect]]s,{{sfn|Garwood|Sutton|2010}} [[myriapod]]s and [[arachnid]]s{{sfn| Garwood |Dunlop |Sutton |2009}} are known from the late Carboniferous, but so far not from the early Carboniferous.{{sfn| Garwood |Edgecombe |2011}} The first true [[priapulid]]s appeared during this period. Their diversity when they do appear, however, shows that these arthropods were both well developed and numerous. Their large size can be attributed to the moistness of the environment (mostly swampy fern forests) and the fact that the oxygen concentration in the Earth's atmosphere in the Carboniferous was much higher than today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Can Oxygen Set Thermal Limits in an Insect and Drive Gigantism? |last1=Verberk |first1=Wilco C.E.P. |last2=Bilton |first2=David T. |date=July 27, 2011 |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages = e22610|df= |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0022610|pmid = 21818347|pmc=3144910 |bibcode=2011PLoSO...622610V }}&lt;/ref&gt; This required less effort for respiration and allowed [[Arthropoda|arthropods]] to grow larger with the up to {{convert|2.6|m|ft|sp=us|adj=mid|-long}} millipede-like ''[[Arthropleura]]'' being the largest-known land invertebrate of all time. Among the insect groups are the huge predatory [[Protodonata]] (griffinflies), among which was ''[[Meganeura]]'', a giant [[dragonfly]]-like insect and with a wingspan of ca. {{convert|75|cm|0|abbr=on}}—the largest flying insect ever to roam the planet. Further groups are the [[Syntonopterodea]] (relatives of present-day [[Ephemeroptera|mayflies]]), the abundant and often large sap-sucking [[Palaeodictyopteroidea]], the diverse herbivorous [[Protorthoptera]], and numerous [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] [[Dictyoptera]] (ancestors of [[cockroach]]es).{{sfn|Garwood|Sutton|2010}}  Many insects have been obtained from the coalfields of [[Saarbrücken]] and [[Commentry]], and from the hollow trunks of fossil trees in Nova Scotia. Some British coalfields have yielded good specimens: ''[[Archaeoptitus]]'', from the Derbyshire coalfield, had a spread of wing extending to more than {{convert|35|cm|0|abbr=on}}; some specimens (''[[Brodia]]'') still exhibit traces of brilliant wing colors. In the Nova Scotian tree trunks land snails (''[[Archaeozonites]]'', ''[[Dendropupa]]'') have been found.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

===Fish===
Many fish inhabited the Carboniferous seas; predominantly [[Elasmobranch]]s (sharks and their relatives). These included some, like ''[[Psammodus]]'', with crushing pavement-like teeth adapted for grinding the shells of brachiopods, crustaceans, and other marine organisms. Other sharks had piercing teeth, such as the [[Symmoriida]]; some, the [[petalodont]]s, had peculiar cycloid cutting teeth. Most of the sharks were marine, but the [[Xenacanthida]] invaded fresh waters of the coal swamps. Among the [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]], the [[Palaeonisciformes]] found in coastal waters also appear to have migrated to rivers. [[Sarcopterygii|Sarcopterygia]]n fish were also prominent, and one group, the [[Rhizodont]]s, reached very large size.

Most species of Carboniferous marine fish have been described largely from teeth, fin spines and dermal ossicles, with smaller freshwater fish preserved whole.

Freshwater fish were abundant, and include the genera ''[[Ctenodus]]'', ''[[Uronemus]]'', ''[[Acanthodes]]'', ''[[Cheirodus]]'', and ''[[Gyracanthus]]''.

[[Shark]]s (especially the ''Stethacanthids'') underwent a major [[evolutionary radiation]] during the Carboniferous.&lt;ref name=goldsharks/&gt; It is believed that this evolutionary radiation occurred because the decline of the [[Placodermi|placoderms]] at the end of the Devonian period caused many [[Niche (ecology)|environmental niches]] to become unoccupied and allowed new organisms to evolve and fill these niches.&lt;ref name=goldsharks/&gt; As a result of the evolutionary radiation Carboniferous sharks assumed a wide variety of bizarre shapes including ''[[Stethacanthus]]'' which possessed a flat brush-like dorsal fin with a patch of [[Dermal denticle|denticles]] on its top.&lt;ref name=goldsharks/&gt; ''[[Stethacanthus]]''{{'s}} unusual fin may have been used in mating rituals.&lt;ref name=goldsharks&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/evolution/golden_age.htm |title=A Golden Age of Sharks |accessdate=2008-06-23 |website=Biology of Sharks and Rays {{!}} ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research |first=R.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

===Tetrapods===
Carboniferous [[amphibian]]s were diverse and common by the middle of the period, more so than they are today; some were as long as 6 meters, and those fully terrestrial as adults had scaly skin.{{sfn|Stanley|1999|pp=411-412}} They included a number of basal tetrapod groups classified in early books under the [[Labyrinthodont]]ia. These had long bodies, a head covered with bony plates and generally weak or undeveloped limbs. The largest were over 2 meters long. They were accompanied by an assemblage of smaller amphibians included under the [[Lepospondyli]], often only about {{convert|15|cm|0|abbr=on}} long. Some Carboniferous amphibians were aquatic and lived in rivers (''[[Loxomma]]'', ''[[Eogyrinus]]'', ''[[Proterogyrinus]]''); others may have been semi-aquatic (''[[Ophiderpeton]]'', ''[[Amphibamus]]'', ''[[Hyloplesion]]'') or terrestrial (''[[Dendrerpeton]]'', ''[[Tuditanus]]'', ''[[Anthracosaurus]]'').

The [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]] slowed the evolution of amphibians who could not survive as well in the cooler, drier conditions. Reptiles, however, prospered due to specific key adaptations.&lt;ref name=&quot;SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse&quot;/&gt; One of the greatest evolutionary innovations of the Carboniferous was the [[amniote]] egg, which allowed the laying of eggs in a dry environment, allowing for the further exploitation of the land by certain [[tetrapod]]s. These included the earliest [[Sauropsida|sauropsid]] reptiles (''[[Hylonomus]]''), and the earliest known [[synapsid]] (''[[Archaeothyris]]''). These small lizard-like animals quickly gave rise to many descendants, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[mammal]]s.

Reptiles underwent a major evolutionary radiation in response to the drier climate that preceded the rainforest collapse.&lt;ref name=&quot;SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kazlev&gt;{{cite web |first=M. Alan |last=Kazlev |year=1998 |url=http://www.palaeos.com/Paleozoic/Carboniferous/Carboniferous.htm |title=The Carboniferous Period of the Paleozoic Era: 299 to 359 million years ago |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621180851/http://www.palaeos.com/Paleozoic/Carboniferous/Carboniferous.htm |archive-date=2008-06-21 |website=Palaeos.org |access-date=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the Carboniferous period, [[amniote]]s had already diversified into a number of groups, including [[Protorothyrididae|protorothyridids]], [[captorhinidae|captorhinids]], [[Araeoscelidia|araeoscelid]]s, and several [[Family (biology)|families]] of [[pelycosaur]]s.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

===Fungi===
Because plants and animals were growing in size and abundance in this time (for example, ''[[Lepidodendron]]''), land [[fungi]] diversified further. Marine fungi still occupied the oceans. All modern [[class (biology)|classes]] of fungi were present in the Late Carboniferous ([[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] Epoch).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Blackwell |first1=Meredith |last2=Vilgalys |first2=Rytas |last3=James |first3=Timothy Y. |last4=Taylor |first4=John W. |year=2008 |title=Fungi.

==Extinction events==

===Romer's gap===
{{Main|Romer's gap}}
The first 15 million years of the Carboniferous had very limited terrestrial fossils. This gap in the fossil record is called [[Romer's gap]] after the American palaentologist [[Alfred Romer]]. While it has long been debated whether the gap is a result of fossilisation or relates to an actual event, recent work indicates the gap period saw a drop in atmospheric oxygen levels, indicating some sort of [[ecological collapse]].&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ward |first1=P. |first2=Conrad |last2=Labandeira |first3=Michel |last3=Laurin |first4=Robert A. |last4=Berner |date=November 7, 2006 |title=Confirmation of Romer's Gap is a low oxygen interval constraining the timing of initial arthropod and vertebrate terrestrialization |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=103 |issue=45 |pages=16818–16822 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0607824103|pmid=17065318 |pmc=1636538 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/103/45/16818.full.pdf |bibcode=2006PNAS..10316818W }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gap saw the demise of the [[Devonian]] fish-like [[ichthyostegalia]]n labyrinthodonts, and the rise of the more advanced [[Temnospondyli|temnospondyl]] and [[reptiliomorpha]]n amphibians that so typify the Carboniferous terrestrial vertebrate fauna.

===Carboniferous rainforest collapse===
{{Main|Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse}}
Before the end of the Carboniferous Period, an [[extinction event]] occurred. On land this event is referred to as the [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]] (CRC).&lt;ref name=&quot;SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse&quot;/&gt; Vast tropical rainforests collapsed suddenly as the [[Climate change (general concept)|climate changed]] from hot and humid to cool and arid. This was likely caused by intense [[glaciation]] and a drop in sea levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Heckel, P.H. | year=2008 | title=Pennsylvanian cyclothems in Midcontinent North America as far-field effects of waxing and waning of Gondwana ice sheets | journal=Resolving the Late Paleozoic Ice Age in Time and Space:Geological Society of America Special Paper | volume =441 | pages = 275–289 | doi= 10.1130/2008.2441(19) | isbn= 978-0-8137-2441-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new climatic conditions were not favorable to the growth of rainforest and the animals within them. Rainforests shrank into isolated islands, surrounded by seasonally dry habitats. Towering [[lycopsid]] forests with a heterogeneous mixture of vegetation were replaced by much less diverse tree-fern dominated flora.
 
Amphibians, the dominant vertebrates at the time, fared poorly through this event with large losses in biodiversity; reptiles continued to diversify due to key adaptations that let them survive in the drier habitat, specifically the hard-shelled egg and scales, both of which retain water better than their amphibian counterparts.&lt;ref name=&quot;SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse&quot;/&gt;
