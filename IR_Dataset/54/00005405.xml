Higher income inequality is partly driven by unequal regional income distribution. The eastern coastal regions have been the driver of China’s rapid growth, due to its geographic location and the early introduction of reforms. As a result, the eastern coastal region is now home to 38 percent of the population, and its per capita GDP was 77 percent higher than that of the central, western, and northeastern regions in 2018. This gap widened further in the first three quarters of 2019. This is in part due to a disproportionate slowdown in interior provinces, which are more dependent on commodities and heavy industry. The slowdown has been negatively affected by structural shifts, especially necessary cuts in overcapacity (Figure 28).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''China''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|中国}}|p=Zhōngguó}}), officially the '''People's Republic of China''' ('''PRC'''), is a country in [[East Asia]] and is the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|world's most populous country]], with a population of around [[Demographics of China|{{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|China}}|,||}}/1e9 round 3}}&amp;nbsp;billion]] in 2017.

See {{section link||Administrative divisions}}}} five [[Autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]], four [[Direct-controlled municipalities of China|direct-controlled municipalities]] ([[Beijing]], [[Tianjin]], [[Shanghai]], and [[Chongqing]]), and the [[Special administrative regions of China|special administrative regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]].

China emerged as one of the world's [[Cradle of civilization|first civilizations]], in the fertile basin of the [[Yellow River]] in the [[North China Plain]]. For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, or [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasties]], beginning with the semi-mythical [[Xia dynasty]] in 21st century [[Common Era|BCE]]. Since then, China has [[Dynasties in Chinese history|expanded, fractured, and re-unified]] numerous times. In the 3rd century BCE, [[Qin's wars of unification|the Qin reunited core China]] and established [[Qin dynasty|the first Chinese empire]]. The succeeding [[Han dynasty]], which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE, saw some of the [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty|most advanced technology]] at that time, including [[papermaking]] and the [[compass]], along with agricultural and medical improvements. The invention of [[gunpowder]] and [[movable type]] in the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) and [[Northern Song]] (960–1127) completed the [[Four Great Inventions]]. Tang culture spread widely in Asia, as the new [[Silk Road|Silk Route]] brought traders to as far as [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Horn of Africa]]. Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the [[Xinhai Revolution]], when the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China (ROC)]] replaced the [[Qing dynasty]]. China, as a whole, was ravaged by [[Warlord Era|feudal warlordism]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] during [[World War II]]. The subsequent [[Chinese Civil War]] resulted in a division of territory in 1949 when the [[Communist Party of China]] led by [[Mao Zedong]] [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|established]] the People's Republic of China on [[mainland China]] while the [[Kuomintang]]-led nationalist government retreated to the island of [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]] where it governed until 1996 when Taiwan transitioned to democracy. The [[political status of Taiwan]] remains disputed to this day.

China is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[One-party state|one-party]] [[socialist state|socialist republic]] and is one of the few existing [[socialist state]]s. [[List of Chinese dissidents|Political dissidents]] and [[human rights]] groups have denounced and criticized the [[Government of China|Chinese government]] for [[Human rights in China|human rights abuses]], [[Ethnic issues in China|suppression of religious and ethnic minorities]], [[Censorship in China|censorship]] and [[Mass surveillance in China|mass surveillance]], and cracking down on protests [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|such as in 1989]]. The Chinese government says that the right to subsistence and [[economic development]] is a prerequisite to other types of human rights and that the notion of human rights should take into account a country's present economic level.

Since the introduction of [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms in 1978]], [[Economy of China|China's economy]] has been one of the world's [[List of countries by real GDP growth rate|fastest-growing]] with annual growth rates consistently above 6 percent. According to the World Bank, China's GDP grew from $150 billion in 1978 to $12.24 trillion by 2017. According to official data, China's GDP in 2018 was 90 trillion Yuan ($13.5 trillion). Since 2010, China has been the world's second-largest economy by [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|nominal GDP]], and since 2014, the largest economy in the world by [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|purchasing power parity]]. China is also the world's [[List of countries by exports|largest exporter]] and [[List of countries by imports|second-largest importer]] of goods. China is a recognized [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nuclear weapons state]] and has the world's [[List of countries by number of active troops|largest standing army]], the [[People's Liberation Army]], and the [[Military budget of China|second-largest defense budget]]. The PRC is a [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent member]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]] as it replaced the ROC in 1971, as well as an active global partner of [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations#ASEAN Plus Three and Six|ASEAN Plus mechanism]]. Since 2019, China has the highest number of rich people in the world.{{efn|&quot;Rich people&quot; is defined here as the wealthiest 10% of the global population. {{As of|2019}}, this group holds assets of at least {{USD|109,400}}.}} China has been characterized as a [[potential superpower]], mainly because of its massive population, large and rapidly-growing economy, and powerful military.

The [[Xianbei]] unified them as the [[Northern Wei]], whose [[Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei|Emperor Xiaowen]] reversed his predecessors' apartheid policies and [[Northern and Southern dynasties#Northern dynasties|enforced a drastic sinification on his subjects]], largely integrating them into Chinese culture. In the south, the general [[Emperor Wu of Liu Song|Liu Yu]] secured the abdication of the Jin in favor of the [[Liu Song]]. The various successors of these states became known as the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]], with the two areas finally reunited by the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] in 581. The Sui restored the Han to power through China, reformed its agriculture, economy and [[imperial examination]] system, constructed the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]], and patronized [[Buddhism in China|Buddhism]]. However, they fell quickly when their conscription for public works and a [[Goguryeo–Sui War|failed war]] in [[Goguryeo|northern Korea]] provoked widespread unrest.&lt;ref&gt;Ki-Baik Lee (1984).

Between the 10th and 11th centuries, the population of China doubled in size to around 100 million people, mostly because of the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern China, and the production of abundant food surpluses.

The 13th century brought the [[Mongol conquest of China]]. In 1271, the [[Mongols|Mongol]] leader [[Kublai Khan]] established the [[Yuan dynasty]]; the Yuan conquered the last remnant of the Song dynasty in 1279.

In the early years of the Ming dynasty, China's capital was moved from [[Nanjing]] to Beijing. With the budding of capitalism, philosophers such as [[Wang Yangming]] further critiqued and expanded Neo-Confucianism with concepts of [[individualism]] and equality of [[four occupations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wang Yangming (1472—1529)|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/wangyang/|encyclopedia=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=9 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109100108/http://www.iep.utm.edu/wangyang/|archivedate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[scholar-official]] stratum became a supporting force of industry and commerce in the tax boycott movements, which, together with the famines and defense against [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)]] and [[Qing conquest of the Ming|Manchu invasions]] led to an exhausted treasury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.docin.com/p-378667223.html |script-title=zh:论明末士人阶层与资本主义萌芽的关系 |website=docin.com |date=8 April 2012 |accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1644, Beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebel forces led by [[Li Zicheng]]. The [[Chongzhen Emperor]] committed suicide when the city fell. The Manchu [[Qing dynasty]], then allied with Ming dynasty general [[Wu Sangui]], overthrew Li's short-lived [[Shun dynasty]] and subsequently seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty.

China's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from the [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] and [[Taklamakan Desert]]s in the arid north to the [[subtropical]] forests in the wetter south. The [[Himalaya]], [[Karakoram]], [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] and [[Tian Shan]] mountain ranges separate China from much of [[South Asia|South]] and [[Central Asia]]. The [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] and [[Yellow River]]s, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, respectively, run from the [[Tibetan Plateau]] to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is {{convert|14500|km|mi|sp=us}} long and is bounded by the [[Bohai Sea|Bohai]], [[Yellow Sea|Yellow]], [[East China Sea|East China]] and [[South China Sea|South China]] seas. China connects through the Kazakh border to the [[Eurasian Steppe]] which has been an artery of communication between East and West since the Neolithic through the [[Steppe Route|Steppe route]] – the ancestor of the terrestrial [[Silk Road UNESCO World Heritage Sites|Silk Road]](s).

===Landscape and climate===

The territory of China lies between [[latitude]]s [[18th parallel north|18°]] and [[54th parallel north|54° N]], and [[longitude]]s [[73rd meridian east|73°]] and [[135th meridian east|135° E]]. China's landscapes vary significantly across its vast territory. In the east, along the shores of the [[Yellow Sea]] and the [[East China Sea]], there are extensive and densely populated [[alluvium|alluvial plains]], while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, broad [[grassland]]s predominate. Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, while the central-east hosts the [[river delta|deltas]] of China's two major rivers, the [[Yellow River]] and the [[Yangtze River]]. Other major rivers include the [[Xi River|Xi]], [[Mekong]], [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] and [[Amur River|Amur]]. To the west sit major mountain ranges, most notably the Himalayas. High [[plateau]]s feature among the more arid landscapes of the north, such as the [[Taklamakan Desert|Taklamakan]] and the [[Gobi Desert]]. The world's highest point, [[Mount Everest]] (8,848&amp;nbsp;m), lies on the Sino-Nepalese border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8608913.stm|title=Nepal and China agree on Mount Everest's height|date=8 April 2010|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|access-date=18 January 2020|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's lowest point, and the world's third-lowest, is the dried lake bed of [[Ayding Lake]] (−154m) in the [[Turpan Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/deva/naturescience/lowest-places-on-earth.htm|title=Lowest Places on Earth|date=28 February 2015|website=[[National Park Service]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China's climate is mainly dominated by [[dry season]]s and wet [[monsoons]], which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer.

In China, heavy metals also cause environmental pollution. Heavy metal pollution is an inorganic chemical hazard, which is mainly caused by lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), cobalt (Co), and nickel (Ni). Five metals among them, Pb, Cr, As, Cd, and Hg, are the key heavy metal pollutants in China. Heavy metal pollutants mainly come from mining, sewage irrigation, the manufacturing of metal-containing products, and other related production activities. High level of heavy metal exposure can also cause permanent intellectual and developmental disabilities, including reading and learning disabilities, behavioral problems, hearing loss, attention problems, and disruption in the development of visual and motor function. According to the data of a national census of pollution, China has more than 1.5 million sites of heavy metals exposure. The total volume of discharged heavy metals in the waste water, waste gas and solid wastes are around 900,000 tons each year from 2005–2011.&lt;ref&gt;Hu, Hui, Qian Jin, and Philip Kavan. &quot;A study of heavy metal pollution in China: Current status, pollution-control policies and countermeasures.&quot; Sustainability 6.9 (2014): 5820–5838.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of China|Districts of Hong Kong|Municipalities of Macau}}
The People's Republic of China is divided into 22 [[Provinces of China|provinces]], five [[Autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]] (each with a designated minority group), and four [[Direct-controlled municipality of China|municipalities]]—collectively referred to as &quot;[[mainland China]]&quot;—as well as the [[special administrative region]]s (SARs) of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]. Geographically, all 31 provincial divisions of mainland China can be grouped into six regions: [[North China]], [[Northeast China]], [[East China]], [[South Central China]], [[Southwest China]], and [[Northwest China]].

China considers [[Taiwan]] to be [[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|its 23rd province]], although Taiwan is governed by the [[Republic of China]] (ROC), which rejects the PRC's claim.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_ap&quot;&gt;Gwillim Law (2 April 2005).

Ever since its establishment after the second [[Chinese Civil War]], the PRC has claimed [[Free area of the Republic of China|the territories]] governed by the [[Republic of China]] (ROC), a separate political entity today commonly known as Taiwan, as a part of its territory. It regards the [[island of Taiwan]] as its [[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|Taiwan Province]], [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] as a part of [[Fujian Province]] and islands the ROC controls in the [[South China Sea]] as a part of [[Hainan Province]] and [[Guangdong Province]]. These claims are controversial because of the complicated [[Cross-Strait relations]], with the PRC treating the [[One-China policy]] as one of its most important diplomatic principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.cultural-china.com/en/34History7320.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130912132339/http://history.cultural-china.com/en/34History7320.html|archivedate=12 September 2013|title=Chinese Civil War|publisher=Cultural-China.com|quote=To this day, since no armistice or peace treaty has ever been signed, there is controversy as to whether the Civil War has legally ended.|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While economic and social controls have been significantly relaxed in China since the 1970s, [[political freedom]] is still tightly restricted.

In 2019 a world-first study called for the mass retraction of more than 400 scientific papers on [[Organ transplantation in China|organ transplantation]], because of fears the organs were obtained unethically from Chinese prisoners. The study was published in the medical journal BMJ Open. A report published in 2016 found a large discrepancy between official transplant figures from the Chinese government and the number of transplants reported by hospitals. While the government says 10,000 transplants occur each year, hospital data shows between 60,000 and 100,000 organs are transplanted each year. The report provided evidence that this gap is being made up by executed [[prisoners of conscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/feb/06/call-for-retraction-of-400-scientific-papers-amid-fears-organs-came-from-chinese-prisoners|title=Call for retraction of 400 scientific papers amid fears organs came from Chinese prisoners|last=Davey|first=Melissa|date=5 February 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=16 October 2019|url-status=live|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its founding in 1949 until late 1978, the People's Republic of China was a Soviet-style centrally [[planned economy]]. Following Mao's death in 1976 and the consequent end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], [[Deng Xiaoping]] and the new Chinese leadership began to [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|reform the economy]] and move towards a more market-oriented [[mixed economy]] under one-party rule. [[Collective farming|Agricultural collectivization]] was dismantled and farmlands privatized, while foreign trade became a major new focus, leading to the creation of [[Special Economic Zone]]s (SEZs). Inefficient [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned enterprises]] (SOEs) were restructured and unprofitable ones were closed outright, resulting in massive job losses.

Given concerns about population growth, China implemented a two-child limit during the 1970s, and, in 1979, began to advocate for an even stricter limit of one child per family. Beginning in the mid 1980s, however, given the unpopularity of the strict limits, China began to allow some major exemptions, particularly in rural areas, resulting in what was actually a &quot;1.5&quot;-child policy from the mid-1980s to 2015 (ethnic minorities were also exempt from one child limits). The next major loosening of the policy was enacted in December 2013, allowing families to have two children if one parent is an only child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China formalizes easing of one-child policy|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/12/28/china-one-child-policy/4230785/|newspaper=USA Today|date=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the one-child policy was replaced in favor of a [[two-child policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-12/27/c_134955448.htm|title=Top legislature amends law to allow all couples to have two children|publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]]| date=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from the 2010 census implies that the [[total fertility rate]] may be around 1.4, although due to underreporting of births it may be closer to 1.5–1.6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18651512 |title=The most surprising demographic crisis |work=The Economist |date=5 May 2011 |accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their own counterfactual model of fertility decline without such restrictions implies that China averted more than 500 million births between 1970 and 2015, a number which may reach one billion by 2060 given all the lost descendants of births averted during the era of fertility restrictions, with one-child restrictions accounting for the great bulk of that reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goodkind |first1=Daniel |title=The Astonishing Population Averted by China's Birth Restrictions: Estimates, Nightmares, and Reprogrammed Ambitions |journal=Demography |date=2017 |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=1375–1400 |doi=10.1007/s13524-017-0595-x |pmid=28762036 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7dcb4537e267aa61f75f87bc82062644d9965652 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clear data on religious affiliation in China is difficult to gather due to varying definitions of &quot;religion&quot; and the unorganized, diffusive nature of Chinese religious traditions.

Since ancient times, Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by [[Confucianism]].

The first leaders of the People's Republic of China were born into the traditional imperial order, but were influenced by the [[May Fourth Movement]] and reformist ideals. They sought to change some traditional aspects of Chinese culture, such as rural land tenure, [[sexism]], and the Confucian system of education, while preserving others, such as the family structure and culture of obedience to the state. Some observers see the period following the establishment of the PRC in 1949 as a continuation of traditional Chinese dynastic history, while others claim that the Communist Party's rule has damaged the foundations of Chinese culture, especially through political movements such as the [[Cultural Revolution]] of the 1960s, where many aspects of traditional culture were destroyed, having been denounced as &quot;regressive and harmful&quot; or &quot;vestiges of [[feudalism]]&quot;.

And the bean products, such as [[tofu]] and [[soy milk]], remain as a popular source of protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://wenku.baidu.com/view/fca14f07866fb84ae45c8de0.html |script-title=zh:中国居民豆类及豆制品的消费现状 |journal=Food and Nutrition in China |issue=January 2008 |accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pork is now the most popular meat in China, accounting for about three-fourths of the country's total meat consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2013/06/19/chinas-hunger-for-pork-will-impact-the-u-s-meat-industry/|title=China's Hunger For Pork Will Impact The U.S. Meat Industry|date=19 June 2013|newspaper=[[Forbes]]|access-date=18 January 2020|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; While pork dominates the meat market, there is also the vegetarian [[Buddhist cuisine]] and the pork-free [[Chinese Islamic cuisine]]. Southern cuisine, due to the area's proximity to the ocean and milder climate, has a wide variety of seafood and vegetables; it differs in many respects from the wheat-based diets across dry northern China. Numerous offshoots of Chinese food, such as [[Cuisine of Hong Kong#Eastern Styles|Hong Kong cuisine]] and [[American Chinese food]], have emerged in the nations that play host to the [[Chinese diaspora]].
