Cambodia's main [[geography|geographical]] features are the low lying Central Plain that includes the [[Tonlé Sap]] basin,  the lower [[Mekong River]] flood-plains and the [[Bassac River]] plain surrounded by mountain ranges to the north, east, in the south-west and south. The central lowlands extend into Vietnam to the south-east. The south and south-west of the country constitute a {{convert|443|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long coast at the Gulf of Thailand, characterized by sizable [[mangrove]] marshes, [[peninsula]]s, sandy beaches and [[headlands and bays]]. Cambodia's territorial waters account for over 50 islands.

The landmass is bisected by the [[Mekong river]], which at {{convert|486|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} is the longest river in Cambodia. After extensive rapids, [[Khone Falls|turbulent sections]] and [[cataracts]] in [[Laos]], the river enters the country at [[Stung Treng]] province, is predominantly calm and navigable during the entire year as it widens considerably in the lowlands. The Mekong's waters disperse into the surrounding wetlands of central Cambodia and strongly affect the seasonal nature of the [[Tonlé Sap]] lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ffw.mrcmekong.org/south.htm |title=Information Resources - Southern Part |website=Mekong River Commission |date=May 11, 2015 |accessdate=May 14, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512074812/http://ffw.mrcmekong.org/south.htm |archive-date=2015-05-12 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whrm-kamoto.com/assets/files/World%20geographical%20dictionary_CAM%2030%20May2013.pdf   |title= World Geographical Dictionary On Cambodia six distinct terrestrial eco‐regions in Cambodia have been recognized |publisher=  Water Hazard and Risk management |date= May 31, 2013 |accessdate=June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two third of the country's population live in the lowlands, where the rich sediment deposited during the Mekong's annual flooding makes the agricultural lands highly fertile. As [[Deforestation in Cambodia|deforestation]] and over-exploitation affected Cambodia only in recent decades, forests, low mountain ranges and local eco-regions still retain much of their natural potential and although still home to the largest areas of contiguous and intact forests in mainland Southeast Asia, multiple serious environmental issues persist and accumulate, which are closely related to rapid population growth, uncontrolled [[globalization]] and inconsequential administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lizasreef.com/HOPE%20FOR%20THE%20RAIN%20FORESTS/rain_forests_of_the_world.htm |title=Rain Forests of the World | website= Lizas Reef |date= |accessdate=May 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rainforests.mongabay.com/20cambodia.htm |title=Environmental issues in Cambodia | website= Rainforests Mongabay |date=August 15, 2014 |accessdate=May 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cambodiadaily.com/news/officials-unable-to-explain-mystery-ships-99537/ |title= Officials Unable to Explain Mystery Ships | publisher= The Cambodia Daily |date=November 6, 2015 |accessdate=November 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/conservation-activists-arrested-koh-kong | title= Conservation activists arrested in Koh Kong   | publisher= Phnom Penh Post  |date=August 18, 2015  |accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/in-cambodia-quality-wood-makes-for-murder/ | title= In Cambodia, quality wood makes for murder | publisher=  CBSNews |date=November 13, 2012 |accessdate=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the country lies within the [[Tropical savanna climate]] zone, as the coastal areas in the South and West receive noticeably more and steady rain [[Mango showers|before]] and during the wet season. These areas constitute the easternmost fringes of the [[Monsoon of South Asia|south-west monsoon]], determined to be inside the [[Tropical monsoon climate]]. Countrywide there are two seasons of relatively equal length, defined by varying [[precipitation]] as temperatures and humidity are generally high and steady throughout the entire year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.tourismcambodia.com/tripplanner/general-travel-information/climate-and-weather.htm | title=Climate and Weather | publisher= Tourism of Cambodia  |date=  |accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Southeast Asia consists of [[allochthon]]ous continental blocks from [[Gondwana]]land. These include the South China, [[Indochina]], [[Sibumasu]], and West Burma blocks, which amalgamated to form the Southeast Asian continent during the [[Paleozoic]] and [[Mesozoic]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6wMfMgSmckkC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=The+South+China+Block-Indochina+collision:+where,+when,+and+how%3F#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20South%20China%20Block-Indochina%20collision%3A%20where%2C%20when%2C%20and%20how%3F&amp;f=false |title=Late Palaeozoic and Mesozoic Ecosystems in SE Asia

The Indochina [[continent]]al block, which is separated from the South China Block by the Jinshajiang-Ailaoshan [[Suture (geology)|Suture]] zone, is an amalgamation of the Viet-Lao, Khorat-Kontum, Uttaradit (UTD), and Chiang Mai-West Kachin [[terrane]]s, all of which are separated by [[Suture (geology)|suture zones]] or ductile [[shear zone]]s.
The Khorat-Kontum terrane, which includes western Laos, Cambodia and southern Vietnam, consists of the Kontum [[Metamorphic core complex|metamorphic complex]], [[Paleozoic]] shallow marine deposits, upper [[Permian]] arc volcanic rocks and Mesozoic [[Terrigenous sediment|terrigenous]] [[sediment]]ary rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.cugb.edu.cn/upload/20600/papers_upload/news_2010122105227.pdf |title=Structural and geochronological constraints on the tectonic evolution of the Dulong-Song Chay tectonic dome in Yunnan province, SW China |journal=Journal of Asian Earth Sciences |volume=28 |issue=4–6 |pages=332 |accessdate=May 13, 2015 |bibcode=2006JAESc..28..332Y |last1=Yan |first1=Dan-Ping |last2=Zhou |first2=Mei-Fu |last3=Wang |first3=Christina Yan |last4=Xia |first4=Bin |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.jseaes.2005.10.011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908203853/http://www.cugb.edu.cn/upload/20600/papers_upload/news_2010122105227.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-08 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soils===
[[Image:Acrisolprof.JPG|thumb|120px|Low fertile [[Acrisol]]]]
&quot;Sandy materials cover a large proportion of the landscape of Cambodia, on account of the [[Siliceous rock|siliceous]] [[sediment]]ary formations that underlie much of the Kingdom. [[Mesozoic]] [[sandstone]] dominates most of the basement geology in Cambodia and hence has a dominating influence on the properties of upland soils. [[Arenosol]]s (sandy soils featuring very weak or no soil development) are mapped on only 1.6% of the land area.&quot;

&quot;Sandy surface textures are more prevalent than the deep sandy soils that fit the definition for Arenosols. Sandy textured profiles are common amongst the most prevalent soil groups, including [[Acrisol]]s and [[Leptosol]]s. The Acrisols are the most prevalent soil group occupying the lowlands - nearly half of the land area of Cambodia. Low fertility and toxic amounts of aluminium pose limitations to its agricultural use, crops that can be successfully cultivated include [[rubber tree]], [[oil palm]], [[coffee]] and [[sugar cane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/W8594E/w8594e00.htm#  |title= World reference base for soil resources | publisher= FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS Rome, 1998 |date= |accessdate=June 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The main subgroups are: Gleyic Acrisols (20.5%, Haplic Acrisols (13.3%), Plinthic Acrisol (8.7%) and Ferric Acrisol (6.3%).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;fao.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/ag125e/AG125E07.htm |title=Management of tropical sandy soils for sustainable agriculture |website=FAO Document Repository |date= |accessdate=May 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central plain===
[[Image:Cambo 152.jpg|thumb|right|Extensive flooding in central Cambodia]]

The vast [[Alluvial plain|alluvial]] and [[Lacustrine plain|lacustrine]] interconnected Cambodian flood-plain is a geologically relatively recent depression where the sediments of the Mekong and its tributaries accumulate as waters are subject to frequent course changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrcmekong.org/RAK/html/1.2.5a_lower_reaches.html |title=THE LOWER REACHES AND DELTA REGIONS |website=MRC Mekong |date= |accessdate=May 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area covers {{convert|25069|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. The [[Tonlé Sap]] lake and - river system occupies the lowest area. The Tonle Sap river is a waterway that branches off the Mekong near Phnom Penh in the north-westerly direction and meets the Tonle Sap lake after around {{convert|115|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. Its waters' flow reverses direction every year, caused by greatly varying amounts of water carried by the Mekong over the course of a year and the impact of monsoonal rains, that coincides with the river's maximum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Cambodian+Plain |title= Cambodian Plain definition of Cambodian Plain | publisher= Free Online Encyclopedia |date=  |accessdate=June 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plains of the Mekong and Tonle Sap basin are confined in the North by the Dangrek and Central Annamite Mountains, and to the South by the Cardamom Mountains and Elephant Mountains. The plains completely surround the Tonle Sap Lake in the western half of the country and wind their way through the middle of the country following the course of the Mekong River. The two basins actually form a single body of water, the whole of which effects about 75% of Cambodia’s land cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treeseedfa.org/doc/GeneEcologicalZonation/4DescriptionofEcological.pdf |title=Description of Ecological Factors in Cambodia |publisher=Cambodia Tree Seed Project |accessdate=May 20, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304095439/http://www.treeseedfa.org/doc/GeneEcologicalZonation/4DescriptionofEcological.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flow reversal===
[[File:Tonle Sap Lake phases.gif|thumb|Tonle Sap Lake volume over the course of one year|alt=]]
The Mekong river and its tributaries increase water volumes in spring (May) on the northern hemisphere, mainly caused by melting snows. As the Mekong enters Cambodia (over 95% of its waters have already joined the river) it widens and inundates large areas.

Water levels, not flow rates and volumes, determine the movement of water across the landscape.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mekonginfo.org/assets/midocs/0001968-inland-waters-overview-of-the-hydrology-of-the-mekong-basin.pdf |title=Overview of the Hydrology of the Mekong Basin  | publisher= Mekong Info |date=October 1, 2005  |accessdate=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The plain's deepest point - the Tonle Sap -  flooded area varies from a low of around {{convert|2700|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} with a depth of around 1 meter at the end of the dry season (April) to {{convert|26000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} and a depth of up to 9 meters in October/November. This figure rose to {{convert|45000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} during 2000 when some of the worst flood conditions recorded caused over 800 deaths in Cambodia and Vietnam.

Inflow starts in May/June with maximum rates of flow of around 10,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s by late August and ends in October/November, amplified by precipitation of the annual monsoon. In November the lake reaches its maximum size. The annual monsoon coincides to cease around this time of the year. As the Mekong river begins its minimum around this time of the year and its water level falls deeper than the inundated Tonle Sap lake, Tonle Sap river and surrounding wetlands, waters of the lake's basin now drains via the Tonle Sap river into the Mekong. As a result the Tonle Sap River (length around {{convert|115|km|mi|abbr=on}}) flows 6 months a year from South-East (Mekong) to North-West (lake) and 6 month a year in the opposite direction. The mean annual reverse flow volume in the Tonle Sap is {{convert|30|km3|mi3|abbr=on}}, or about half of the maximum lake volume. A further 10% is estimated to enter the system by overland flow from the Mekong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tonlesap.net/ |title= Tonle Sap Cambodia - River Lake |publisher= Tonle Sap |accessdate= May 12, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150504074909/http://tonlesap.net/ |archive-date= May 4, 2015 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;State of water : Cambodia&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wepa-db.net/policies/state/cambodia/overview1_4.htm |title=State of water : Cambodia  | publisher= WEPA |date=  |accessdate=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mekong branches off into [[Bassac River|several arms]] near [[Phnom Penh]] and reaches Vietnamese territory south of Koh Thom and Loek Daek districts of [[Kandal Province]].

[[Image:Koppen World Map Am.png|thumb|right|300px|Worldwide zones of tropical monsoon climate (Am).]]
Cambodia's climate, like that of much of the rest of mainland Southeast Asia is dominated by [[monsoon]]s, which are known as tropical wet and dry because of the distinctly marked seasonal differences. The monsoonal air-flows are caused by annual alternating high pressure and low pressure over the Central Asian landmass. In summer, moisture-laden air—the southwest monsoon—is drawn landward from the Indian Ocean. The flow is reversed during the winter, and the northeast monsoon sends back dry air. The southwest monsoon brings the rainy season from mid-May to mid-September or to early October, and the northeast monsoon flow of drier and cooler air lasts from early November to March. Temperatures are fairly uniform throughout the [[Tonlé Sap]] Basin area, with only small variations from the average annual mean of around {{convert|25|°C|1}}.

The maximum mean is about {{convert|30|°C|abbr=on}} ; the minimum mean, about {{convert|24|°C|abbr=on}}. Maximum temperatures of higher than {{convert|32|°C|abbr=on}}, however, are common and, just before the start of the rainy season, they may rise to more than {{convert|38|°C|abbr=on}}. Minimum night temperatures sporadically fall below {{convert|20|°C|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web    |url=http://www.cambodiaweather.net/weather/sihanoukville-cambodia-weather-in-january.html    |title=Sihanoukville weather in January    |publisher=Cambodia Weather net    |accessdate=May 27, 2015    |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527111738/http://www.cambodiaweather.net/weather/sihanoukville-cambodia-weather-in-january.html    |archive-date=2015-05-27    |url-status=dead    }}&lt;/ref&gt; in January, the coldest month.

The total annual rainfall average is between {{convert|1000|and|1500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, and the heaviest amounts fall in the southeast. Rainfall from April to September in the [[Tonlé Sap]] Basin-Mekong Lowlands area averages {{convert|1300|to|1500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} annually, but the amount varies considerably from year to year. Rainfall around the basin increases with elevation. It is heaviest in the mountains along the coast in the southwest, which receive from {{convert|2500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} to more than {{convert|5000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of precipitation annually as the southwest monsoon reaches the coast. This area of greatest rainfall, however, drains mostly to the sea; only a small quantity goes into the rivers flowing into the basin. Relative humidity is high throughout the entire year; usually exceeding 90%. During the dry season daytime humidity rates average around 50 percent or slightly lower, climbing to about 90% during the rainy season.&lt;ref name=&quot;fao.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/90520/Cambodia/52452/Climate |title=Cambodia's climate |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |date= |accessdate=May 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major rivers are the [[Stung Sen Wildlife Sanctuary|Sen river]], [[Sreng River]], [[Stung Pouthisat River]], [[Sisophon River]], [[Mongkol Borei River]], and [[Sangkae River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.fao.org/nr/water/espim/country/cambodia/print1.stm | title=FAO's Information System on Water and Agriculture | publisher= AQUASTAT  |date=  |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.wepa-db.net/policies/state/cambodia/river.htm | title=State of water environmental issues | publisher= Water Environment Partnership in Asia  |date=  |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller rivers in the southeast, the Cardamom Mountains and Elephant Range form separate [[drainage divide]]s. To the east the rivers flow into the Tonle Sap, as in the south-west rivers flow into the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. Toward the southern slopes of the Elephant Mountains, small rivers flow south-eastward on the eastern side of the divide.

The Mekong River flows southward from the Cambodia-Laos border to a point south of [[Kratié (town)]], where it turns west for about {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} and then turns southwest towards Phnom Penh. Extensive rapids run north of [[Kratié (town)|Kratie city]]. From [[Kampong Cham Province]] the gradient slopes very gently, and inundation of areas along the river occurs at flood stage. From June through November—through breaks in the natural [[levee]]s that have built up along its course. At Phnom Penh four major water courses meet at a point called the Chattomukh (Four Faces). The Mekong River flows in from the northeast and the Tonle Sap river emanates from the Tonle Sap—flows in from the northwest. They divide into two parallel channels, the Mekong River proper and the [[Bassac River]], and flow independently through the delta areas of Cambodia and Vietnam to the [[South China Sea]].

The flow of water into the Tonle Sap is seasonal. In spring, the flow of the Mekong River, fed by monsoon rains, increases to a point where its outlets through the delta can't handle the enormous volume of water. At this point, the water pushes northward up the Tonle Sap river and empties into the Tonle Sap lake, thereby increasing the size of the lake from about {{convert|2590|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} to about {{convert|24605|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} at the height of the flooding. After the Mekong's waters crest — when its downstream channels can handle the volume of water — the flow reverses, and water flows out of the engorged lake.

As the level of the Tonle Sap retreats, it deposits a new layer of sediment. The annual flooding, combined with poor drainage immediately around the lake, transforms the surrounding area into marshlands, unusable for agricultural purposes during the dry season. The sediment deposited into the lake during the Mekong's flood stage appears to be greater than the quantity carried away later by the Tonle Sap River. Gradual silting of the lake would seem to be occurring; during low-water level, it is only about {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep, while at flood stage it is between {{convert|10|and|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mekonginfo.org/assets/midocs/0001968-inland-waters-overview-of-the-hydrology-of-the-mekong-basin.pdf |title= Overview of the Hydrology of the Mekong Basin | publisher= Mekong River Commission |date=  |accessdate=June 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/cambodia/38.htm |title= Cambodia - Rivers |website= U.S. Library of Congress |date= |accessdate=June 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Forest and land cover Cambodia.jpg|thumb|left| Map of forests, vegetation and [[land use]] in Cambodia]]
Cambodia has one of the highest levels of forest cover in the region as the interdependence of Cambodia’s geography and hydrology makes it rich in natural resources and biological diversity - among the bio-richest countries in Southeast Asia. The Royal Government of Cambodia estimates Cambodia contains approximately 10.36 million hectares of forest cover, representing approximately 57.07% of Cambodia’s land area (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://cambodia.panda.org/where_we_work/dry_forests/ |title=Saving Cambodia's Dry Forests |publisher=WWF |accessdate=May 16, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521101348/http://cambodia.panda.org/where_we_work/dry_forests/ |archive-date=2015-05-21 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, international observers and independent sources provide rather different numbers.

===The Great Lake ecosystem===
[[Image:Engkabang (Shorea sp.) (15607560356).jpg|thumb|right|[[Dipterocarpaceae]]]]
The Tonle Sap, also known as the Great Lake in central Cambodia is the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia and one of the richest inland fishing grounds in the world. The Lake functions as a natural flood water reservoir for the Mekong system as a whole and therefore is an important source of water for the Mekong Delta during the dry season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whrm-kamoto.com/assets/files/PublicationFile20%20tonele%20sap.pdf   |title= The importance of Tonle Sap at multiple levels |publisher=  Water Hazard and Risk management |date= |accessdate=June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ecosystem has developed as a result of the Mekong’s seasonal flow fluctuations. A belt of freshwater mangroves known as the &quot;flooded forest&quot; surrounds the lake. The floodplains in turn are surrounded by low hills, covered with evergreen [[seasonal tropical forest]] with substantial [[Dipterocarpaceae|dipterocarp]] vegetation or [[deciduous]] [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|dry forest]]. The eco-region consists of a mosaic of habitats for a great number of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://193.62.154.38/diptero/ | title= Dipterocarpaceae Data Base  |website= Forestry Research Programme  |date=  |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forest gradually yields to bushes and finally grassland with increasing distance from the lake.

Threats to the lake include widespread pollution, stress through growth of the local population which is dependent on the lake for subsistence and livelihood, over-harvesting of fish and other aquatic - often endangered - species, habitat destruction and potential changes in the hydrology, such as the construction and operation of dams, that disrupt the lake's natural flood cycle.

===Coastal habitats===
[[Image:Koh Kong mangrove forest.jpg|thumb|right|Mangrove forests in [[Koh Kong Province]] Cambodia, September 2013]]

The Cambodian coastline consists of {{convert|60000|ha|acre|abbr=on}} of over 30 species of [[mangrove]]s - among the most biologically diverse wetlands on earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;idrc.ca&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Resources/Publications/Pages/ArticleDetails.aspx?PublicationID=912 | title= Protecting mangrove forests in Cambodia  |website= International Development Research Centre (IDRC)  |date= |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most pristine mangrove forests are found in Koh Kong Province. In addition to mangroves, [[Seagrass|sea-grass]] beds extend throughout the coastal areas, especially in Kampot Province, the Sihanoukville Bay Delta and the Kep municipal waters. The meadows are highly productive, but few animals feed directly on the grasses. Those that do tend to be vertebrates such as sea turtles, dabbling ducks and geese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://php.radford.edu/~swoodwar/biomes/?page_id=831 |title= Seagrass meadows - Biomes of the World |website= Department of Geospatial Science Radford University |date= |accessdate=June 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldfishcenter.org/Pubs/CambodiaProceedings/pdf/CambodiaProceedings-02.pdf | title= Biodiversity of Cambodia's Wetlands |website=WorldFish Center |date= |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mangrovesforthefuture.org/countries/members/cambodia/ | title= Cambodia - Mangroves for the Future  |website= Mangroves for the Future  |date= |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;With their roots deep in mud, jagged and gnarled mangrove trees are able to grow in the brackish wetlands between land and sea where other plant life cannot survive. The trees offer refuge and nursery grounds for fish, crabs, shrimp, and mollusks. They are nesting - and migratory sites for hundreds of bird species. They also provide homes for monkeys, lizards, sea turtles, and many other animals as well as countless insects.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;idrc.ca&quot;/&gt;

&quot;Until relatively recently, the mangroves of Koh Kong, Cambodia have remained relatively intact. This is partly because of the region’s location — it is an isolated, inaccessible place — and because decades of war and conflict perversely protected the forests from over-exploitation. Local people, however, tended to use the forest's sustainability, for food, fuel, medicine, building materials, and other basic needs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;idrc.ca&quot;/&gt;

Cambodia is home to a wide array of wildlife. There are 212 [[mammal]] species, 536 [[bird]] species, 176 [[reptile]] species (including 89 subspecies), 850 freshwater [[fish]] species ([[Tonlé Sap]] Lake area), and 435 marine fish species.
Many of the country's species are recognized by the [[IUCN]] or World Conservation Union as threatened, endangered, or critically endangered due to [[Deforestation in Cambodia|deforestation]] and habitat destruction, [[poaching]], illegal [[wildlife trade]], farming, fishing, and unauthorized forestry concessions. Intensive poaching may have already driven Cambodia's national animal, the [[Kouprey]], to extinction. Wild tigers, Eld's deer, wild water buffaloes and hog deer are at critically low numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fauna-flora.org/explore/cambodia/ | title= Cambodia  |website=Fauna &amp; Flora International (FFI)  |date= |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fauna-flora.org/news/remote-wildlife-eden-uncovered-in-cambodia/ | title= Remote wildlife Eden uncovered in Cambodia  |website=Fauna &amp; Flora International (FFI)  |date= |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reptile-database.org |title=Reptiles  | publisher=Reptile Database  |date=January 15, 1999  |accessdate=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kohrong-sanloem.com/species|title=Cambodia's Islands - SPECIES|publisher=Cambodia islands – Island Species Cambodia|accessdate=December 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222053212/http://kohrong-sanloem.com/species|archive-date=December 22, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Administrative divisions of Cambodia}}
Cambodia borders Vietnam over a length of {{convert|1228|km|mi|abbr=on}}, Thailand over a length of {{convert|803|km|mi|abbr=on}} and Laos over a length of {{convert|541|km|mi|abbr=on}}, with {{convert|2572|km|mi|abbr=on}} in total and an additional {{convert|443|km|mi|abbr=on}} of coastline. The capital (''reach thani'') and provinces (''khaet'') of Cambodia are first-level administrative divisions. Cambodia is divided into 25 [[Provinces of Cambodia|provinces]] including the capital.

Municipalities and districts are the second-level administrative divisions of Cambodia. The provinces are subdivided into 159 districts and 26 municipalities. The districts and municipalities in turn are further divided into communes (''khum'') and quarters (''sangkat'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geonames.org/KH/administrative-division-cambodia.html | title=Administrative divisions of Cambodia | publisher= GeoNames |date=  |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land use===

Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam have experienced major changes in land use and land cover over the last two decades. The emergence from cold war rivalries and recent major economic reforms result in a shift from subsistence agrarian modes of production to market-based agricultural production and industrialized economies, which are heavily integrated into regional and global trade systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdri.org.kh/webdata/download/wp/wp53e.pdf |title=An Investigation of Land Cover and Land Use Change in Stung Chrey Bak Catchment, Cambodia |website=Cambodia Development Resource Institute |accessdate=May 26, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526110703/http://www.cdri.org.kh/webdata/download/wp/wp53e.pdf |archive-date=2015-05-26 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional divisions===

Cambodia's boundaries were for the most part based upon those recognized by [[France]] and by neighboring countries during the [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|colonial period]]. The {{convert|800|km|mi|abbr=on}} boundary with Thailand runs along the [[drainage divide|watershed]] of the Dangrek Mountains, although only in its northern sector. The {{convert|541|km|mi|abbr=on}} border with Laos and the {{convert|1228|km|mi|abbr=on}} border with Vietnam result from French administrative decisions and do not follow major natural features. Border disputes have broken out in the past and do persist between Cambodia and Thailand as well as between Cambodia and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ibru/publications/full/bsb5-2_amer.pdf?origin=publication_detail | title=Border Conflicts between Cambodia and Vietnam  | publisher= Durham University |date=  |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2012/01/27/thai-cambodian-conflict-rooted-in-history/ | title=Thai–Cambodian conflict rooted in history  | publisher= East Asia Forum |date=January 27, 2012  |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cambodianlifestory.com/thailand-cambodia-a-love-hate-relationships/ |title= Thailand-Cambodia &quot; A love-hate relationships&quot; |publisher= Cambodian Life Story |date= January 23, 2013 |accessdate= June 6, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150606230918/http://www.cambodianlifestory.com/thailand-cambodia-a-love-hate-relationships/ |archive-date= 2015-06-06 |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/06/cambodias-impossible-dream-koh-tral/

It is expected to get 30-year-production permit in the second quarter of 2011.
In late 1969, the Cambodian government granted a permit to a French company to explore for [[petroleum]] in the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. By 1972 none had been located, and exploration ceased when the [[Khmer Republic]] (see Appendix B) fell in 1975. Subsequent oil and gas discoveries in the Gulf of Thailand and in the [[South China Sea]], however, could spark renewed interest in Cambodia's offshore area, especially because the country is on the same [[continental shelf]] as its Southeast Asian oil-producing neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/05/world/asia/05cambo.html?_r=0 |title= Big Oil in Tiny Cambodia: The Burden of New Wealth  |date=May 5, 2007 | publisher= The New York Times Company |accessdate=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
