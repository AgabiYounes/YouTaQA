{{Politics of Central African Republic}}
The '''politics of the [[Central African Republic]]''' formally take place in a framework of a [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] [[republic]]. In this system, the [[Heads of state of the Central African Republic (and Central African Empire)|President]] is the [[head of state]], with a  [[Heads of government of the Central African Republic (and Central African Empire)|Prime Minister]] as [[head of government]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and parliament.

Changes in government have occurred in recent years by three methods: violence, negotiations, and elections. Both Bozize and Djotodia assumed the Presidency through takeover by violent means; however, elections were held in March 2005 and promised in 2013. A ceasefire agreement in January 2013 called for a multipartisan unity government.

The government was deposed on March 13, 2003 by forces under the rebel leader [[François Bozizé]], who promised elections in 18 to 30 months. A new cabinet was set up on April 1, 2003. Elections were held on March 13, 2005.

On January 11, 2013, a ceasefire was signed by the [[Séléka]] rebel coalition, which had aimed to bring down the government of President Bozizé. According to this agreement, a new unity government would be formed. The President would appoint a new prime minister from the opposition parties, and the [[National Assembly of the Central African Republic]] would be dissolved and new legislative elections would be held within twelve months.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20990671 Central African Republic ceasefire signed]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, two months later, the Séléka rebels felt their terms were not being met, and at the culmination of the [[2012-2013 Central African Republic conflict]], they attacked and took the capital, [[Bangui]].  The president, Bozizé, fled to neighboring [[Cameroon]] via the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] on March 24, 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn20130324&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/24/world/africa/central-african-republic-unrest/index.html |title=Central African Republic president flees capital amid violence, official says |date=24 Mar 2013 |accessdate=24 Mar 2013 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt20130326&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/world/africa/leader-of-central-african-republic-francois-bozize-is-in-cameroon.html | title =Leader of Central African Republic Fled to Cameroon, Official Says | author =Lydia Polgreen | work =The New York Times | date =25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
