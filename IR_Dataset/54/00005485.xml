[[File:Djemah Ferry Boat.jpeg|thumb|Ferries such as this one near [[Djemah]] are sometimes used to transport vehicles across rivers.]]
Modes of [[transport]] in the [[Central African Republic]] include [[road transport|road]], [[water transport|water]], and [[air transport|air]]. Most but not all of the country is connected to the road network, much of which is unpaved, and which centres on the ''routes nationales'' identified as RN1 to RN11. [[Bangui]] serves as a [[seaport]], and 900 km of inland waterways are [[Navigability|navigable]], the main route being the [[Oubangui]] river. There is one international [[airport]] at [[Bangui M'Poko International Airport|Bangui-Mpoko]], two other paved airports, and over 40 with unpaved runways.
