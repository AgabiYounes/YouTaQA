'''Cameroon''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-Cameroon-pronunciation.ogg|ˌ|k|æ|m|ə|ˈ|r|uː|n}}; {{lang-fr|Cameroun}}), officially the '''Republic of Cameroon''' ({{lang-fr|République du Cameroun|links=no}}), is a country in [[Central Africa]]. It is bordered by [[Nigeria]] to the west and north; [[Chad]] to the northeast; the [[Central African Republic]] to the east; and [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Gabon]] and the [[Republic of the Congo]] to the south. Cameroon's coastline lies on the [[Bight of Biafra]], part of the [[Gulf of Guinea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Although Cameroon is not an [[Economic Community of West African States|ECOWAS]] member state, it is geographically and historically in West Africa with the [[Southern Cameroons]] which now form her [[Northwest Region (Cameroon)|Northwest]] and [[Southwest Region (Cameroon)|Southwest]] Regions having a strong West African history. The country is sometimes identified as West African and other times as Central African due to its strategic position at the crossroads between West and Central Africa. Cameroon is home to over 250 native languages spoken by nearly 20 million people.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/CM|title=Cameroon|website=Ethnologue|language=en|access-date=1 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official languages of the country are [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]].

Early inhabitants of the territory included the [[Sao civilisation]] around [[Lake Chad]] and the [[Baka people (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka]] hunter-gatherers in the southeastern rainforest. [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese explorers]] reached the coast in the 15th century and named the area ''Rio dos Camarões'' (''Shrimp River''), which became ''Cameroon'' in English. [[Fula people|Fulani]] soldiers founded the [[Adamawa Emirate]] in the north in the 19th century, and various ethnic groups of the west and northwest established powerful chiefdoms and [[Fon (title)|fondoms]]. Cameroon became a [[German Empire|German colony]] in 1884 known as [[German Cameroon|Kamerun]].

After [[World War I]], the territory was divided between [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[British Empire|United Kingdom]] as [[League of Nations mandate]]s. The [[Union of the Peoples of Cameroon|Union des Populations du Cameroun]] (UPC) political party advocated independence, but was outlawed by France in the 1950s, leading to the [[Bamileke War]] fought between French and UPC militant forces until early 1971. In 1960, the French-administered part of Cameroon became independent as the Republic of Cameroun under President [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]]. The [[Southern Cameroons|southern part]] of [[British Cameroons]] federated with it in 1961 to form the [[Federal republic|Federal Republic]] of Cameroon. The federation was abandoned in 1972. The country was renamed the [[Unitary state|United Republic]] of Cameroon in 1972 and the Republic of Cameroon in 1984. Large numbers of Cameroonians live as [[subsistence farmers]]. [[Paul Biya]], the incumbent President, has led the country since 1982; he had previously held office as prime minister, from 1975 until his elevation to the presidency. The country has experienced tensions coming from the English-speaking territories. Politicians in the English-speaking regions have advocated for greater decentralisation and even complete separation or independence (as in the [[Southern Cameroons National Council]]) from Cameroon. In 2017, tensions in the English-speaking territories escalated into [[Anglophone Crisis|open warfare]].

The [[official language]]s of Cameroon are French and English. The languages of former colonial [[French Cameroons]] and [[British Cameroons]] and its [[Religion in Cameroon|religious population]] consists of 70% [[Religion in Cameroon|Christians]] and 20% [[Islam in Cameroon|Muslims]]. It is governed as a [[Unitary state|Unitary]] [[Presidential system|presidential republic]] and has [[Foreign relations of Cameroon|good relations]] with the major powers of [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Cameroon–China relations|China]].

The country is often referred to as &quot;Africa in miniature&quot; for its geological and cultural diversity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.today/20120525195312/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/globalextremes.html Highest Average Annual Precipitation Extremes].

The highest point at almost {{convert|4100|m|ft}} is [[Mount Cameroon]] in the [[Southwest Region (Cameroon)|Southwest Region]] of the country, and the largest cities in population-terms are [[Douala]] on the [[Wouri River]], its economic capital and main seaport, [[Yaoundé]], its political capital, and [[Garoua]]. The country is well known for its native styles of music, particularly [[Makossa]] and [[Bikutsi]], and for its successful [[Cameroon national football team|national football team]]. Cameroon is a member state of the [[African Union]], the [[United Nations]], [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]].

== History ==

{{Main|History of Cameroon}}

The territory of present-day Cameroon was first settled during the [[Neolithic]] Era. The longest continuous inhabitants are groups such as the [[Baka people (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka]] ([[Pygmy peoples|Pygmies]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 2.&lt;/ref&gt; From here, [[Bantu expansion|Bantu migrations]] into eastern, southern, and central Africa are believed to have originated about 2,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; The [[Sao civilisation|Sao]] culture arose around [[Lake Chad]], c. 500 AD, and gave way to the Kanem and its successor state, the [[Kanem–Bornu Empire|Bornu Empire]]. Kingdoms, [[Fon (title)|fondoms]], and [[chiefdom]]s arose in the west.&lt;ref name=Njung/&gt;

[[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese sailors]] reached the coast in 1472. They noted an abundance of the ghost shrimp ''[[Lepidophthalmus turneranus]]'' in the [[Wouri River]] and named it {{lang|pt|Rio dos Camarões}} (''Shrimp River''), which became ''Cameroon'' in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pondi | first1 = J.

In the early 19th century, [[Modibo Adama]] led [[Fula people|Fulani]] soldiers on a [[jihad]] in the north against non-Muslim and partially Muslim peoples and established the [[Adamawa Emirate]]. Settled peoples who fled the Fulani caused a major redistribution of population.

The Bamum tribe have a writing system, known as [[Bamum script]] or Shu Mom. The script was given to them by Sultan [[Ibrahim Njoya]] in 1896,&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NMAA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africa.si.edu/exhibits/inscribing/bamum.html|title=Bamum|publisher=National Museum of African Art, Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=29 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101155844/http://africa.si.edu/exhibits/inscribing/bamum.html|archive-date=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is taught in Cameroon by the [[Bamum Scripts and Archives Project]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NMAA&quot;/&gt; Germany began to establish roots in Cameroon in 1868 when the Woermann Company of Hamburg built a warehouse. It was built on the estuary of the Wouri River. Later Gustav Nachtigal made a treaty with one of the local kings to annex the region for the German emperor.&lt;ref name=historyworld&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historyworld.net|title=historyworld|access-date=17 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190407073336/http://historyworld.net/|archive-date=7 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[German Empire]] claimed the territory as the colony of [[Kamerun]] in 1884 and began a steady push inland. The Germans ran into resistance with the native people who did not want the Germans to establish themselves on this land. Under the influence of Germany, commercial companies were left to regulate local administrations. These concessions used [[forced labour]] of the Africans to make a profit. The labour was used on banana, rubber, palm oil, and cocoa plantations.&lt;ref name=historyworld/&gt; They initiated projects to improve the colony's infrastructure, relying on a harsh system of forced labour, which was much criticised by the other colonial powers.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeLancey 125&quot;&gt;[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1900s ===

With the defeat of Germany in [[World War I]], Kamerun became a [[League of Nations mandate]] territory and was split into [[French Cameroon]]s and [[British Cameroon]]s in 1919. France integrated the economy of Cameroon with that of France&lt;ref name=&quot;DeLancey 5&quot;&gt;[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and improved the infrastructure with capital investments and skilled workers, modifying the colonial system of forced labour.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeLancey 125&quot;/&gt;

The British administered their territory from neighbouring [[Nigeria]]. Natives complained that this made them a neglected &quot;colony of a colony&quot;. Nigerian migrant workers flocked to Southern Cameroons, ending forced labour altogether but angering the local natives, who felt swamped.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The League of Nations mandates were converted into [[United Nations Trusteeship Council|United Nations Trusteeships]] in 1946, and the question of independence became a pressing issue in French Cameroun.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeLancey 5&quot;/&gt;

France outlawed the pro-independence political party, the [[Union of the Peoples of Cameroon|Union des Populations du Cameroun]] (UPC), on 13 July 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Terretta | first1 = M. | title = Cameroonian Nationalists Go Global: From Forest Maquis to a Pan-African Accra | doi = 10.1017/S0021853710000253 | journal = The Journal of African History | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 189–212 | year = 2010 | pmid   =| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Armed response by the colonialists prompted a long guerrilla war  (known also as the [[Bamileke War]]) and the assassination of several of the party's leaders, including [[Ruben Um Nyobè]], [[Félix-Roland Moumié]] and [[Ernest Ouandie]].

==== Independence (1960) ====

[[File:Ahmadou Ahidjo.jpg|thumb|Former president [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]] ruled from 1960 until 1982.]]

On 1 January 1960, French Cameroun gained independence from France under President [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]]. On 1 October 1961, the formerly British [[Southern Cameroons]] gained independence voted by vote of the UN General Assembly and joined with French Cameroun to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon, a date which is now observed as [[Unification Day (Cameroon)|Unification Day]], a [[Public holidays in Cameroon|public holiday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Diane Cook|title=Cameroon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jn7TBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT95|date=2 September 2014|publisher=Mason Crest|isbn=978-1-4222-9434-5|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahidjo used the ongoing war with the UPC to concentrate power in the presidency, continuing with this even after the suppression of the UPC in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeLancey 6&quot;&gt;[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

His political party, the [[Cameroon People's Democratic Movement#Cameroonian National Union|Cameroon National Union]] (CNU), became the sole legal political party on 1 September 1966 and on 20 May 1972, a referendum was passed to abolish the [[Federation|federal system of government]] in favour of a United Republic of Cameroon, headed from [[Yaoundé]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 19.&lt;/ref&gt; This day is now the country's [[National Day (Cameroon)|National Day]], a public holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.prc.cm/en/multimedia/photo-albums/37-20-may-national-day |title=20 May National Day |website=Presidency of the Republic of Cameroon |access-date=3 May 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahidjo pursued an economic policy of [[planned liberalism]], prioritising [[cash crops]] and petroleum development. The government used oil money to create a national cash reserve, pay farmers, and finance major development projects; however, many initiatives failed when Ahidjo appointed unqualified allies to direct them.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paul Biya 2014.png|thumb|left|[[Paul Biya]] has ruled the country since 1982]]

Ahidjo stepped down on 4 November 1982 and left power to his constitutional successor, [[Paul Biya]]. However, Ahidjo remained in control of the CNU and tried to run the country from behind the scenes until Biya and his allies pressured him into resigning.

An [[Economic crisis of Cameroon|economic crisis]] took effect in the mid-1980s to late 1990s as a result of international economic conditions, drought, falling [[petroleum]] prices, and years of corruption, mismanagement, and [[cronyism]]. Cameroon turned to foreign aid, cut government spending, and [[Privatization|privatised]] industries. With the reintroduction of multi-party politics in December 1990, the former British Southern Cameroons pressure groups called for greater autonomy, and the [[Southern Cameroons National Council]] advocated complete secession as the Republic of [[Ambazonia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DeLancey 9&quot;&gt;[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1992 Labour Code of Cameroon gives workers the freedom to belong to a trade union or not to belong to any trade union at all.

In June 2006, talks concerning a territorial dispute over the [[Bakassi]] peninsula were resolved. The talks involved President Paul Biya of Cameroon, then President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] of Nigeria and then UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]], and resulted in Cameroonian control of the oil-rich peninsula. The northern portion of the territory was formally handed over to the Cameroonian government in August 2006, and the remainder of the peninsula was left to Cameroon 2 years later, in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200606130612.html Cameroon: Presidents Obasanjo And Biya Shake Hands on Disputed Bakassi Peninsula] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217063651/http://allafrica.com/stories/200606130612.html |date=17 February 2017 }}, ''Allafrica'', 13 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary change triggered a [[Bakassi conflict|local separatist insurgency]], as many Bakassians refused to accept Cameroonian rule.

The [[National Assembly (Cameroon)|National Assembly]] makes legislation. The body consists of 180 members who are elected for five-year terms and meet three times per year.&lt;ref name=msu/&gt; Laws are passed on a majority vote.

=== Political culture ===

Cameroon is viewed as rife with corruption at all levels of government. In 1997, Cameroon established anti-corruption bureaus in 29 ministries, but only 25% became operational,&lt;ref name=&quot;IRIN&quot;/&gt; and in 2012, [[Transparency International]] placed Cameroon at number 144 on a list of 176 countries ranked from least to most corrupt.&lt;ref name=Corruption/&gt; On 18 January 2006, Biya initiated an anti-corruption drive under the direction of the [[National Anti-Corruption Observatory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IRIN&quot;/&gt; There are several high corruption risk areas in Cameroon, for instance, customs, public health sector and public procurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Corruption in Cameroon|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/cameroon/business-corruption-in-cameroon.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=24 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324190641/http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/cameroon/business-corruption-in-cameroon.aspx|archive-date=24 March 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the corruption has gotten worse, regardless of the existing anti-corruption bureaus, as Transparency International ranked Cameroon 152 on a list of 180 countries in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.transparency.org/cpi2018 Corruption Perceptions Index 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Statue d'un chef coutumier à Bana.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A statue of a chief in [[Bana, Cameroon|Bana]], West Region.]]

President Biya's [[Cameroon People's Democratic Movement]] (CPDM) was the only legal political party until December 1990. Numerous regional political groups have since formed. The primary opposition is the [[Social Democratic Front (Cameroon)|Social Democratic Front]] (SDF), based largely in the Anglophone region of the country and headed by [[John Fru Ndi]].&lt;ref name = &quot;lergai&quot;&gt;[[#West|West]] 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biya and his party have maintained control of the presidency and the National Assembly in national elections, which rivals contend were unfair.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeLancey 9&quot;/&gt; Human rights organisations allege that the government suppresses the freedoms of opposition groups by preventing demonstrations, disrupting meetings, and arresting opposition leaders and journalists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amnesty&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Freedom House&quot;/&gt; In particular, English-speaking people are discriminated against; protests often escalate into violent clashes and killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/15/world/cameroon-protesters-deaths/ |title=Rights groups call for probe into protesters' deaths in Cameroon |author=Radina Gigova |date=15 December 2016 |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=17 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318083433/http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/15/world/cameroon-protesters-deaths/ |archive-date=18 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, President Biya shut down the Internet in the English-speaking region for 94 days, at the cost of hampering five million people, including [[Silicon Mountain]] startups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/03/africa/internet-shutdown-cameroon/ |title=Cameroon goes offline after Anglophone revolt |author=Kieron Monks |date=3 February 2017 |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=17 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318003526/http://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/03/africa/internet-shutdown-cameroon/ |archive-date=18 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 Cameroon petitioned the [[International Court of Justice]] to resolve the dispute. The two countries attempted to establish a cease-fire in 1996, however, fighting continued for years. In 2002, the ICJ ruled that the [[Anglo-German Agreement of 1913]] gave sovereignty to Cameroon. The ruling called for a withdrawal by both countries and denied the request by Cameroon for compensation due to Nigeria's long-term occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/11/world/court-rules-for-cameroon-in-oil-dispute-with-nigeria.html|title=Court Rules for Cameroon In Oil Dispute With Nigeria|last=Banerjee|first=Marc Lacey With Neela|date=11 October 2002|work=The New York Times|access-date=4 February 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205130042/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/11/world/court-rules-for-cameroon-in-oil-dispute-with-nigeria.html|archive-date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004, Nigeria had failed to meet the deadline to handover the peninsula.

=== Administrative divisions ===

{{Main|Regions of Cameroon|Departments of Cameroon}}

[[File:Provinces of Cameroon EN.svg|thumb|upright|Cameroon is divided into 10 regions.]]

The [[Constitution of Cameroon|constitution]] divides Cameroon into 10 semi-autonomous regions, each under the administration of an elected [[Regional Council (Cameroon)|Regional Council]]. Each region is headed by a presidentially appointed governor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neba 250&quot;/&gt;

These leaders are charged with implementing the will of the president, reporting on the general mood and conditions of the regions, administering the civil service, keeping the peace, and overseeing the heads of the smaller administrative units. Governors have broad powers: they may order propaganda in their area and call in the army, [[Gendarmerie|gendarmes]], and police.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neba 250&quot;/&gt; All local government officials are employees of the central government's Ministry of Territorial Administration, from which local governments also get most of their budgets.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/26431.htm|title=Cameroon|publisher=US Department of State|date=25 August 2011|accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regions are subdivided into 58 divisions (French {{lang|fr|départements}}). These are headed by presidentially appointed divisional officers ({{lang|fr|[[Prefect|préfets]]}}). The divisions are further split into sub-divisions ({{lang|fr|arrondissements}}), headed by assistant divisional officers ({{lang|fr|sous-prefets}}). The districts, administered by district heads ({{lang|fr|chefs de district}}), are the smallest administrative units.&lt;ref name=unhchr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/0/33bb745d595710e3c125693d0035f74b?Opendocument|accessdate=12 April 2013|title=Core document forming part of the reports of States Parties: Cameroon|publisher=UNHCHR|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023091521/http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/0/33bb745d595710e3c125693d0035f74b?Opendocument|archive-date=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three northernmost regions are the [[Far North Region (Cameroon)|Far North]] ({{lang|fr|Extrême Nord}}), [[North Region (Cameroon)|North]] ({{lang|fr|Nord}}), and [[Adamawa Region|Adamawa]] ({{lang|fr|Adamaoua}}). Directly south of them are the [[Centre Region (Cameroon)|Centre]] ({{lang|fr|Centre}}) and [[East Region (Cameroon)|East]] ({{lang|fr|Est}}). The [[South Region (Cameroon)|South Province]] ({{lang|fr|Sud}}) lies on the Gulf of Guinea and the southern border. Cameroon's western region is split into four smaller regions: the [[Littoral Region (Cameroon)|Littoral]] ({{lang|fr|Littoral}}) and [[Southwest Region (Cameroon)|Southwest]] ({{lang|fr|Sud-Ouest}}) regions are on the coast, and the [[Northwest Region (Cameroon)|Northwest]] ({{lang|fr|Nord-Ouest}}) and [[West Region (Cameroon)|West]] ({{lang|fr|Ouest}}) regions are in the western grassfields.&lt;ref name=unhchr/&gt;

Cameroon has one of the highest school attendance rates in Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mbaku 15&quot; /&gt; Girls attend school less regularly than boys do because of cultural attitudes, domestic duties, early marriage, pregnancy, and sexual harassment.

Cameroon's natural resources are very well suited to agriculture and arboriculture. An estimated 70% of the population farms, and agriculture comprised an estimated 19.8% of GDP in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt; Most agriculture is done at the subsistence scale by local farmers using simple tools. They sell their surplus produce, and some maintain separate fields for commercial use. Urban centres are particularly reliant on peasant agriculture for their foodstuffs. Soils and climate on the coast encourage extensive commercial cultivation of bananas, cocoa, oil palms, rubber, and tea. Inland on the South Cameroon Plateau, cash crops include coffee, sugar, and tobacco. Coffee is a major cash crop in the western highlands, and in the north, natural conditions favour crops such as cotton, groundnuts, and rice. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Cameroon vulnerable to shifts in their prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt;

The southern rainforest has vast timber reserves, estimated to cover 37% of Cameroon's total land area.&lt;ref name=awf/&gt; However, large areas of the forest are difficult to reach. Logging, largely handled by foreign-owned firms,&lt;ref name=awf/&gt; provides the government US$60&amp;nbsp;million a year in taxes ({{as of|1998|lc=yes}}), and laws mandate the safe and sustainable exploitation of timber.

Except for the several relatively good [[toll road]]s which connect major cities (all of them one-lane) roads are poorly maintained and subject to inclement weather, since only 10% of the roadways are tarred.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt; Roadblocks often serve little other purpose than to allow police and gendarmes to collect bribes from travellers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hudgens|Hudgens and Trillo]] 1036.&lt;/ref&gt; Road banditry has long hampered transport along the eastern and western borders, and since 2005, the problem has intensified in the east as the [[Central African Republic]] has further destabilised.&lt;ref name=&quot;Musa Gunmen&quot;/&gt;

[[Intercity bus service]]s run by multiple private companies connect all major cities. They are the most popular means of transportation followed by the rail service ''[[Camrail]]''. Rail service runs from [[Kumba]] in the west to [[Bélabo]] in the east and north to [[Ngaoundéré]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtravelguide.net/cameroon/getting-around|accessdate=12 April 2013|publisher=World Travel Guide|title=Getting around Cameroon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627051533/http://www.worldtravelguide.net/cameroon/getting-around|archive-date=27 June 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; International airports are located in [[Douala International Airport|Douala]] and [[Yaoundé Nsimalen International Airport|Yaoundé]], with a third under construction in [[Maroua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cameroononline.org/2013/04/03/equipments-for-the-future-maroua-international-airport/ |accessdate=12 April 2013 |title=Equipment for the Future Maroua International Airport |publisher=Cameroon Online |date=3 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509073605/http://www.cameroononline.org/2013/04/03/equipments-for-the-future-maroua-international-airport/ |archivedate=9 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Douala is the country's principal seaport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soschildrensvillages.ca/where-we-help/africa/cameroon/douala/pages/default.aspx|accessdate=12 April 2013|title=SOS Children's Village Douala|publisher=SOS Children's Villages|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130615075059/http://www.soschildrensvillages.ca/where-we-help/africa/cameroon/douala/pages/default.aspx|archive-date=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the north, the Bénoué River is seasonally navigable from Garoua across into Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The population total in Cameroon was {{UN_Population|Cameroon}} in {{UN_Population|Year}}.{{UN_Population|ref}} The life expectancy is 56&amp;nbsp;years (55.9&amp;nbsp;years for males and 58.6&amp;nbsp;years for females).&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cm.html|title=Cameroon|publisher=CIA|work=World Factbook|accessdate=2 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030061543/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cm.html|archive-date=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the latest census, Cameroon still has slightly more women (50.6%) than men (49.4%). Nearly 60% of the population is under age 25. People over 65 years of age account for only 3.2% of the total population.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot; /&gt;

Cameroon's population is almost evenly divided between urban and rural dwellers.&lt;ref name=&quot;West 3&quot;&gt;[[#West|West]] 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Population density is highest in the large urban centres, the western highlands, and the northeastern plain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Neba|Neba]] 109–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Douala, Yaoundé, and [[Garoua]] are the largest cities. In contrast, the Adamawa Plateau, southeastern Bénoué depression, and most of the South Cameroon Plateau are sparsely populated.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Neba|Neba]] 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[World Health Organization]], the [[fertility rate]] was 4.8 in 2013 with a population growth rate of 2.56%.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

People from the overpopulated western highlands and the underdeveloped north are moving to the coastal plantation zone and urban centres for employment.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Neba|Neba]] 105–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller movements are occurring as workers seek employment in lumber mills and plantations in the south and east.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Neba|Neba]] 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the national sex ratio is relatively even, these out-migrants are primarily males, which leads to unbalanced ratios in some regions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Neba|Neba]] 103–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[monogamy|monogamous]] and [[polygamy|polygamous]] marriage are practised, and the average Cameroonian family is large and extended.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 139.&lt;/ref&gt; In the north, women tend to the home, and men herd cattle or work as farmers. In the south, women grow the family's food, and men provide meat and grow cash crops.

The northern peoples are Sudanese groups, who live in the central highlands and the northern lowlands, and the Fulani, who are spread throughout northern Cameroon. A small number of [[Baggara|Shuwa]] Arabs live near Lake Chad. Southern Cameroon is inhabited by speakers of [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] and [[Semi-Bantu]] languages. Bantu-speaking groups inhabit the coastal and equatorial zones, while speakers of Semi-Bantu languages live in the Western grassfields. Some 5,000 Gyele and Baka [[Pygmy peoples]] roam the southeastern and coastal rainforests or live in small, roadside settlements.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Neba|Neba]] 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Nigerians make up the largest group of foreign nationals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Neba|Neba]] 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both English and French are official languages, although French is by far the most understood language (more than 80%).&lt;ref&gt;Nathan, Fernand (ed.) (2010) [http://www.francophonie.org/IMG/pdf/langue_francaise_monde_integral.pdf ''La langue francaise dans le monde en 2010''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603081542/http://www.francophonie.org/IMG/pdf/langue_francaise_monde_integral.pdf |date=3 June 2012 }}, {{ISBN|2098824076}}.&lt;/ref&gt; German, the language of the original colonisers, has long since been displaced by French and English. [[Cameroonian Pidgin English]] is the lingua franca in the formerly British-administered territories.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Neba|Neba]] 94.&lt;/ref&gt; A mixture of English, French, and Pidgin called [[Camfranglais]] has been gaining popularity in urban centres since the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Niba/&gt; The government encourages bilingualism in English and French, and as such, official government documents, new legislation, ballots, among others, are written and provided in both languages. As part of the initiative to encourage bilingualism in Cameroon, six of the eight universities in the country are entirely bilingual.

In addition to the colonial languages, there are approximately 250 other languages spoken by nearly 20 million Cameroonians.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;Kouega, Jean-Paul. 'The Language Situation in Cameroon', Current Issues in Language Planning, vol. 8/no. 1, (2007), pp. 3–94.&lt;/ref&gt; It is because of this that Cameroon is considered one of the most linguistically diverse countries in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.languagesoftheworld.info/geolinguistics/linguistic-diversity-in-africa-and-europe.html|title=Linguistic diversity in Africa and Europe - Languages Of The World|last=|first=|date=16 June 2011|website=languagesoftheworld.info|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915122923/http://www.languagesoftheworld.info/geolinguistics/linguistic-diversity-in-africa-and-europe.html|archive-date=15 September 2017|access-date=4 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norwegian Missionary Society first established a mission in Cameroon in the early 1920s. Many of its churches still stand. At the time there were few Christians but now there are many. In cooperation with the local Evangelical Lutheran Church of Cameroon EELC and the American ELCA the NMS built several hospitals among these the Protestant Hospital of Ngaoundéré, high schools and several other institutions. Ngaoundéré once held one of the largest Norwegian contingencies of any place in the world, with over 100 Norwegians living there in the 1980s. Some of the families have been there in several generations among these Kaldhol, Bjaanes, Stavenjord and Dankel. The neighbourhood was even dubbed &quot;Norvège&quot; (&quot;Norway&quot; in French).

[[File:Baka dancers June 2006.jpg|thumb|Dancers greet visitors to the East Region.]]

[[Music of Cameroon|Music]] and [[dance in Cameroon|dance]] are an integral part of Cameroonian ceremonies, festivals, social gatherings, and storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;West 18&quot;/&gt; Traditional dances are highly choreographed and separate men and women or forbid participation by one sex altogether.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 204.&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of dances range from pure entertainment to religious devotion.&lt;ref name=&quot;West 18&quot;&gt;[[#West|West]] 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, music is transmitted orally. In a typical performance, a chorus of singers echoes a soloist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mbaku 189&quot;&gt;[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Musical accompaniment may be as simple as clapping hands and stomping feet,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 191.&lt;/ref&gt; but traditional instruments include bells worn by dancers, clappers, drums and [[talking drum]]s, flutes, horns, rattles, scrapers, stringed instruments, whistles, and xylophones; the exact combination varies with ethnic group and region. Some performers sing complete songs by themselves, accompanied by a harplike instrument.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mbaku 189&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#West|West]] 18–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular music styles include [[ambasse bey]] of the coast, [[assiko]] of the Bassa, [[mangambeu]] of the [[Bamileke|Bangangte]], and [[tsamassi]] of the Bamileke.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 184.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Music of Nigeria|Nigerian music]] has influenced Anglophone Cameroonian performers, and [[Prince Nico Mbarga]]'s [[highlife]] hit &quot;[[Sweet Mother]]&quot; is the top-selling African record in history.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two most popular styles of music are [[makossa]] and [[bikutsi]]. Makossa developed in Douala and mixes folk music, highlife, [[soul music|soul]], and [[soukous|Congo music]]. Performers such as [[Manu Dibango]], [[Francis Bebey]], [[Moni Bilé]], and [[Petit-Pays]] popularised the style worldwide in the 1970s and 1980s. Bikutsi originated as war music among the Ewondo. Artists such as [[Anne-Marie Nzié]] developed it into a popular dance music beginning in the 1940s, and performers such as [[Mama Ohandja]] and [[Les Têtes Brulées]] popularised it internationally during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Nkolo/&gt;

[[Cuisine of Cameroon|Cuisine]] varies by region, but a large, one-course, evening meal is common throughout the country. A typical dish is based on cocoyams, [[maize]], [[cassava]] (manioc), [[millet]], [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], [[potato]]es, [[rice]], or [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], often pounded into dough-like [[fufu]]. This is served with a sauce, soup, or stew made from greens, [[Peanut|groundnut]]s, [[palm oil]], or other ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;[[#West|West]] 84–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Meat and fish are popular but expensive additions, with chicken often reserved for special occasions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mbaku 121-2&quot;&gt;[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 121–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Dishes are often quite hot, spiced with salt, red pepper sauce, and [[Maggi]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hudgens|Hudgens and Trillo]] 1047&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#West|West]] 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cutlery is common, but food is traditionally manipulated with the right hand. Breakfast consists of leftovers of bread and fruit with [[coffee]] or [[tea]]. Generally breakfast is made from wheat flour in various different foods such as puff-puff (doughnuts), accra banana made from [[banana]]s and flour, bean cakes and many more. Snacks are popular, especially in larger towns where they may be bought from [[street vendor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hudgens|Hudgens and Trillo]] 1049.&lt;/ref&gt;

Water, [[palm wine]], and [[millet beer]] are the traditional mealtime drinks, although beer, soda, and wine have gained popularity. 33 Export beer is the official drink of the [[Cameroon national football team|national soccer team]] and one of the most popular brands, joining Castel, [[Amstel Brewery]], and [[Guinness Foreign Extra Stout|Guinness]].

=== Local arts and crafts ===

Traditional arts and crafts are practiced throughout the country for commercial, decorative, and religious purposes. Woodcarvings and sculptures are especially common.&lt;ref&gt;[[#West|West]] 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The high-quality clay of the western highlands is suitable for pottery and ceramics.&lt;ref name=&quot;West 18&quot;/&gt; Other crafts include [[basket weaving]], beadworking, brass and bronze working, calabash carving and painting, embroidery, and leather working. Traditional housing styles make use of locally available materials and vary from temporary wood-and-leaf shelters of nomadic [[Wodaabe|Mbororo]] to the rectangular mud-and-thatch homes of southern peoples. Dwellings made from materials such as cement and tin are increasingly common.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 110–3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Contemporary art]] is mainly promoted by independent cultural organizations ([[Doual'art]], [[Africréa]]) and [[artist-run initiative]]s ([[Art Wash]], [[Atelier Viking]], [[ArtBakery]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postzambia.com/post-read_article.php?articleId=8690|accessdate=12 April 2013|work=The Post|author=Mulenga, Andrew|date=30 April 2010|title=Cameroon's indomitable contemporary art|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311124956/http://www.postzambia.com/post-read_article.php?articleId=8690|archivedate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literature ===

{{Main|Literature of Cameroon}}

Cameroonian literature has concentrated on both European and African themes. Colonial-era writers such as [[Louis-Marie Pouka]] and [[Sankie Maimo]] were educated by European missionary societies and advocated [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] into European culture as the means to bring Cameroon into the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 80–1&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]], writers such as [[Mongo Beti]] and [[Ferdinand Oyono]] analysed and criticised colonialism and rejected assimilation.&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 77, 83–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Volet/&gt;

=== Films and literature ===

{{Further|Cinema of Cameroon}}

Shortly after independence, filmmakers such as [[Jean-Paul Ngassa]] and [[Thérèse Sita-Bella]] explored similar themes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 119–20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#West|West]] 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, [[Mongo Beti]], [[Ferdinand Léopold Oyono]] and other writers explored post-colonialism, problems of African development, and the recovery of African identity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 85–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in the mid-1970s, filmmakers such as [[Jean-Pierre Dikongué Pipa]] and [[Daniel Kamwa]] dealt with the conflicts between traditional and post-colonial society. Literature and films during the next two decades concentrated more on wholly Cameroonian themes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sports ===

{{main|Sport in Cameroon}}

[[File:Cameroon vs Germany 2003.jpg|thumb|[[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] faces [[Germany national football team|Germany]] at [[Zentralstadion]] in Leipzig, 17 November 2004.]]

National policy strongly advocates sport in all forms. Traditional sports include canoe racing and wrestling, and several hundred runners participate in the {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Mount Cameroon Race of Hope]] each year.&lt;ref&gt;[[#West|West]] 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Cameroon is one of the few tropical countries to have [[Cameroon at the 2002 Winter Olympics|competed]] in the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]].

Sport in Cameroon is dominated by football. Amateur football clubs abound, organised along ethnic lines or under corporate sponsors. The [[Cameroon national football team|national team]] has been one of the most successful in Africa since its strong showing in the [[1982 Football World Cup|1982]] and [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]s. Cameroon has won five [[African Cup of Nations]] titles and the gold medal at the [[Football at the 2000 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2000 Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#West|West]] 92–3, 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cameroon was the host country of the [[Africa Women Cup of Nations|Women Africa Cup of Nations]] in November–December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/20/africa-women-cup-of-nations-cameroon-opening-ceremony-football|title=Africa Women Cup of Nations kicks off in Cameroon|date=20 November 2016|publisher=|access-date=|newspaper=The Guardian|last1=Shearlaw|first1=Maeve|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123163325/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/20/africa-women-cup-of-nations-cameroon-opening-ceremony-football|archive-date=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cameroon women's national football team|women's football team]] is known as the &quot;Indomitable Lionesses.&quot;

The [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] reports that Cameroon Government forces are responsible for killings, the excessive use of force, burning down of houses, arbitrary detentions and torture. UN figures indicate that more than 21,000 people have fled to neighboring countries, while 160,000 have been internally displaced by the violence, many reportedly hiding in forests.
On 25 July 2018, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights [[Zeid Raad Al Hussein|Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein]] expressed deep concern about reports of violations and abuses in the English-speaking Northwest and Southwest regions of Cameroon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=23404&amp;LangID=E |title=OHCHR – UN Human Rights Chief deeply alarmed by reports of serious rights breaches in Cameroon |publisher=Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights |access-date=2 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180803014220/https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=23404&amp;LangID=E |archive-date=3 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
