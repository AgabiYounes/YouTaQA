The '''Military of Chile''' ({{lang-es|Fuerzas Armadas de Chile}}) is the unified military organization comprising the Chilean Army, Air Force and Navy. The President of Chile is the commander in chief of the military, and formulates policy through the Minister of Defence. In recent years and after several major reequipment programs, the Chilean Armed Forces have become one of the most technologically advanced and professional armed forces in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BAWDEN&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Bawden | first = John R | authorlink = | title = 'The Pinochet Generation: The Chilean Military in the Twentieth Century' | publisher = University of Alabama | date = 2016 | location = | pages = 218–219 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-8173-1928-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chilean Army is mostly supplied with equipment from [[Germany]], the [[United States]], [[Israel]], [[France]], and [[Spain]].
