'''Capricornus''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|æ|p|r|ᵻ|ˈ|k|ɔːr|n|ə|s}} is one of the [[constellation]]s of the [[zodiac]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for &quot;horned [[goat]]&quot; or &quot;goat [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]]&quot; or &quot;having horns like a goat's&quot;, and it is commonly represented in the form of a [[sea goat]]: a mythical creature that is half goat, half [[fish]]. Its symbol is [[Image:Capricorn symbol 2.png|20px]] (Unicode ♑).

Capricornus is one of the [[88 modern constellations]], and was also one of the 48&amp;nbsp;constellations listed by the 2nd&amp;nbsp;century astronomer Claudius [[Ptolemy]]. Under its modern boundaries it is bordered by [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]], [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], [[Microscopium]], [[Piscis Austrinus]], and [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]]. The constellation is located in an area of sky called the [[Sea (astronomy)|Sea]] or the Water, consisting of many water-related constellations such as Aquarius, [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] and [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]]. It is the smallest constellation in the zodiac.

===Stars===
{{see also|List of stars in Capricornus}}
Capricornus is a faint constellation, with only one star above magnitude&amp;nbsp;3; its [[Bayer designation|alpha star]] has a magnitude of only 3.6&amp;nbsp;.

The brightest star in Capricornus is [[Delta Capricorni|δ&amp;nbsp;Capricorni]], also called Deneb Algedi, with a magnitude of 2.9, located 39&amp;nbsp;light-years from Earth. Like several other stars such as [[Denebola]] and [[Deneb]], it is named for the Arabic word for &quot;tail&quot; (''deneb''); its traditional name means &quot;the tail of the goat&quot;. Deneb Algedi is a [[Beta Lyrae variable]] star (a type of [[eclipsing binary]]). It ranges by about 0.2&amp;nbsp;magnitudes with a period of 24.5&amp;nbsp;hours.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102–103}}

The other bright stars in Capricornus range in magnitude from 3.1 to 5.1&amp;nbsp;. [[Alpha Capricorni|α&amp;nbsp;Capricorni]] is a multiple star. The primary (α&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Cap), 109&amp;nbsp;light-years from Earth, is a yellow-hued giant star of magnitude&amp;nbsp;3.6; the secondary (α&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Cap), 690&amp;nbsp;light-years from Earth, is a yellow-hued supergiant star of magnitude&amp;nbsp;4.3&amp;nbsp;. The two stars are distinguishable by the naked eye, and both are themselves multiple stars. α&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Capricorni is accompanied by a star of magnitude&amp;nbsp;9.2; α&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Capricornus is accompanied by a star of magnitude 11.0; this faint star is itself a binary star with two components of magnitude&amp;nbsp;11. Also called Algedi or Giedi, the traditional names of α&amp;nbsp;Capricorni come from the Arabic word for &quot;the kid&quot;, which references the constellation's mythology.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102–103}}

[[Beta Capricorni|β Capricorni]] is a [[double star]] also known as Dabih. It is a yellow-hued giant star of magnitude&amp;nbsp;3.1, 340&amp;nbsp;light-years from Earth. The secondary is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 6.1&amp;nbsp;. The two stars are distinguishable in binoculars. [[Beta Capricorni|β&amp;nbsp;Capricorni]]'s traditional name comes from the Arabic phrase for &quot;the lucky stars of the slaughterer,&quot; a reference to ritual sacrifices performed by ancient Arabs at the [[heliacal rising]] of Capricornus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mark R., III |last=Chartrand |year=1983 |title=Skyguide: A Field Guide for Amateur Astronomers |page=126 |ISBN=0-307-13667-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another star visible to the naked eye is [[Gamma Capricorni|γ&amp;nbsp;Capricorni]], sometimes called Nashira (&quot;bringing good tidings&quot;); it is a white-hued giant star of magnitude&amp;nbsp;3.7, 139&amp;nbsp;light-years from Earth. [[Pi Capricorni|π Capricorni]] is a double star with a blue-white hued primary of magnitude&amp;nbsp;5.1 and a white-hued secondary of magnitude&amp;nbsp;8.3&amp;nbsp;. It is 670&amp;nbsp;light-years from Earth and the components are distinguishable in a small telescope.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102–103}}

===Deep-sky objects===
Several galaxies and star clusters are contained within Capricornus. [[Messier 30]] is a globular cluster located 1&amp;nbsp;degree south of the galaxy group [[NGC 7103]]. The constellation also harbors the wide spiral galaxy [[NGC 6907]].

[[Messier 30|M30]] (NGC 7099) is a centrally-condensed globular cluster of magnitude 7.5&amp;nbsp;. At a distance of 30,000&amp;nbsp;light-years, it has chains of stars extending to the north that are resolvable in small amateur telescopes.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102–103}}

One [[galaxy group]] located in Capricornus is [[HCG 87]], a group of at least three galaxies located 400&amp;nbsp;million [[light-years]] from Earth ([[redshift]] 0.0296). It contains a large [[elliptical galaxy]], a face-on [[spiral galaxy]], and an edge-on spiral galaxy. The face-on spiral galaxy is experiencing abnormally high rates of [[star formation]], indicating that it is [[interacting galaxy|interacting]] with one or both members of the group. Furthermore, the large elliptical galaxy and the edge-on spiral galaxy, both of which have [[active galactic nucleus|active nuclei]], are connected by a stream of stars and dust, indicating that they too are interacting. Astronomers predict that the three galaxies may [[galaxy merger|merge]] millions of years in the future to form a giant elliptical galaxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilkins|Dunn|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==
The constellation was first attested in depictions on a cylinder-seal from around the 21st&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BCE,&lt;ref name=Espak2006&gt;{{cite thesis |type=Masters |title=Master's Thesis |first=Peeter |last=Espak |year=2006 |page=104 |url=http://dspace.utlib.ee/dspace/bitstream/10062/958/5/espakpeeter.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was explicitly recorded in the [[Babylonian star catalogues]] before 1000&amp;nbsp;BCE. In the [[Early Bronze Age]] the [[winter solstice]] occurred in the constellation, but due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]], the December solstice now takes place in the constellation [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]].&lt;ref name=Rogers1998&gt;{{cite journal |first=John H. |last=Rogers |title=Origins of the ancient constellations: I.&amp;nbsp;The Mesopotamian traditions |journal=Journal of the British Astronomical Association |volume=108 |year=1998 |pages=9–28 |bibcode=1998JBAA..108....9R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sun is now in the constellation Capricorn (as distinct from the astrological sign) from late January through mid-February.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102–103}}

Although the solstice during the northern hemisphere's winter no longer takes place while the sun is in the ''constellation'' Capricornus, as it did until 130&amp;nbsp;BCE, the [[Capricorn (astrology)|''astrological sign'' called Capricorn]] is still used to denote the position of the solstice, and the latitude of the sun's most southerly position continues to be called the ''[[Tropic of Capricorn]]'', a term which also applies to the line on the Earth at which the sun is directly overhead at local noon on the day of the December solstice.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102–103}}

The planet [[Neptune]] was discovered by German astronomer [[Johann Gottfried Galle|Johann Galle]], near Deneb Algedi (δ&amp;nbsp;Capricorni) on 23&amp;nbsp;September 1846, as Capricornus can be seen best from Europe at 4:00{{sc|am}} in September (although, by modern constellation boundaries established in the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;CE, Neptune lay within the confines of Aquarius at the time of its discovery).

==Mythology==
Despite its faintness, the constellation Capricornus has one of the oldest mythological associations, having been consistently represented as a [[mythological hybrid|hybrid]] of a goat and a fish since the [[Middle Bronze Age]], when the [[Babylonian star catalogues|Babylonians]] used {{lang|sux-Latn|&lt;sup&gt;MUL&lt;/sup&gt;SUḪUR.MAŠ}} &quot;The Goat-Fish&quot; as a symbol of their god [[Ea (god)|Ea]].&lt;ref name=Rogers1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Espak2006/&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], the constellation is sometimes identified as [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]], the goat that suckled the infant [[Zeus]] after his mother, [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], saved him from being devoured by his father, [[Cronus|Cronos]]. Amalthea's broken horn was transformed into the [[cornucopia]] or &quot;horn of plenty&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reference and Allusion&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Delahunty |first1=Andrew |last2=Dignen |first2=Sheila |title=Oxford Dictionary of Reference and Allusion |date=2012 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-956746-1 |page=91 |edition=3rd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hX6rCuCLI2MC&amp;pg=PA91 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some ancient Greek myths, it started with the sea-goat Pricus. He was the father of the race of sea-goats (half goats half fish), who were intelligent and honourable creatures. They lived in the sea near the shore. They could speak and think according to Greek legend. They were favoured by the gods.
Pricus is tied to [[Chronos]], the god of time in Greek myths. Chronos created the immortal Pricus, who shares Chronos's ability to manipulate time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gods-and-monsters.com/capricorn-mythology.html |website=Gods and Monsters |title=Capricorn |department=mythology}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He had lots of children who lived near the seashore, but when they found themselves on the dry land they turned into normal goats, losing their special ability to think and speak in the process. In an effort to prevent this, Pricus turns back time, again and again; however, he eventually resigns himself to loneliness and misery, letting the little Sea Goats leave him. Learning he cannot control their fate and not wanting to be the only Sea Goat prompts him to ask Chronos to let him die. Because he is [[Immortality|immortal]] instead, he must spend eternity in the sky as Capricorn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://starsignstyle.com/capricorn-the-goat/ |website=starsignstyle.com |title=Capricorn the goat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capricornus is also sometimes identified as [[Pan (god)|Pan]], the god with a goat's horns and legs, who saved himself from the monster [[Typhon]] by giving himself a fish's tail and diving into a river.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102–103}}

==Visualizations==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Capricornus.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Capricornus as a sea-goat from ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'' (1825).]]
Capricornus's brighter stars are found on a triangle whose vertices are [[Alpha Capricorni|α&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Capricorni]] (Giedi), [[Delta Capricorni|δ Capricorni]] (Deneb Algiedi), and [[Omega Capricorni|ω Capricorni]]. Ptolemy's method of connecting the stars of Capricornus has been influential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jebrown.us/SolarAlmanac/private/Articles/Constellations/Capricornus.html#Ptolemy |title=Capricornus |publisher=Jebrown.us |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capricornus is usually drawn as a goat with the tail of a fish.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102–103}}

[[Image:Capricornus constellation map visualization.PNG|thumb|300px|right|Diagram of H.A. Rey's alternative way to connect the stars of the Capricornus constellation.]]
[[H. A. Rey]] has suggested an alternative visualization, which graphically shows a [[goat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rey|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goat's head is formed by the triangle of stars [[Iota Capricorni|ι Cap]], [[Theta Capricorni|θ Cap]], and [[Zeta Capricorni|ζ Cap]]. The goat's horn sticks out with stars [[Gamma Capricorni|γ Cap]] and [[Delta Capricorni|δ Cap]]. Star δ Cap, at the tip of the horn, is of the third magnitude. The goat's tail consists of stars [[Beta Capricorni|β Cap]] and [[Alpha Capricorni|α&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Cap]]: star β Cap being of the third magnitude. The goat's hind foot consists of stars [[Psi Capricorni|ψ Cap]] and [[Omega Capricorni|ω Cap]]. Both of these stars are of the fourth magnitude.
