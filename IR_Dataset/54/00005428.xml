The [[Khmer Empire]] was established by the early 9th century. Sources refer here to a mythical initiation and [[consecration]] ceremony to claim political legitimacy by founder [[Jayavarman II]] at [[Phnom Kulen|Mount Kulen]] (Mount Mahendra) in 802 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wolters |first=O.

A new dynasty of provincial origin introduced [[Buddhism]], which according to some scholars resulted in royal religious discontinuities and general decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://studiesofasia.wikispaces.com/file/view/EDAS8003A+Assignment+1+Khmer+civilisation+at+Angkor.pdf |title= The emergence and ultimate decline of the Khmer Empire - Many scholars attribute the halt of the development of Angkor to the rise of Theravada...p.14 |date= | publisher= Studies Of Asia |accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of kings of Cambodia|royal chronology]] ends in the 14th century.

The decline continued through a transitional period of approximately 100 years followed by the Middle Period of Cambodian history, also called the [[Dark ages of Cambodia]], beginning in the mid 15th century. Although the Hindu cults had by then been all but replaced, the [[Angkor Wat|monument sites]] at the old capital remained an important spiritual centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/1971/JSS_059_2h_Chandler_EighteenthCenturyInscriptionFromAngkorWat.pdf |title= AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY INSCRIPTION FROM ANGKOR WAT by David P.

Yet since the mid 15th century the core population steadily moved to the east and – with brief exceptions – settled at the confluence of the [[Mekong]] and Tonle Sap rivers at [[Phnom Penh|Chaktomuk]], [[Longvek]] and [[Oudong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/cambodia/history-kingdom.htm |title= Kingdom of Cambodia – 1431–1863 |date= | publisher= GlobalSecurity |accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Google Books&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ross Marlay|author2=Clark D.

[[Indian Ocean trade|Maritime trade]] was the basis for a very prosperous 16th century. But, as a result foreigners – [[Muslim]] [[Malay people|Malays]] and Cham, Christian [[Age of Discovery|European adventurers]] and [[Mission (Christianity)|missionaries]] – increasingly disturbed and influenced government affairs. Ambiguous fortunes, a robust economy on the one hand and a disturbed culture and compromised royalty on the other were constant features of the Longvek era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/870 |title= Murder and Mayhem in Seventeenth Century Cambodia |publisher= Institute of Historical Research (IHR) |date= |accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themua.org/collections/files/original/dbfc18c3e3c6e83a95c2df47dcd683b8.pdf |title= Maritime Trade in Southeast Asia during the Early Colonial Period ...transferring the lucrative China trade to Cambodia... |publisher= Oxford Centre for Maritime Archaeology University of Oxford |date= |accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 15th century, the [[Khmer people|Khmers']] traditional neighbours, the [[Mon people]] in the west and the [[Cham people]] in the east had gradually been pushed aside or replaced by the resilient [[Thai people|Siamese/Thai]] and [[Vietnamese people|Annamese/Vietnamese]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben Kiernan|title=Blood and Soil: Modern Genocide 1500-2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5p7cRyK748C|year=2008|publisher=Melbourne Univ.

A weak Khmer kingdom only encouraged the strategists in [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] (later in [[Bangkok]]) and in [[Huế]]. Attacks on and conquests of Khmer royal residences left sovereigns without a ceremonial and legitimate power base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ayutthaya-history.com/Ayutthayan_Wars_1551.html |title= 1551 – WAR WITH LOVEK – During the Burmese siege of Ayutthaya in 1549 the King of Cambodia, Ang Chan... | publisher= History of Ayutthaya |date= |accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas Tarling|title=The Cambridge History of Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jtsMLNmMzbkC&amp;pg=PA100|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-66370-0|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interference in succession and marriage policies added to the decay of royal prestige.

The 19th-century arrival of then technologically more advanced and ambitious [[Colonialism|European colonial]] powers with concrete policies of global control put an end to regional feuds and as [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam/Thailand]], although humiliated and on the retreat, escaped colonisation as a buffer state, [[Vietnam]] was to be the focal point of [[French colonial empire|French colonial]] ambition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/The-great-Lao-buffer-zone-30124168.html |title=The great Lao buffer zone |last=Smithies |first=Michael |work=[[The Nation]] |date=8 March 2010 |accessdate=3 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402155047/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/The-great-Lao-buffer-zone-30124168.html |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Radiocarbon dating]] of a cave at [[Laang Spean]] in [[Battambang Province]], northwest [[Cambodia]] confirmed the presence of [[Hoabinhian]] stone tools from 6000–7000 BCE and pottery from 4200 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joachim Schliesinger|title=Ethnic Groups of Cambodia Vol 1: Introduction and Overview|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8TkjBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1|year=2015|publisher=Booksmango|isbn=978-1-63323-232-7|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandlerp13&quot;&gt;David Chandler, ''A History of Cambodia'' (Westview Publishers: Boulder Colorado, 2008) p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2009 archaeological research of the ''Franco-Cambodian Prehistoric Mission'' has documented a complete cultural sequence from 71.000 years BP to the [[Neolithic]] period in the cave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Hoabinhian from Laang Spean Cave in its stratigraphic, chronological, typo-technological and environmental context (Cambodia, Battambang province) |doi=10.1016/j.jasrep.2015.06.008 |volume=3 |journal=Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports |pages=194–206|year= 2015 |last1= Forestier |first1= Hubert |last2= Sophady |first2= Heng |last3= Puaud |first3= Simon |last4= Celiberti |first4= Vincenzo |last5= Frère |first5= Stéphane |last6= Zeitoun |first6= Valéry |last7= Mourer-Chauviré |first7= Cécile |last8= Mourer |first8= Roland |last9= Than |first9= Heng |last10= Billault |first10= Laurence }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finds since 2012 lead to the common interpretation, that the cave contains the archaeological remains of a first occupation by hunter and gatherer groups, followed by [[Neolithic]] people with highly developed hunting strategies and stone tool making techniques, as well as highly artistic pottery making and design, and with elaborate social, cultural, symbolic and exequial practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002291/229174e.pdf |title= Human origin sites and the World Heritage Convention in Asia – The case of Phnom Teak Treang and Laang Spean cave, Cambodia: The potential for World Heritage site nomination; the significance of the site for human evolution in Asia, and the need for international cooperation | publisher= World Heritage |date= |accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skulls and human bones found at Samrong Sen in [[Kampong Chhnang Province]] date from 1500 BCE. Heng Sophady (2007) has drawn comparisons between Samrong Sen and the circular earthwork sites of eastern Cambodia. These people may have migrated from South-eastern China to the Indochinese Peninsula.

The [[Iron Age]] period of [[Southeast Asia]] begins around 500 BCE and lasts until the end of the Funan era - around 500 A.D. as it provides the first concrete evidence for sustained maritime trade and socio-political interaction with India and South Asia. By the 1st century settlers have developed complex, organised societies and a varied religious cosmology, that required advanced spoken languages very much related to those of the present day. The most advanced groups lived along the coast and in the lower Mekong River valley and the delta regions in houses on stilts where they cultivated rice, fished and kept domesticated animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stark2006&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anthropology.hawaii.edu/people/faculty/stark/pdfs/2003_AngkorBorei.pdf |title=Art and Archaeology of Fu-Nan |publisher=Department of Anthropology College of Social Sciences University of Hawaii |accessdate=7 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923172505/http://www.anthropology.hawaii.edu/people/faculty/stark/pdfs/2003_AngkorBorei.pdf |archive-date=23 September 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/BIPPA/article/view/9966/0 |title= Trade and Exchange Networks in Iron Age Cambodia: Preliminary Results from a Compositional Analysis of Glass Beads - Beads made of glass and stone found at Iron Age period sites (500 BCE – 500 CE) in Southeast Asia are amongst the first signs for sustained trade and sociopolitical contact with South Asia... | publisher= Indo-Pacific Prehistory Association |date= |accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the second century CE Funan controlled the strategic coastline of [[Indochina]] and the maritime trade routes. Cultural and religious ideas reached Funan via the [[Indian Ocean trade]] route. Trade with [[India]] had commenced well before 500 BCE as [[Sanskrit]] hadn't yet replaced [[Pali]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stark1999&quot;/&gt; Funan's language has been determined as to have been an early form of Khmer and its written form was [[Sanskrit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rooneyarchive.net/books/khmer_ceramics/khmer_ceramics.pdf |title= Khmer Ceramics by Dawn Rooney – The language of Funan was... | publisher= Oxford University Press 1984 |date= |accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funan is associated with myths, such as the [[Óc Eo|Kattigara]] legend and the Khmer founding legend in which an Indian [[Brahman]] or prince named Preah Thaong in Khmer, Kaundinya in Sanskrit and Hun-t’ien in Chinese records marries the local ruler, a princess named Nagi Soma (Lieu-Ye in Chinese records), thus establishing the first [[List of monarchs of Cambodia|Cambodian royal dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anthropology.hawaii.edu/people/faculty/Stark/pdfs/YoffeePages313332.pdf |title=9 Textualized Places, Pre-Angkorian Khmers and Historicized Archaeology by Miriam T.

Chinese annals report that Funan reached its territorial climax in the early 3rd century under the rule of king Fan Shih-man, extending as far south as [[Malaysia]] and as far west as [[Myanmar|Burma]]. A system of [[mercantilism]] in commercial monopolies was established. Exports ranged from forest products to precious metals and commodities such as gold, elephants, ivory, rhinoceros horn, kingfisher feathers, wild spices like cardamom, lacquer, hides and aromatic wood. Under Fan Shih-man Funan maintained a formidable fleet and was administered by an advanced bureaucracy, based on a &quot;tribute-based economy, that produced a surplus which was used to support foreign traders along its coasts and ostensibly to launch expansionist missions to the west and south&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stark2006&quot; /&gt;

The question of how Funan came to an end is in the face of almost universal scholarly conflict impossible to pin down. [[Chenla]] is the name of Funan's successor in Chinese annals, first appearing in 616/617 CE

{{quotation|...the fall of Funan was not the result of the shifting of maritime trade route from the Malay Peninsula route to the Strait of Malacca starting from the 5th century CE; rather, it suggests that the conquest of Funan by Zhenla was the exact reason for the shifting of maritime trade route in the 7th century CE....&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factsanddetails.com/asian/cat62/sub406/entry-2814.html |title= ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA: FUNAN, SRIVIJAYA AND THE MON | publisher= Facts and Details |date= |accessdate=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;As Funan was indeed in decline caused by shifts in Southeast Asian maritime trade routes, rulers had to seek new sources of wealth inland.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= |title= &quot;What and Where was Chenla?&quot; George Coedes | publisher= Michael Vickery |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;By the end of the fifth century, international trade through southeast Asia was almost entirely directed through the Strait of Malacca. Funan, from the point of view of this trade, had outlived its usefulness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learner.org/courses/worldhistory/support/reading_10_1.pdf |title=Southeast Asian Riverine and Island Empires by Candice Goucher, Charles LeGuin, and Linda Walton - By the end of the fifth century, international trade through |publisher=The Annenberg Foundation |date= |accessdate=13 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109081448/http://www.learner.org/courses/worldhistory/support/reading_10_1.pdf |archive-date=9 January 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Nothing in the epigraphical record authorizes such interpretations; and the inscriptions which retrospectively bridge the so- called Funan-Chenla transition do not indicate a political break at all.&quot;

The History of the Chinese [[Sui dynasty]] contains records that a state called [[Chenla]] sent an embassy to China in 616 or 617 CE It says, that Chenla was a vassal of [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]], but under its ruler Citrasena-Mahendravarman conquered Funan and gained independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-reading.club/bookreader.php/142071/Encyclopedia_of_ancient_Asian_civilizations.pdf |title= Encyclopedia of Ancient Asian Civilizations by Charles F.

Most of the Chinese recordings on Chenla, including that of Chenla conquering Funan, have been contested since the 1970s as they are generally based on single remarks in the Chinese annals, as author Claude Jacques emphasised the very vague character of the Chinese terms 'Funan' and 'Chenla', while more domestic epigraphic sources become available. Claude Jacques summarises: &quot;Very basic historical mistakes have been made&quot; because &quot;the history of pre-Angkorean Cambodia was reconstructed much more on the basis of Chinese records than on that of [Cambodian] inscriptions&quot; and as new inscriptions were discovered, researchers &quot;preferred to adjust the newly discovered facts to the initial outline rather than to call the Chinese reports into question&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://michaelvickery.org/vickery1994what.pdf |title= &quot;What and Where was Chenla?&quot; - In the 1970s Claude Jacques began cautiously to move away from the established historiographical framework | publisher= Michael Vickery |date= |accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of Chenla's centre being in modern Laos has also been contested. &quot;All that is required is that it be inland from Funan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://michaelvickery.org/vickery1994what.pdf |title= &quot;What and Where was Chenla?&quot; - there is really no need to look for Chenla beyond the borders of what is present-day Cambodia.

Another inscription of a few years later, K44, 674 CE, commemorating a foundation in Kampot province under the patronage of Jayavarman I, refers to an earlier foundation in the time of King Raudravarma, presumably Rudravarman of Funan, and again there is no suggestion of political discontinuity.

The [[New Book of Tang|History of the T'ang]] asserts that shortly after 706 the country was split into Land Chenla and Water Chenla.

By the late 8th century Water Chenla had become a vassal of the Sailendra dynasty of Java – the last of its kings were killed and the polity incorporated into the Javanese monarchy around 790 CE.

Ancient Chinese records mention two kings, Shrutavarman and Shreshthavarman who ruled at the capital Shreshthapura located in modern-day southern Laos. The immense influence on the identity of Cambodia to come was wrought by the Khmer Kingdom of [[Sambor Prei Kuk|Bhavapura]], in the modern day Cambodian city of [[Kampong Thom (city)|Kampong Thom]]. Its legacy was its most important sovereign, [[Isanavarman I|Ishanavarman]] who completely conquered the kingdom of Funan during 612–628. He chose his new capital at the [[Sambor Prei Kuk]], naming it Ishanapura.&lt;ref name=Coedes&gt;{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|authorlink= George Coedès|editor= Walter F.

[[Indravarman I]] (877–889) and his son and successor [[Yasovarman I]] (889–900), who established the capital [[Yasodharapura]] ordered the construction of huge water reservoirs (barays) north of the capital. The water management network depended on elaborate configurations of channels, ponds, and embankments built from huge quantities of clayey sand, the available bulk material on the Angkor plain.

Royal administration was based on the religious idea of the Shivaite Hindu state and the central cult of the sovereign as warlord and protector – the &quot;Varman&quot;. This centralised system of governance appointed royal functionaries to provinces. The [[Jayavarman VI|Mahidharapura dynasty]] – its first king was [[Jayavarman VI]] (1080 to 1107), which originated west of the [[Dângrêk Mountains]] in the [[Mun river]] valley discontinued the old &quot;ritual policy&quot;, genealogical traditions and crucially, [[Hinduism]] as exclusive state religion.

The area that comprises the various capitals was spread out over around {{convert|1000|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, it is nowadays commonly called [[Angkor]]. The combination of sophisticated wet-rice agriculture, based on an engineered irrigation system and the [[Tonlé Sap]]'s spectacular abundance in fish and aquatic fauna, as protein source guaranteed a regular food surplus. Recent Geo-surveys have confirmed that Angkor maintained the largest pre-industrial settlement complex worldwide during the 12th and 13th centuries – some three quarters of a million people lived there. Sizeable contingents of the public workforce were to be redirected to monument building and [[infrastructure]] maintenance.

Under king [[Suryavarman II]] (1113–1150) the empire reached its greatest geographic extent as it directly or indirectly controlled [[Indochina]], the [[Gulf of Thailand]] and large areas of northern [[maritime Southeast Asia]]. Suryavarman II commissioned the temple of [[Angkor Wat]], built in a period of 37 years, its five towers representing [[Mount Meru]] is considered to be the most accomplished expression of classical [[Khmer architecture]]. However, territorial expansion ended when Suryavarman II was killed in battle attempting to invade [[Đại Việt]]. It was followed by a period of dynastic upheaval and a [[Cham people|Cham]] invasion that culminated in the sack of Angkor in 1177.

King Jayavarman VII (reigned 1181–1219) is generally considered to be Cambodia's greatest King. A [[Mahayana Buddhism|Mahayana Buddhist]], he initiates his reign by striking back against [[Champa]] in a successful campaign. During his nearly forty years in power he becomes the most prolific monument builder, who establishes the city of [[Angkor Thom]] with its central temple the [[Bayon]]. Further outstanding works are attributed to him – [[Banteay Kdei]], [[Ta Prohm]], [[Neak Pean]] and Sra Srang. The construction of an impressive number of utilitarian and secular projects and edifices, such as maintenance of the extensive road network of [[Suryavarman I]], in particular the royal road to [[Phimai]] and the many rest houses, bridges and hospitals make Jayavarman VII unique among all imperial rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/plape/citiesaut11/readings/Hendrickson--angkor%20roads-Antiquity.pdf |title= Historie routes to Angkor: development of the Khmer road system (ninth to thirteenth centuries CE) in mainland Southeast Asia by Mitch Hendrickson | publisher= University of Sydney |date= |accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1296, the Chinese diplomat [[Zhou Daguan]] arrived at Angkor and remained at the court of king [[Srindravarman]] until July 1297. He wrote a detailed report, ''[[The Customs of Cambodia]]'', on life in Angkor. His portrayal is one of the most important sources of understanding historical Angkor as the text offers valuable information on the everyday life and the habits of the inhabitants of Angkor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thegreatkhmerempire.blogspot.com/2011/12/zhou-daguan-record-of-cambodia-siam.html |title= Zhou Daguan-A Record of Cambodia-Siam Society Review by Milton Osborne | publisher= The Great Khmer Empire |date= |accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The empire was an agrarian state that consisted essentially of three social classes, the elite, workers and slaves. The elite included advisers, military leaders, courtiers, priests, religious ascetics and officials. Workers included agricultural labourers and also a variety of craftsman for construction projects. Slaves were often captives from military campaigns or distant villages. Coinage did not exist and the barter economy was based on agricultural produce, principally rice, with regional trade as an insignificant part of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://studiesofasia.wikispaces.com/file/view/EDAS8003A+Assignment+1+Khmer+civilisation+at+Angkor.pdf |title= The emergence and ultimate decline of the Khmer Empire was paralleled with development and subsequent change in religious ideology, together with infrastructure that supported agriculture by Kay McCullough | publisher= National Academy of Science |date= |accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Southeast Asia in the 9th to 14th Centuries | author=David G.

In August 1863 King [[Norodom of Cambodia|Norodom]] signed an agreement with the French placing the kingdom under the protection of France. The original treaty left Cambodian sovereignty intact, but French control gradually increased, with important landmarks in 1877, 1884, and 1897, until by the end of the century the king's authority no longer existed outside the palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cambodiatribunal.org/history/cambodian-history/ |title= Colonial Era – Cambodia Enters the Wider World: 1863 – 1953 Cambodian History Searching for the Truth, July 2009 By David Chandler | publisher= NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND DOCUMENTATION CENTER OF CAMBODIA |date= |accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norodom died in 1904, and his two successors, Sisowath and Monivong, were content to allow the French to control the country, but in 1940 France was defeated in a brief border war with Thailand and forced to surrender the provinces of Battambang and Angkor (the ancient site of Angkor itself was retained). King Monivong died in April 1941 and the French placed the obscure Prince Sihanouk on the throne as king, believing that the inexperienced 18-year old would be more pliable than Monivong's middle-aged son, Prince Monireth. 

Cambodia's situation at the end of the war was chaotic. The [[Free French]], under General [[Charles de Gaulle]], were determined to recover Indochina, though they offered Cambodia and the other Indochinese protectorates a carefully circumscribed measure of self-government. Convinced that they had a &quot;[[civilizing mission]]&quot;, they envisioned Indochina's participation in a French Union of former colonies that shared the common experience of French culture.

==Administration of Sihanouk (1953–70)==
{{Main article|Japanese occupation of Cambodia|Kingdom of Cambodia (1953–70)}}
On 9 March 1945, during the [[Japanese occupation of Cambodia]], young king [[Norodom Sihanouk]] proclaimed an independent Kingdom of Kampuchea, following a formal request by the Japanese. Shortly thereafter the Japanese government nominally ratified the independence of Cambodia and established a consulate in Phnom Penh.&lt;ref&gt;Keat Gin Ooi ''Southeast Asia: a historical encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; The new government did away with the [[romanisation]] of the [[Khmer language]] that the French colonial administration was beginning to enforce and officially reinstated the [[Khmer script]]. This measure taken by the short-lived governmental authority would be popular and long-lasting, for since then no government in Cambodia has tried to romanise the Khmer language again.&lt;ref&gt;David P. Chandler, ''A History of Cambodia'', Silkworm 1993&lt;/ref&gt;
After Allied military units entered Cambodia, the Japanese military forces present in the country were disarmed and repatriated. The French were able to reimpose the colonial administration in Phnom Penh in October the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.country-data.com/frd/cs/cambodia/kh_appnb.html Cambodia, Appendix B – Major Political and Military Organizations]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hartini Sukarno with Norodom Sihanouk and wife, Bung Karno Penjambung Lidah Rakjat 253.jpg|thumb|left|Norodom Sihanouk and his wife in Indonesia 1964.]]
Sihanouk's &quot;royal crusade for independence&quot; resulted in grudging French acquiescence to his demands for a transfer of sovereignty. A partial agreement was struck in October 1953. Sihanouk then declared that independence had been achieved and returned in triumph to [[Phnom Penh]]. As a result of the Geneva Conference on Indochina, Cambodia was able to bring about the withdrawal of the [[Viet Minh]] troops from its territory and to withstand any residual impingement upon its sovereignty by external powers.

Neutrality was the central element of Cambodian foreign policy during the 1950s and 1960s. By the mid-1960s, parts of Cambodia's eastern provinces were serving as bases for North Vietnamese Army and [[Viet Cong|National Liberation Front]] (NVA/NLF) forces operating against South Vietnam, and the port of [[Sihanoukville (city)|Sihanoukville]] was being used to supply them. As NVA/VC activity grew, the United States and [[South Vietnam]] became concerned, and in 1969, the United States began a 14-month-long series of bombing raids targeted at NVA/VC elements, contributing to destabilisation. The bombing campaign took place no further than ten, and later twenty miles (32&amp;nbsp;km) inside the Cambodian border, areas where the Cambodian population had been evicted by the NVA.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Phillip B. ''Vietnam at War: The History 1946–1975''. 1988. P. 593&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Cite supports entire paragraph--&gt; Prince Sihanouk, fearing that the conflict between communist North Vietnam and South Vietnam might spill over to Cambodia, publicly opposed the idea of a bombing campaign by the United States along the Vietnam–Cambodia border and inside Cambodian territory. However [[Peter Rodman]] claimed, &quot;Prince Sihanouk complained bitterly to us about these North Vietnamese bases in his country and invited us to attack them&quot;. In December 1967 ''Washington Post'' journalist Stanley Karnow was told by Sihanouk that if the US wanted to bomb the Vietnamese communist sanctuaries, he would not object, unless Cambodians were killed.&lt;ref&gt;''The Washington Post'', 29 December 1967&lt;/ref&gt; The same message was conveyed to US President Johnson's emissary Chester Bowles in January 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Morris ''Why Vietnam Invaded Cambodia'' (Stanford University Press. 1999). p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; So the US had no real motivation to overthrow Sihanouk. However Prince Sihanouk wanted Cambodia to stay out of the North Vietnam–South Vietnam conflict and was very critical of the United States government and its allies (the South Vietnamese government). Prince Sihanouk, facing internal struggles of his own, due to the rise of the Khmer Rouge, did not want Cambodia to be involved in the conflict. Sihanouk wanted the United States and its allies (South Vietnam) to keep the war away from the Cambodian border. Sihanouk did not allow the United States to use Cambodian air space and airports for military purposes. This upset the United States greatly and contributed to their view that of Prince Sihanouk as a North Vietnamese sympathiser and a thorn on the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{worldhistory|quote=P. 1012|section=4084}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, declassified documents indicate that, as late as March 1970, the Nixon administration was hoping to garner &quot;friendly relations&quot; with Sihanouk.

Throughout the 1960s, domestic Cambodian politics became polarised. Opposition to the government grew within the middle class and leftists including Paris-educated leaders like [[Son Sen]], [[Ieng Sary]], and Saloth Sar (later known as [[Pol Pot]]), who led an [[insurgency]] under the clandestine Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK). Sihanouk called these insurgents the [[Khmer Rouge]], literally the &quot;Red Khmer&quot;. But the 1966 national assembly elections showed a significant swing to the right, and General [[Lon Nol]] formed a new government, which lasted until 1967. During 1968 and 1969, the insurgency worsened. However members of the government and army, who resented Sihanouk's ruling style as well as his tilt away from the United States, did have a motivation to overthrow him.

However, as early as 12 March 1970, the CIA Station Chief told Washington that based on communications from Sirik Matak, Lon Nol's cousin, that &quot;the (Cambodian) army was ready for a coup&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Short, ''Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare'' (Henry Holt &amp; Co.: New York, 2004) p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Lon Nol assumed power after the military coup and immediately allied Cambodia with the United States. Son Ngoc Thanh, an opponent of Pol Pot, announced his support for the new government. On 9 October, the Cambodian monarchy was abolished, and the country was renamed the Khmer Republic. The new regime immediately demanded that the Vietnamese communists leave Cambodia.

Hanoi rejected the new republic's request for the withdrawal of NVA troops. In response, the United States moved to provide material assistance to the new government's armed forces, which were engaged against both CPK insurgents and NVA forces. The North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces, desperate to retain their sanctuaries and supply lines from North Vietnam, immediately launched armed attacks on the new government. The North Vietnamese quickly overran large parts of eastern Cambodia, reaching to within {{convert|15|mi|km}} of [[Phnom Penh]]. The North Vietnamese turned the newly won territories over to the [[Khmer Rouge]]. The king urged his followers to help in overthrowing this government, hastening the onset of [[Cambodian Civil War|civil war]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SIHNK&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last = Sihanouk | first = Norodom | authorlink = Norodom Sihanouk | title = My War with the CIA: The Memoirs of Prince Norodom Sihanouk as Related to Wilfred Burchett | publisher = Pantheon Books | year = 1973 | isbn = 978-0394485430 | url = https://archive.org/details/mywarwithcia00noro }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1970, US President Richard Nixon announced to the American public that US and South Vietnamese ground forces had entered Cambodia in a campaign aimed at destroying NVA base areas in Cambodia (see [[Cambodian Incursion]]).&lt;ref&gt;Philip Short, ''Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare'' (Henry Holt &amp; Co.: New York, 2004) p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; The US had already been bombing Vietnamese positions in Cambodia for well over a year by that point. Although a considerable quantity of equipment was seized or destroyed by US and South Vietnamese forces, containment of North Vietnamese forces proved elusive.

The Khmer Republic's leadership was plagued by disunity among its three principal figures: Lon Nol, Sihanouk's cousin [[Sirik Matak]], and National Assembly leader [[In Tam]]. Lon Nol remained in power in part because none of the others were prepared to take his place. In 1972, a constitution was adopted, a parliament elected, and Lon Nol became president. But disunity, the problems of transforming a 30,000-man army into a national combat force of more than 200,000 men, and spreading corruption weakened the civilian administration and army.

The Khmer Rouge insurgency inside Cambodia continued to grow, aided by supplies and military support from North Vietnam. Pol Pot and [[Ieng Sary]] asserted their dominance over the Vietnamese-trained communists, many of whom were purged. At the same time, the Khmer Rouge (CPK) forces became stronger and more independent of their Vietnamese patrons. By 1973, the CPK were fighting battles against government forces with little or no North Vietnamese troop support, and they controlled nearly 60% of Cambodia's territory and 25% of its population.

The government made three unsuccessful attempts to enter into negotiations with the insurgents, but by 1974, the CPK was operating openly as divisions, and some of the NVA combat forces had moved into South Vietnam. Lon Nol's control was reduced to small enclaves around the cities and main transportation routes. More than two million refugees from the war lived in Phnom Penh and other cities.

On New Year's Day 1975, Communist troops launched an offensive which, in 117 days of the hardest fighting of the war, caused the collapse of the Khmer Republic. Simultaneous attacks around the perimeter of Phnom Penh pinned down Republican forces, while other CPK units overran fire bases controlling the vital lower Mekong resupply route. A US-funded airlift of ammunition and rice ended when Congress refused additional aid for Cambodia. The Lon Nol government in Phnom Penh surrendered on 17 April 1975, just five days after the US mission evacuated Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Short, ''Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare'' p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after its victory, the CPK ordered the evacuation of all cities and towns, sending the entire urban population into the countryside to work as farmers, as the CPK was trying to reshape society into a model that Pol Pot had conceived.

The new government sought to completely restructure Cambodian society. Remnants of the old society were abolished and religion was suppressed. Agriculture was collectivised, and the surviving part of the industrial base was abandoned or placed under state control. Cambodia had neither a currency nor a banking system.

Democratic Kampuchea's relations with Vietnam and Thailand worsened rapidly as a result of border clashes and ideological differences. While communist, the CPK was fiercely nationalistic, and most of its members who had lived in Vietnam were purged. Democratic Kampuchea established close ties with the People's Republic of China, and the Cambodian-Vietnamese conflict became part of the Sino-Soviet rivalry, with Moscow backing Vietnam. Border clashes worsened when the Democratic Kampuchea military attacked villages in Vietnam. The regime broke off relations with Hanoi in December 1977, protesting Vietnam's alleged attempt to create an Indochina Federation. In mid-1978, Vietnamese forces invaded Cambodia, advancing about {{convert|30|mi|km}} before the arrival of the rainy season.

The reasons for Chinese support of the CPK was to prevent a pan-Indochina movement, and maintain Chinese military superiority in the region. The Soviet Union supported a strong Vietnam to maintain a second front against China in case of hostilities and to prevent further Chinese expansion. Since Stalin's death, relations between Mao-controlled China and the Soviet Union had been lukewarm at best. In February to March 1979, China and Vietnam would fight the brief [[Sino-Vietnamese War]] over the issue.

In December 1978, Vietnam announced the formation of the [[Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation]] (KUFNS) under [[Heng Samrin]], a former DK division commander. It was composed of Khmer Communists who had remained in Vietnam after 1975 and officials from the eastern sector—like Heng Samrin and Hun Sen—who had fled to Vietnam from Cambodia in 1978. In late December 1978, Vietnamese forces launched a full invasion of Cambodia, capturing Phnom Penh on 7 January 1979 and driving the remnants of Democratic Kampuchea's army westward toward Thailand.

Within the CPK, the Paris-educated leadership—[[Pol Pot]], [[Ieng Sary]], [[Nuon Chea]], and [[Son Sen]]—were in control. A new constitution in January 1976 established Democratic Kampuchea as a Communist People's Republic, and a 250-member Assembly of the Representatives of the People of Kampuchea (PRA) was selected in March to choose the collective leadership of a State Presidium, the chairman of which became the head of state.

Prince Sihanouk resigned as head of state on 4 April. On 14 April, after its first session, the PRA announced that [[Khieu Samphan]] would chair the State Presidium for a 5-year term. It also picked a 15-member cabinet headed by Pol Pot as prime minister. Prince Sihanouk was put under virtual house arrest.

===Destruction and deaths caused by the regime===

[[File:Phnom Penh, Killing Fields of Choeung Ek (6226142426).jpg|left|thumb|[[Choeung Ek]] Monument contains more than 5,000 human skulls.]]
20,000 people died of exhaustion or disease during the evacuation of [[Phnom Penh]] and its aftermath. Many of those forced to evacuate the cities were resettled in newly created villages, which lacked food, agricultural implements, and medical care. Many who lived in cities had lost the skills necessary for survival in an agrarian environment. Thousands starved before the first harvest. Hunger and malnutrition—bordering on starvation—were constant during those years. Most military and civilian leaders of the former regime who failed to disguise their pasts were executed.

Some of the ethnicities in Cambodia, such as the [[Cham people|Cham]] and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], suffered specific and targeted and violent persecutions, to the point of some international sources referring to it as the &quot;Cham genocide&quot;. Entire families and towns were targeted and attacked with the goal of significantly diminishing their numbers and eventually eliminated them. Life in 'Democratic Kampuchea' was strict and brutal. In many areas of the country people were rounded up and executed for speaking a foreign language, wearing glasses, scavenging for food, absent for government assigned work, and even crying for dead loved ones. Former businessmen and bureaucrats were hunted down and killed along with their entire families; the Khmer Rouge feared that they held beliefs that could lead them to oppose their regime. A few Khmer Rouge loyalists were even killed for failing to find enough 'counter-revolutionaries' to execute.

When Cambodian socialists began to rebel in the eastern zone of Cambodia, [[Pol Pot]] ordered his armies to exterminate 1.5 million eastern Cambodians which he branded as &quot;Cambodians with Vietnamese minds&quot; in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Genocide: Vol. 1-|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Q30HcvCVuIC&amp;pg=PA132|year=1999|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-87436-928-1|pages=132–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purge was done speedily and efficiently as Pol Pot's soldiers quickly killed at least more than 100,000 to 250,000 eastern Cambodians right after deporting them to execution site locations in Central, North and North-Western Zones within a month's time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2BTRtIv1_B8C&amp;pg=PT435 | title=Pol Pot: The History of a Nightmare | page=435 | author=Philip Short| isbn=9781444780307 | date=2013-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the most bloodiest episode of mass murder under Pol Pot's regime

Religious institutions were not spared by the Khmer Rouge as well, in fact [[religion]] was so viciously persecuted to such a terrifying extent that the vast majority of [[Khmer architecture|Cambodia's historic architecture]], 95% of Cambodia's Buddhist temples, was completely destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=la4kBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT23 | title=The Worst World Disasters of All Time | author=Kevin Baker | page=23| isbn=9781456623432 | date=2014-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His conclusion is that an average of 2.52 million people (range of 1.17-3.42 million) died as a result of regime actions between 1970 and 1979, with an average estimate of 1.4 million (range of 1.09-2.16 million) directly violent deaths.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being based on a house-to-house survey of Cambodians, the estimate of 3.3 million deaths promulgated by the Khmer Rouge's successor regime, the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] (PRK), is generally considered to be an exaggeration; among other methodological errors, the PRK authorities added the estimated number of victims that had been found in the partially-exhumed mass graves to the raw survey results, meaning that some victims would have been double-counted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tufts.edu&quot;/&gt;

On 10 January 1979, after the Vietnamese army and the [[KUFNS]] (Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation) invaded Cambodia and overthrowing the Khmer Rouge, the new [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] (PRK) was established with [[Heng Samrin]] as head of state. Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge forces retreated rapidly to the jungles near the Thai border. The Khmer Rouge and the PRK began a costly struggle that played into the hands of the larger powers China, the United States and the Soviet Union. The Khmer People’s Revolutionary Party’s rule gave rise to a guerrilla movement of three major resistance groups – the FUNCINPEC (Front Uni National pour un Cambodge Indépendant, Neutre, Pacifique, et Coopératif), the KPLNF (Khmer People’s National Liberation Front) and the PDK (Party of Democratic Kampuchea, the Khmer Rouge under the nominal presidency of Khieu Samphan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpil.de/files/pdf2/mpunyb_keller_9_127_178.pdf |title= Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia and the PRK's rule constituted a challenge on both the national and international political level.

Over 4 million Cambodians (about 90% of eligible voters) participated in the May 1993 elections. Pre-election violence and intimidation was widespread, caused by SOC (State of Cambodia – made up largely of former PDK cadre) security forces, mostly against the FUNCINPEC and BLDP parties according to UNTAC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/democracy/1993_hrp_report/93hrp_report_eap/Cambodia.html |title=CAMBODIA HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICES, 1993 |publisher=U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE |date=31 January 1994 |accessdate=26 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909120055/http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/democracy/1993_hrp_report/93hrp_report_eap/Cambodia.html |archive-date=9 September 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/asia/south-east-asia/cambodia/Cambodias%20Elections%20Turn%20Sour.pdf|title=CAMBODIA'S ELECTIONS TURN SOUR – Pre-election violence and intimidation|publisher=International Crisis Group|accessdate=26 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304193644/http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/asia/south-east-asia/cambodia/Cambodias%20Elections%20Turn%20Sour.pdf|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Khmer Rouge or [[Party of Democratic Kampuchea]] (PDK), whose forces were never actually disarmed or demobilized blocked local access to polling places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/khmer/ledgerwood/free_and_fair.htm |title= &quot;Massive irregularities&quot;: SOC charges of Voting Fraud | publisher= SEAsite |date= |accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norodom Ranariddh|Prince Ranariddh]]'s (son of Norodom Sihanouk) royalist [[Funcinpec]] Party was the top vote recipient with 45.5% of the vote, followed by Hun Sen's [[Cambodian People's Party]] and the [[Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party]], respectively. Funcinpec then entered into a coalition with the other parties that had participated in the election. A coalition government resulted between the Cambodian People’s Party and FUNCINPEC, with two co-prime ministers – [[Hun Sen]], since 1985 the prime minister in the Communist government, and [[Norodom Ranariddh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/cambodia/government.htm |title= Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] – The election resulted in a coalition government | publisher= GlobalSecurity |date= |accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parties represented in the 120-member assembly proceeded to draft and approve a new constitution, which was promulgated 24 September 1993. It established a multiparty liberal democracy in the framework of a constitutional monarchy, with the former Prince Sihanouk elevated to King. Prince Ranariddh and Hun Sen became First and Second Prime Ministers, respectively, in the Royal Cambodian Government (RGC). The constitution provides for a wide range of internationally recognised human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cambodia.ohchr.org/klc_pages/KLC_files/section_001/section_01_01_ENG.pdf |title=Constitution of Cambodia |publisher=OHCHR Cambodia |accessdate=26 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090810/http://cambodia.ohchr.org/klc_pages/KLC_files/section_001/section_01_01_ENG.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hun Sen and his government have seen much controversy. Hun Sen was a former Khmer Rouge commander who was originally installed by the Vietnamese and, after the Vietnamese left the country, maintains his [[Strongman (politics)|strong man]] position by violence and oppression when deemed necessary.&lt;ref name=HRWAdams&gt;{{cite web|author=Brad Adams |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/05/31/10000-days-hun-sen |title=Adams, Brad, ''10,000 Days of Hun Sen'', International Herald Tribune, reprinted by Human Rights Watch.org |publisher=Hrw.org |date=31 May 2012 |accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, fearing the growing power of his co-Prime Minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, Hun launched a [[1997 Cambodian Coup|coup]], using the army to purge Ranariddh and his supporters. Ranariddh was ousted and fled to Paris while other opponents of Hun Sen were arrested, tortured and some summarily executed.&lt;ref name=HRWAdams/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/54/060.html |title=Open letter to Second Prime Minister Hun Sen from Amnesty International|publisher=Hartford-hwp.com |date=11 July 1997 |accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 October 2004, the Cambodian National Assembly ratified an agreement with the United Nations on the establishment of a tribunal to try senior leaders responsible for the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/about-eccc |title= About ECCC – INTRODUCTION | publisher= Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) |date= |accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; International donor countries have pledged a US$43 Million share of the three-year tribunal budget as Cambodia contributes US$13.3 Million. The tribunal has sentenced several senior Khmer Rouge leaders since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cambodiatribunal.org/history/tribunal-background/accused-persons/ |title= Accused Persons – Cambodia Tribunal Monitor | publisher= Cambodia Tribunal Monitor |date= |accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cambodia is still infested with countless land mines, indiscriminately planted by all warring parties during the decades of war and upheaval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/khmer/Ledgerwood/Landmines.htm |title= Landmines in Cambodia | publisher= seasite |date= |accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
