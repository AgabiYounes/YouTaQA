The '''Central African Republic''' ('''CAR'''; [[Sango language|Sango]]: ''Ködörösêse tî Bêafrîka''&lt;span style=&quot;margin-left:1px&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; {{lang-fr|République centrafricaine}}&amp;nbsp; {{IPA-fr|ʁepyblik sɑ̃tʁafʁikɛn|pron}}, or ''{{lang|fr|Centrafrique}}'' {{IPA-fr|sɑ̃tʁafʁik|}}) is a [[landlocked country]] in [[Central Africa]]. It is bordered by [[Chad]] to [[Central African Republic–Chad border|the north]], [[Sudan]] to [[Central African Republic–Sudan border|the northeast]], [[South Sudan]] to [[Central African Republic–South Sudan border|the southeast]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to [[Central African Republic–Democratic Republic of the Congo border|the south]], the [[Republic of the Congo]] to [[Central African Republic–Republic of the Congo border|the southwest]] and [[Cameroon]] to [[Cameroon–Central African Republic border|the west]]. The CAR covers a land area of about {{convert|620,000|km2|sqmi}} and had an estimated population of around {{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|Central African Republic}}|R}}/1e6 round 1}} million {{As of|{{UN_Population|Year}}|lc=y}}. {{As of|2020}}, the CAR is the scene of a [[Central African Republic Civil War (2012–present)|civil war, ongoing since 2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/central-african-republic|title=World Report 2019: Rights Trends in Central African Republic|last1=Mudge|first1=Lewis|date=11 December 2018|website=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2019-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the CAR consists of Sudano-Guinean [[savanna]]s, but the country also includes a [[Sahel]]o-[[East Sudanian savanna|Sudanian]] zone in the north and an [[Northern Congolian forest-savanna mosaic|equatorial forest zone]] in the south. Two thirds of the country is within the [[Ubangi River]] basin (which flows into the [[Congo River|Congo]]), while the remaining third lies in the basin of the [[Chari River|Chari]], which flows into [[Lake Chad]].

What is today the Central African Republic has been inhabited for millennia; however, the country's current borders were established by [[France]], which ruled the country as a colony starting in the late 19th century. After gaining independence from France in 1960, the Central African Republic was ruled by a series of autocratic leaders, including an [[Central African Empire|abortive attempt at a monarchy]];&lt;ref name=Bokassa&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/03/jean-bedel-bokassa-posthumous-pardon 'Cannibal' dictator Bokassa given posthumous pardon] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301025416/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/03/jean-bedel-bokassa-posthumous-pardon |date=1 March 2017 }}. ''The Guardian''. 3 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; by the 1990s, calls for democracy led to the first multi-party democratic elections in 1993. [[Ange-Félix Patassé]] became president, but was later removed by [[François Bozizé|General François Bozizé]] in the [[2003 Central African Republic coup d'état|2003 coup]]. The [[Central African Republic Bush War]] began in 2004 and, despite a peace treaty in 2007 and another in 2011, civil war resumed in 2012.

Despite its significant [[mineral]] deposits and other resources, such as [[uranium]] reserves, [[crude oil]], [[gold]], [[diamond]]s, [[cobalt]], [[lumber]], and [[hydropower]],&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; as well as significant quantities of [[arable land]], the Central African Republic is among the ten poorest countries in the world, with the lowest [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita at purchasing power parity in the world as of 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;IMF 2017&quot;&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2017/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2017&amp;ey=2017&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;pr1.x=55&amp;pr1.y=9&amp;c=512%2C946%2C914%2C137%2C612%2C546%2C614%2C962%2C311%2C674%2C213%2C676%2C911%2C548%2C193%2C556%2C122%2C678%2C912%2C181%2C313%2C867%2C419%2C682%2C513%2C684%2C316%2C273%2C913%2C868%2C124%2C921%2C339%2C948%2C638%2C943%2C514%2C686%2C218%2C688%2C963%2C518%2C616%2C728%2C223%2C836%2C516%2C558%2C918%2C138%2C748%2C196%2C618%2C278%2C624%2C692%2C522%2C694%2C622%2C142%2C156%2C449%2C626%2C564%2C628%2C565%2C228%2C283%2C924%2C853%2C233%2C288%2C632%2C293%2C636%2C566%2C634%2C964%2C238%2C182%2C662%2C359%2C960%2C453%2C423%2C968%2C935%2C922%2C128%2C714%2C611%2C862%2C321%2C135%2C243%2C716%2C248%2C456%2C469%2C722%2C253%2C942%2C642%2C718%2C643%2C724%2C939%2C576%2C644%2C936%2C819%2C961%2C172%2C813%2C132%2C726%2C646%2C199%2C648%2C733%2C915%2C184%2C134%2C524%2C652%2C361%2C174%2C362%2C328%2C364%2C258%2C732%2C656%2C366%2C654%2C734%2C336%2C144%2C263%2C146%2C268%2C463%2C532%2C528%2C944%2C923%2C176%2C738%2C534%2C578%2C536%2C537%2C429%2C742%2C433%2C866%2C178%2C369%2C436%2C744%2C136%2C186%2C343%2C925%2C158%2C869%2C439%2C746%2C916%2C926%2C664%2C466%2C826%2C112%2C542%2C111%2C967%2C298%2C443%2C927%2C917%2C846%2C544%2C299%2C941%2C582%2C446%2C474%2C666%2C754%2C668%2C698%2C672&amp;s=PPPPC&amp;grp=0&amp;a= World Economic Outlook Database, January 2018] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503062812/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2017/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2017&amp;ey=2017&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;pr1.x=55&amp;pr1.y=9&amp;c=512,946,914,137,612,546,614,962,311,674,213,676,911,548,193,556,122,678,912,181,313,867,419,682,513,684,316,273,913,868,124,921,339,948,638,943,514,686,218,688,963,518,616,728,223,836,516,558,918,138,748,196,618,278,624,692,522,694,622,142,156,449,626,564,628,565,228,283,924,853,233,288,632,293,636,566,634,964,238,182,662,359,960,453,423,968,935,922,128,714,611,862,321,135,243,716,248,456,469,722,253,942,642,718,643,724,939,576,644,936,819,961,172,813,132,726,646,199,648,733,915,184,134,524,652,361,174,362,328,364,258,732,656,366,654,734,336,144,263,146,268,463,532,528,944,923,176,738,534,578,536,537,429,742,433,866,178,369,436,744,136,186,343,925,158,869,439,746,916,926,664,466,826,112,542,111,967,298,443,927,917,846,544,299,941,582,446,474,666,754,668,698,672&amp;s=PPPPC&amp;grp=0&amp;a= |date=3 May 2018 }}, [http://www.imf.org/external/ns/cs.aspx?id=28 International Monetary Fund] {{Webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20060214005019/http://www.imf.org/external/ns/cs.aspx?id=28 |date=14 February 2006 }}.

France seized and colonized [[Ubangi-Shari]] territory in 1894. In 1911 at the [[Treaty of Fez]], France ceded a nearly 300,000&amp;nbsp;km² portion of the Sangha and Lobaye basins to the [[German Empire]] which ceded a smaller area (in present-day [[Chad]]) to France. After [[World War I]] France again annexed the territory. Modeled on [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold]]'s [[Congo Free State]], concessions were doled out to private companies that endeavored to strip the region's assets as quickly and cheaply as possible before depositing a percentage of their profits into the French treasury. The concessionary companies forced local people to harvest rubber, coffee, and other commodities without pay and held their families hostage until they met their quotas. Between 1890, a year after the French first arrived, and 1940, the population declined by half due to diseases, famine and exploitation by private companies.&lt;ref name=fp1015&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/10/28/one-day-we-will-start-a-big-war-central-african-republic-un-violence/|title=One day we will start a big war|magazine=Foreign Policy|accessdate=13 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205203123/http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/10/28/one-day-we-will-start-a-big-war-central-african-republic-un-violence/|archive-date=5 February 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Since independence (1960–present) ===
In the [[1957 Ubangi-Shari parliamentary election|Ubangi-Shari Territorial Assembly election]] in 1957, MESAN captured 347,000 out of the total 356,000 votes,&lt;ref&gt;Olson, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; and won every legislative seat,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kalck|Kalck]], p. xxxi.&lt;/ref&gt; which led to Boganda being elected president of the Grand Council of [[French Equatorial Africa]] and vice-president of the Ubangi-Shari Government Council.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kalck|Kalck]], p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a year, he declared the establishment of the Central African Republic and served as the country's first prime minister.

Dacko threw out his political rivals, including former Prime Minister and [[Democratic Evolution Movement of Central Africa|Mouvement d'évolution démocratique de l'Afrique centrale]] (MEDAC), leader [[Abel Goumba]], whom he forced into exile in France. With all opposition parties suppressed by November 1962, Dacko declared MESAN as the official party of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kalck|Kalck]], p. xxxii.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Central African Empire}}
[[File:Bokassa colored.png|thumb|upright|[[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]], self-crowned [[Emperor of Central Africa]].&lt;ref name=Bokassa/&gt; ]]
On 31 December 1965, Dacko was overthrown in the [[Saint-Sylvestre coup d'état]] by Colonel [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]], who suspended the constitution and dissolved the National Assembly. President Bokassa declared himself President for Life in 1972, and named himself Emperor Bokassa I of the [[Central African Empire]] (as the country was renamed) on 4 December 1976. A year later, Emperor Bokassa crowned himself in a lavish and expensive ceremony that was ridiculed by much of the world.&lt;ref name=Bokassa/&gt;

In April 1979, young students protested against Bokassa's decree that all school attendees would need to buy uniforms from a company owned by one of his wives. The government violently suppressed the protests, killing 100 children and teenagers. Bokassa himself may have been personally involved in some of the killings.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7803421.stm 'Good old days' under Bokassa?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203043924/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7803421.stm |date=3 December 2013 }}&quot;. BBC News. 2 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1979, [[Operation Barracuda|France overthrew Bokassa]] and restored Dacko to power (subsequently restoring the name of the country and the original government to the Central African Republic). Dacko, in turn, was again overthrown in a [[1981 Central African Republic coup d'état|coup]] by General [[André Kolingba]] on 1 September 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/02/world/army-tropples-leader-of-central-african-republic.html|title=Army Tropples Leader of Central African Republic|last=Prial|first=Frank J.|date=1981-09-02|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-09-19|last2=Times|first2=Special To the New York|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Central African Republic under Kolingba ====
Kolingba suspended the constitution and ruled with a military junta until 1985. He introduced a new constitution in 1986 which was adopted by a nationwide referendum. Membership in his new party, the [[Rassemblement Démocratique Centrafricain]] (RDC), was voluntary. In 1987 and 1988, semi-free elections to parliament were held, but Kolingba's two major political opponents, [[Abel Goumba]] and [[Ange-Félix Patassé]], were not allowed to participate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discoverworld.com/Central-African-Republic:In-depth#Why-Visit|title=Central African Republic - Discover World|website=www.discoverworld.com|access-date=2018-02-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210180433/https://www.discoverworld.com/Central-African-Republic:In-depth#Why-Visit|archive-date=10 February 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1990, inspired by the fall of the Berlin Wall, a pro-democracy movement arose. Pressure from the United States, France, and from a group of locally represented countries and agencies called GIBAFOR (France, the US, Germany, Japan, the EU, the [[World Bank]], and the UN) finally led Kolingba to agree, in principle, to hold free elections in October 1992 with help from the UN Office of Electoral Affairs. After using the excuse of alleged irregularities to suspend the results of the elections as a pretext for holding on to power, President Kolingba came under intense pressure from GIBAFOR to establish a &quot;Conseil National Politique Provisoire de la République&quot; (Provisional National Political Council, CNPPR) and to set up a &quot;Mixed Electoral Commission&quot;, which included representatives from all political parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

When a second round of elections were finally held in 1993, again with the help of the international community coordinated by GIBAFOR,  Ange-Félix Patassé won in the second round of voting with 53% of the vote while Goumba won 45.6%. Patassé's party, the ''Mouvement pour la Libération du Peuple Centrafricain'' (MLPC) or Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People, gained a simple but not an absolute majority of seats in parliament, which meant Patassé's party required coalition partners.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==== Patassé Government (1993–2003) ====
Patassé purged many of the Kolingba elements from the government and Kolingba supporters accused Patassé's government of conducting a &quot;witch hunt&quot; against the Yakoma. A new constitution was approved on 28 December 1994 but had little impact on the country's politics. In 1996–1997, reflecting steadily decreasing public confidence in the government's erratic behaviour, three mutinies against Patassé's administration were accompanied by widespread destruction of property and heightened ethnic tension. During this time (1996) the Peace Corps evacuated all its volunteers to neighboring Cameroon.  To date, the Peace Corps has not returned to the Central African Republic.  The [[Bangui Agreements]], signed in January 1997, provided for the deployment of an inter-African military mission, to Central African Republic and re-entry of ex-mutineers into the government on 7 April 1997. The inter-African military mission was later replaced by a U.N. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1159|peacekeeping force (MINURCA)]]. Since 1997, the country has hosted almost a dozen peacekeeping interventions, earning it the title of &quot;world champion of peacekeeping&quot;.&lt;ref name=fp1015/&gt;

In 1998, parliamentary elections resulted in Kolingba's RDC winning 20 out of 109 seats. The next year, however, in spite of widespread public anger in urban centers over his corrupt rule, Patassé won a second term in the presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eisa.org.za/wep/car1999results.htm|title=EISA Central African Republic: 1999 Presidential election results|last=|first=|date=October 2010|website=www.eisa.org.za|publisher=African Democracy Encyclopaedia Project|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 May 2001, rebels stormed strategic buildings in Bangui in an [[2001 Central African Republic coup d'état attempt|unsuccessful coup attempt]]. The army chief of staff, Abel Abrou, and General François N'Djadder Bedaya were killed, but Patassé regained the upper hand by bringing in at least 300 troops of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] rebel leader [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]] and Libyan soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=International Crisis Group|title=Central African Republic: Anatomy of a Phantom State|url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/africa/central-africa/central-african-republic/Central%20African%20Republic%20Anatomy%20of%20a%20Phantom%20State.pdf|website=CrisisGroup.org|publisher=International Crisis Group|accessdate=24 July 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626162538/http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/africa/central-africa/central-african-republic/Central%20African%20Republic%20Anatomy%20of%20a%20Phantom%20State.pdf|archivedate=26 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[2001 Central African Republic coup d'état attempt|failed coup]], militias loyal to Patassé sought revenge against rebels in many neighborhoods of [[Bangui]] and incited unrest including the murder of many political opponents. Eventually, Patassé came to suspect that General [[François Bozizé]] was involved in another coup attempt against him, which led Bozizé  to flee with loyal troops to Chad. In March 2003, Bozizé launched a surprise attack against Patassé, who was out of the country. Libyan troops and some 1,000 soldiers of Bemba's Congolese rebel organization failed to stop the rebels and Bozizé's forces succeeded in overthrowing Patassé.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discoverworld.com/Central-African-Republic:In-depth#History|title=Central African Republic History|date=2018|website=DiscoverWorld.com|access-date=2018-02-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210180433/https://www.discoverworld.com/Central-African-Republic:In-depth#History|archive-date=10 February 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

François Bozizé suspended the constitution and named a new cabinet, which included most opposition parties. Abel Goumba was named vice-president, which gave Bozizé's new government a positive image.{{why?|date=September 2018}} Bozizé established a broad-based National Transition Council to draft a new constitution, and announced that he would step down and run for office once the new constitution was approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news/2003/04/28/bozize-step-down-after-transitional-period|title=Bozize to step down after transitional period|date=2003-04-28|website=The New Humanitarian|language=en|access-date=2020-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the [[Central African Republic Bush War]] began, as forces opposed to Bozizé took up arms against his government.

The Syrte Agreement in February and the Birao Peace Agreement in April 2007 called for a cessation of hostilities, the billeting of [[Democratic Front of the Central African People|FDPC]] fighters and their integration with FACA, the liberation of political prisoners, integration of FDPC into government, an amnesty for the [[Union of Democratic Forces for Unity|UFDR]], its recognition as a political party, and the integration of its fighters into the national army. Several groups continued to fight but other groups signed on to the agreement, or similar agreements with the government (e.g. UFR on 15 December 2008). The only major group not to sign an agreement at the time was the [[Convention of Patriots for Justice and Peace|CPJP]], which continued its activities and signed a peace agreement with the government on 25 August 2012.

The Central African Republic is a landlocked nation within the interior of the African continent. It is bordered by Cameroon, Chad, Sudan, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Republic of the Congo. The country lies between latitudes [[2nd parallel north|2°]] and [[11th parallel north|11°N]], and longitudes [[14th meridian east|14°]] and [[28th meridian east|28°E]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/africa/centralafricanrepublic/cfland.htm|title=Geography of Central African Republic, Landforms - World Atlas|last=Moen|first=John|date=|website=www.worldatlas.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the country consists of flat or rolling plateau [[savanna]] approximately {{convert|500|m|ft|0}} above [[sea level]]. Most of the northern half lies within the [[World Wildlife Fund]]'s [[East Sudanian savanna]] [[ecoregion]]. In addition to the Fertit Hills in the northeast of the CAR, there are scattered hills in the southwest regions. In the northwest is the Yade Massif, a [[granite]] plateau with an altitude of {{convert|1,143|ft|m|0|order=flip}}.

At {{convert|622,984|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=}}, the Central African Republic is the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|world's 44th-largest country]]. It is comparable in size to [[Ukraine]], as the [[Ukraine]] is {{Convert|603500|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=}} in area, according to [[List of countries and dependencies by area]].

Much of the southern border is formed by [[Tributary|tributaries]] of the [[Congo River]]; the [[Mbomou River]] in the east merges with the [[Uele River]] to form the [[Ubangi River]], which also comprises portions of the southern border. The [[Sangha River]] flows through some of the western regions of the country, while the eastern border lies along the edge of the [[Nile River]] [[drainage basin|watershed]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

It has been estimated that up to 8% of the country is covered by forest, with the densest parts generally located in the southern regions. The forests are highly diverse and include commercially important species of [[Ayous]], [[Sapele|Sapelli]] and [[Sipo (timber)|Sipo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forestsmonitor.org/en/reports/540539 &quot;Sold Down the River (English)&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413014533/http://www.forestsmonitor.org/en/reports/540539 |date=13 April 2010 }}. forestsmonitor.org.&lt;/ref&gt; The deforestation rate is about 0.4% per annum, and [[Illegal logging|lumber poaching]] is commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://carpe.umd.edu/resources/Documents/THE_FORESTS_OF_THE_CONGO_BASIN_State_of_the_Forest_2006.pdf/view |title=The Forests of the Congo Basin: State of the Forest 2006 |accessdate=2010-09-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220052802/http://carpe.umd.edu/resources/Documents/THE_FORESTS_OF_THE_CONGO_BASIN_State_of_the_Forest_2006.pdf/view |archivedate=20 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}.

Politics in the Central African Republic formally take place in a framework of a [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] [[republic]]. In this system, the [[Heads of state of the Central African Republic (and Central African Empire)|President]] is the [[head of state]], with a  [[Heads of government of the Central African Republic (and Central African Empire)|Prime Minister]] as [[head of government]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot; /&gt;

Changes in government have occurred in recent years by three methods: violence, negotiations, and elections. A new constitution was approved by voters in a referendum held on 5 December 2004. The government was rated 'Partly Free' from 1991 to 2001 and from 2004 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIW Score|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FIW%20All%20Scores%2C%20Countries%2C%201973-2012%20%28FINAL%29.xls|work=Freedom House|accessdate=26 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424223549/http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FIW%20All%20Scores%2C%20Countries%2C%201973-2012%20%28FINAL%29.xls|archive-date=24 April 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Executive branch===
The president is elected by popular vote for a six-year term, and the prime minister is appointed by the president. The president also appoints and presides over the [[Central African Republic Council of Ministers|Council of Ministers]], which initiates laws and oversees government operations. However, as of 2018 the official government is not in control of large parts of the country, which are governed by rebel groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/rebels-in-the-central-african-republic-are-filling-the-void-of-an-absent-government/2018/03/25/3e11d960-2328-11e8-946c-9420060cb7bd_story.html|title=Rebels in the Central African Republic are filling the void of an absent government|last=Losh|first=Jack|date=26 March 2018|website=[[The Washington Post]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Economy of the Central African Republic}}

The [[per capita income]] of the Republic is often listed as being approximately $400 a year, [[List of countries by GNI (PPP) per capita|one of the lowest in the world]], but this figure is based mostly on reported sales of exports and largely ignores the unregistered sale of foods, locally produced [[alcoholic beverage]]s, [[diamond]]s, [[ivory]], [[bushmeat]], and [[traditional medicine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2019-06-19|title=Central African Republic - Systematic Country Diagnostic : Priorities for Ending Poverty and Boosting Shared Prosperity|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/459721563221464687/Central-African-Republic-Systematic-Country-Diagnostic-Priorities-for-Ending-Poverty-and-Boosting-Shared-Prosperity|journal=[[The World Bank]]|language=en|location=Washington, D.C.|volume=|pages=1–96|via=http://documents.worldbank.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The currency of Central African Republic is the [[Central African CFA franc|CFA franc]], which is accepted across the former countries of French West Africa and trades at a fixed rate to the euro. Diamonds constitute the country's most important export, accounting for 40–55% of export revenues, but it is estimated that between 30% and 50% of those produced each year leave the country clandestinely.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Tree map export 2009 Central African Republic.jpeg|thumb|left|Graphical depiction of Central African Republic's product exports in 28 color-coded categories]]

Agriculture is dominated by the cultivation and sale of food crops such as [[cassava]], [[peanut]]s, [[maize]], [[sorghum]], [[millet]], [[sesame]], and [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]. The annual real GDP [[Economic growth|growth rate]] is just above 3%. The importance of food crops over exported [[cash crops]] is indicated by the fact that the total production of cassava, the staple food of most Central Africans, ranges between 200,000 and 300,000 [[tonnes]] a year, while the production of [[cotton]], the principal exported cash crop, ranges from 25,000 to 45,000 tonnes a year. Food crops are not exported in large quantities, but still constitute the principal cash crops of the country, because Central Africans derive far more income from the periodic sale of surplus food crops than from exported cash crops such as cotton or coffee.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Much of the country is self-sufficient in food crops; however, [[livestock]] development is hindered by the presence of the [[tsetse fly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gouteux|first=J.
