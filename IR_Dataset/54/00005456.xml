{{Politics of Cameroon}}
[[Cameroon]]'s noncontentious, low-profile approach to foreign relations puts it squarely in the middle of other [[Africa]]n and developing country states on major issues. It supports the principles of [[National sovereignty|non-interference]] in the affairs of third world countries and increased assistance to underdeveloped countries. Cameroon is an active participant in the [[United Nations]], where its voting record demonstrates its commitment to causes that include international [[peacekeeping]], the [[rule of law]], [[environmentalism|environmental protection]], and [[Third World]] economic development. In the UN and other [[human rights]] fora, Cameroon's non-confrontational approach has generally led it to avoid criticizing other countries.

Cameroon enjoys good [[Cameroon-United States relations|relations with the United States]] and other developed countries. Cameroon enjoys generally good relations with its African neighbors. It supports UN peacekeeping activities in [[Central Africa]].

==International disputes==
Delimitation of international boundaries in the vicinity of [[Lake Chad]], the lack of which led to border incidents in the past, is complete and awaits ratification by Cameroon, [[Chad]], [[Niger]], and Nigeria; dispute with Nigeria over land and [[maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]] around the [[Bakasi Peninsula]] and Lake Chad is currently before the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ), as is a dispute with [[Equatorial Guinea]] over the exclusive maritime economic zone.  As of 10 October 2012, it has been resolved that Cameroon own Bakassi.

Cameroon also faces a complaint filed with the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights|African Commission on Human Rights]] by the [[Southern Cameroons National Council|Southern Cameroons National Council (SCNC)]] and the [[Southern Cameroons|Southern Cameroons Peoples Organisation (SCAPO)]] against the Government of the Republic of Cameroon, in which the complainants allege that the Republic of Cameroon is illegally occupying the territory of [[Southern Cameroons]]. The SCNC and SCAPO ultimately seek the independence of the territory of Southern Cameroons.&lt;ref name=
