A '''duopoly''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] δύο, ''duo'' (two) + πωλεῖν, ''polein'' (to sell)) is a type of [[oligopoly]] where two firms have dominant or exclusive control over a market. It is the most commonly studied form of oligopoly due to its simplicity. Duopolies sell to consumers in a competitive market where the choice of an individual consumer can not affect the firm. The defining characteristic of both duopolies and oligopolies is that decisions made by sellers are dependent on each other.

==Duopoly models in economics and game theory==
There are two principal duopoly models, [[Cournot duopoly]] and [[Bertrand duopoly]]:
* The [[Antoine Augustin Cournot|Cournot]] model, which shows that two firms assume each other's output and treat this as a fixed amount, and produce in their own firm according to this.
* The [[Joseph Louis François Bertrand|Bertrand]] model, in which, in a [[Game theory|game]] of two firms, each one of them will assume that the other will not change prices in response to its price cuts. When both firms use this logic, they will reach a [[Nash equilibrium]].

== Characteristics of duopoly ==
# Existence of only two sellers
# Independence :if any firm makes the change in the price or promotional scheme, other forms also have to comply with it, to remain in the competition.{{explain|date=December 2019}}
# Presence of monopoly elements: so long as products are differentiated, the firms enjoy some monopoly power, as each product will have some loyal customers
# There are two popular models of duopoly, i.e., Cournot's Model and Bertrand's Model.

==Politics==
{{Main article|Two-party system}}
Like a market, a political system can be dominated by two groups, which exclude other parties or ideologies from participation. One party or the other tends to dominate government at any given time (the Majority party), while the other has only limited power (the Minority party). According to [[Duverger's law]], this tends to be caused by a simple [[plurality voting|winner-take-all]] voting system without [[runoff voting|runoffs]]{{dn|date=December 2019}} or [[instant-runoff voting|ranked choices]]. The [[Politics of the United States|United States]] and many Latin American countries have two-party government systems.

==Examples in business==
&lt;!-- Do not add examples without providing a reliable source that characterize them as duopolies. The source need not use the word &quot;duopoly,&quot; but it must note the anticompetitive effect of a two-entity market. Your own opinion is not sufficient. --&gt;
A commonly cited example of a duopoly is that involving [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] and [[MasterCard]], who between them control a large proportion of the electronic payment processing market. In 2000 they were the defendants in a [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] [[Sherman Antitrust Act|antitrust]] lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/f1900/1973.htm|title=Complaint - ATR - Department of Justice|author=|date=|website=www.usdoj.gov|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mit.edu/thistle/www/v12/2/credit.html|title=Credit Card Antitrust Suit|author=|date=|website=mit.edu|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An appeal was upheld in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4014599.stm|title=Amex is suing Visa and Mastercard|author=|date=15 November 2004|publisher=|accessdate=9 April 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples where two companies control a large proportion of a market are:
* [[Woolworths Limited|Woolworths]] and [[Coles Supermarkets|Coles]] in the [[Australia]]n supermarket market (share 79% of the supermarket market)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/article/2008/11/03/20101_latest-news.html Weeklytimesnow.com.au - Coles, Woolworths still dominate&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] and [[CSX Transportation]] operate a duopoly on freight rail traffic in the [[Eastern United States]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kramer-Miller|first=Ben|title=Norfolk Southern Corp.

* [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[iOS]] and [[Google|Google's]] [[Android (operating system)|Android]] make up over 99% of the [[mobile operating system]] market&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/16/14634656/android-ios-market-share-blackberry-2016 99.6 percent of new smartphones run Android or iOS].

==Media==
In Finland, the state-owned broadcasting company [[Yleisradio]] and the private broadcaster [[MTV3|Mainos-TV]] had a legal duopoly (in the economists' sense of the word) from the 1950s to 1993. No other broadcasters were allowed. Mainos-TV operated by leasing air time from Yleisradio, broadcasting in reserved blocks between Yleisradio's own programming on its two channels. This was a unique phenomenon in the world. Between 1986 and 1992 there was an independent third channel but it was jointly owned by Yle and MTV; only in 1993 did MTV get its own channel.

In the United Kingdom, the [[BBC]] and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] formed an effective duopoly (with [[Channel 4]] originally being economically dependent on ITV) until the development of multichannel from the 1990s onwards.

[[Safaricom]] mobile service provider and [[Airtel]] in Kenya are perfect examples of Duopoly market in the African telecommunication industry.

==Broadcasting==
{{Main|Duopoly (broadcasting)}}
[[Duopoly (broadcasting)|Duopoly]] is also used in the United States broadcast television and radio industry to refer to a single company owning two outlets in the same city.

This usage is technically incompatible with the normal definition of the word and may lead to confusion, inasmuch as there are generally more than two owners of broadcast television stations in markets with broadcast duopolies. In Canada, this definition is therefore more commonly called a &quot;[[twinstick]]&quot;.
