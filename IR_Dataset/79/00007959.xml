{{Basic forms of government}}
{{Politics sidebar|expanded=Systems}}

'''Democracy''' ({{lang-gr|δημοκρατία}} ''{{lang|grc|dēmokratía}}'', &quot;rule by [the] people&quot;) is a form of [[government]] in which [[people|the people]] exercise the [[authority]] of government. Who people are and how authority is shared among them are core issues for democratic development and [[constitution]]. Some cornerstones of these issues are  [[freedom of assembly]] and [[freedom of speech|speech]], [[Social exclusion#Social inclusion|inclusiveness]] and [[political equality|equality]], [[citizenship|membership]], [[consent of the governed|consent]], [[voting rights|voting]], [[right to life]] and [[minority rights]].

Generally, there are two types of democracy: direct and representative. In a [[direct democracy]], the people directly [[deliberate]] and decide on [[legislature]]. In a [[representative democracy]] the people elect representatives to deliberate and decide on legislature, such as in [[parliamentary democracy|parliamentary]] or [[presidential democracy]]. [[Liquid democracy]] combines elements of these two basic types.

The most common decision making approach of democracies has been the [[Majority rule|majority rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/democracy|title=Definition of DEMOCRACY|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''Two Treatises on Government: a Translation into Modern English''. Quote: &quot;There is no practical alternative to majority political rule – i.e., to taking the consent of the majority as the act of the whole and binding every individual. It would be next to impossible to obtain the consent of every individual before acting collectively ... No rational people could desire and constitute a society that had to dissolve straightaway because the majority was unable to make the final decision and the society was incapable of acting as one body.&quot;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=d_4BGe7-pFIC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;lpg=PR9&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CThere+is+no+practical+alternative+to+majority+political+rule+%E2%80%93+i.e.,+to+taking+the+consent+of+the+majority+as+the+act+of+the+whole+and+binding+every+individual.%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CThere%20is%20no%20practical%20alternative%20to%20majority%20political%20rule%20%E2%80%93%20i.e.%2C%20to%20taking%20the%20consent%20of%20the%20majority%20as%20the%20act%20of%20the%20whole%20and%20binding%20every%20individual.%22&amp;f=false Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; Others are [[supermajority]] and [[consensus democracy|consensus]].

In the common variant of [[liberal democracy]] the powers of the majority are exercised within the framework of a representative democracy, but the [[constitution]] limits the majority and protects the minority, usually through the enjoyment by all of certain individual rights, e.g. freedom of speech, or freedom of association.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'': &quot;democracy&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Watkins |first1=Frederick |title=Democracy |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=1970 |publisher=William Benton |isbn=978-0-85229-135-1 |pages=215–23 |edition=Expo '70 hardcover |language=English |volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Besides these general types of democracy, there have been a wealth of further types ([[Democracy#Types of governmental democracies|see below]]). [[Republic]]s, though often associated with democracy because of the shared principle of rule by [[consent of the governed]], are not necessarily democracies, as [[republicanism]] does not specify ''how'' the people are to rule.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. R. Palmer]], ''The Age of the Democratic Revolution: Political History of Europe and America, 1760–1800'' (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

Democracy is a system of processing conflicts in which outcomes depend on what participants do, but no single force controls what occurs and its outcomes. The uncertainty of outcomes is inherent in democracy. Democracy makes all forces struggle repeatedly to realize their interests and devolves power from groups of people to sets of rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Przeworski|first1=Adam|title=Democracy and the Market|url=https://archive.org/details/democracymarket00prze|url-access=registration|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/democracymarket00prze/page/10 10–14]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western democracy]], as distinct from that which existed in pre-modern societies, is generally considered to have originated in [[city-states]] such as [[Classical Athens]] and the [[Roman Republic]], where various schemes and degrees of enfranchisement of the free male population were observed before the form disappeared in [[Western world|the West]] at the beginning of [[late antiquity]]. The English word dates back to the 16th century, from the older [[Middle French]] and [[Middle Latin]] equivalents.

According to American political scientist [[Larry Diamond]], democracy consists of four key elements: a political system for choosing and replacing the government through free and fair [[election]]s; the active participation of the people, as citizens, in politics and civic life; protection of the [[human rights]] of all citizens; a [[rule of law]], in which the laws and procedures apply equally to all citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, L., Lecture at Hilla University for Humanistic Studies 21 January 2004: [http://web.stanford.edu/~ldiamond/iraq/WhaIsDemocracy012004.htm &quot;What is Democracy&quot;]; Diamond, L. and Morlino, L., The quality of democracy (2016). In Diamond, L., In Search of Democracy. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-415-78128-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Todd Landman, nevertheless, draws our attention to the fact that democracy and [[human rights]] are two different concepts and that &quot;there must be greater specificity in the conceptualisation and operationalisation of democracy and human rights&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Landman |first1=Todd |title=Democracy and Human Rights: Concepts, Measures, and Relationships |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=1 |page=48 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i1.1186 |year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The term appeared in the 5th century BC to denote the political systems then existing in [[Greek city-state]]s, notably [[Classical Athens|Athens]], to mean &quot;rule of the people&quot;, in contrast to [[aristocracy]] ({{lang|grc|ἀριστοκρατία}}, ''{{lang|la|aristokratía}}''), meaning &quot;rule of an elite&quot;. While theoretically, these definitions are in opposition, in practice the distinction has been blurred historically.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, N.G. (2006). ''Encyclopedia of ancient Greece''. New York: Routledge. p. 511. {{ISBN|0-415-97334-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The political system of Classical Athens, for example, granted democratic citizenship to free men and excluded slaves and women from political participation. In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship consisted of an elite class, until full enfranchisement was won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the [[suffrage]] movements of the 19th and 20th centuries.

Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by an individual, as in an [[absolute monarchy]], or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an [[oligarchy]]. Nevertheless, these oppositions, inherited from Greek philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barker|first=Ernest|title=The Political Thought of Plato and Aristotle|year=1906|publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons|location=Chapter VII, Section 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HUrAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; are now ambiguous because contemporary governments have mixed democratic, oligarchic and monarchic elements. [[Karl Popper]] defined democracy in contrast to [[dictatorship]] or [[Tyrant|tyranny]], thus focusing on opportunities for the people to control their leaders and to oust them without the need for a [[revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Jarvie, 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;218–19&lt;/ref&gt;

No consensus exists on how to define democracy, but [[legal equality]], [[political freedom]] and [[rule of law]] have been identified as important characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer |url=http://www.economist.com/markets/rankings/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8908438|title=Liberty and justice for some|work=[[The Economist]] | publisher = [[Economist Group]] | date = 22 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = O'Donnell | first = Guillermo | contribution = Why the rule of law matters | editor-last1 = Diamond | editor-first1 = Larry | editor-last2 = Morlino | editor-first2 = Leonardo | title = Assessing the quality of democracy | pages = 3–17 | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | location = Baltimore | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-8018-8287-6 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=-eXJMXnraPQC&amp;pg=PA3 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; These principles are reflected in all eligible citizens being [[Equality before the law|equal before the law]] and having equal access to legislative processes.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} For example, in a [[representative democracy]], every vote has equal weight, no unreasonable restrictions can apply to anyone seeking to become a representative,{{according to whom|date=January 2015}} and the freedom of its eligible citizens is secured by legitimised rights and liberties which are typically protected by a [[constitution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BKMIT&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Dahl | first1 = Robert A. | last2 = Shapiro | first2 = Ian | last3 = Cheibub | first3 = José Antônio | title = The democracy sourcebook | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-262-54147-3 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=B8THIuSkiqgC Details.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BKHenaff&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hénaff | first1 = Marcel | last2 = Strong | first2 = Tracy B. | title = Public space and democracy | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | location = Minneapolis | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-8166-3388-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other uses of &quot;democracy&quot; include that of [[direct democracy]].

One theory holds that democracy requires three fundamental principles: upward control (sovereignty residing at the lowest levels of authority), political equality, and social norms by which individuals and institutions only consider acceptable acts that reflect the first two principles of upward control and political equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kimber | first = Richard | title = On democracy | journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 201, 199–219| doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9477.1989.tb00090.x | date = September 1989 | ref = harv }} [https://tidsskrift.dk/index.php/scandinavian_political_studies/article/view/13057/24875 Full text.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;democracy&quot; is sometimes used as shorthand for [[liberal democracy]], which is a variant of representative democracy that may include elements such as [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]]; equality before the law; the [[right to petition]] elected officials for redress of grievances; [[due process]]; [[civil liberties]]; [[human rights]]; and elements of [[civil society]] outside the government.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} [[Roger Scruton]] argues that democracy alone cannot provide personal and political freedom unless the institutions of [[civil society]] are also present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Scruton | first = Roger | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23607302 | title=A Point of View: Is democracy overrated? | work = [[BBC News]] | publisher= [[BBC]] | date=9 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, notably in the [[United Kingdom]] which originated the [[Westminster system]], the dominant principle is that of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], while maintaining [[judicial independence]].&lt;ref name= Kopstein2014&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Kopstein|editor1-first=Jeffrey|editor2-last=Lichbach|editor2-first=Mark|editor3-last=Hanson|editor3-first=Stephen E.|title=Comparative Politics: Interests, Identities, and Institutions in a Changing Global Order|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-99138-4|pages=37–39|edition=4, revised|url=https://books.google.com/?id=L2jwAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/sovereignty/ |title=Parliamentary sovereignty |publisher=UK Parliament |accessdate=18 August 2014|postscript=none}}; {{cite web|title=Independence|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-the-government-and-the-constitution/jud-acc-ind/independence/|publisher=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], [[separation of powers]] is often cited as a central attribute.

There are many decision making methods used in democracies, but [[majority rule]] is the dominant form. Without compensation, like legal protections of individual or group rights, [[minority group|political minorities]] can be oppressed by the &quot;[[tyranny of the majority]]&quot;. Majority rule is a competitive approach, opposed to [[consensus democracy]], creating the need that [[elections]], and generally [[deliberation]], are substantively and procedurally &quot;[[wikt:fair|fair]],&quot; i.e., [[wikt:just|just]] and [[wikt:equitable|equitable]]. In some countries, [[freedom (political)|freedom of political expression]], [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of the press]], and [[E-democracy|internet democracy]] are considered important to ensure that voters are well informed, enabling them to vote according to their own interests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barak27&quot;&gt;{{citation | last = Barak | first = Aharon | contribution = Protecting the constitution and democracy | editor-last = Barak | editor-first = Aharon | title = The judge in a democracy | page = 27 | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton, New Jersey | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-691-12017-1 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=3HX7mAbjGOYC&amp;pg=PA27 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kelsen | first = Hans | title = Foundations of democracy | journal = Ethics | volume = 66 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–101 | doi = 10.1086/291036 | jstor = 2378551 | date = October 1955 | ref = harv | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4f866f052445d9007716f87f2b6eba9abc747510 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that a basic feature of democracy is the capacity of all voters to participate freely and fully in the life of their society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nussbaum |first=Martha | author-link = Martha Nussbaum |title=Women and human development: the capabilities approach |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge New York |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-521-00385-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; With its emphasis on notions of [[social contract]] and the collective will of all the voters, democracy can also be characterised as a form of political [[collectivism]] because it is defined as a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in lawmaking.&lt;ref name=&quot;JHUPress&quot;&gt;{{citation | last1 = Snyder | first1 = Richard | last2 = Samuels | first2 = David | contribution = Devaluing the vote in Latin America | editor-last1 = Diamond | editor-first1 = Larry | editor-last2 = Plattner | editor-first2 = Marc F. | title = Electoral systems and democracy | page = 168 | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | location = Baltimore | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-8018-8475-7 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While representative democracy is sometimes equated with the republican form of government, the term &quot;[[republic]]&quot; classically has encompassed both democracies and [[aristocracy|aristocracies]].&lt;ref&gt;Montesquieu, ''Spirit of the Laws'', Bk. II, ch. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;William R.

{{see also|Athenian democracy}}

The term &quot;democracy&quot; first appeared in ancient Greek political and philosophical thought in the city-state of [[Athens]] during [[classical antiquity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BKDunn1992&quot;&gt;John Dunn, ''Democracy: the unfinished journey 508 BC&amp;nbsp;– 1993 AD'', Oxford University Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-19-827934-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Raaflaub|Ober|Wallace|2007|p={{page needed|date=July 2014}} }} The word comes from ''demos'', &quot;common people&quot; and ''kratos'', &quot;strength&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=democracy |dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary|title=Democracy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Led by [[Cleisthenes]], Athenians established what is generally held as the first democracy in 508–507 BC. Cleisthenes is referred to as &quot;the father of [[Athenian democracy]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. Po-chia Hsia, Lynn Hunt, Thomas R. Martin, Barbara H. Rosenwein, and Bonnie G. Smith, ''The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures, A Concise History, Volume I: To 1740'' (Boston and New York: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2007), 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Athenian democracy took the form of a direct democracy, and it had two distinguishing features: the [[sortition|random selection]] of ordinary citizens to fill the few existing government administrative and judicial offices,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle Book 6&lt;/ref&gt; and a legislative assembly consisting of all Athenian citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Leonid E. |last=Grinin |url=http://www.socionauki.ru/book/early_state_en/ |title=The Early State, Its Alternatives and Analogues |publisher=Uchitel' Publishing House |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; All eligible citizens were allowed to speak and vote in the assembly, which set the laws of the city state. However, Athenian citizenship excluded women, slaves, foreigners (μέτοικοι / ''métoikoi''), non-landowners, and men under 20 years of age.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/projects/demos/article_women_and_family?page=4|title=Women and Family in Athenian Law|website=www.stoa.org|language=en|access-date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Contradict-inline|article=Athenian democracy|date=September 2014}}
The exclusion of large parts of the population from the citizen body is closely related to the ancient understanding of citizenship. In most of antiquity the benefit of citizenship was tied to the obligation to fight war campaigns.&lt;ref name=&quot;SLape2009&quot;&gt;Susan Lape, ''Reproducing Athens: Menander's Comedy, Democratic Culture, and the Hellenistic City'', Princeton University Press, 2009, p. 4, {{ISBN|1-4008-2591-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athenian democracy was not only ''direct'' in the sense that decisions were made by the assembled people, but also the ''most direct'' in the sense that the people through the assembly, boule and courts of law controlled the entire political process and a large proportion of citizens were involved constantly in the public business.{{sfn|Raaflaub|Ober|Wallace|2007|p=5}} Even though the rights of the individual were not secured by the Athenian constitution in the modern sense (the ancient Greeks had no word for &quot;rights&quot;{{sfn|Ober|Hedrick|1996|p=107}}), the Athenians enjoyed their liberties not in opposition to the government but by living in a city that was not subject to another power and by not being subjects themselves to the rule of another person.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, 2001, pp. 194–201&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Range voting]] appeared in [[Sparta]] as early as 700 BC. The [[Apella]] was an assembly of the people, held once a month, in which every male citizen of at least 30 years of age could participate. In the Apella, Spartans elected leaders and cast votes by range voting and shouting. [[Aristotle]] called this &quot;childish&quot;, as compared with the stone voting ballots used by the Athenians. Sparta adopted it because of its simplicity, and to prevent any bias voting, buying, or cheating that was predominant in the early democratic elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rangevoting.org/SpartaBury.html |title=Full historical description of the Spartan government |publisher=Rangevoting.org |date= |accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terrence A. Boring, ''Literacy in Ancient Sparta'', Leiden Netherlands (1979). {{ISBN|90-04-05971-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the [[Roman Republic]] contributed significantly to many aspects of democracy, only a minority of Romans were citizens with votes in elections for representatives. The votes of the powerful were given more weight through a system of [[gerrymandering]], so most high officials, including members of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], came from a few wealthy and noble families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://annourbis.com/Ancient-Rome/8rome10.html |title=Ancient Rome from the earliest times down to 476 A.D |publisher=Annourbis.com |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Roman Republic was the first government in the western world to have a [[Republic]] as a nation-state, although it didn't have much of a democracy. The Roman model of governance inspired many political thinkers over the centuries,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Livy|2002|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; and today's modern representative democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek models because it was a state in which supreme power was held by the people and their elected representatives, and which had an elected or nominated leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watson|2005|p=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cultures, such as the [[Iroquois]] Nation in the Americas between around 1450 and 1600 AD also developed a form of democratic society before they came in contact with the Europeans. This indicates that forms of democracy may have been invented in other societies around the world.

Most regions in medieval Europe were ruled by clergy or feudal lords.

The [[Kouroukan Fouga]] divided the [[Mali Empire]] into ruling clans (lineages) that were represented at a great assembly called the ''Gbara''. However, the charter made Mali more similar to a [[constitutional monarchy]] than a [[democratic republic]].

The [[Parliament of England]] had its roots in the restrictions on the power of kings written into [[Magna Carta]] (1215), which explicitly protected certain rights of the King's subjects and implicitly supported what became the English writ of [[habeas corpus]], safeguarding individual freedom against unlawful imprisonment with right to appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta: an introduction|url=http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/magna-carta-an-introduction|publisher=The British Library|accessdate=28 January 2015|quote=Magna Carta is sometimes regarded as the foundation of democracy in England. ...Revised versions of Magna Carta were issued by King Henry III (in 1216, 1217 and 1225), and the text of the 1225 version was entered onto the statute roll in 1297. ...The 1225 version of Magna Carta had been granted explicitly in return for a payment of tax by the whole kingdom, and this paved the way for the first summons of Parliament in 1265, to approve the granting of taxation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/citizen_subject/making_history_citizen.htm |title=Citizen or Subject? |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first representative national assembly in [[Kingdom of England|England]] was [[Simon de Montfort's Parliament]] in 1265.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jobson|first1=Adrian|title=The First English Revolution: Simon de Montfort, Henry III and the Barons' War|date=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=978-1-84725-226-5|pages=173–74|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9gHWamp-TLoC&amp;pg=PA174#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Simon de Montfort: The turning point for democracy that gets overlooked|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30849472|accessdate=19 January 2015|publisher=BBC| postscript = none|date=19 January 2015}}; {{cite news|title=The January Parliament and how it defined Britain|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/11355822/The-January-Parliament-and-how-it-defined-Britain.html|accessdate=28 January 2015|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of [[Parliament of England#The emergence of parliament as an institution|petitioning]] is some of the earliest evidence of parliament being used as a forum to address the general grievances of ordinary people.

After the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] was enacted in 1689 which codified certain rights and liberties and is still in effect. The Bill set out the requirement for regular elections, rules for freedom of speech in Parliament and limited the power of the monarch, ensuring that, unlike much of Europe at the time, [[royal absolutism]] would not prevail.&lt;ref name=refNARoP&gt;{{cite web|title=Britain's unwritten constitution|url=http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution|publisher=British Library|accessdate=27 November 2015|quote=The key landmark is the Bill of Rights (1689), which established the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown....

The rising commercial class that had supported the Tudor monarchy in the 16th century led the revolutionary battle in the 17th and succeeded in establishing the supremacy of Parliament and, eventually, of the House of Commons. What emerged as the distinctive feature of modern constitutionalism was not the insistence on the idea that the king is subject to law (although this concept is an essential attribute of all constitutionalism). This notion was already well established in the Middle Ages. What was distinctive was the establishment of effective means of political control whereby the rule of law might be enforced. Modern constitutionalism was born with the political requirement that representative government depended upon the consent of citizen subjects... However, as can be seen through provisions in the 1689 Bill of Rights, the English Revolution was fought not just to protect the rights of property (in the narrow sense) but to establish those liberties which liberals believed essential to human dignity and moral worth. The &quot;rights of man&quot; enumerated in the English Bill of Rights gradually were proclaimed beyond the boundaries of England, notably in the American Declaration of Independence of 1776 and in the French Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024130317/http://www.ait.org.tw/infousa/zhtw/DOCS/Demopaper/dmpaper2.html|archivedate=24 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic historians [[Douglass North]] and [[Barry R.

In North America, representative government began in [[Jamestown, Virginia]], with the election of the [[House of Burgesses]] (forerunner of the [[Virginia General Assembly]]) in 1619.

[[File:Suffrage universel 1848.jpg|thumb|The establishment of [[universal male suffrage]] in France in 1848 was an important milestone in the history of democracy.]]

The [[first Parliament of Great Britain]] was established in 1707, after the merger of the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] under the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]]. Although the monarch increasingly became a [[Constitutional monarchy|figurehead]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/citizenship2.htm |title=Citizenship 1625–1789 |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
only a small minority actually had a voice; Parliament was elected by only a few percent of the population (less than 3% as late as 1780).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/struggle_democracy/getting_vote.htm |title=Getting the vote |publisher=The National Archives |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Age of Liberty]] in Sweden (1718–1772), [[civil rights]] were expanded and power shifted from the monarch to parliament. The taxed peasantry was represented in parliament, although with little influence, but commoners without taxed property had no suffrage.

The creation of the short-lived [[Corsican Republic]] in 1755 marked the first nation in modern history to adopt a democratic [[constitution]] (all men and women above age of 25 could vote&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The ungovernable rock: a history of the Anglo-Corsican Kingdom and its role in Britain's Mediterranean strategy during the Revolutionary War, 1793–1797 |first=Desmond |last=Gregory |year=1985 |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |location=London |page=31 |isbn=978-0-8386-3225-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This [[Corsican Constitution]] was the first based on [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles and included [[female suffrage]], something that was not granted in most other democracies until the 20th century.

In the [[Colonial history of the United States|American colonial period before 1776]], and for some time after, often only adult white male property owners could vote; enslaved Africans, most free black people and most women were not extended the franchise. This changed state by state, beginning with the republican State of New Connecticut, soon after called [[Vermont]], which, on declaring independence of Great Britain in 1777, adopted a constitution modelled on Pennsylvania's with citizenship and democratic suffrage for males with or without property, and went on to abolish slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Voting in Early America|journal=Colonial Williamsburg|volume=Spring 2007|url=http://www.history.org/Foundation/journal/spring07/elections.cfm|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Frontier Thesis|American frontier]], democracy became a way of life, with more widespread social, economic and political equality.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Allen Billington, ''America's Frontier Heritage'' (1974) 117–58. {{ISBN|0-8263-0310-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not described as a democracy by the [[founding fathers of the united states|founding fathers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnston|first1=Douglas M.|last2=Reisman|first2=W.

The [[American Revolution]] led to the adoption of the [[United States Constitution]] in 1787, the oldest surviving, still active, governmental [[codified constitution]].

The Constitution was designed to correct the Commonwealth's political flaws and had been preceded by a period of agitation for{{mdash}}and gradual introduction of{{mdash}}reforms, beginning with the [[Convocation Sejm (1764)|Convocation Sejm of 1764]] and the consequent [[Royal elections in Poland|election]] that year of [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]] as the Commonwealth's last king.

The Constitution sought to implement a more effective [[constitutional monarchy]], introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility, and placed the peasants under the protection of the government, mitigating the worst abuses of [[serfdom]]. It banned pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the ''[[liberum veto]]'', which had put the Sejm at the mercy of any single deputy, who could veto and thus undo all the legislation that had been adopted by that Sejm. The Commonwealth's neighbours reacted with hostility to the adoption of the Constitution. [[Frederick William II of Prussia|King Frederick William II]] broke [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]'s alliance with the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and joined with [[Catherine the Great]]'s [[Imperial Russia]] and the [[Targowica Confederation]] of anti-reform Polish magnates to defeat the Commonwealth in the [[Polish–Russian War of 1792]].

The 1791 Constitution was in force for less than 19 months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Machnikowski2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ligeza2017&quot;/&gt; It was declared null and void by the [[Grodno Sejm]] that met in 1793,&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies1992&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ligeza2017&quot;/&gt; though the Sejm's legal power to do so was questionable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ligeza2017&quot;/&gt; The [[Second Partition of Poland|Second]] and [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partitions]] of Poland (1793, 1795) ultimately ended Poland's sovereign existence until the close of [[World War I]] in 1918. Over those 123 years, the 1791 Constitution helped keep alive Polish aspirations for the eventual restoration of the country's sovereignty. In the words of two of its principal authors, [[Ignacy Potocki]] and [[Hugo Kołłątaj]], the 1791 Constitution was &quot;the last will and testament of the expiring Homeland.&quot;{{efn|name=Fatherland|Piotr Machnikowski renders the Polish ''&quot;Ojczyzna&quot;'' as &quot;[[Fatherland]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Machnikowski2010&quot;/&gt; The &quot;[[literal translation|literal]]&quot; English translation of &quot;''ojczyzna''&quot; is indeed &quot;[[fatherland]]&quot;: both these words are [[calque]]s of the [[Latin]] &quot;''patria'',&quot; which itself derives from the Latin &quot;''pater''&quot; (&quot;father&quot;).

The Landed Nobility|&quot;The Landed Nobility&quot;]]) renders &quot;''ojczyzna''&quot; as &quot;country&quot;, which is the usual English-language [[Translation#Equivalence|equivalent]] of the expression.  In this particular context, &quot;Homeland&quot; may be the most natural rendering.}}

The Constitution of 3 May 1791 combined a [[monarchy|monarchic]] [[republic]] with a clear division of executive, legislative, and judiciary powers. It is generally considered Europe's first, and the world's second, modern written national constitution, after the [[United States Constitution]] that had come into force in 1789.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ligeza2017&quot;/&gt;{{efn|name=Constitution|The claims of &quot;first&quot; and &quot;second constitution&quot; have been disputed. The U.S. and Polish-Lithuanian constitutions had been preceded by earlier documents that had not introduced the clear division of executive, legislative, and judiciary powers advocated by [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers such as [[Montesquieu]]. According to Koenigsberger,&lt;ref name=&quot;Koenigsberger1986&quot;/&gt; the [[Corsican Constitution]] of 1755&lt;ref name=dd/&gt; had not separated the executive from the judiciary. See [[history of the constitution]].}}

In 1789, [[Revolutionary France]] adopted the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] and, although short-lived, the [[National Convention]] was elected by all men in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mars.wnec.edu/~grempel/courses/wc2/lectures/rev892.html |title=The French Revolution II |publisher=Mars.wnec.edu |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827213104/http://mars.wnec.edu/~grempel/courses/wc2/lectures/rev892.html |archivedate=27 August 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the early 19th century, little of democracy—as theory, practice, or even as word—remained in the North Atlantic world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Denning2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Denning|title=Culture in the Age of Three Worlds|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GAoWojy41BkC&amp;pg=PA212|accessdate=10 July 2013|year=2004|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-85984-449-6|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, [[slavery]] remained a social and economic institution in places around the world. This was particularly the case in the [[United States]], and especially in the last fifteen [[slave state]]s that kept slavery legal in the American South until the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. A variety of organisations were established advocating the movement of black people from the United States to locations where they would enjoy greater freedom and equality.

The United Kingdom's [[Slave Trade Act 1807]] banned the trade across the [[British Empire]], which was [[Blockade of Africa|enforced internationally]] by the Royal Navy under treaties Britain negotiated with other nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lovejoy&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Lovejoy |first=Paul E. |title=Transformations in slavery: a history of slavery in Africa |page=290 |location=New York |edition=2nd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-521-78012-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the voting franchise in the U.K. was increased, it also was made more uniform in a series of reforms beginning with the [[Reform Act 1832]], although the United Kingdom did not manage to become a complete democracy well into the [[20th century]]. In 1833, the United Kingdom passed the [[Slavery Abolition Act]] which took effect across the British Empire.

[[Universal male suffrage]] was established in [[France]] in March 1848 in the wake of the [[French Revolution of 1848]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/suffrage_universel/suffrage-1848.asp|title=1848 &quot; Désormais le bulletin de vote doit remplacer le fusil &quot;|author=French National Assembly|accessdate=26 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848, several [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutions broke out in Europe]] as rulers were confronted with popular demands for liberal constitutions and more democratic government.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.iun.edu/~hisdcl/h114_2002/democracy.htm Movement toward greater democracy in Europe]&quot;.

In the [[1860 United States Census]], the slave population in the United States had grown to four million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itd.nps.gov/cwss/manassas/social/introsoc.htm |title=Introduction – Social Aspects of the Civil War |publisher=Itd.nps.gov |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714073725/http://www.itd.nps.gov/cwss/manassas/social/introsoc.htm |archivedate=14 July 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] after the Civil War (late 1860s), the newly [[Abolitionism in the United States|freed slaves]] became citizens with a nominal right to vote for men. Full enfranchisement of citizens was not secured until after the [[Civil Rights Movement]] gained passage by the United States Congress of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=100&amp;page=transcript Transcript of Voting Rights Act (1965)]  U.S. National Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,897070,00.html The Constitution: The 24th Amendment] Time.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876 the Ottoman Empire transitioned from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional one, and held two elections the next year to elect members to her newly formed parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;HK&quot;&gt;Hasan Kayalı (1995) [http://psi203.cankaya.edu.tr/uploads/files/Kayali,%20Elections%20in%20the%20Ott%20Empire%20(1995).pdf &quot;Elections and the Electoral Process in the Ottoman Empire, 1876–1919&quot;] ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'', Vol. 27, No. 3, pp 265–286&lt;/ref&gt; Provisional Electoral Regulations were issued on 29 October 1876, stating that the elected members of the Provincial Administrative Councils would elect members to the first [[Parliament of the Ottoman Empire|Parliament]]. On 24 December a new constitution was promulgated, which provided for a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] Parliament with a [[Senate of the Ottoman Empire|Senate]] appointed by [[Abdul Hamid II|the Sultan]] and a popularly elected [[Chamber of Deputies (Ottoman Empire)|Chamber of Deputies]]. Only men above the age of 30 who were competent in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and had full civil rights were allowed to stand for election. Reasons for disqualification included holding dual citizenship, being employed by a foreign government, being bankrupt, employed as a servant, or having &quot;notoriety for ill deeds&quot;. Full universal suffrage was achieved in 1934.

20th-century transitions to liberal democracy have come in successive &quot;waves of democracy&quot;, variously resulting from wars, revolutions, [[decolonisation]], and religious and economic circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diamond|first1=Larry|title=Timeline: Democracy in Recession|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/09/13/opinion/larry-diamond-democracy-in-recession-timeline.html|accessdate=25 January 2016|work=The New York Times|date=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global waves of &quot;democratic regression&quot; reversing democratization, have also occurred in the 1920s and 30s, in the 1960s and 1970s, and in the 2010s.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-11/mini-trumps-are-running-for-election-all-over-the-world|title=Mini-Trumps Are Running for Election All Over the World|last=Kurlantzick|first=Joshua|date=11 May 2017|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/authoreditor/yascha-mounk|title=The Signs of Deconsolidation|last=Mounk|first=Yascha|date=January 2017|language=en|access-date=16 May 2017|journal=Journal of Democracy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World War I]] and the dissolution of the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] and [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] empires resulted in the creation of new nation-states from Europe, most of them at least nominally democratic.

In the 1920s democracy flourished and [[Timeline of women's suffrage|women's suffrage]] advanced, but the [[Great Depression]] brought disenchantment and most of the countries of Europe, Latin America, and Asia turned to strong-man rule or dictatorships. [[Fascism]] and dictatorships flourished in [[Nazi Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], as well as non-democratic governments in the [[Baltics]], the [[Balkans]], [[Brazil]], [[Cuba]], [[China]], and [[Japan]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snl.depaul.edu/contents/current/syllabi/HC_314.doc |title=Age of Dictators: Totalitarianism in the inter-war period |accessdate=7 September 2006 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907220746/http://www.snl.depaul.edu/contents/current/syllabi/HC_314.doc |archivedate=7 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World War II]] brought a definitive reversal of this trend in western Europe. The [[democratisation]] of the [[Allied Control Council|American, British, and French sectors of occupied Germany]] (disputed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?a=599 |title=Did the United States Create Democracy in Germany?: The Independent Review: The Independent Institute |publisher=Independent.org |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Austria, Italy, and the [[occupied Japan]] served as a model for the later theory of [[government change]]. However, most of [[Eastern Europe]], including the [[German Democratic Republic|Soviet sector of Germany]] fell into the non-democratic [[Soviet bloc]].

The war was followed by [[decolonisation]], and again most of the new independent states had nominally democratic constitutions. India emerged as the world's largest democracy and continues to be so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/country_profiles/1154019.stm |title=World &amp;#124; South Asia &amp;#124; Country profiles &amp;#124; Country profile: India |work=BBC News |date=7 June 2010 |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countries that were once part of the [[British Empire]] often adopted the British [[Westminster system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Arjomand|editor1-first=Saïd Amir|title=Constitutionalism and political reconstruction|date=2007|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-15174-1|pages=92–94|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=kYmmnYKEvE0C&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;pg=PA94#v=onepage|author1=Julian Go|chapter=A Globalizing Constitutionalism?, Views from the Postcolony, 1945–2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the Westminster Parliamentary System was exported around the World|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/features/how-the-westminster-parliamentary-system-was-exported-around-the-world|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=16 December 2013|date=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1960, the vast majority of country-states were nominally democracies, although most of the world's populations lived in nations that experienced sham elections, and other forms of subterfuge (particularly in [[Communist state|&quot;Communist&quot; nations]] and the former colonies.)

A subsequent wave of [[democratisation]] brought substantial gains toward true liberal democracy for many nations. [[Spanish democratic transition|Spain]], [[Portuguese transition to democracy|Portugal]] (1974), and several of the military dictatorships in South America returned to civilian rule in the late 1970s and early 1980s ([[Argentine transition to democracy|Argentina in 1983]], [[History of Bolivia|Bolivia]], [[History of Uruguay|Uruguay in 1984]], [[History of Brazil (1985–present)|Brazil in 1985]], and [[Chilean transition to democracy|Chile in the early 1990s]]). This was followed by nations in [[East Asia|East]] and [[South Asia]] by the mid-to-late 1980s.

Economic malaise in the 1980s, along with resentment of Soviet oppression, contributed to the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|collapse of the Soviet Union]], the associated end of the [[Cold War]], and the democratisation and [[liberalisation]] of the former [[Eastern bloc]] countries. The most successful of the new democracies were those geographically and culturally closest to western Europe, and they are now members or candidate members of the [[European Union]]. In 1986, after the toppling of the most prominent Asian dictatorship, the only democratic state of its kind at the time emerged in the [[Philippines]] with the rise of [[Corazon Aquino]], who would later be known as the Mother of Asian Democracy.

[[File:Corazon Aquino inauguration.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|[[Corazon Aquino]] taking the Oath of Office, becoming the first female president in Asia]]

The liberal trend spread to some nations in Africa in the 1990s, most prominently in South Africa. Some recent examples of attempts of liberalisation include the [[Indonesian Revolution of 1998]], the [[Overthrow of Slobodan Milošević|Bulldozer Revolution]] in [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], the [[Rose Revolution]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the [[Orange Revolution]] in Ukraine, the [[Cedar Revolution]] in Lebanon, the [[Tulip Revolution]] in [[Kyrgyzstan]], and the [[2010–2011 Tunisian revolution|Jasmine Revolution]] in [[Tunisia]].

According to [[Freedom House]], in 2007 there were 123 electoral democracies (up from 40 in 1972).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=368&amp;year=2007 |title=Tables and Charts |publisher=Freedomhouse.org |date=10 May 2004 |accessdate=22 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090713213025/http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=368&amp;year=2007 |archivedate=13 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''World Forum on Democracy'', electoral democracies now represent 120 of the 192 existing countries and constitute 58.2 percent of the world's population. At the same time liberal democracies i.e. countries Freedom House regards as free and respectful of basic human rights and the rule of law are 85 in number and represent 38 percent of the global population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordemocracy.net/electoral.shtml List of Electoral Democracies] fordemocracy.net {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most electoral democracies continue to exclude those younger than 18 from voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wall|first=John|date=October 2014|title=Democratising democracy: the road from women's to children's suffrage|url=https://johnwall.camden.rutgers.edu/files/2014/10/Democratising-Democracy-The-Road-from-Womens-to-Childrens-Suffrage1.pdf|journal=The International Journal of Human Rights|volume=18:6|pages=646–59|via=Rutgers University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voting age has been lowered to 16 for national elections in a number of countries, including Brazil, Austria, Cuba, and Nicaragua. In California, a 2004 proposal to permit a quarter vote at 14 and a half vote at 16 was ultimately defeated. In 2008, the German parliament proposed but shelved a bill that would grant the vote to each citizen at birth, to be used by a parent until the child claims it for themselves.

In 2007 the [[United Nations]] declared 15 September the [[International Day of Democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/ga10655.doc.htm |title=General Assembly declares 15 September International Day of Democracy; Also elects 18 Members to Economic and Social Council |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Freedom House, starting in 2005, there have been eleven consecutive years in which declines in political rights and civil liberties throughout the world have outnumbered improvements,&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2017|title=Freedom in the Word 2017|last=|first=|date=2016|website=freedomhouse.org|language=en|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Populism|populist]] and [[Nationalism|nationalist]] political forces have gained ground everywhere from Poland (under the [[Law and Justice|Law and Justice Party]]) to the Philippines (under [[Rodrigo Duterte]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

Dieter Fuchs and Edeltraud Roller suggest that, in order to truly measure the quality of democracy, objective measurements need to be complemented by &quot;subjective measurements based on the perspective of citizens&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fuchs |first1=Dieter |last2=Roller |first2=Edeltraud |title=Conceptualizing and Measuring the Quality of Democracy: The Citizens' Perspective |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=1 |page=22 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i1.1188 |year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Quinton Mayne and Brigitte Geißel also defend that the quality of democracy does not depend exclusively on the performance of institutions, but also on the citizens' own dispositions and commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mayne |first1=Quinton |last2=Geißel |first2=Brigitte |title=Don't Good Democracies Need &quot;Good&quot; Citizens?

===Difficulties in measuring democracy===
Because democracy is an overarching concept that includes the functioning of diverse institutions which are not easy to measure, strong limitations exist in quantifying and econometrically measuring the potential effects of democracy or its relationship with other phenomena—whether inequality, poverty, education etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;Journal of Economic Methodology&quot;&gt;Alexander Krauss, 2016. [http://personal.lse.ac.uk/kraussa/The%20scientific%20limits%20of%20understanding%20the%20%28potential%29%20relationship%20between%20complex%20social%20phenomena%20--%20the%20case%20of%20democracy%20and%20inequality.pdf ''The scientific limits of understanding the (potential) relationship between complex social phenomena: the case of democracy and inequality'']. Vol. 23(1).  [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1350178X.2015.1069372 Journal of Economic Methodology.]&lt;/ref&gt; Given the constraints in acquiring reliable data with within-country variation on aspects of democracy, academics have largely studied cross-country variations. Yet variations between democratic institutions are very large across countries which constrains meaningful comparisons using statistical approaches. Since democracy is typically measured aggregately as a macro variable using a single observation for each country and each year, studying democracy faces a range of econometric constraints and is limited to basic correlations. Cross-country comparison of a composite, comprehensive and qualitative concept like democracy may thus not always be, for many purposes, methodologically rigorous or useful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Journal of Economic Methodology&quot;/&gt;

==Types of governmental democracies==
{{main|Types of democracy}}

Democracy has taken a number of forms, both in theory and practice. Some varieties of democracy provide better representation and more freedom for their citizens than others.&lt;ref&gt;G.F. Gaus, C. Kukathas, ''Handbook of Political Theory'', SAGE, 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;143–45, {{ISBN|0-7619-6787-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RGisaLxA6eMC Google Books link]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Judge in a Democracy'', Princeton University Press, 2006, p. 26, {{ISBN|0-691-12017-X}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3HX7mAbjGOYC Google Books link]&lt;/ref&gt; However, if any democracy is not structured to prohibit the government from excluding the people from the legislative process, or any branch of government from altering the [[separation of powers]] in its favour, then a branch of the system can accumulate too much power and destroy the democracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barak40&quot;&gt;A.

]]

The following kinds of democracy are not exclusive of one another: many specify details of aspects that are independent of one another and can co-exist in a single system.

===Basic forms===
Several variants of democracy exist, but there are two basic forms, both of which concern how the whole body of all eligible citizens executes its will. One form of democracy is [[direct democracy]], in which all eligible citizens have active participation in the political decision making, for example voting on policy initiatives directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Budge, Ian|chapter=Direct democracy|editor=Clarke, Paul A.B. |editor2=Foweraker, Joe|title=Encyclopedia of Political Thought|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2001|isbn=978-0-415-19396-2|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=srzDCqnZkfUC&amp;pg=PA224}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most modern democracies, the whole body of eligible citizens remain the sovereign power but political power is exercised indirectly through elected representatives; this is called a [[representative democracy]].

====Direct====
[[File:Landsgemeinde Glarus, 2009.jpg|thumb|A [[Landsgemeinde]] (in 2009) of the [[canton of Glarus]], an example of direct democracy in [[Switzerland]]]]
[[File:Swiss voting material.jpg|thumb|In [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]], without needing to register, every citizen receives [[ballot papers]] and information brochures for each vote (and can send it back by post). Switzerland has a [[direct democracy]] system and votes (and elections) are organised about four times a year; here, to [[Bern#Politics|Berne]]'s citizen in November 2008 about 5 national, 2 cantonal, 4 municipal referendums, and 2 elections (government and parliament of the City of Berne) to take care of at the same time.]]
{{Main|Direct democracy}}

Direct democracy is a political system where the citizens participate in the decision-making personally, contrary to relying on intermediaries or representatives. The use of a lot system, a characteristic of [[Athenian democracy]], is unique to direct democracies. In this system, important governmental and administrative tasks are performed by citizens picked from a lottery.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Manin. Principles of Representative Government. pp. 8–11 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; A direct democracy gives the voting population the power to:

# Change constitutional laws,
# Put forth [[initiative]]s, [[referendum]]s and suggestions for laws,
# Give binding orders to elective officials, such as revoking them before the end of their elected term or initiating a lawsuit for breaking a campaign promise.

Within modern-day representative governments, certain electoral tools like referendums, citizens' initiatives and [[recall election]]s are referred to as forms of direct democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Beramendi, Virginia, and Jennifer Somalie. Angeyo. ''Direct Democracy: The International Idea Handbook''. Stockholm, Sweden: International IDEA, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some advocates of direct democracy argue for local assemblies of face-to-face discussion. Direct democracy as a government system currently exists in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] of [[Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden|Appenzell Innerrhoden]] and [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]],&lt;ref name=Golay/&gt; the [[Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities]],&lt;ref&gt;Niels Barmeyer, ''Developing Zapatista Autonomy'', Chapter Three: Who is Running the Show? The Workings of Zapatista Government.&lt;/ref&gt; communities affiliated with the [[CIPO-RFM]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teaching Rebellion: Stories from the Grassroots Mobilization in Oaxaca|last=Denham|first=Diana|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bolivia]]n city councils of [[Fejuve|FEJUVE]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dispersing Power: Social Movements as Anti-State Forces in Latin America|last=Zibechi|first=Raul|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kurdish cantons of [[Rojava]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rudaw.net/english/opinion/29012015|title=A Very Different Ideology in the Middle East|publisher=Rudaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Representative====
{{Main|Representative democracy}}
Representative democracy involves the election of government officials by the people being represented. If the head of state is also [[Democratically-elected government|democratically elected]] then it is called a democratic [[republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/REV/RADICAL.HTM |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990203212816/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/REV/RADICAL.HTM |archivedate=3 February 1999 |title=Radical Revolution – The Thermidorean Reaction |publisher=Wsu.edu |date=6 June 1999 |accessdate=22 August 2010 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common mechanisms involve election of the candidate with a majority or a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the votes. Most western countries have representative systems.&lt;ref name=Golay/&gt;

Representatives may be elected or become diplomatic representatives by a particular district (or [[constituency]]), or represent the entire electorate through [[Proportional representation|proportional]] systems, with some using a combination of the two. Some representative democracies also incorporate elements of direct democracy, such as [[referendum]]s. A characteristic of representative democracy is that while the representatives are elected by the people to act in the people's interest, they retain the freedom to exercise their own judgement as how best to do so. Such reasons have driven criticism upon representative democracy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Köchler | first = Hans | title = The Crisis of Representative Democracy | publisher = Frankfurt/M., Bern, New York | isbn = 978-3-8204-8843-2 | year = 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Urbinati | first = Nadia | title  = Representative Democracy: Principles and Genealogy | isbn = 978-0-226-84279-0 | date = 1 October 2008 | chapter = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out the contradictions of representation mechanisms with democracy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Fenichel Pitkin | first = Hanna | title = Representation and democracy: uneasy alliance | journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 335–42 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9477.2004.00109.x | date = September 2004 | ref = harv | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f2ef1c003b0810e621950e7f57dcc7f2469b201e }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Aristotle | title = Politics | volume = Book 4| chapter = Ch. 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Parliamentary=====
{{Main|Parliamentary system}}
Parliamentary democracy is a representative democracy where government is appointed by, or can be dismissed by, representatives as opposed to a &quot;presidential rule&quot; wherein the president is both head of state and the head of government and is elected by the voters. Under a parliamentary democracy, government is exercised by delegation to an executive ministry and subject to ongoing review, checks and balances by the legislative parliament elected by the people.&lt;ref&gt;Keen, Benjamin, A History of Latin America. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuykendall, Ralph, Hawaii: A History. New York: Prentice Hall, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Charles H., The Correspondents' War. New York: Charles Scribners' Sons, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taussig, Capt. J.K., &quot;Experiences during the Boxer Rebellion,&quot; in Quarterdeck and Fo'c'sle. Chicago: Rand McNally &amp; Company, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

Parliamentary systems have the right to dismiss a Prime Minister at any point in time that they feel he or she is not doing their job to the expectations of the legislature. This is done through a Vote of No Confidence where the legislature decides whether or not to remove the Prime Minister from office by a majority support for his or her dismissal.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Neil, Patrick H 2010&quot;&gt;O'Neil, Patrick H. Essentials of Comparative Politics. 3rd ed. New York: W.W. Norton 2010. Print&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, the Prime Minister can also call an election whenever he or she so chooses, and typically the Prime Minister will hold an election when he or she knows that they are in good favour with the public as to get re-elected. In other parliamentary democracies, extra elections are virtually never held, a minority government being preferred until the next ordinary elections. An important feature of the parliamentary democracy is the concept of the &quot;loyal opposition&quot;. The essence of the concept is that the second largest political party (or coalition) opposes the governing party (or coalition), while still remaining loyal to the state and its democratic principles.

=====Presidential=====
{{Main|Presidential system}}
Presidential Democracy is a system where the public elects the president through free and fair elections. The president serves as both the head of state and head of government controlling most of the executive powers. The president serves for a specific term and cannot exceed that amount of time. Elections typically have a fixed date and aren't easily changed. The president has direct control over the cabinet, specifically appointing the cabinet members.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Neil, Patrick H 2010&quot;/&gt;

The president cannot be easily removed from office by the legislature, but he or she cannot remove members of the legislative branch any more easily. This provides some measure of [[separation of powers]]. In consequence, however, the president and the legislature may end up in the control of separate parties, allowing one to block the other and thereby interfere with the orderly operation of the state. This may be the reason why presidential democracy is not very common outside the Americas, Africa, and Central and Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Neil, Patrick H 2010&quot;/&gt;

A [[semi-presidential system]] is a system of democracy in which the government includes both a prime minister and a president. The particular powers held by the prime minister and president vary by country.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Neil, Patrick H 2010&quot;/&gt;

====Hybrid or semi-direct====
{{See also|Politics of Switzerland|Voting in Switzerland}}
Some modern democracies that are predominantly representative in nature also heavily rely upon forms of political action that are directly democratic. These democracies, which combine elements of representative democracy and direct democracy, are termed ''hybrid democracies'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Garret, Elizabeth |url=http://clhc.usc.edu/centres/cslp/assets/docs/cslp-wp-048.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171009224922/http://clhc.usc.edu/centres/cslp/assets/docs/cslp-wp-048.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 October 2017 |title=The Promise and Perils of Hybrid Democracy |publisher=The Henry Lecture, University of Oklahoma Law School |date=13 October 2005 |accessdate=7 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''semi-direct democracies'' or ''participatory democracies''. Examples include Switzerland and some [[U.S. state]]s, where frequent use is made of [[referendum]]s and [[initiatives]].

The [[Swiss confederation]] is a semi-direct democracy.&lt;ref name=Golay/&gt; At the federal level, citizens can propose changes to the constitution ([[federal popular initiative]]) or ask for a [[Optional referendum|referendum]] to be held on any law voted by the [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|parliament]].&lt;ref name=Golay&gt;Vincent Golay and Mix et Remix, ''Swiss political institutions'', Éditions loisirs et pédagogie, 2008. {{ISBN|978-2-606-01295-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Between January 1995 and June 2005, Swiss citizens voted 31 times, to answer 103 questions (during the same period, French citizens participated in only two referendums).&lt;ref name=Golay/&gt; Although in the past 120 years less than 250 initiatives have been put to referendum. The populace has been conservative, approving only about 10% of the initiatives put before them; in addition, they have often opted for a version of the initiative rewritten by government.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

In the [[United States]], no mechanisms of direct democracy exists at the federal level, but over half of the [[U.S. state|states]] and many localities provide for citizen-sponsored ballot initiatives (also called &quot;ballot measures&quot;, &quot;ballot questions&quot; or &quot;propositions&quot;), and the vast majority of states allow for referendums. Examples include the extensive use of [[referendum]]s in the US state of [[California]], which is a state that has more than 20 million voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themercury.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3985561 |title=Article on direct democracy by Imraan Buccus |publisher=Themercury.co.za |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117121519/http://www.themercury.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3985561 |archivedate=17 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[New England]], [[Town meeting]]s are often used, especially in rural areas, to manage local government. This creates a hybrid form of government, with a local [[direct democracy]] and a representative state government. For example, most [[Vermont]] towns hold annual town meetings in March in which town officers are elected, budgets for the town and schools are voted on, and citizens have the opportunity to speak and be heard on political matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sec.state.vt.us/townmeeting/citizens_guide.html |title=A Citizen's Guide To Vermont Town Meeting |date=July 2008 |accessdate=12 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805023214/http://www.sec.state.vt.us/TownMeeting/citizens_guide.html |archivedate=5 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variants===

====Constitutional monarchy====
{{main|Constitutional monarchy}}
[[File:Elizabeth II greets NASA GSFC employees, May 8, 2007 edit.jpg|thumb|upright|Queen [[Elizabeth II]], a constitutional monarch]]

Many countries such as the United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian countries]], [[Thailand]], [[Japan]] and [[Bhutan]] turned powerful monarchs into constitutional monarchs with limited or, often gradually, merely symbolic roles. For example, in the predecessor states to the United Kingdom, constitutional monarchy began to emerge and has continued uninterrupted since the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 and passage of the [[Bill of Rights 1689]].&lt;ref name= Kopstein2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=refNARoP /&gt;

In other countries, the monarchy was abolished along with the aristocratic system (as in France, China, Russia, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Italy, Greece and Egypt). An elected president, with or without significant powers, became the head of state in these countries.

Elite upper houses of legislatures, which often had lifetime or hereditary tenure, were common in many nations. Over time, these either had their powers limited (as with the British [[House of Lords]]) or else became elective and remained powerful (as with the [[Australian Senate]]).

====Republic====
{{Main|Republicanism}}
The term ''[[republic]]'' has many different meanings, but today often refers to a representative democracy with an elected [[head of state]], such as a [[President (government title)|president]], serving for a limited term, in contrast to states with a hereditary [[monarch]] as a head of state, even if these states also are representative democracies with an elected or appointed [[head of government]] such as a [[Prime Minister|prime minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/republic |title=Republic – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=M-W.com |date=25 April 2007 |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] rarely praised and often criticised democracy, which in their time tended to specifically mean direct democracy, often without the protection of a constitution enshrining basic rights; [[James Madison]] argued, especially in [[Federalist No. 10|''The Federalist'' No. 10]], that what distinguished a direct ''democracy'' from a ''republic'' was that the former became weaker as it got larger and suffered more violently from the effects of faction, whereas a republic could get stronger as it got larger and combats faction by its very structure.

What was critical to American values, [[John Adams]] insisted,&lt;ref&gt;Novanglus, no. 7. 6 March 1775&lt;/ref&gt; was that the government be &quot;bound by fixed laws, which the people have a voice in making, and a right to defend.&quot; As Benjamin Franklin was exiting after writing the U.S. constitution, a woman asked him &quot;Well, Doctor, what have we got—a republic or a monarchy?&quot;. He replied &quot;A republic—if you can keep it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch18I.html |title=''The Founders' Constitution: Volume 1, Chapter 18, Introduction'', &quot;Epilogue: Securing the Republic&quot; |publisher=Press-pubs.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Liberal democracy====
{{main|Liberal democracy}}
A liberal democracy is a representative democracy in which the ability of the elected representatives to exercise decision-making power is subject to the [[rule of law]], and moderated by a constitution or laws that emphasise the protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals, and which places constraints on the leaders and on the extent to which the will of the majority can be exercised against the rights of minorities (see [[civil liberties]]).

In a liberal democracy, it is possible for some large-scale decisions to [[Emergent democracy|emerge]] from the many individual decisions that citizens are free to make. In other words, citizens can &quot;vote with their feet&quot; or &quot;vote with their dollars&quot;, resulting in significant informal government-by-the-masses that exercises many &quot;powers&quot; associated with formal government elsewhere.

====Socialist====
{{See also|Democracy in Marxism}}

[[Socialism|Socialist]] thought has several different views on democracy. [[Social democracy]], [[democratic socialism]], and the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] (usually exercised through [[Soviet democracy]]) are some examples. Many democratic socialists and social democrats believe in a form of [[participatory democracy|participatory]], [[industrial democracy|industrial]], [[economic democracy|economic]] and/or [[workplace democracy]] combined with a [[representative democracy]].

Within [[Democracy in Marxist theory|Marxist orthodoxy]] there is a hostility to what is commonly called &quot;liberal democracy&quot;, which is simply referred to as parliamentary democracy because of its often centralised nature. Because of orthodox Marxists' desire to eliminate the political elitism they see in capitalism, [[Marxism|Marxists]], [[Leninism|Leninists]] and [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] believe in direct democracy implemented through a system of [[commune (Socialism)|communes]] (which are sometimes called [[Soviet (council)|soviets]]). This system ultimately manifests itself as council democracy and begins with workplace democracy.

{{quote|Democracy cannot consist solely of elections that are nearly always fictitious and managed by rich landowners and professional politicians.|[[Che Guevara]]|Speech, Uruguay, 1961&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1961/08/08.htm &quot;Economics Cannot be Separated from Politics&quot;] speech by Che Guevara to the ministerial meeting of the Inter-American Economic and Social Council (CIES), in Punta del Este, Uruguay on August 8, 1961&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Anarchist====
[[Anarchism|Anarchists]] are split in this domain, depending on whether they believe that a [[Tyranny of the majority|majority-rule is tyrannic or not]].  To many anarchists, the only form of democracy considered acceptable is direct democracy. [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] argued that the only acceptable form of direct democracy is one in which it is recognised that majority decisions are not binding on the minority, even when unanimous.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. ''General Idea of the Revolution'' See also commentary by [[Robert Graham (historian)|Graham, Robert]]. [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/ANARCHIST_ARCHIVES/proudhon/grahamproudhon.html ''The General Idea of Proudhon's Revolution'']&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[anarcho-communist]] [[Murray Bookchin]] criticised [[individualist anarchists]] for opposing democracy,&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray. Communalism: The Democratic Dimensions of Social Anarchism. Anarchism, Marxism and the Future of the Left: Interviews and Essays, 1993–1998, AK Press 1999, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; and says &quot;majority rule&quot; is consistent with anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray. [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bookchin/soclife.html Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some anarcho-communists oppose the majoritarian nature of direct democracy, feeling that it can impede individual liberty and opt-in favour of a non-majoritarian form of [[consensus democracy]], similar to Proudhon's position on direct democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Graeber, David and Grubacic, Andrej. ''Anarchism, Or The Revolutionary Movement Of The Twenty-first Century''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry David Thoreau]], who did not self-identify as an anarchist but argued for &quot;a better government&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;disobedience&quot;&gt;Thoreau, H.D. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/71/71.txt On the Duty of Civil Disobedience]''&lt;/ref&gt; and is cited as an inspiration by some anarchists, argued that people should not be in the position of ruling others or being ruled when there is no consent.

====Sortition====
{{Main|Sortition}}
Sometimes called &quot;democracy without elections&quot;, [[sortition]] chooses decision makers via a random process. The intention is that those chosen will be representative of the opinions and interests of the people at large, and be more fair and impartial than an elected official. The technique was in widespread use in [[Athenian Democracy]] and [[Republic of Florence|Renaissance Florence]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Imprint Academic&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dowlen|first1=Oliver|title=The Political Potential of Sortition: A study of the random selection of citizens for public office|date=2008|publisher=Imprint Academic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is still used in modern [[jury selection]].

====Consociational====
{{Main|Consociational democracy}}
A consociational democracy allows for simultaneous majority votes in two or more ethno-religious constituencies, and policies are enacted only if they gain majority support from both or all of them.

====Consensus democracy====
{{Main| Consensus democracy}}
A consensus democracy, in contrast, would not be dichotomous. Instead, decisions would be based on a multi-option approach, and policies would be enacted if they gained sufficient support, either in a purely verbal agreement or via a consensus vote—a multi-option preference vote. If the threshold of support were at a sufficiently high level, minorities would be as it were protected automatically. Furthermore, any voting would be ethno-colour blind.

====Supranational====
[[Qualified majority voting]] is designed by the [[Treaty of Rome]] to be the principal method of reaching decisions in the [[European Council of Ministers]]. This system allocates votes to member states in part according to their population, but heavily weighted in favour of the smaller states. This might be seen as a form of representative democracy, but representatives to the Council might be appointed rather than directly elected.

====Inclusive====
{{Youth rights sidebar}}
{{Main|Inclusive democracy}}
Inclusive democracy is a political theory and political project that aims for [[direct democracy]] in all fields of social life: political democracy in the form of face-to-face assemblies which are confederated, [[economic democracy]] in a [[Stateless society|stateless]], moneyless and marketless economy, democracy in the social realm, i.e. [[Workers' self-management|self-management]] in places of work and education, and ecological democracy which aims to reintegrate society and nature. The theoretical project of inclusive democracy emerged from the work of political philosopher [[Takis Fotopoulos]] in &quot;Towards An Inclusive Democracy&quot; and was further developed in the journal ''[[Democracy &amp; Nature]]'' and its successor ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy''.

The basic unit of decision making in an inclusive democracy is the demotic assembly, i.e. the assembly of demos, the citizen body in a given geographical area which may encompass a town and the surrounding villages, or even neighbourhoods of large cities. An inclusive democracy today can only take the form of a confederal democracy that is based on a network of administrative councils whose members or delegates are elected from popular face-to-face democratic assemblies in the various demoi. Thus, their role is purely administrative and practical, not one of policy-making like that of representatives in representative democracy.

The citizen body is advised by experts but it is the citizen body which functions as the ultimate decision-taker. Authority can be delegated to a segment of the citizen body to carry out specific duties, for example, to serve as members of popular courts, or of regional and confederal councils. Such delegation is made, in principle, by lot, on a rotation basis, and is always recallable by the citizen body. Delegates to regional and confederal bodies should have specific mandates.

====Participatory politics====
{{Main|Participatory politics}}
A [[Parpolity]] or Participatory Polity is a theoretical form of democracy that is ruled by a [[Parpolity|Nested Council]] structure. The guiding philosophy is that people should have decision making power in proportion to how much they are affected by the decision. Local councils of 25–50 people are completely autonomous on issues that affect only them, and these councils send delegates to higher level councils who are again autonomous regarding issues that affect only the population affected by that council.

A council court of randomly chosen citizens serves as a check on the [[tyranny of the majority]], and rules on which body gets to vote on which issue. Delegates may vote differently from how their sending council might wish but are mandated to communicate the wishes of their sending council. Delegates are recallable at any time. Referendums are possible at any time via votes of most lower-level councils, however, not everything is a referendum as this is most likely a waste of time. A parpolity is meant to work in tandem with a [[participatory economy]].

====Cosmopolitan====
{{Main|Cosmopolitan democracy}}
Cosmopolitan democracy, also known as ''Global democracy'' or ''World Federalism'', is a political system in which democracy is implemented on a global scale, either directly or through representatives. An important justification for this kind of system is that the decisions made in national or regional democracies often affect people outside the constituency who, by definition, cannot vote. By contrast, in a cosmopolitan democracy, the people who are affected by decisions also have a say in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danielearchibugi.org/downloads/papers/CD_and_critics_A_review.pdf |title=Article on Cosmopolitan democracy by Daniele Archibugi |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725220629/http://www.danielearchibugi.org/downloads/papers/CD_and_critics_A_review.pdf |archivedate=25 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its supporters, any attempt to solve global problems is undemocratic without some form of cosmopolitan democracy. The general principle of cosmopolitan democracy is to expand some or all of the values and norms of democracy, including the rule of law; the non-violent resolution of conflicts; and equality among citizens, beyond the limits of the state. To be fully implemented, this would require reforming existing [[international organisations]], e.g. the [[United Nations]], as well as the creation of new institutions such as a [[World Parliament]], which ideally would enhance public control over, and accountability in, international politics.

Cosmopolitan Democracy has been promoted, among others, by physicist Albert Einstein,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neutrino.aquaphoenix.com/un-esa/ws1997-letter-einstein.html |title=letter by Einstein – &quot;To the General Assembly of the United Nations&quot; |accessdate=2 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510174259/http://neutrino.aquaphoenix.com/un-esa/ws1997-letter-einstein.html |archive-date=10 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}, first published in United Nations World New York, Oct 1947, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; writer Kurt Vonnegut, columnist [[George Monbiot]], and professors [[David Held]] and [[Daniele Archibugi]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniele Archibugi &amp; David Held, eds., ''Cosmopolitan Democracy. An Agenda for a New World Order'', Polity Press, Cambridge, 1995; David Held, ''Democracy and the Global Order'', Polity Press, Cambridge, 1995, Daniele Archibugi, [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8737.html ''The Global Commonwealth of Citizens. Toward Cosmopolitan Democracy''], Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the [[International Criminal Court]] in 2003 was seen as a major step forward by many supporters of this type of cosmopolitan democracy.

====Creative democracy====
{{Main|Creative democracy}}
Creative Democracy is advocated by American philosopher [[John Dewey]]. The main idea about Creative Democracy is that democracy encourages individual capacity building and the interaction among the society. Dewey argues that democracy is a way of life in his work of &quot;Creative Democracy: The Task Before Us&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://pages.uoregon.edu/koopman/courses_readings/dewey/dewey_creative_democracy.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212175652/http://pages.uoregon.edu/koopman/courses_readings/dewey/dewey_creative_democracy.pdf |archive-date=12 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an experience built on faith in human nature, faith in human beings, and faith in working with others. Democracy, in Dewey's view, is a [[Morality|moral ideal]] requiring actual effort and work by people; it is not an institutional concept that exists outside of ourselves. &quot;The task of democracy&quot;, Dewey concludes, &quot;is forever that of creation of a freer and more humane experience in which all share and to which all contribute&quot;.

====Guided democracy====
{{Main|Guided democracy}}
Guided democracy is a form of democracy which incorporates regular popular elections, but which often carefully &quot;guides&quot; the choices offered to the electorate in a manner which may reduce the ability of the electorate to truly determine the type of government exercised over them.  Such democracies typically have only one central authority which is often not subject to meaningful public review by any other governmental authority.  Russian-style democracy has often been referred to as a &quot;Guided democracy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/17149/pdf Ten Years After the Soviet Breakup: From Democratization to &quot;Guided Democracy&quot;] Journal of Democracy. By Archie Brown. Oct. 2001. Downloaded 28 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Russian politicians have referred to their government as having only one center of power/ authority, as opposed to most other forms of democracy which usually attempt to incorporate two or more naturally competing sources of authority within the same government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russialist.org/archives/2009-35-32.php Putin’s Rule: Its Main Features and the Current Diarchy] Johnson's Russia List.

==Non-governmental democracy==
Aside from the public sphere, similar democratic principles and mechanisms of voting and representation have been used to govern other kinds of groups. Many [[non-governmental organisation]]s decide policy and leadership by voting. Most [[trade union]]s and [[cooperative]]s are governed by democratic elections. [[Corporation]]s are controlled by [[shareholder]]s on the principle of [[one share, one vote]]—sometimes supplemented by [[workplace democracy]]. [[Amitai Etzioni]] has postulated a system that fuses elements of democracy with [[sharia law]], termed ''islamocracy''.&lt;ref&gt;

==Theory&lt;!--'Democratic theory' redirects here--&gt;==
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|upright|A marble statue of [[Aristotle]]]]

===Aristotle===
[[Aristotle]] contrasted rule by the many (democracy/[[timocracy]]), with rule by the few ([[oligarchy]]/[[aristocracy]]), and with rule by a single person ([[tyranny]] or today [[autocracy]]/[[absolute monarchy]]). He also thought that there was a good and a bad variant of each system (he considered democracy to be the degenerate counterpart to timocracy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.8.viii.html |title=Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Book VIII, Chapter 10 (1160a.31-1161a.9) |publisher=Internet Classics Archive |date= |accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/aristotl.htm|title=Aristotle |encyclopedia= Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Aristotle, the underlying principle of democracy is freedom, since only in a democracy can the citizens have a share in freedom. In essence, he argues that this is what every democracy should make its aim. There are two main aspects of freedom: being ruled and ruling in turn, since everyone is equal according to number, not merit, and to be able to live as one pleases.

{{quote|But one factor of liberty is to govern and be governed in turn; for the popular principle of justice is to have equality according to number, not worth,&amp;nbsp;... And one is for a man to live as he likes; for they say that this is the function of liberty, inasmuch as to live not as one likes is the life of a man that is a slave.|[[Aristotle]]|''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' 1317b (Book 6, Part II)}}

===Early Republican theory===
A common view among early and renaissance [[Republicanism|Republican]] theorists was that democracy could only survive in small political communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8304.html|title=Deudney, D.: Bounding Power: Republican Security Theory from the Polis to the Global Village. (eBook and Paperback)|website=press.princeton.edu|access-date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heeding the lessons of the Roman Republic's shift to monarchism as it grew larger, these Republican theorists held that the expansion of territory and population inevitably led to tyranny.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Democracy was therefore highly fragile and rare historically, as it could only survive in small political units, which due to their size were vulnerable to conquest by larger political units.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; [[Montesquieu]] famously said, &quot;if a republic is small, it is destroyed by an outside force; if it is large, it is destroyed by an internal vice.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] asserted, &quot;It is, therefore the natural property of small states to be governed as a republic, of middling ones to be subject to a monarch, and of large empires to be swayed by a despotic prince.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

===Rationale===
Among modern political theorists, there are three contending conceptions of the fundamental rationale for democracy: ''aggregative democracy'', ''[[deliberative democracy]]'', and ''[[radical democracy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/354048|last1=Springer|first1=Simon|title=Public Space as Emancipation: Meditations on Anarchism, Radical Democracy, Neoliberalism and Violence|journal=Antipode|volume=43|issue=2|year=2011|pages=525–62|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8330.2010.00827.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aggregative====
The theory of ''aggregative democracy'' claims that the aim of the democratic processes is to solicit citizens' preferences and aggregate them together to determine what social policies society should adopt. Therefore, proponents of this view hold that democratic participation should primarily focus on [[voting]], where the policy with the most votes gets implemented.

Different variants of aggregative democracy exist. Under ''minimalism'', democracy is a system of government in which citizens have given teams of political leaders the right to rule in periodic elections. According to this minimalist conception, citizens cannot and should not &quot;rule&quot; because, for example, on most issues, most of the time, they have no clear views or their views are not well-founded. [[Joseph Schumpeter]] articulated this view most famously in his book ''Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Schumpeter]], (1950). ''Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy''. Harper Perennial. {{ISBN|0-06-133008-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary proponents of minimalism include [[William H. Riker]], [[Adam Przeworski]], [[Richard Posner]].

According to the theory of [[direct democracy]], on the other hand, citizens should vote directly, not through their representatives, on legislative proposals. Proponents of direct democracy offer varied reasons to support this view. Political activity can be valuable in itself, it socialises and educates citizens, and popular participation can check powerful elites. Most importantly, citizens do not rule themselves unless they directly decide laws and policies.

Governments will tend to produce laws and policies that are close to the views of the median voter—with half to their left and the other half to their right. This is not a desirable outcome as it represents the action of self-interested and somewhat unaccountable political elites competing for votes. [[Anthony Downs]] suggests that ideological political parties are necessary to act as a mediating broker between individual and governments. Downs laid out this view in his 1957 book ''An Economic Theory of Democracy''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Downs]], (1957). ''An Economic Theory of Democracy''. Harper Collins College. {{ISBN|0-06-041750-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert A. Dahl]] argues that the fundamental democratic principle is that, when it comes to binding collective decisions, each person in a political community is entitled to have his/her interests be given equal consideration (not necessarily that all people are equally satisfied by the collective decision). He uses the term [[polyarchy]] to refer to societies in which there exists a certain set of institutions and procedures which are perceived as leading to such democracy. First and foremost among these institutions is the regular occurrence of free and open [[elections]] which are used to select representatives who then manage all or most of the public policy of the society. However, these polyarchic procedures may not create a full democracy if, for example, poverty prevents political participation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert A. Dahl|Dahl, Robert]], (1989). ''Democracy and its Critics''. New Haven: Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-04938-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Ronald Dworkin]] argues that &quot;democracy is a substantive, not a merely procedural, ideal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Ronald (2006). ''Is Democracy Possible Here?'' Princeton: Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-691-13872-5}}, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deliberative====
''[[Deliberative democracy]]'' is based on the notion that democracy is government by [[deliberation]]. Unlike aggregative democracy, deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting. ''Authentic deliberation'' is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups.&lt;ref&gt;Gutmann, Amy, and Dennis Thompson (2002). ''Why Deliberative Democracy?'' Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-691-12019-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Cohen, &quot;Deliberation and Democratic Legitimacy&quot; in Essays on Reason and Politics: Deliberative Democracy Ed. James Bohman and William Rehg (The MIT Press: Cambridge) 1997,
72–73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ethan J. &quot;Can Direct Democracy Be Made Deliberative?&quot;, ''Buffalo Law Review'', Vol. 54, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; If the decision-makers cannot reach [[consensus]] after authentically deliberating on a proposal, then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule.

====Radical====
''[[Radical democracy]]'' is based on the idea that there are hierarchical and oppressive power relations that exist in society. Democracy's role is to make visible and challenge those relations by allowing for difference, dissent and antagonisms in decision-making processes.

==Criticism==
{{Main|Criticism of democracy}}
[[File:2011 Wisconsin Budget Protests 1 JO.jpg|thumb|Protests]]

===Inefficiencies===

Some economists have criticized the efficiency of democracy, citing the premise of the irrational voter, or a voter who makes decisions without all of the facts or necessary information in order to make a truly informed decision. Another argument is that democracy slows down processes because of the amount of input and participation needed in order to go forward with a decision. A common example often quoted to substantiate this point is the high economic development achieved by China (a non-democratic country) as compared to India (a democratic country). According to economists, the lack of democratic participation in countries like China allows for unfettered economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Democracy a Pre-Condition in Economic Growth? A Perspective from the Rise of Modern China|url=https://unchronicle.un.org/article/democracy-pre-condition-economic-growth-perspective-rise-modern-china|website=UN Chronicle|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Socrates]] believed that democracy without educated masses (educated in the more broader sense of being knowledgeable and responsible) would only lead to populism being the criteria to become an elected leader and not competence. This would ultimately lead to a demise of the nation. This was quoted by Plato in book 10 of The Republic, in Socrates' conversation with Adimantus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Republic&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conversation of Socrates|first1=Plato|last2=H|first2=Translated by Spens|title=The Republic of Plato – Book ten – A conversation between Socrates and Admimantus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates was of the opinion that the right to vote must not be an indiscriminate right (for example by birth or citizenship), but must be given only to people who thought sufficiently of their choice.

===Popular rule as a façade===

The 20th-century Italian thinkers [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and [[Gaetano Mosca]] (independently) argued that democracy was illusory, and served only to mask the reality of elite rule. Indeed, they argued that elite oligarchy is the unbendable law of human nature, due largely to the apathy and division of the masses (as opposed to the drive, initiative and unity of the elites), and that democratic institutions would do no more than shift the exercise of power from oppression to manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Against the masses : varieties of anti-democratic thought since the French Revolution|first=Joseph V.|last=Femia|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-828063-7|location=Oxford|oclc=46641885}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Louis Brandeis]] once professed, &quot;We may have democracy, or we may have [[wealth]] concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.&quot;{{clarify|date=March 2018}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mr. Justice Brandeis, great American;press opinion and public appraisal|last=Dilliard|first=Irving|date=1941|publisher=Saint Louis|isbn=|location=|pages=|hdl = 2027/mdp.39015009170443}}&lt;/ref&gt; British writer [[Ivo Mosley]], grandson of blackshirt [[Oswald Mosley]] describes in ''In the Name of the People: Pseudo-Democracy and the Spoiling of Our World'', how and why current forms of electoral governance are destined to fall short of their promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Publishers Weekly|title=Book Review, In the Name of the People|date=3 April 2013|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/9781845402624}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A study led by Princeton professor Martin Gilens of 1,779 U.S. government decisions concluded that
&quot;elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Testing theories of American politics: Elites, interest groups, and average citizens&quot;, M. Gilens and B. I. Page (2014), ''Perspectives on politics'' '''12''', 564-581, [https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B/S1537592714001595a.pdf/testing_theories_of_american_politics_elites_interest_groups_and_average_citizens.pdf]
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mob rule===

[[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' presents a critical view of democracy through the narration of [[Socrates]]: &quot;Democracy, which is a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder, and dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequaled alike.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''the Republic of Plato'' (London: J.M Dent &amp; Sons LTD.; New York: E.P. Dutton &amp; Co. Inc.), 558-C.&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, Plato lists [[Plato's five regimes|5 forms of government]] from best to worst. Assuming that ''the Republic'' was intended to be a serious critique of the political thought in Athens, Plato argues that only Kallipolis, an aristocracy led by the unwilling philosopher-kings (the wisest men), is a just form of government.&lt;ref&gt;The contrast between Plato's theory of philosopher-kings, arresting change, and Aristotle's embrace of change is the historical tension espoused by [[Karl Raimund Popper]] in his WWII treatise, ''The Open Society and its Enemies'' (1943).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Madison]] critiqued direct democracy (which he referred to simply as &quot;democracy&quot;) in [[Federalist No. 10]], arguing that representative democracy—which he described using the term &quot;republic&quot;—is a preferable form of government, saying: &quot;...&amp;nbsp;democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.&quot; Madison offered that republics were superior to democracies because republics safeguarded against [[tyranny of the majority]], stating in [[Federalist No. 10]]: &quot;the same advantage which a republic has over a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by a large over a small republic&quot;.

===Political instability===

More recently, democracy is criticised for not offering enough political stability. As governments are frequently elected on and off there tends to be frequent changes in the policies of democratic countries both domestically and internationally. Even if a political party maintains power, vociferous, headline-grabbing protests and harsh criticism from the popular media are often enough to force sudden, unexpected political change. Frequent policy changes with regard to business and immigration are likely to deter investment and so hinder economic growth. For this reason, many people have put forward the idea that democracy is undesirable for a developing country in which economic growth and the reduction of poverty are top priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7671283.stm | work=BBC News | title=Head to head: African democracy | date=16 October 2008 | accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This opportunist alliance not only has the handicap of having to cater to too many ideologically opposing factions, but it is usually short-lived since any perceived or actual imbalance in the treatment of coalition partners, or changes to leadership in the coalition partners themselves, can very easily result in the coalition partner withdrawing its support from the government.

Biased media has been accused of causing political instability, resulting in the obstruction of democracy, rather than its promotion.&lt;ref&gt;''The Review of Policy Research, Volume 22, Issues 1–3'', Policy Studies Organization, Potomac Institute for Policy Studies. Blackwell Publishing, 2005. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fraudulent elections===

In representative democracies, it may not benefit incumbents to conduct fair elections. A study showed that incumbents who rig elections stay in office 2.5 times as long as those who permit fair elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;wp091108&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/06/AR2009110601906.html |title=5 myths about the beauty of the ballot box |accessdate= |author=Paul Collier |authorlink=Paul Collier |date=8 November 2009 |work= Washington Post |publisher=Washington Post |page=B2 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Democracies in countries with high per capita income have been found to be less prone to violence, but in countries with low incomes the tendency is the reverse.&lt;ref name=&quot;wp091108&quot;/&gt; Election misconduct is more likely in countries with low per capita incomes, small populations, rich in natural resources, and a lack of institutional checks and balances. Sub-Saharan countries, as well as Afghanistan, all tend to fall into that category.&lt;ref name=&quot;wp091108&quot;/&gt;

Governments that have frequent elections tend to have significantly more stable economic policies than those governments who have infrequent elections. However, this trend does not apply to governments where fraudulent elections are common.&lt;ref name=&quot;wp091108&quot;/&gt;

===Opposition===

{{Main|Anti-democratic thought}}
Democracy in modern times has almost always faced opposition from the previously existing government, and many times it has faced opposition from social elites. The implementation of a democratic government within a non-democratic state is typically brought about by [[democratic revolution]].

==Development==
{{main|Democratization}}
[[File:Hong Kong P1066634 (48678676473).jpg|thumb|Banner in Hong Kong asking for democracy]]
Several philosophers and researchers have outlined historical and social factors seen as supporting the evolution of democracy.

Other commentators have mentioned the influence of economic development.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1951731 | author = Lipset, Seymour Martin. | year = 1959 | title = Some Social Requisites of Democracy: Economic Development and Political Legitimacy| journal = American Political Science Review | volume = 53 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–105 | jstor =  1951731 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/affd89086e3cfb3a70ea3faf4002d5f28f20e6dd }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a related theory, [[Ronald Inglehart]] suggests that improved living-standards in modern developed countries can convince people that they can take their basic survival for granted, leading to increased emphasis on [[self-expression values]], which correlates closely with democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Inglehart, Ronald. Welzel, Christian ''Modernisation, Cultural Change and Democracy: The Human Development Sequence'', 2005. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Inglehart |first1=Ronald F. |title=Cultural Evolution: People's Motivations Are Changing, and Reshaping the World |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |doi=10.1017/9781108613880 |isbn=978-1-108-61388-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas M. Gibler and Andrew Owsiak in their study argued about the importance of peace and stable borders for the development of democracy. It has often been assumed that [[democratic peace theory|democracy causes peace]], but this study shows that, historically, peace has almost always predated the establishment of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gibler |first1=Douglas M. |last2=Owsiak |first2=Andrew |title=Democracy and the Settlement of International Borders, 1919–2001 |journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution |volume=62 |issue=9 |pages=1847–75 |date=2017 |doi=10.1177/0022002717708599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carroll Quigley]] concludes that the characteristics of weapons are the main predictor of democracy:&lt;ref&gt;Foreword, written by historian [http://paw.princeton.edu/memorials/24/79/index.xml Harry J Hogan] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130901040610/http://paw.princeton.edu/memorials/24/79/index.xml |date= 1 September 2013 }} in 1982, to Quigley's ''Weapons Systems and Political Stability''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also Chester G Starr, Review of ''Weapons Systems and Political Stability'', American Historical Review, Feb 1984, p. 98, available at [http://www.carrollquigley.net/book-reviews/Review-of-Weapons-Systems-Political-Stability-Starr.htm carrollquigley.net]&lt;/ref&gt; Democracy—this scenario—tends to emerge only when the best weapons available are easy for individuals to obtain and use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quigley1983-38&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= Carroll Quigley |title= Weapons systems and political stability: a history |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=L6e2AAAAIAAJ |accessdate= 20 May 2013 |year= 1983 |publisher= University Press of America |isbn= 978-0-8191-2947-5 |pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1800s, guns were the best personal weapons available, and in the United States of America (already nominally democratic), almost everyone could afford to buy a gun, and could learn how to use it fairly easily.

Other theories stressed the relevance of [[education]] and of [[human capital]]—and within them of [[intelligence|cognitive ability]] to increasing tolerance, rationality, political literacy and participation. Two effects of education and cognitive ability are distinguished:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glaeser | first1 = E. | last2 = Ponzetto | first2 = G. | last3 = Shleifer | first3 = A. | year = 2007 | title = Why does democracy need education? | url = http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:27867132| journal = Journal of Economic Growth | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 77–99 | doi=10.1007/s10887-007-9015-1 | access-date = 3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=August 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deary | first1 = I.J. | last2 = Batty | first2 = G.D. | last3 = Gale | first3 = C.R. | year = 2008 | title = Bright children become enlightened adults | url = https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/8896064/bright_children_become_enlightened_adults.pdf| journal = Psychological Science | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 1–6 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02036.x | pmid=18181782}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{cite journal | last1 = Rindermann | first1 = H | year = 2008 | title = Relevance of education and intelligence for the political development of nations: Democracy, rule of law and political liberty | url = | journal = Intelligence | volume = 36 | issue = 4| pages = 306–22 | doi=10.1016/j.intell.2007.09.003 | quote = Political theory has described a positive linkage between education, cognitive ability and democracy. This assumption is confirmed by positive correlations between education, cognitive ability, and positively valued political conditions (N = 183 − 130). [...] It is shown that in the second half of the 20th century, education and intelligence had a strong positive impact on democracy, rule of law and political liberty independent from wealth (GDP) and chosen country sample. One possible mediator of these relationships is the attainment of higher stages of moral judgment fostered by cognitive ability, which is necessary for the function of democratic rules in society. The other mediators for citizens as well as for leaders could be the increased competence and willingness to process and seek information necessary for political decisions due to greater cognitive ability. There are also weaker and less stable reverse effects of the rule of law and political freedom on cognitive ability.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a cognitive effect (competence to make rational choices, better information-processing)
* an ethical effect (support of democratic values, freedom, human rights etc.), which itself depends on intelligence.

Evidence consistent with conventional theories of why democracy emerges and is sustained has been hard to come by. Statistical analyses have challenged [[modernisation theory]] by demonstrating that there is no reliable evidence for the claim that democracy is more likely to emerge when countries become wealthier, more educated, or less unequal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Albertus |first1= Michael |first2= Victor |last2= Menaldo |title= Coercive Capacity and the Prospects for Democratisation |journal= Comparative Politics |volume= 44 |issue= 2 |year= 2012 |pages= 151–69 |doi= 10.5129/001041512798838003|url= https://semanticscholar.org/paper/56c698c8e40fe6ae4f547650a733f05bc7f43476 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither is there convincing evidence that increased reliance on oil revenues prevents democratisation, despite a vast theoretical literature on &quot;[[the Resource Curse]]&quot; that asserts that oil revenues sever the link between citizen taxation and government accountability, seen as the key to representative democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.plawlotic.com/?p=8 | title= The Resource Curse: Does the Emperor Have no Clothes?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of evidence for these conventional theories of democratisation have led researchers to search for the &quot;deep&quot; determinants of contemporary political institutions, be they geographical or demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy |last1= Acemoglu |first1= Daron |authorlink1= Daron Acemoglu |first2= James A. |last2= Robinson |year= 2006 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 978-0-521-85526-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.plawlotic.com/?p=102 | title= Rainfall and Democracy}}&lt;/ref&gt; More inclusive [[institution]]s lead to democracy because as people gain more power, they are able to demand more from the elites, who in turn have to concede more things to keep their position.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} This virtuous circle may end up in democracy.

An example of this is the disease environment. Places with different mortality rates had different populations and productivity levels around the world. For example, in Africa, the [[tsetse fly]]—which afflicts humans and livestock—reduced the ability of Africans to plow the land. This made Africa less settled. As a consequence, political power was less concentrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Alsan, Marcella|doi= 10.1257/aer.20130604|url= https://www.dartmouth.edu/~neudc2012/docs/paper_285.pdf|year= 2015|title= The Effect of the TseTse Fly on African Development|journal= American Economic Review|volume= 105|issue= 1|pages= 382–410|citeseerx= 10.1.1.1010.2955}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also affected the colonial institutions European countries established in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1= Acemoglu, Daron |author2=Johnson, Simon |author3=Robinson, James  |year= 2005|chapter= Institutions as a fundamental cause of long-run growth |title= Handbook of Economic Growth |volume= 1|pages= 385–472, Sections 1 to 4|doi= 10.1016/S1574-0684(05)01006-3|series= Handbook of Economic Growth|isbn= 978-0-444-52041-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether colonial settlers could live or not in a place made them develop different institutions which led to different economic and social paths. This also affected the distribution of power and the collective actions people could take. As a result, some African countries ended up having democracies and others [[autocracies]].

An example of geographical determinants for democracy is having access to coastal areas and rivers. This natural endowment has a positive relation with economic development thanks to the benefits of [[trade]].&lt;ref&gt;Mellinger, Andrew D., Jeffrey Sachs, and John L. Gallup. (1999). [http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/sitefiles/file/about/director/pubs/024.pdf &quot;Climate, Water Navigability, and Economic Development&quot;]. Working Paper.&lt;/ref&gt; Trade brought economic development, which in turn, broadened power. Rulers wanting to increase revenues had to protect property-rights to create incentives for people to invest. As more people had more power, more concessions had to be made by the ruler and in many{{quantify|date=August 2018}} places this process lead to democracy. These determinants defined the structure of the society moving the balance of political power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1= Acemoglu, Daron |author2=Johnson, Simon |author3=Robinson, James  |year= 2005|chapter= Institutions as a fundamental cause of long-run growth |title= Handbook of Economic Growth |volume= 1|pages= 385–472, Sections 5 to 10|doi= 10.1016/S1574-0684(05)01006-3|series= Handbook of Economic Growth|isbn= 978-0-444-52041-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, democracy has become such a popular method of reaching decisions that its application beyond politics to other areas such as entertainment, food and fashion, consumerism, urban planning, education, art, literature, science and theology has been criticised as &quot;the reigning dogma of our time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Farrelly |first= Elizabeth |authorlink= Elizabeth Farrelly |title= Deafened by the roar of the crowd |url= http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/deafened-by-roar-of-the-crowd-20110914-1k9lo.html |newspaper= The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate= 17 September 2011 |date= 15 September 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111230084034/http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/deafened-by-roar-of-the-crowd-20110914-1k9lo.html |archive-date= 30 December 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument suggests that applying a populist or market-driven approach to art and literature (for example), means that innovative creative work goes unpublished or unproduced. In education, the argument is that essential but more difficult studies are not undertaken. Science, as a [[truth]]-based discipline, is particularly corrupted by the idea that the correct conclusion can be arrived at by popular vote. However, more recently, theorists{{which|date=August 2018}} have also advanced the concept [[epistemic democracy]] to assert that democracy actually does a good job tracking the truth.

Robert Michels asserts that although democracy can never be fully realised, democracy may be developed automatically in the act of striving for democracy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The peasant in the fable, when on his death-bed, tells his sons that a treasure is buried in the field. After the old man's death the sons dig everywhere in order to discover the treasure. They do not find it. But their indefatigable labor improves the soil and secures for them a comparative well-being. The treasure in the fable may well symbolise democracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michels1915&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= Robert Michels |title= Political Parties |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ijae_UIez38C |accessdate =5 June 2013 |date= 1999 |origyear= 1962 by [[Collier's|Crowell-Collier]] |publisher= [[Transaction Publishers]] |isbn= 978-1-4128-3116-1 |page= 243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dr. [[Harald Wydra]], in his book ''Communism and The Emergence of Democracy'' (2007), maintains that the development of democracy should not be viewed as a purely procedural or as a static concept but rather as an ongoing &quot;process of meaning formation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Harald Wydra, Communism and the Emergence of Democracy, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007, pp. 22–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on Claude Lefort's idea of the empty place of power, that &quot;power emanates from the people [...] but is the power of nobody&quot;, he remarks that democracy is reverence to a symbolic mythical authority—as in reality, there is no such thing as the people or ''demos''. Democratic political figures are not supreme rulers but rather temporary guardians of an empty place. Any claim to substance such as the [[collective good]], the [[public interest]] or the will of the nation is subject to the competitive struggle and times of for{{clarify|date=January 2016}} gaining the authority of office and government. The essence of the democratic system is an empty place, void of real people, which can only be temporarily filled and never be appropriated. The seat of power is there but remains open to constant change. As such, people's definitions of &quot;democracy&quot; or of &quot;democratic&quot; progress throughout history as a continual and potentially never-ending process of social construction.&lt;ref&gt;

LXVI, no. 10 (6 June 2019), pp.&amp;nbsp;52–53, 56–57.  &quot;Democracy has no clear answer for the mindless operation of [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] and [[technology|technological power]].  We may indeed be witnessing its extension in the form of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[robotics]].  Likewise, after decades of dire warning, the [[environmentalism|environmental problem]] remains fundamentally unaddressed.... Bureaucratic overreach and environmental catastrophe are precisely the kinds of slow-moving existential challenges that democracies deal with very badly.... Finally, there is the threat du jour:  [[corporation]]s and the technologies they promote.&quot;  (pp.&amp;nbsp;56–57.)
