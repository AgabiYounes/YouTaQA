{{Professional responsibility}}

'''Disbarment''' is the removal of a [[lawyer]] from a [[bar association]] or the [[practice of law]], thus revoking his or her [[law license]] or [[admission to practice law]]. Disbarment is usually a punishment for [[Legal ethics|unethical]] or criminal conduct. Procedures vary depending on the [[law society]].

==Australia==
In Australia, states regulate the Legal Profession under state law, despite many participating in a uniform scheme. Admission as a lawyer is the business of the admissions board and the Supreme Court. Disciplinary proceedings may be commenced by the Bar Association or the Law Society of which one is a member, or the board itself

==Germany==
In Germany, a ''[[Berufsverbot]]'' is a ban on practicing a profession, which the government can issue to a lawyer for misconduct, ''[[Volksverhetzung]]'' or for serious mismanagement of personal finances.

In April 1933, the Nazi government issued a ''Berufsverbot'' forbidding the practice of law by Jews, communists, and other political opponents, except for those protected by the ''[[Frontkämpferprivileg]]''.

==United States==
===Overview===
Generally disbarment is imposed as a sanction for conduct indicating that an attorney is not fit to practice law, willfully disregarding the interests of a client, [[commingling]] funds, or engaging in fraud which impedes the administration of justice. In addition, any lawyer who is convicted of a [[felony]] is automatically disbarred in most{{Where|date=November 2012}} jurisdictions, a policy that, although opposed by the [[American Bar Association]], has been described as a convicted felon's &lt;!-- DON'T &quot;FIX&quot; THIS TO JUST DESSERTS --&gt;[[just deserts]]&lt;!-- &quot;Desert&quot;, from the same French root as deserve, meaning something deserved --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=13|publisher=Hastings Const. L.Q.|pages=433|date=1985–1986|title=Automatic Disbarment: A Convicted Felon's Just Deserts|author1=Gentile, Michael A. |author2=McShea, Sarah Diane }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States legal system, disbarment is specific to regions; one can be disbarred from some courts, while still being a member of the [[bar association|bar]] in another jurisdiction. However, under the [[American Bar Association]]'s [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]], which have been adopted in most states, disbarment in one state or court is grounds for disbarment in a jurisdiction which has adopted the Model Rules.

Disbarment is quite rare (in 2011, only 1,046 lawyers were disbarred&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rocketlawyer.com/blog/getting-disbarred-is-harder-than-you-think-915832&lt;/ref&gt;). Instead, lawyers are usually sanctioned by their own clients through civil malpractice proceedings, or via fine, censure, suspension, or other punishments from the disciplinary boards. To be disbarred is considered a great embarrassment and shame, even if one no longer wishes to pursue a career in the law.

Because disbarment rules vary by area, different rules can apply depending on where a lawyer is disbarred. Notably, the majority of US states have no procedure for permanently disbarring a person. Depending on the jurisdiction, a lawyer may reapply to the bar immediately, after five to seven years, or be banned for life.&lt;ref name=&quot;reapply&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3975/is_200707/ai_n19511820/pg_2 | work=The Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics | title=Should Permanent Disbarment be Permanent? | year=2007 | first=Brian | last=Finkelstein | access-date=2007-11-20 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112072221/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3975/is_200707/ai_n19511820/pg_2 | archive-date=2008-11-12 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable U.S. disbarments===
{{main|List of disbarments in the United States}}
The 20th and the 21st centuries have seen one former U.S. [[President of the United States|president]] and one former U.S. [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] disbarred, and another former president suspended from one bar and caused to resign from another bar rather than face disbarment.

Former Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], having pleaded [[nolo contendere|no contest]] (which subjects a person to the same criminal penalties as a guilty plea, but is not an admission of guilt for a civil suit) to charges of [[bribery]] and [[tax evasion]], was disbarred from [[Maryland]], the state of which he had previously been [[Governor of Maryland|governor]].

Former President [[Richard Nixon]] was disbarred from [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1976&lt;ref&gt;See In re Nixon, 53 A.D.2d 178, 385 N.Y.S.2d 305 (1st Dept. 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nixon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/exhibits/impeach/whthous1.html|date=July 9, 1976 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028075731/http://www.history.com/exhibits/impeach/whthous1.html |archivedate=2007-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[obstruction of justice]] related to the [[Watergate scandal]].

According to the panel, Thomas &quot;outrageously exploited power, flagrantly fostered fear, and disgracefully misused the law&quot; while serving as Maricopa County Attorney. The panel found &quot;clear and convincing evidence&quot; that Thomas brought unfounded and malicious criminal and civil charges against political opponents, including four state judges and the state attorney general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/11/andrew-thomas-disbarred-phoenix-prosecutor_n_1415815.html | work=Huffington Post | first=John | last=Rudolf | title=Arizona Prosecutor Disbarred For Plotting Bad Arrests With 'America's Toughest Sheriff' | date=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Were this a criminal case,&quot; the panel concluded, &quot;we are confident that the evidence would establish this conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2012-04-19/news/andy-thomas-needs-a-perp-walk-with-his-papi-sheriff-joe-arpaio/2/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]], the Florida lawyer noted for his activism against [[Howard Stern]], video games, and rap music, was permanently disbarred for various charges of misconduct.

The order was made on September 25, 2008, effective October 25. However, Thompson attempted to appeal to the higher courts in order to avoid the penalty actually taking effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5054772/jack-thompson-disbarred|title=Jack Thompson Disbarred|author=Mike Fahey|publisher=Gawker Media|work=Kotaku|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the US District court, nor the US Supreme Court&lt;ref&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/042009zor.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; would hear his appeal, rendering the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court final.

[[F. Lee Bailey]], noted criminal defense attorney, was disbarred by the state of Florida in 2001, with reciprocal disbarment in Massachusetts in 2002. The Florida disbarment was the result of his handling of stock in the DuBoc marijuana case. Bailey was found guilty of 7 counts of attorney misconduct by the Florida Supreme Court. Bailey had transferred a large portion of DuBoc's assets into his own accounts, using the interest gained on those assets to pay for personal expenses. In March 2005, Bailey filed to regain his law license in Massachusetts. The book ''Florida Pulp Nonfiction'' details the peculiar facts of the DuBoc case along with extended interviews with Bailey that include his own defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7153568|title=F.
