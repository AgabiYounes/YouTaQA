The first significant [[adaptive radiation]] of life on dry land occurred during the Devonian. [[Pteridophyte|Free-sporing vascular plants]] began to spread across dry land, forming extensive [[forest]]s which covered the continents. By the middle of the Devonian, several groups of plants had evolved leaves and true roots, and by the end of the period the [[Pteridospermatophyta|first seed-bearing plants]] appeared. Various terrestrial [[arthropod]]s also became well-established.&lt;!--Arthropods had been on the land since the Silu/Ordovican. See Tumblagooda sandstone.--&gt;

[[Fish]] reached substantial diversity during this time, leading the Devonian to often be dubbed the '''Age of Fishes'''. The [[placodermi|placoderms]] began dominating almost every known aquatic environment. The ancestors of all four-limbed vertebrates ([[tetrapod]]s) began adapting to walking on land, as their strong pectoral and pelvic fins gradually evolved into legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Amos |first1=Jonathan |title=Fossil tracks record 'oldest land-walkers' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8443879.stm |accessdate=24 December 2016 |work=news.bbc.co.uk |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the oceans, primitive [[shark]]s became more numerous than in the Silurian and [[Ordovician#Subdivisions|Late Ordovician]].

The first [[Ammonoidea|ammonites]], species of molluscs, appeared. [[Trilobite]]s, the mollusc-like [[brachiopod]]s, and the great [[coral reef]]s were still common. The [[Late Devonian extinction]] which started about 375&amp;nbsp;million years ago&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Newitz |first=Annalee |title=How do you have a mass extinction without an increase in extinctions? |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/06/how-do-you-have-a-mass-extinction-without-an-increase-in-extinctions/276836/ |website=The Atlantic |date=2013-06-13 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; severely affected marine life, killing off all placodermi, and all trilobites, save for a few species of the order [[Proetida]].

The [[palaeogeography]] was dominated by the [[supercontinent]] of [[Gondwana]] to the south, the continent of [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]] to the north, and the early formation of the small continent of [[Euramerica]] in between.

==History==
[[File:Lummaton Quarry 1.JPG|thumb|left|The rocks of Lummaton Quarry in [[Torquay]] in Devon played an early role in defining the Devonian period.]]
The period is named after [[Devon]], a county in southwestern England, where a controversial argument in the 1830s over the age and structure of the rocks found distributed throughout the county was eventually resolved by the definition of the Devonian period in the geological timescale. [[The Great Devonian Controversy]] was a long period of vigorous argument and counter-argument between the main protagonists of [[Roderick Murchison]] with [[Adam Sedgwick]] against [[Henry De la Beche]] supported by [[George Bellas Greenough]]. Murchison and Sedgwick won the debate and named the period they proposed as the Devonian System.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gradstein|Ogg|Smith|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rudwick |first=M.S.J. |date=1985 |title=The great Devonian controversy: The shaping of scientific knowledge among gentlemanly specialists |url=https://archive.org/details/greatdevoniancon0000rudw |url-access=registration |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|text=
Sedgwick and Murchison coined the term &quot;Devonian system&quot; in {{harvtxt|Sedgwick|Murchison|1840|p=701}}: &quot;We propose therefore, for the future, to designate these groups collectively by the name ''Devonian system''&quot;. Sedgwick and Murchison acknowledged William Lonsdale's role in proposing, on the basis of fossil evidence, the existence of a Devonian stratum between those of the Silurian and Carboniferous periods. From {{harvtxt|Sedgwick|Murchison|1840|p=690}}:  &quot;Again, Mr.&amp;nbsp;Lonsdale, after an extensive examination of the fossils of South Devon, had pronounced them, more than a year since, to form ''a group intermediate between those of the Carboniferous and Silurian systems''&quot;.

William Lonsdale stated that in December 1837 he had suggested the existence of a stratum between the Silurian and Carboniferous ones. From {{harvtxt|Lonsdale|1840|p= 724}}: &quot;Mr.&amp;nbsp;Austen's communication [was] read December&amp;nbsp;1837 ...&amp;nbsp;. It was immediately after the reading of that paper ... that I formed the opinion relative to the limestones of Devonshire being of the age of the old red sandstone; and which I afterwards suggested first to Mr.&amp;nbsp;Murchison and then to Prof.&amp;nbsp;Sedgwick&quot;.}}

While the [[stratum|rock bed]]s that define the start and end of the Devonian period are well identified, the exact dates are uncertain. According to the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]], {{sfn|Gradstein|Ogg|Smith|2004}} the Devonian extends from the end of the Silurian {{Period end|Silurian}} [[annum|Mya]], to the beginning of the [[Carboniferous]] {{Period start|Carboniferous}} Mya – in [[North America]], at the beginning of the [[Mississippian (geology)|Mississippian subperiod]] of the Carboniferous.

In nineteenth-century texts the Devonian has been called the &quot;Old Red Age&quot;, after the red and brown terrestrial deposits known in the United Kingdom as the [[Old Red Sandstone]] in which early fossil discoveries were found. Another common term is &quot;Age of the Fishes&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.estrellamountain.edu/faculty/farabee/biobk/BioBookPaleo4.html#The%20Devonian |title=Paleobiology: The Late Paleozoic: Devonian |last=Farabee |first=Michael J. |website=The Online Biology Book |publisher=Estrella Mountain Community College |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the evolution of several major groups of [[fish]] that took place during the period. Older literature on the Anglo-Welsh basin divides it into the Downtonian, Dittonian, Breconian, and Farlovian stages, the latter three of which are placed in the Devonian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Barclay |first1=W.J. |date=1989 |title=Geology of the South Wales Coalfield Part&amp;nbsp;II, the country around Abergavenny |edition=3rd |series=Memoir for 1:50,000 geological sheet (England and Wales) |number=232 |pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Devonian has also erroneously been characterised as a &quot;greenhouse age&quot;, due to [[sampling bias]]: most of the early Devonian-age discoveries came from the [[stratum|strata]] of [[western Europe]] and eastern [[North America]], which at the time straddled the [[Equator]] as part of the supercontinent of Euramerica where [[fossil]] signatures of widespread reefs indicate tropical [[climate]]s that were warm and moderately humid but in fact the climate in the Devonian differed greatly during its [[geologic time scale|epochs]] and between geographic regions. For example, during the Early Devonian, arid conditions were prevalent through much of the world including Siberia, Australia, North America, and China, but Africa and [[South America]] had a warm [[temperate climate]]. In the Late Devonian, by contrast, arid conditions were less prevalent across the world and [[temperate climate]]s were more common.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Subdivisions{{anchor|subdivisions}}==
The Devonian Period is formally broken into Early, Middle and Late subdivisions. The rocks corresponding to those [[series (stratigraphy)|epoch]]s are referred to as belonging to the Lower, Middle and Upper parts of the Devonian System.

;Early Devonian
The Early Devonian lasted from {{period span|Early devonian}} and began with the [[Lochkovian]] stage {{period span|Lochkovian}}, which was followed by the [[Pragian]] from {{period span|Pragian}} and then by the [[Emsian]], which lasted until the Middle Devonian began, {{ma|middle devonian|error=show}}.&lt;ref name=ICSC&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Cohen, K.M.; Finney, S.C.; Gibbard, P.L.; &amp; Fan, J.-X. |year=2018 |title=The ICS International Chronostratigraphic Chart. Episodes&amp;nbsp;36: 199-204 |url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2018-08.pdf |access-date=18 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
During this time, the first [[Ammonoidea|ammonoids]] appeared, descending from [[Bactritida|bactritoid]] [[Nautiloidea|nautiloids]]. Ammonoids during this time period were simple and differed little from their nautiloid counterparts. These ammonoids belong to the order [[Agoniatitida]], which in later epochs evolved to new ammonoid orders, for example [[Goniatite|Goniatitida]] and [[Clymeniida]]. This class of [[cephalopod]] molluscs would dominate the marine fauna until the beginning of the [[Mesozoic]] era.

;Middle Devonian
The Middle Devonian comprised two subdivisions: first the [[Eifelian]], which then gave way to the [[Givetian]] {{Mya|Givetian|error=show}}.
During this time the jawless [[agnathan]] fishes began to decline in diversity in freshwater and marine environments partly due to drastic environmental changes and partly due to the increasing competition, predation, and diversity of [[gnathostomata|jawed fishes]]. The shallow, warm, oxygen-depleted waters of Devonian inland lakes, surrounded by primitive plants, provided the environment necessary for certain early fish to develop such essential characteristics as well developed lungs, and the ability to crawl out of the water and onto the land for short periods of time.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

;Late Devonian
Finally, the Late Devonian started with the [[Frasnian]], {{period span|Frasnian}}, during which the first forests took shape on land. The first tetrapods appeared in the fossil record in the ensuing [[Famennian]] subdivision, the beginning and end of which are marked with extinction events. This lasted until the end of the Devonian, {{Mya|Carboniferous|error=show}}.&lt;ref name=ICSC/&gt;

==Climate==
The Devonian was a relatively warm period, and probably lacked any [[glacier]]s. The temperature gradient from the equator to the poles was not as large as it is today. The weather was also very arid, mostly along the equator where it was the driest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joachim Kia 2009&quot;/&gt; Reconstruction of tropical sea surface temperature from [[conodont]] [[apatite]] implies an average value of {{convert|30|C|4=0|abbr=on}} in the Early Devonian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joachim Kia 2009&quot;/&gt; {{Co2}} levels dropped steeply throughout the Devonian period as the burial of the newly evolved forests drew carbon out of the atmosphere into sediments; this may be reflected by a Mid-Devonian cooling of around {{convert|5|C-change|4=0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joachim Kia 2009&quot;/&gt; The Late Devonian warmed to levels equivalent to the Early Devonian; while there is no corresponding increase in {{co2}} concentrations, continental weathering increases (as predicted by warmer temperatures); further, a range of evidence, such as plant distribution, points to a Late Devonian warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joachim Kia 2009&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=M.

The warming at the end of the Devonian may even have contributed to the extinction of the stromatoporoids.

==Paleogeography==
[[File:380 Ma plate tectonic reconstruction.png|thumb|left|200px|The [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]] opened during the Devonian]]
The Devonian period was a time of great [[plate tectonics|tectonic]] activity, as [[Euramerica]] and [[Gondwana]] drew closer together.

The continent [[Euramerica]] (or Laurussia) was created in the early Devonian by the collision of [[Laurentia]] and [[Baltica]], which rotated into the natural dry zone along the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], which is formed as much in Paleozoic times as nowadays by the convergence of two great air-masses, the [[Hadley cell]] and the [[Ferrel cell]]. In these near-deserts, the [[Old Red Sandstone]] sedimentary beds formed, made red by the oxidised iron ([[hematite]]) characteristic of drought conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Devonian-Period |title=Devonian Period |series=geochronology |work=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=2017-12-15 |df=dmy-all |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the [[equator]], the [[plate tectonics|plate]] of Euramerica and Gondwana were starting to meet, beginning the early stages of the assembling of [[Pangaea]]. This activity further raised the northern [[Appalachian Mountains]] and formed the [[Caledonian orogeny|Caledonian Mountains]] in [[Great Britain]] and [[Scandinavia]].

The west coast of Devonian North America, by contrast, was a passive margin with deep silty embayments, river deltas and estuaries, found today in [[Idaho]] and [[Nevada]]; an approaching volcanic [[island arc]] reached the steep slope of the continental shelf in Late Devonian times and began to uplift deep water deposits, a collision that was the prelude to the mountain-building episode at the beginning of the Carboniferous called the [[Antler orogeny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~rcb7/devpaleo.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415135733/http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~rcb7/devpaleo.html |title=Devonian Paleogeography, Southwestern US |archive-date=April 15, 2010 |last=Blakey |first=Ron C. |website=jan.ucc.nau.edu |url-status=dead |publisher=Northern Arizona University |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sea levels were high worldwide, and much of the land lay under shallow seas, where tropical [[reef]] organisms lived. The deep, enormous [[Panthalassa]] (the &quot;universal ocean&quot;) covered the rest of the [[planet]]. Other minor oceans were the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]], [[Proto-Tethys Ocean]], [[Rheic Ocean]], and [[Ural Ocean]] (which was closed during the collision with [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]] and Baltica).

During the Devonian, [[Chaitenia]], an [[island arc]], [[accretion (geology)|accreted]] to Patagonia.&lt;ref name=Herve2018&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hervé |first1=Francisco|author-link1=Francisco Hervé |last2=Calderón |first2=Mauricio |last3=Fanning |first3=Mark |last4=Pankhurst |first4=Robert|author-link4=Robert John Pankhurst |last5=Rapela |first5=Carlos W. |last6=Quezada |first6=Paulo |year=2018 |title=The country rocks of Devonian magmatism in the North Patagonian Massif and Chaitenia |url=http://www.andeangeology.cl/index.php/revista1/article/view/V45n3-3117 |journal=[[Andean Geology]] |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=301–317 |doi=10.5027/andgeoV45n3-3117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Evolution of fish#Devonian: Age of fishes}}

Sea levels in the Devonian were generally high. Marine faunas continued to be dominated by [[bryozoa]], diverse and abundant [[brachiopod]]s, the enigmatic [[hederellid]]s, [[microconchida|microconchids]] and [[coral]]s. Lily-like [[crinoid]]s (animals, their resemblance to flowers notwithstanding) were abundant, and [[trilobite]]s were still fairly common. Among vertebrates, jawless armored fish ([[ostracoderm]]s) declined in diversity, while the jawed fish (gnathostomes) simultaneously increased in both the sea and [[fresh water]]. Armored placoderms were numerous during the lower stages of the Devonian Period and became extinct in the Late Devonian, perhaps because of competition for food against the other fish species. Early cartilaginous ([[Chondrichthyes]]) and bony fishes ([[Osteichthyes]]) also become diverse and played a large role within the Devonian seas. The first abundant genus of shark, ''[[Cladoselache]]'', appeared in the oceans during the Devonian Period. The great diversity of fish around at the time has led to the Devonian being given the name &quot;The Age of Fish&quot; in popular culture.

The first ammonites also appeared during or slightly before the early Devonian Period around 400&amp;nbsp;Mya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Palaeos Paleozoic: Devonian: The Devonian Period – 1 |url=http://palaeos.com/paleozoic/devonian/devonian.html |website=palaeos.com |accessdate=24 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reefs===
A now dry barrier reef, located in present-day [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley Basin]] of northwest [[Australia]], once extended a thousand kilometres, fringing a Devonian continent. Reefs in general are built by various [[carbonate]]-secreting organisms that have the ability to erect wave-resistant structures close to sea level. Although modern reefs are constructed mainly by corals and calcareous [[algae]], the main contributors of the Devonian reefs were different: They were composed of calcareous algae, coral-like [[Stromatoporoidea|stromatoporoids]], and tabulate and [[Rugosa|rugose corals]], in that order of importance.{{clarify|reason=Difference between &quot;corals and calcareous [[algae]]&quot; and &quot;calcareous algae and coral-like [[Stromatoporoidea|stromatoporoids]] [and corals]&quot;|date=December 2010}}


===Terrestrial biota===
By the Devonian Period, life was well underway in its colonisation of the land. The [[moss]] forests and [[bacteria]]l and algal mats of the Silurian were joined early in the period by primitive rooted plants that created the first stable [[soil]]s and harbored arthropods like [[mite]]s, [[scorpion]]s, [[Trigonotarbida|trigonotarbids]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garwood |first1=Russell J. |last2=Dunlop |first2=Jason |date=July 2014 |title=The walking dead: Blender as a tool for paleontologists with a case study on extinct arachnids |url=https://www.academia.edu/7625529 |journal=[[Journal of Paleontology]] |volume=88 |issue=4 |pages=735–746 |doi=10.1666/13-088 |issn=0022-3360 |accessdate=2015-07-21|bibcode=1974JPal...48..524M}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Myriapoda|myriapods]] (although arthropods appeared on land much earlier than in the Early Devonian&lt;ref name=&quot;Garwood&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garwood |first1=Russell J. |last2=Edgecombe |first2=Gregory D. |date=September 2011 |title=Early Terrestrial Animals, Evolution, and Uncertainty |journal=Evolution: Education and Outreach |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=489–501 |doi=10.1007/s12052-011-0357-y |url=https://www.academia.edu/891357 |issn=1936-6426 |accessdate=2015-07-21 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the existence of fossils such as ''[[Protichnites]]'' suggest that amphibious arthropods may have appeared as early as the [[Cambrian]]).

====The greening of land====
[[File:Devonianscene-green.jpg|thumb|The Devonian period marks the beginning of extensive land colonisation by [[plant]]s. With large land-dwelling [[herbivore]]s not yet present, large forests grew and shaped the landscape.]]

These are the oldest-known trees of the world's first forests. By the end of the Devonian, the first seed-forming plants had appeared. This rapid appearance of so many plant groups and growth forms has been called the &quot;Devonian Explosion&quot;.

The 'greening' of the continents acted as a [[carbon sink]], and [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric concentrations]] of [[carbon dioxide]] may have dropped. This may have cooled the climate and led to a massive [[extinction event]]. See [[Late Devonian extinction]].

====Animals and the first soils====
Primitive arthropods co-evolved with this diversified terrestrial vegetation structure. The evolving co-dependence of insects and seed-plants that characterised a recognisably modern world had its genesis in the Late Devonian period. The development of soils and plant root systems probably led to changes in the speed and pattern of [[erosion]] and sediment deposition. The rapid evolution of a terrestrial ecosystem that contained copious animals opened the way for the first [[vertebrate]]s to seek out a terrestrial living. By the end of the Devonian, arthropods were solidly established on the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gess |first1=R.W. |year=2013 |title=The earliest record of terrestrial animals in Gondwana: A scorpion from the Famennian (Late Devonian) Witpoort Formation of South Africa |url=http://africaninvertebrates.org/ojs/index.php/AI/article/view/284 |journal=[[African Invertebrates]] |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=373–379 |doi=10.5733/afin.054.0206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late Devonian extinction==
{{Main|Late Devonian extinction}}
[[File:Extinction Intensity.svg|thumb|The Late Devonian is characterised by three episodes of extinction (&quot;Late D&quot;)]]
A major extinction occurred at the beginning of the last phase of the Devonian period, the Famennian faunal stage (the Frasnian-Famennian boundary), about {{Period start|Famennian}} Mya, when all the fossil [[agnatha]]n fishes, save for the [[psammosteida|psammosteid]] [[heterostraci]], suddenly disappeared. A second strong pulse closed the Devonian period. The Late Devonian extinction was one of five major extinction events in the history of the Earth's biota, and was more drastic than the familiar extinction event that closed the Cretaceous.

The Devonian extinction crisis primarily affected the marine community, and selectively affected shallow warm-water organisms rather than cool-water organisms. The most important group to be affected by this extinction event were the reef-builders of the great Devonian reef systems.

Amongst the severely affected marine groups were the brachiopods, trilobites, ammonites, [[conodont]]s, and [[acritarch]]s, as well as [[agnatha|jawless fish]], and all placoderms. Land plants as well as freshwater species, such as our tetrapod ancestors, were relatively unaffected by the Late Devonian extinction event (there is a counterargument that the Devonian extinctions nearly wiped out the tetrapods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McGhee |first=George R. |year=2013 |title=When the invasion of land failed: The legacy of the Devonian extinctions |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=9780231160568}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The reasons for the Late Devonian extinctions are still unknown, and all explanations remain speculative.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Digby McLaren]] suggested in 1969 that the Devonian extinction events were caused by an asteroid impact. However, while there were Late Devonian collision events (see the [[Alamo bolide impact]]), little evidence supports the existence of a large enough Devonian crater.
