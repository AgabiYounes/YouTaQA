The '''Kennedy family''' is an American [[political family]] that has long been prominent in [[Politics of the United States|American politics]], public service, entertainment and business. The first Kennedy elected to public office was [[P. J. Kennedy|Patrick Joseph &quot;P. J.&quot; Kennedy]] in 1884, 35 years after the family's arrival from [[Ireland]]. He served in the [[Massachusetts state legislature]] from 1884 to 1895. At least one Kennedy family member served in federal elective office in every year from 1947, when P.J. Kennedy's grandson, [[John F. Kennedy]], became a member of Congress from [[Massachusetts]]; to 2011, when P.J. Kennedy's great-grandson, [[Patrick J. Kennedy]], retired as a member of Congress from [[Rhode Island]], a span of 64 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg021310&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/rhode_island/articles/2010/02/13/pondering_a_congress_without_kennedys/|title=Pondering a Congress without Kennedys|last=Levenson|first=Michael|date=February 13, 2010|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The descendants of P.J.'s son, [[Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.]], and [[Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy]] include a [[president of the United States]] (who had also served in [[United States Congress|both houses of Congress]]), a [[Attorney General of the United States|U.S. attorney general]] (who later served in the U.S. Senate), four other members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] or [[United States Senate|Senate]], and two U.S. ambassadors, a lieutenant governor, three state legislators (one of whom went on to the U.S. House of Representatives), and one mayor.

In addition, Joseph Sr. and Rose's daughter, [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver|Eunice]], founded the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (a part of the [[National Institutes of Health]]), and founded the [[Special Olympics]]. Eunice's daughter [[Maria Shriver]] served as First Lady of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://governors.library.ca.gov/firstladies/35-Shriver.html|title=Governors of California - Maria Shriver|first=California State|last=Library|website=governors.library.ca.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other descendants of Joseph and Rose Kennedy have been active as lawyers, authors, and activists on behalf of those with physical and intellectual challenges.

==History==
[[File:Patrick Kennedy (1823–1858).jpg|thumb|Patrick Kennedy, the progenitor of the Kennedy family.]]
According to genealogist Brian Kennedy in his work ''JFK's Irish O'Kennedy Ancestors'', the Kennedys who would go on to play a significant role in the [[United States of America]] originated from the Ó Cinnéide Fionn (one of the three Irish Gaelic [[Ó Cinnéide]] clans who ruled the [[Kings of Osraige|kingdom of Ormond]], along with the Ó Cinnéide Donn and Ó Cinnéide Ruadh). Their progenitor, Diarmaid Ó Cinnéide Fionn, held Knigh Castle close to what is today [[Puckane]], [[County Tipperary]] in 1546. From there, having lost out to the [[Anglo-Irish people|New English]] order in the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], they ended up in Dunganstown, [[New Ross]], [[County Wexford]] by 1740. Patrick Kennedy was born there in 1823.

The first Kennedys to reside in the United States were Patrick Kennedy (1823–1858) and Bridget Murphy (1824–1888), who sailed from Ireland to [[East Boston]] in 1849; Patrick worked in East Boston as a barrel maker, or cooper.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maier2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Kennedys: America's Emerald Kings |first=Thomas |last=Maier |publisher=Basic Books |year=2003 |p=[https://archive.org/details/kennedysamericas00maie_0/page/ {{page needed|date=April 2015}}] |isbn=978-0-465-04317-0 |ref=harv |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/kennedysamericas00maie_0/page/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick and Bridget had five children: their youngest, [[P. J. Kennedy|Patrick Joseph &quot;P. J.&quot; Kennedy]], went into business and served in the [[Massachusetts General Court|Massachusetts state legislature]] from 1884–1895.

P.J. and Mary Augusta Hickey were the parents of four children. Their oldest was [[Joseph Patrick Kennedy|Joseph Patrick &quot;Joe&quot; Kennedy Sr.]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/The-Kennedy-Family.aspx The Kennedy Family] The JFK Library, accessed Feb 10, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; who amassed a fortune in banking and securities trading, which he further expanded by investing in other growing industries. Joseph Sr. was appointed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] as the first chairman of the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]], chairman of the [[United States Maritime Commission|Maritime Commission]], and [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] in the [[Causes of World War II|lead-up to World War II]]. He served on The Hoover Commission, officially named the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government, from 1947–1949; the commission was appointed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry Truman]] to recommend administrative changes in the federal government.

==Continued public service==
Joseph Sr. and [[Rose Kennedy|Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald]], were the parents of nine children: [[Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.|Joseph Jr.]], [[John F. Kennedy|John]], [[Rosemary Kennedy|Rosemary]], [[Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington|Kathleen]], [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver|Eunice]], [[Patricia Kennedy Lawford|Patricia]], [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert]], [[Jean Kennedy Smith|Jean]], and [[Ted Kennedy|Edward]] (called Ted). John served as the 35th [[President of the United States]], while Robert and Ted both became prominent [[United States Senate|senators]]. Every Kennedy elected to public office has served as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], while other members of the family have worked for the Democratic Party or held [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] posts in Democratic administrations. Many have attended [[Harvard University]], and the family has contributed greatly to that university's [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]].

Joseph Sr. expected his eldest son, Joseph Jr., to go into politics and to ultimately be elected president. Joseph Jr. was elected as a delegate to the [[1940 Democratic National Convention]], and enlisted in the [[United States Navy|Navy]] after the U.S. entered [[World War II]]. Joseph Jr. was killed in 1944 when the bomber he was piloting exploded in flight. It then fell upon John, who had considered a career as a journalist — he had authored a book and did some reporting for Hearst Newspapers — to fulfill his father's desire to see the family involved in politics and government. After returning from Navy service, John served in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] representing [[11th congressional district of Massachusetts|Massachusetts' 11th congressional district]] from 1947 to 1953, and then as [[List of United States Senators from Massachusetts|U.S. Senator from Massachusetts]] until his election as [[1960 United States presidential election|President]] in 1960.

During [[Timeline of the presidency of John F. Kennedy|John's administration]], Robert served as [[United States Attorney General|attorney general]]; his brother-in-law [[Sargent Shriver]] served as director of the new [[Peace Corps]], and Ted [[United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 1962|was elected to the U.S. Senate]], occupying his brother's former seat in [[Massachusetts]] until his death in 2009. Among the Kennedy administration's accomplishments: the [[Alliance for Progress]], the Peace Corps, peaceful resolution to the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], the [[Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] of 1963, the [[24th Amendment to the United States Constitution|24th Amendment]] ending the poll tax, and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/john-f-kennedy/&lt;/ref&gt; The family was the subject of intense media coverage during and after the Kennedy presidency, often emphasizing their relative youth, allure, education, and future in politics. Ted served in the Senate with his brother Robert (1965–1968), and was serving in the Senate when his nephew, [[Joseph P. Kennedy II|Joseph P. II]] (1987–1999), and son, [[Patrick J. Kennedy|Patrick J.]] (1995–2011), served in the U.S. House of Representatives.

In November 2012, [[Joseph P. Kennedy III]], son of former Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II and grandson of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from [[Massachusetts's 4th congressional district|Massachusetts' 4th Congressional District]].

==Family incidents==
{{main|Kennedy curse}}
[[File:BirthdayJPK.jpg|thumb|right|The Kennedy family at their home in [[Hyannis Port, Massachusetts]], September 1963]]

Family incidents led Senator Ted Kennedy to wonder, in a televised statement about the [[Chappaquiddick incident]] in 1969, whether there really was a &quot;Kennedy curse.&quot; Some of the tragedies endured by the Kennedy clan include: in 1941, Rosemary underwent a non-consensual lobotomy intended to cure or treat her mental disability and to curb her uncontrollable nature, which was believed by her father to be a detriment to the family's political ambition. The operation left her incapacitated for the rest of her life. Joseph Jr. died in 1944 when the Navy bomber he was piloting exploded in mid-flight. Kathleen died in a plane crash in [[France]] in 1948. [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|John]] and [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Robert]] were assassinated, in 1963 and 1968 respectively. In 1964, Ted was nearly killed when his plane crashed in an [[apple orchard]] near [[Southampton, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;time062664&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Teddy's Ordeal |url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,898150,00.html |magazine=Time |date=June 26, 1964 |accessdate=May 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/Kennedy-N344S.htm | publisher=Check-Six.com | title=The Luck of the Kennedys | accessdate=February 24, 2009 | date=May 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Legislative aide Edward Moss and the pilot were killed in the crash.)&lt;ref name=&quot;misfortunes&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=John F.

Since John F. Kennedy's election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1946, members of the family have held public office continuously with very few exceptions — first from December 22, 1960 until January 20, 1961 (from Kennedy's resignation from the Senate to his taking office as President) and next from Patrick J. Kennedy's departure from the House on January 3, 2011 until Joseph P. Kennedy III's election to the House on January 3, 2013.

==Coat of arms==
In 1961, John F. Kennedy was presented with a grant of [[coat of arms|arms]] for all the descendants of Patrick Kennedy (1823–1858) from the [[Chief Herald of Ireland]]. The design of the arms (three silver closed helmets on a black field)&lt;ref&gt;The General Armory of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales, Bernard Burke, Harrison &amp; Sons, 1884, pp. 558-9&lt;/ref&gt; strongly alludes to symbols in the coats of arms of the [[Kennedy (Ireland)|O'Kennedys]] of Ormonde and the [[Earl of Desmond|FitzGeralds]] of Desmond, from whom the family is believed to be descended. The crest is an armored hand holding four arrows between two olive branches, elements taken from the coat of arms of the United States of America and also symbolic of Kennedy and his brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | URL = http://www.americanheraldry.org/pages/index.php?n=President.Kennedy | title = John Fitzgerald Kennedy, 35th President of the United States | publisher = American Heraldry Society | accessdate =October 27, 2009 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803191207/http://www.americanheraldry.org/pages/index.php?n=President.Kennedy | archivedate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
