'''Piter De Vries''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' universe]] created by [[Frank Herbert]]. He is primarily featured in the 1965 novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', but also appears in the ''[[Prelude to Dune]]'' [[prequel]] [[trilogy]] (1999–2001) by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]].

De Vries is portrayed by [[Brad Dourif]] in [[David Lynch]]'s 1984 film ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]'', and by Jan Unger in the [[Frank Herbert's Dune|2000 ''Dune'' miniseries]]. The character will be played by [[David Dastmalchian]] in the 2020 [[Denis Villeneuve]] film ''[[Dune (2020 film)|Dune]]''.

== Character ==
In the service of the ruthless [[Vladimir Harkonnen|Baron Vladimir Harkonnen]], De Vries is a [[Mentat]]—a human specially trained to perform mental functions rivaling computers, which are forbidden universe-wide. In addition, De Vries has been &quot;twisted&quot; into an [[amorality|amoral]] [[Sadomasochism|sadist]] by the [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nerdist Mentat&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nerdist.com/article/dune-mentats/|title=Who Are the Mentats in ''Dune''?|first=Rose|last=Bueno|website=[[Nerdist]]|date=July 30, 2019|accessdate=July 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dune&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Herbert |title=Dune |year=1965 |title-link=Dune (novel) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Vries is so loyal to Harkonnen that he continues to serve the Baron with great enthusiasm even though his Mentat abilities and great intelligence confirm his suspicions that his master plans to eventually kill him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dune&quot;/&gt; As he says in ''Dune'':

{{quote|But you see, Baron, I know as a Mentat when you will send the executioner. You will hold back just so long as I am useful. To move sooner would be wasteful and I'm yet of much use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dune&quot;/&gt;}}

De Vries is described in the novel ''Dune'' (though not portrayed on screen) as being addicted to the drug [[Melange (fictional drug)|melange]], which has colored both the sclera and irises of his eyes a characteristic deep blue. He also has the characteristic ruby red lips of [[sapho (Dune)|sapho]] drinkers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dune&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Mentat Piter DeVries.gif|thumb|left|150px|Piter De Vries from ''[[The Dune Encyclopedia]]'']]
In ''Dune'', it is established that De Vries had pioneered a type of toxin called &quot;[[residual poison]]&quot; which remains in the body for years and requires an [[antidote]] to be administered regularly. One such fatal poison is secretly administered by the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnens]] to [[Thufir Hawat]], the Mentat of [[House Atreides]], in order to guarantee Hawat's allegiance to the Harkonnens, who alone possess the antidote.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dune&quot;/&gt; De Vries is the architect of the plan to destroy House Atreides, longtime enemy of the Harkonnens, while restoring the Baron's stewardship over the planet [[Arrakis]]. Dr. [[Wellington Yueh]], personal physician to House Atreides, has undergone [[Suk School|Suk conditioning]], which renders him incapable of inflicting harm on his patients. De Vries breaks this conditioning through torture and psychological manipulation, and Yueh eventually betrays House Atreides. De Vries originally plans to claim [[Lady Jessica]], the [[concubine]] of [[Leto I Atreides|Duke Leto Atreides]], as his slave, but he decides to become governor of Arrakis instead. However, Yueh has given the captured Leto a false tooth filled with poison gas. When Leto crushes the tooth, the intended victim Baron Harkonnen escapes, but Leto and De Vries die.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dune&quot;/&gt;

===''Prelude to Dune''===
In ''[[Dune: House Corrino]]'' (published in 2001 and the third novel in the ''Prelude to Dune'' prequel series by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson), Piter De Vries discovers the Harkonnen heritage of [[Lady Jessica]] and her newborn son [[Paul Atreides|Paul]], and attempts to kidnap and ransom the infant. The plot is thwarted and the secret preserved—the [[Reverend Mother (Dune)|Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]] kills the Mentat and arranges for his corpse to be shipped home to [[Giedi Prime]]. An enraged Baron is left with no choice but to order a duplicate from the Bene Tleilax: the Mentat De Vries featured in Herbert's original novel ''Dune''.&lt;ref name=&quot;House Corrino&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Brian |authorlink=Brian Herbert |author2=Kevin J.
