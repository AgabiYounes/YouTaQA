'''Delaware''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Delaware.ogg|ˈ|d|ɛ|l|ə|w|ɛər}})&lt;ref&gt;''[[Random House Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the 50 [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[United States]], in the [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|Mid Atlantic]] region.{{Efn|name=&quot;WhichRegion&quot;|While the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] designates Delaware as one of the [[South Atlantic States]], it is often grouped with the [[Mid-Atlantic States]] or the [[Northeastern United States]].}} It is bordered to the south and west by [[Maryland]], north by [[Pennsylvania]], and east by [[New Jersey]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The state takes its name from [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]], an English nobleman and [[Virginia]]'s first colonial governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Delaware|title=Delaware|accessdate=February 24, 2007|dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary|date=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012121643/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=Delaware|archivedate=October 12, 2007|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delaware occupies the northeastern portion of the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] and some islands and territory within the Delaware River. It is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|second smallest]] and [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|sixth least populous]] state, but the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population density|sixth most densely populated]]. Delaware's largest city is [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], while the state capital is [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]], the second-largest city in the state. The state is divided into [[List of counties in Delaware|three counties]], the lowest number of any state. From north to south, they are [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]], [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent County]], and [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex County]]. While the southern two counties have historically been predominantly agricultural, New Castle County is more urbanized.

Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century, Delaware was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans, including the [[Lenape]] in the north and [[Nanticoke Indian Tribe|Nanticoke]] in the south. It was initially colonized by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] traders at [[Zwaanendael Colony|Zwaanendael]], near the present town of [[Lewes, Delaware|Lewes]], in 1631.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Narratives of Early Pennsylvania, West New Jersey and Delaware, 1630–1707, Volume 13|author=Myers, Albert Cook|publisher=C. Scribner's Sons|year=1912|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delaware was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies|13 colonies]] participating in the [[American Revolution]]. On December 7, 1787, Delaware became the first state to ratify the [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]], and has since been known as &quot;The First State&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The First to Ratify&quot; would be more accurate, as the beginnings of the states themselves date back to the Declaration of Independence, celebrated July 4, 1776, when what was to become the State of Delaware was still the three lower counties of Pennsylvania with the governor in Philadelphia, and not establishing independence from that body until [[Delaware Constitution of 1776#Background|September 20, 1776]]. According to Delaware's own website, &quot;Delaware became a state in 1776, just two months after the signing of the Declaration of Independence.&quot; (ref-[http://delaware.gov/facts/DelawareFactsandSymbols.pdf pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223143442/http://delaware.gov/facts/DelawareFactsandSymbols.pdf |date=December 23, 2016 }}) Therefore Delaware was actually the ''last'' of the thirteen colonies to establish itself as a state. Additionally, the [[50 State Quarters#Designs|Delaware State Quarter]] is minted with this nickname, yet shows [[Caesar Rodney#American Revolution|Caesar Rodney]] on horseback in commemoration of how he was the ''last'' delegate to show up to the Continental Congress for the historic vote for independence. And with regard to the original Articles of Confederation, Delaware was the [[Articles of Confederation#Ratification|12th of the 13 states to ratify]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toponymy==
The state was named after the [[Delaware River#Origin of the name|Delaware River]], which in turn derived its name from [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]] (1577–1618) who was the ruling governor of the [[Colony of Virginia]] at the time Europeans first explored the river. The [[Delaware Indians]], a name used by [[Europeans]] for [[Lenape]] people indigenous to the Delaware Valley, also derive their name from the same source.

The surname ''de La Warr'' comes from [[Sussex]] and is of [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ware DeGidio |first=Wanda |year=2011 |title=Ware Family History: Descendants from Ancient, Medieval, and Modern Kings and Queens, and Presidents of the United States |editor-first=Wanda |editor-last=Ware DeGidio |location= |edition=|volume= |page=10 |ref= |isbn=978-1-4010-9930-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It came probably from a Norman [[lieu-dit]] ''La Guerre''. This [[toponymic]] could derive from the Latin word ''[[wikt:ager#Latin|ager]]'', from the Breton ''[[wikt:gwern#Breton|gwern]]'' or from the [[Late Latin]] ''varectum'' ([[fallow]]). The toponyms Gara, Gare, Gaire (the sound [[Open central unrounded vowel|[ä]]] often mutated in [[Near-open front unrounded vowel|[æ]]]) also appear in old texts cited by [[Lucien Musset]], where the word ''ga(i)ra'' means [[Gore (road)|gore]]. It could also be linked with a [[patronymic]] from the Old Norse ''[[wikt:verr#Old Norse|verr]]''.

Delaware is {{convert|96|mi|km}} long and ranges from {{convert|9|mi}} to {{convert|35|mi|km}} across, totaling {{convert |1954|sqmi|km2}}, making it the second-smallest state in the United States after [[Rhode Island]]. Delaware is bounded to the north by [[Pennsylvania]]; to the east by the [[Delaware River]], [[Delaware Bay]], [[New Jersey]] and the Atlantic Ocean; and to the west and south by [[Maryland]]. Small portions of Delaware are also situated on the eastern side of the Delaware River sharing land boundaries with New Jersey. The state of Delaware, together with the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore counties of Maryland]] and [[Eastern Shore of Virginia|two counties of Virginia]], form the [[Delmarva Peninsula]], which stretches down the Mid-Atlantic Coast.

The definition of the northern boundary of the state is unusual. Most of the boundary between Delaware and Pennsylvania was originally defined by an arc extending {{convert|12|mi|km|sigfig=3}} from the [[cupola]] of the courthouse in the city of [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]].{{citation needed|reason=Need supporting reference for this claim|date=March 2016}} This boundary is often referred to as the [[Twelve-Mile Circle]].{{Efn | Because of surveying errors, the actual line is several compound arcs with centers at different points in New Castle.}} Although the Twelve-Mile Circle is often claimed to be the only territorial boundary in the United States that is a true [[Arc (geometry)|arc]], the Mexican boundary with Texas includes several arcs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://faolex.fao.org/docs/pdf/bi-51757.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410052222/http://faolex.fao.org/docs/pdf/bi-51757.pdf |archive-date=April 10, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and many cities in the South (such as [[Plains, Georgia]])&lt;ref&gt;Frank Jacobs, [http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/655-enigma-georgia-mystery-of-the-souths-circular-towns &quot;Enigma, Georgia: Mystery of the South's Circular Towns&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523230226/http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/655-enigma-georgia-mystery-of-the-souths-circular-towns |date=May 23, 2014 }}, Strange Maps, April 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; also have circular boundaries.

This border extends all the way east to the low-tide mark on the New Jersey shore, then continues south along the shoreline until it again reaches the {{convert|12|mi|adj=on}} arc in the south; then the boundary continues in a more conventional way in the middle of the main channel ([[thalweg]]) of the Delaware River. To the west, a portion of the arc extends past the easternmost edge of Maryland. The remaining western border runs slightly east of due south from its intersection with the arc. [[The Wedge (border)|The Wedge]] of land between the northwest part of the arc and the Maryland border was claimed by both Delaware and Pennsylvania until 1921, when Delaware's claim was confirmed.

===Topography===
Delaware is on a level plain, with the lowest mean elevation of any state in the nation.&lt;ref name=census&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/04statab/geo.pdf|page=216|title=Extreme and Mean Elevations by State and Other Area|website=Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2004–2005|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=March 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310194411/http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/04statab/geo.pdf|archive-date=March 10, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its highest elevation, located at [[Ebright Azimuth]], near [[Concord High School (Wilmington, Delaware)|Concord High School]], is less than {{convert|450|ft}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=census/&gt; The northernmost part of the state is part of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont Plateau]] with hills and rolling surfaces. The [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line]] approximately follows the [[Delaware Route 2|Robert Kirkwood Highway]] between [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]] and [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]]; south of this road is the [[Atlantic Coastal Plain]] with flat, sandy, and, in some parts, swampy ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dgs.udel.edu/delaware-geology/summary-geologic-history-delaware|title=A Summary of the Geologic History of Delaware|publisher=The Delaware Geological Survey|access-date=March 19, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312150937/http://www.dgs.udel.edu/delaware-geology/summary-geologic-history-delaware|archive-date=March 12, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ridge about {{convert|75|to|80|ft}} high extends along the western boundary of the state and separates the [[drainage basin|watersheds]] that feed Delaware River and Bay to the east and the [[Chesapeake Bay]] to the west.

===Climate===
Since almost all of Delaware is a part of the [[Atlantic coastal plain]], the effects of the ocean moderate its climate. The state lies in the [[humid subtropical climate]] zone. Despite its small size (roughly {{convert|100|mi|km}} from its northernmost to southernmost points), there is significant variation in mean temperature and amount of snowfall between Sussex County and New Castle County. Moderated by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Delaware Bay]], the southern portion of the state has a milder climate and a longer growing season than the northern portion of the state. Delaware's all-time record high of {{convert|110|F|C}} was recorded at [[Millsboro, Delaware|Millsboro]] on July 21, 1930. The all-time record low of {{convert|−17|F|C}} was also recorded at Millsboro, on January 17, 1893. The [[hardiness zone]]s are 7a and 7b.

===Environment===
The transitional climate of Delaware supports a wide variety of vegetation. In the northern third of the state are found [[Northeastern coastal forests]] and mixed [[Quercus|oak]] forests typical of the northeastern United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;ecoregions&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Olson |title=Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World: A New Map of Life on Earth |journal=[[BioScience]] |year=2001 |volume=51 |issue=11 |pages=933–938 |url=http://gis.wwfus.org/wildfinder/ |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0933:TEOTWA]2.0.CO;2 |author2=D.

===Environmental management===
Delaware provides [[Government subsidy|government subsidy support]] for the [[Environmental remediation|clean-up]] of property &quot;lightly contaminated&quot; by [[hazardous waste]], the proceeds for which come from a tax on wholesale petroleum sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cleaning up contamination |first=Jeff |last=Montgomery |newspaper=[[The News Journal]] |publisher=Gannett |date=May 14, 2011 |accessdate=May 14, 2011 |url=http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20110514/NEWS02/105140360/-1/NLETTER01/Cleaning-up-contamination |location=New Castle, Delaware |at=DelawareOnline |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ygBz8xTN?url=http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20110514/NEWS02/105140360/-1/NLETTER01/Cleaning-up-contamination |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |url-status=live }} ''The first online page is archived; the page containing information related here is not in the archived version.''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2018}}

===Native Americans===
Before Delaware was settled by European colonists, the area was home to the Eastern [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes known as the Unami [[Lenape]], or Delaware, who lived mostly along the coast, and the [[Nanticoke people|Nanticoke]] who occupied much of the southern Delmarva Peninsula. John Smith also shows two Iroquoian tribes, the Kuskarawock &amp; [[Tockwogh]], living north of the Nanticoke—they may have held small portions of land in the western part of the state before migrating across the Chesapeake Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sonofthesouth.net/revolutionary-war/maps/captain-smith-virginia-map.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320024903/http://www.sonofthesouth.net/revolutionary-war/maps/captain-smith-virginia-map.jpg |archive-date=March 20, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kuskarawocks were most likely the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]].

The Unami Lenape in the Delaware Valley were closely related to [[Munsee]] Lenape tribes along the [[Hudson River]]. They had a settled hunting and agricultural society, and they rapidly became middlemen in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their ancient enemy, the Minqua or [[Susquehannock]]. With the loss of their lands on the Delaware River and the destruction of the Minqua by the [[Iroquois]] of the Five Nations in the 1670s, the remnants of the Lenape who wished to remain identified as such left the region and moved over the [[Alleghany Mountains]] by the mid-18th century. Generally, those who did not relocate out of the state of Delaware were baptized, became Christian and were grouped together with other persons of color in official records and in the minds of their non-Native American neighbors.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Colonial Delaware===
{{Main|New Netherland|New Sweden|Delaware Colony}}
[[File:NouvSuede.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|New Sweden—encounter between Swedish colonists and the natives of Delaware]]

The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] were the first Europeans to settle in present-day Delaware in the middle region by establishing a trading post at [[Zwaanendael, Delaware|Zwaanendael]], near the site of [[Lewes, Delaware|Lewes]] in 1631. Within a year all the settlers were killed in a dispute with [[Native Americans in the United States|area Native American tribes]]. In 1638 [[New Sweden]], a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] trading post and colony, was established at [[Fort Christina]] (now in [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]]) by [[Peter Minuit]] at the head of a group of Swedes, [[Finnish people|Finns]] and Dutch. The colony of New Sweden lasted 17 years. In 1651 the Dutch, reinvigorated by the leadership of [[Peter Stuyvesant]], established a fort at present-day [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]], and in 1655 they conquered the New Sweden colony, annexing it into the Dutch [[New Netherland]].&lt;ref name=hod&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Delaware|first =John A |last = Munroe|edition = 5th, illustrated|publisher= University of Delaware Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-87413-947-1|page=45|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vs7NcOKnlNUC&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=%22Lower%20counties%22%20%22on%20the%20delaware%22&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Lower%20counties%22%20%22on%20the%20delaware%22 | chapter = 3.

Fighting off a prior claim by [[Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore]], [[Province of Maryland|Proprietor of Maryland]], the Duke passed his somewhat dubious ownership on to [[William Penn]] in 1682. Penn strongly desired access to the sea for his [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania province]] and leased what then came to be known as the &quot;Lower Counties on the Delaware&quot;&lt;ref name = hod /&gt; from the Duke.

Penn established representative government and briefly combined his two possessions under one General Assembly in 1682. However, by 1704 the Province of Pennsylvania had grown so large that their representatives wanted to make decisions without the assent of the Lower Counties, and the two groups of representatives began meeting on their own, one at [[Philadelphia]], and the other at New Castle. Penn and his heirs remained proprietors of both and always appointed the same person Governor for their Province of Pennsylvania and their territory of the Lower Counties. The fact that Delaware and Pennsylvania shared the same governor was not unique. From 1703 to 1738 New York and New Jersey shared a governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Lurie |first = Mappen M |title = Encyclopedia of New Jersey |publisher = Rutgers University Press |year = 2004 |isbn = 978-0-8135-3325-4 |page = 327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massachusetts and New Hampshire also shared a governor for some time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Mayo |first = LS |title = John Wentworth, Governor of New Hampshire: 1767–1775 |publisher = Harvard University Press |year = 1921 |page = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dependent in early years on indentured labor, Delaware imported more slaves as the number of English [[immigrants]] decreased with better economic conditions in England. The colony became a slave society and cultivated tobacco as a cash crop, although English immigrants continued to arrive.

===American Revolution===

Like the other middle colonies, the Lower Counties on the Delaware initially showed little enthusiasm for a break with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]]. The citizenry had a good relationship with the Proprietary government, and generally were allowed more independence of action in their Colonial Assembly than in other colonies. Merchants at the port of Wilmington had trading ties with the British.

So it was that New Castle lawyer [[Thomas McKean]] denounced the [[Stamp Act]] in the strongest terms, and Kent County native [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] became the &quot;Penman of the Revolution&quot;. Anticipating the Declaration of Independence, [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] leaders Thomas McKean and [[Caesar Rodney]] convinced the Colonial Assembly to declare itself separated from British and Pennsylvania rule on June 15, 1776. The person best representing Delaware's majority, [[George Read (signer)|George Read]], could not bring himself to vote for a Declaration of Independence. Only the dramatic overnight ride of Caesar Rodney gave the delegation the votes needed to cast Delaware's vote for independence.

Initially led by [[John Haslet]], Delaware provided one of the premier regiments in the [[Continental Army]], known as the &quot;Delaware Blues&quot; and nicknamed the &quot;[[Blue Hen Chicken|Blue Hen's Chicks]]&quot;. In August 1777 [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|General Sir William Howe]] led a British army through Delaware on his way to a victory at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] and capture of the city of Philadelphia. The only real engagement on Delaware soil was the [[Battle of Cooch's Bridge]], fought on September 3, 1777, at [[Cooch's Bridge]] in New Castle County, although there was a [[Clow Rebellion|minor Loyalist rebellion]] in 1778.

Following the Battle of Brandywine, Wilmington was occupied by the British, and [[Governor of Delaware|State President]] [[John McKinly]] was taken prisoner. The British remained in control of the Delaware River for much of the rest of the war, disrupting commerce and providing encouragement to an active [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] portion of the population, particularly in Sussex County. Because the British promised slaves of rebels freedom for fighting with them, escaped slaves flocked north to join their lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Simon | last = Schama | author-link = Simon Schama | title = Rough Crossings: Britain, the Slaves, and the American Revolution | place = New York | publisher = Harper Collins | year = 2006| title-link = Rough Crossings: Britain, the Slaves, and the American Revolution }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[American Revolution]], statesmen from Delaware were among the leading proponents of a strong central United States with equal representation for each state.

===Slavery and race===
Many colonial settlers came to Delaware from Maryland and Virginia, where the population had been increasing rapidly. The economies of these colonies were chiefly based on labor-intensive tobacco and increasingly dependent on African [[slaves]] because of a decline in working class immigrants from England. Most of the English colonists had arrived as [[indentured servant]]s (contracted for a fixed period to pay for their passage), and in the early years the line between servant and slave was fluid.

Most of the free African-American families in Delaware before the Revolution had migrated from Maryland to find more affordable land. They were descendants chiefly of relationships or marriages between white servant women and enslaved, servant or free African or African-American men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/ | first = Paul | last = Heinegg | title = Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware | accessdate = February 15, 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100807191511/http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/ | archive-date = August 7, 2010 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under slavery law, children took the social status of their mothers, so children born to white women were free, regardless of their paternity, just as children born to enslaved women were born into slavery. As the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in England, more slaves were imported for labor and the caste lines hardened.

By the end of the colonial period, the number of enslaved people in Delaware began to decline. Shifts in the agriculture economy from tobacco to mixed farming resulted in less need for slaves' labor. In addition local [[Methodist]]s and [[Quaker]]s encouraged slaveholders to free their slaves following the American Revolution, and many did so in a surge of individual manumissions for idealistic reasons. By 1810 three-quarters of all blacks in Delaware were free. When John Dickinson freed his slaves in 1777, he was Delaware's largest slave owner with 37 slaves. By 1860, the largest slaveholder owned 16 slaves.{{Sfn |Kolchin |1994 |pp = 78, 81–82}}

Although attempts to abolish slavery failed by narrow margins in the legislature, in practical terms the state had mostly ended the practice. By the [[United States Census, 1860|1860 census]] on the verge of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], 91.7% of the black population were free;{{Sfn |Kolchin |1994 |pp = 81–82}} 1,798 were slaves, as compared to 19,829 &quot;free colored persons&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url = http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/php/start.php?year=V1860 |title = Historical Census Browser |contribution = 1860 Federal Census |publisher = University of Virginia Library |accessdate = November 30, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141011024040/http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/php/start.php?year=V1860 |archivedate = October 11, 2014 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An independent black denomination was chartered in 1813 by freed slave [[Peter Spencer (religious leader)|Peter Spencer]] as the &quot;[[Spencer Churches|Union Church of Africans]]&quot;. This followed the 1793 establishment in Philadelphia of the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] by [[Richard Allen (bishop)|Richard Allen]], which had ties to the Methodist Episcopal Church until 1816. Spencer built a church in Wilmington for the new denomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.udel.edu/BlackHistory/antebellum.html|first=Peter T.|last=Dalleo|title=The Growth of Delaware's Antebellum Free African Community|publisher=University of Delaware|date=June 27, 1997|access-date=June 21, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905050734/http://www.udel.edu/BlackHistory/antebellum.html|archive-date=September 5, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was renamed as the [[African Union First Colored Methodist Protestant Church and Connection]], more commonly known as the [[A.U.M.P. Church]]. In 1814, Spencer called for the first annual gathering, known as the [[Big August Quarterly]], which continues to draw members of this denomination and their descendants together in a religious and cultural festival.&lt;!-- the oldest such cultural festival in the nation {{needs citation||date=August 2018}} --&gt;

Delaware voted against [[secession]] on January 3, 1861, and so remained in the Union. While most Delaware citizens who fought in the war served in the regiments of the state, some served in companies on the Confederate side in [[Maryland Civil War Confederate units|Maryland]] and [[List of Virginia Civil War units|Virginia]] Regiments. Delaware is notable for being the only slave state from which no Confederate regiments or militia groups were assembled. Delaware essentially freed the few slaves who were still in bondage shortly after the Civil War, but rejected the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th]], [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th]], and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th]] Amendments to the Constitution; the 13th Amendment was rejected on February 8, 1865, the 14th Amendment was rejected on February 8, 1867, and the 15th Amendment was rejected on March 18, 1869. Delaware officially ratified the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments on February 12, 1901.

The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Wilmington]] and the [[Episcopal Diocese of Delaware]] oversee the parishes within their denominations. The A.U.M.P. Church, the oldest African-American denomination in the nation, was founded in Wilmington. It still has a substantial presence in the state. Reflecting new immigrant populations, an [[mosque|Islamic mosque]] has been built in the [[Ogletown, Delaware|Ogletown]] area, and a [[Hindu temple]] in [[Hockessin, Delaware|Hockessin]].

Delaware is home to an [[Amish]] community that resides west of [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]] in [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent County]], consisting of nine church districts and about 1,650 people. The Amish first settled in Kent County in 1915. In recent years, increasing development has led to the decline in the number of Amish living in the community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elizabethtown College, the Young Center for Anabaptist and Pietist Studies&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Roads===
{{further|Delaware State Route System}}
[[File:DE 1 near canal.JPG|right|thumb|[[Delaware Route&amp;nbsp;1]] (DE&amp;nbsp;1) is a partial [[toll road]] linking [[Fenwick Island, Delaware|Fenwick Island]] and [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]].]]

One major branch of the U.S. [[Interstate Highway System]], [[Interstate 95 in Delaware|Interstate&amp;nbsp;95]] (I-95), crosses Delaware southwest-to-northeast across New Castle County. In addition to I-95, there are six [[U.S. Highway System|U.S. highways]] that serve Delaware: [[U.S. Route 9 in Delaware|U.S.&amp;nbsp;9]], [[U.S. Route 13 in Delaware|U.S.&amp;nbsp;13]], [[U.S. Route 40 in Delaware|U.S.&amp;nbsp;40]], [[U.S. Route 113 in Delaware|U.S.&amp;nbsp;113]], [[U.S. Route 202 in Delaware|U.S.&amp;nbsp;202]], and [[U.S. Route 301 in Delaware|U.S.&amp;nbsp;301]]. There are also several state highways that cross the state of Delaware; a few of them include [[Delaware Route&amp;nbsp;1|DE&amp;nbsp;1]], [[Delaware Route 9|DE&amp;nbsp;9]], and [[Delaware Route 404|DE&amp;nbsp;404]]. U.S.&amp;nbsp;13 and DE&amp;nbsp;1 are primary north–south highways connecting Wilmington and Pennsylvania with Maryland, with DE&amp;nbsp;1 serving as the main route between Wilmington and the [[Delaware beaches]]. DE&amp;nbsp;9 is a north–south highway connecting Dover and Wilmington via a scenic route along the [[Delaware Bay]]. U.S.&amp;nbsp;40 is a primary east–west route, connecting Maryland with New Jersey. DE&amp;nbsp;404 is another primary east–west highway connecting the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]] in Maryland with the Delaware beaches. The state also operates three toll highways, the Delaware Turnpike, which is I-95, between Maryland and New Castle; the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway, which is DE&amp;nbsp;1, between Wilmington and Dover; and the U.S. 301 toll road between the Maryland border and DE{{nbsp}}1 in New Castle County.

A bicycle route, [[Delaware Bicycle Route&amp;nbsp;1]], spans the north–south length of the state from the Maryland border in [[Fenwick Island, Delaware|Fenwick Island]] to the Pennsylvania border north of [[Montchanin, Delaware|Montchanin]]. It is the first of several signed bike routes planned in Delaware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deldot.gov/information/projects/bike_and_ped/bike_facilities/pages/regional_routes.shtml|publisher=Delaware Department of Transportation|title=Projects: Delaware Bicycle Facility Master Plan|accessdate=September 28, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918130554/https://www.deldot.gov/information/projects/bike_and_ped/bike_facilities/pages/regional_routes.shtml|archive-date=September 18, 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delaware has about 1,450 bridges, 95 percent of which are under the supervision of DelDOT. About 30 percent of all Delaware bridges were built before 1950, and about 60 percent of the number are included in the [[National Bridge Inventory]]. Some bridges not under DelDOT supervision includes the four bridges on the [[Chesapeake and Delaware Canal]], which are under the jurisdiction of the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], and the [[Delaware Memorial Bridge]], which is under the bi-state [[Delaware River and Bay Authority]].

It has been noted that the [[tar and chip]] composition of secondary roads in Sussex County makes them more prone to [[Road surface#Surface deterioration|deterioration]] than are the [[Asphalt concrete|asphalt]] roadways in almost the rest of the state.&lt;ref name=nj20110417&gt;{{cite news |location=Wilmington, Delaware |title=Anything Once: On the road, taking plenty of pot shots |author=Justin Williams |url=http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20110417/NEWS02/304170008/-1/NLETTER01/On-the-road--taking-plenty-of-pot-shots |newspaper=News Journal |publisher=Gannett |date=April 17, 2011 |at=DelawareOnline |accessdate=April 17, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these roads, Sussex (county road) 236 is among the most problematic.&lt;ref name=nj20110417/&gt;

===Ferries===
[[File:MVDelaware.jpg|thumb|right|Cape May–Lewes Ferry]]

Three ferries operate in the state of Delaware:
* [[Cape May–Lewes Ferry]] crosses the mouth of Delaware Bay between Lewes, Delaware, and [[Cape May, New Jersey]].
* [[Woodland Ferry]] (a [[cable ferry]]) crosses the [[Nanticoke River]] southwest of [[Seaford, Delaware|Seaford]].
* [[Forts Ferry Crossing]] connects [[Delaware City]] with [[Fort Delaware]] and [[Fort Mott (New Jersey)|Fort Mott]], New Jersey.

===Rail and bus===
[[File:Wilmington Station from parking garage, July 2014.JPG|thumb|left|Wilmington Station]]

[[Amtrak]] has two stations in Delaware along the [[Northeast Corridor]]; the relatively quiet [[Newark Rail Station (Delaware)|Newark Rail Station]] in Newark, and the busier [[Wilmington station (Delaware)|Wilmington Rail Station]] in Wilmington. The Northeast Corridor is also served by [[SEPTA]]'s [[Wilmington/Newark Line]] of [[SEPTA Regional Rail|Regional Rail]], which serves [[Claymont station|Claymont]], Wilmington, [[Churchmans Crossing, Delaware|Churchmans Crossing]], and Newark.

Two [[Class I railroad]]s, [[Norfolk Southern]] and [[CSX]], provide freight rail service in northern New Castle County. Norfolk Southern provides freight service along the Northeast Corridor and to industrial areas in [[Edgemoor, Delaware|Edgemoor]], [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]], and [[Delaware City, Delaware|Delaware City]]. CSX's [[Philadelphia Subdivision]] passes through northern New Castle County parallel to the Amtrak Northeast Corridor. Multiple [[short-line railroad]]s provide freight service in Delaware. The [[Delmarva Central Railroad]] operates the most trackage of the short-line railroads, running from an interchange with Norfolk Southern in [[Porter, Delaware|Porter]] south through [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]], [[Harrington, Delaware|Harrington]], and [[Seaford, Delaware|Seaford]] to [[Delmar, Delaware|Delmar]], with another line running from Harrington to [[Frankford, Delaware|Frankford]] and branches from [[Ellendale, Delaware|Ellendale]] to [[Milton, Delaware|Milton]] and from [[Georgetown, Delaware|Georgetown]] to [[Gravel Hill, Delaware|Gravel Hill]]. The Delmarva Central Railroad connects with the [[Maryland and Delaware Railroad]], which serves local customers in Sussex County.&lt;ref name=dcr&gt;{{cite web|title=Delmarva Central Railroad|publisher=Carload Express|url=http://carloadexpress.com/railroads/delmarva-central-railroad/|accessdate=March 27, 2017|date=November 8, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524215403/http://carloadexpress.com/railroads/delmarva-central-railroad/|archive-date=May 24, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; CSX connects with the freight/[[heritage railroad|heritage]] operation, the [[Wilmington and Western Railroad]], based in Wilmington and the [[East Penn Railroad]], which operates a line from Wilmington to [[Coatesville, Pennsylvania]].

The last north-south passenger trains through the main part of Delaware was the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]'s local Wilmington-Delmar train in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Pennsylvania Railroad local division timetable, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freight only: {{cite journal |title=Pennsylvania Railroad, Table 155|journal=Official Guide of the Railways |publisher=National Railway Publication Company |volume=99 |issue=7 |date=December 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a successor to the ''[[Del-Mar-Va Express]]'' and ''Cavalier'', which had run from Philadelphia through the state's interior, to the end of the Delmarva Peninsula until the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first = Christopher T |last = Baer |title = Named Trains of The PRR Including Through Services |year = 2009 |url = http://www.prrths.com/Hagley/PRR%20NAMED%20TRAINS.pdf |publisher = PRRTHS |access-date = July 25, 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131014024426/http://www.prrths.com/Hagley/PRR%20NAMED%20TRAINS.pdf |archive-date = October 14, 2013 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;All named trains were gone by the end of 1957 {{cite journal |title=Pennsylvania Railroad, Table 65|journal=Official Guide of the Railways |publisher=National Railway Publication Company |volume=90 |issue=7 |date=December 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[DART First State]] public transportation system was named &quot;Most Outstanding Public Transportation System&quot; in 2003 by the [[American Public Transportation Association]]. Coverage of the system is broad within northern New Castle County with close association to major highways in Kent and Sussex counties. The system includes bus, subsidized passenger rail operated by Philadelphia transit agency SEPTA, and subsidized taxi and [[paratransit]] modes. The paratransit system, consisting of a statewide door-to-door bus service for the elderly and disabled, has been described by a Delaware state report as &quot;the most generous paratransit system in the United States&quot;.&lt;ref name=montgomery2012nj/&gt; {{As of|2012}}, fees for the paratransit service have not changed since 1988.&lt;ref name=montgomery2012nj/&gt;

===Air===
{{see also|Aviation in Delaware}}

{{As of|2016}}, there is no scheduled air service from any Delaware airport, as has been the case in various years since 1991. Various airlines had served [[Wilmington Airport (Delaware)|Wilmington Airport]], the latest departure being [[Frontier Airlines]] in April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Wilmington Airport (Delaware)|Wilmington Airport]] for history and details.&lt;/ref&gt;

Delaware is centrally situated in the [[Northeast megalopolis]] region of cities along [[Interstate 95|I-95]]. Therefore, Delaware [[commercial airline]] passengers most frequently use [[Philadelphia International Airport]] (PHL), [[Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport]] (BWI) and [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] (IAD) for domestic and international transit. Residents of Sussex County will also use [[Wicomico Regional Airport]] (SBY), as it is located less than {{convert|10|mi|km}} from the Delaware border. [[Atlantic City International Airport]] (ACY), [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] (EWR), and [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]] (DCA) are also within a {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}} radius of New Castle County.

Other general aviation airports in Delaware include [[Summit Airport (Delaware)|Summit Airport]] near [[Middletown, Delaware|Middletown]], [[Delaware Airpark]] near [[Cheswold, Delaware|Cheswold]], and [[Delaware Coastal Airport]] near [[Georgetown, Delaware|Georgetown]].

[[Dover Air Force Base]], one of the largest in the country, is home to the [[436th Airlift Wing]] and the [[512th Airlift Wing]]. In addition to its other responsibilities in the [[Air Mobility Command]], it serves as the entry point and [[mortuary]] for U.S. military personnel (and some civilians) who die overseas.

==Law and government==
Delaware's fourth and current constitution, adopted in 1897, provides for executive, judicial and legislative branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Delaware Constitution of 1897 as amended|url=http://delcode.delaware.gov/constitution/|website=State of Delaware|accessdate=August 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908150654/http://www.delcode.delaware.gov/constitution/|archive-date=September 8, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative branch===
[[File:Delaware State Capitol.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Delaware General Assembly]] meets in the [[Delaware State Capitol|Legislative Hall]] in [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]].]]

The [[Delaware General Assembly]] consists of a [[Delaware House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] with 41 members and a [[Delaware Senate|Senate]] with 21 members. It sits in Dover, the state capital. Representatives are elected to two-year terms, while senators are elected to four-year terms. The Senate confirms judicial and other nominees appointed by the governor.

Delaware's U.S. Senators are [[Tom Carper]] (Democrat) and [[Chris Coons]] (Democrat). Delaware's single U.S. Representative is [[Lisa Blunt Rochester]] (Democrat).

===Judicial branch===
The Delaware Constitution establishes a number of courts:
* The [[Delaware Supreme Court]] is the state's highest court.
* The [[Delaware Superior Court]] is the state's trial court of general jurisdiction.
* The [[Delaware Court of Chancery]] deals primarily in corporate disputes.
* The Family Court handles domestic and custody matters.
* The [[Delaware Court of Common Pleas]] has jurisdiction over a limited class of civil and criminal matters.

Minor non-constitutional courts include the [[Justice of the Peace]] Courts and Aldermen's Courts.

Significantly, Delaware has one of the few remaining Courts of [[Court of equity|Chancery]] in the nation, which has jurisdiction over [[Equity (law)|equity]] cases, the vast majority of which are corporate disputes, many relating to [[mergers and acquisitions]]. The [[Delaware Court of Chancery|Court of Chancery]] and the Delaware Supreme Court have developed a worldwide reputation for rendering concise opinions concerning [[corporate law]] which generally (but not always) grant broad discretion to corporate boards of directors and officers. In addition, the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]], which forms the basis of the Courts' opinions, is widely regarded as giving great flexibility to corporations to manage their affairs. For these reasons, Delaware is considered to have the most business-friendly legal system in the United States; therefore a great number of companies are [[incorporated in Delaware]], including 60% of the companies listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name=&quot;divcorpabout&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.corp.delaware.gov/aboutagency.shtml |title= About Agency|accessdate= July 23, 2008 |publisher =Delaware Division of Corporations|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070228002805/http://www.state.de.us/corp/aboutagency.shtml |archivedate=February 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Executive branch===
{{See also|List of Governors of Delaware}}

The executive branch is headed by the [[Governor of Delaware]]. The present governor is [[John C. Carney Jr.|John Carney]] (Democrat), who took office January 17, 2017. The lieutenant governor is [[Bethany Hall-Long]]. The governor presents a &quot;[[State of the State]]&quot; speech to a [[joint session]] of the Delaware legislature annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.delawarestatehouse.com/ |year=2010 |title=Delaware House of Representatives Minority Caucus |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416030742/http://www.delawarestatehouse.com/ |archivedate=April 16, 2009 |accessdate=January 24, 2001 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counties===
Delaware is subdivided into [[List of counties in Delaware|three counties]]; from north to south they are [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]], [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent]] and [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex]]. This is the fewest among all states. Each county elects its own legislative body (known in New Castle and Sussex counties as '''County Council''', and in Kent County as '''Levy Court'''), which deal primarily in zoning and development issues. Most functions which are handled on a county-by-county basis in other states—such as court and law enforcement—have been centralized in Delaware, leading to a significant concentration of power in the Delaware state government. The counties were historically divided into [[Hundred (country subdivision)|hundreds]], which were used as tax reporting and voting districts until the 1960s, but now serve no administrative role, their only current official legal use being in real estate title descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.delaware.gov/museums/vc/vc_hundreds.shtml |title=The Hundreds of Delaware |website=Department of State: Division of Historical and Cultural Affairs |publisher=Delaware State Archives |accessdate=September 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617061234/http://history.delaware.gov/museums/vc/vc_hundreds.shtml |archivedate=June 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
{{Main|Politics of Delaware}}
[[File:DNC Biden (28276763694).jpg|thumb|upright|Delaware Senator [[Chris Coons]] with Vice President [[Joe Biden]] in 2016]]

The Democratic Party holds a [[pluralism (political theory)|plurality]] of registrations in Delaware. Until the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], the state tended to be a Presidential [[bellwether]], sending its three [[electoral votes]] to the winning candidate since 1952. This trend ended in 2000 when Delaware's electoral votes went to [[Al Gore]] by 20-percentage points. In 2004, [[John Kerry]] won Delaware by eight-percentage points. In 2008, Democrat [[Barack Obama]] defeated Republican [[John McCain]] in Delaware by 25-percentage points. Obama's [[running mate]] was [[Joe Biden]], who had represented Delaware in the [[United States Senate]] since 1973. Obama carried Delaware by 19-percentage points in 2012. In 2016, Delaware's electoral votes went to [[Hillary Clinton]] by 11-percentage points.

Delaware's swing to the Democrats is in part due to a strong Democratic trend in New Castle County, home to 55 percent of Delaware's population (the two smaller counties have only 359,000 people between them to New Castle's 535,000). New Castle has not voted Republican in a presidential election since 1988. In 1992, 2000, 2004, and 2016, the Republican presidential candidate carried both Kent and Sussex but lost by double digits each time in New Castle, which was a large enough margin to swing the state to the Democrats. New Castle also elects a substantial majority of the legislature; 27 of the 41 state house districts and 14 of the 21 state senate districts are based in New Castle.

The Democrats have held the governorship since 1993, having won the last seven gubernatorial elections in a row. Democrats presently hold all the nine statewide elected offices, while the Republicans last won two statewide offices in 2014, [[State Auditor]] and [[State Treasurer]].

===Freedom of information===
{{see also|Freedom of information in the United States#State legislation}}

Each of the 50 states of the United States has passed some form of freedom of information legislation, which provides a mechanism for the general public to request information of the government.{{citation needed|date = April 2011}} In 2011 Delaware passed legislation placing a 15 business day time limit on addressing freedom-of-information requests, to either produce information or an explanation of why such information would take longer than this time to produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Bennett | first1 = Rep. | first2 = Sen. | last2 = Peterson | first3 = Sen. | last3 = Katz | date = January 6, 2011 | publication-date = April 15, 2011 | contribution = An Act to Amend Title 29 of the Delaware Code Relating to the Freedom of Information Act | accessdate = April 22, 2011 | contribution-url = http://legis.delaware.gov/lis/lis146.nsf/vwlegislation/HB+5 | edition = online | title = Delaware Code | volume = 78 | at = 10 | id = House Bill # 5 | url = http://legis.delaware.gov/LIS/lis146.nsf/vwLegislation/HB+5/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111002095945/http://legis.delaware.gov/lis/lis146.nsf/vwlegislation/HB+5 | archive-date = October 2, 2011 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxation===
Tax is collected by the [[Delaware Division of Revenue]].&lt;ref&gt;https://revenue.delaware.gov/&lt;/ref&gt;

Delaware has six different [[income tax]] brackets, ranging from 2.2% to 5.95%. The state does not assess [[sales tax]] on consumers. The state does, however, impose a tax on the gross receipts of most businesses. Business and occupational license tax rates range from 0.096% to 1.92%, depending on the category of business activity.

Delaware does not assess a state-level tax on real or personal property. Real estate is subject to county [[property tax]]es, school district property taxes, vocational school district taxes, and, if located within an incorporated area, municipal property taxes.

[[Gambling in the United States#Authorized types|Gambling]] provides significant revenue to the state. For instance, the [[Delaware Park Racetrack#Casino|casino at Delaware Park Racetrack]] provided more than $100&amp;nbsp;million to the state in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Delaware crime: Wave of brazen attacks sounds alarm at casino |first=Chris |last=Barrish |url=http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20110423/NEWS01/104230342/-1/NLETTER01/Wave-of-brazen-attacks-sounds-alarm-at-casino |publisher=Gannett |location=Wilmington, DE |date=April 23, 2011 |work=Delaware Online |accessdate=April 23, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ygCHfM0y?url=http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20110423/NEWS01/104230342/-1/NLETTER01/Wave-of-brazen-attacks-sounds-alarm-at-casino |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |at=1st page of online article archived via link provided |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

Delaware was the origin of ''[[Belton v. Gebhart]]'', one of the four cases which were combined into ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decision that led to the end of officially [[racial segregation|segregated]] public schools. Significantly, ''Belton'' was the only case in which the state court found for the plaintiffs, thereby ruling that segregation is unconstitutional.

Unlike many states, Delaware's educational system is centralized in a state Superintendent of Education, with local school boards retaining control over taxation and some curriculum decisions. This centralized system, combined with the small size of the state, likely contributed to Delaware becoming the first state, after completion of a three-year, $30{{nbsp}}million program ending in 1999, to wire every classroom in all K-12 schools to the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|last=Millard|first=Sandra K.|date=October 29, 1999|title=University of Delaware Library / Statewide K-12 Partnership Providing Online Resources and Training: UDLib/SEARCH|url=https://archive.org/details/ERIC_ED450718/|conference=EDUCAUSE '99|location=Long Beach, California|volume=|pages=|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rehoboth Beach often bills itself as &quot;The Nation's Summer Capital&quot; because it is a frequent summer vacation destination for Washington, D.C. residents as well as visitors from Maryland, Virginia, and in lesser numbers, Pennsylvania. Vacationers are drawn for many reasons, including the town's charm, artistic appeal, nightlife, and tax free shopping. According to SeaGrant Delaware, the Delaware Beaches generate $6.9&amp;nbsp;billion annually and over $711&amp;nbsp;million in tax revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Contribution of The Coastal Economy to the State of Delaware|publisher=SeaGrant Delaware|url=https://www.deseagrant.org/research/contribution-coastal-economy-state-delaware|accessdate=April 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402082704/https://www.deseagrant.org/research/contribution-coastal-economy-state-delaware|archive-date=April 2, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Delaware has no franchises in the major American professional sports leagues, many Delawareans follow either [[Sports in Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] or [[Sports in Baltimore|Baltimore]] teams. In the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]], the [[Washington Mystics]] enjoy a major following due to the presence of Wilmington native and University of Delaware product [[Elena Delle Donne]]. The [[Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens football|University of Delaware's football team]] has a large following throughout the state with the [[Delaware State Hornets football|Delaware State University]] and [[Wesley College (Delaware)|Wesley College]] teams also enjoying a smaller degree of support.

Delaware is home to [[Dover International Speedway]] and [[Dover Downs]]. DIS, also known as the ''Monster Mile'', hosts two [[NASCAR]] race weekends each year, one in the late spring and one in the late summer. Dover Downs is a popular [[harness racing]] facility. It is the only co-located horse- and car-racing facility in the nation, with the Dover Downs track inside the DIS track.

Delaware is represented in [[USA Rugby League|rugby]] by 2015 expansion club, the [[Delaware Black Foxes]].

Delaware has been home to [[professional wrestling]] outfit [[Combat Zone Wrestling]] (CZW). CZW has been affiliated with the annual Tournament of Death and [[East Coast Wrestling Association|ECWA]] with its annual [[ECWA Super 8 Tournament|Super{{nbsp}}8 Tournament]].

Delaware's official state sport is [[bicycling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legis.delaware.gov/LIS/LIS147.NSF/vwLegislation/HB+235 |title=AN ACT TO AMEND TITLE 29 OF THE DELAWARE CODE RELATING TO THE DESIGNATION OF A STATE SPORT |access-date=July 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213444/http://www.legis.delaware.gov/LIS/LIS147.NSF/vwLegislation/HB+235 |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
