The '''Dravidian languages''' are a [[language family]] spoken by more than 215 million people, mainly in [[South India|southern India]] and northern [[Sri Lanka]], with pockets elsewhere in [[South Asia]].&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title= Overview of Dravidian languages |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Dravidian-languages|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[colonial era]], there have been small but significant immigrant communities outside South Asia in countries such as [[Mauritius]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Pakistan]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Philippines]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Australia]], and the [[United States]].

The Dravidian languages are first attested in the 2nd century BCE as [[Tamil-Brahmi]] script inscribed on the cave walls in the [[Madurai]] and [[Tirunelveli]] districts of [[Tamil Nadu]].{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=22}}{{efn|Earlier fragmentary finds have been claimed, e.g. at [[Keeladi|Keezhadi]] near [[Madurai]], [[Tamil Nadu]], but have not been conclusively established (see {{section link||Literature}}).}} The Dravidian languages with the most speakers are (in descending order of number of speakers) [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Kannada]] and [[Malayalam]], all of which have long literary traditions. Smaller literary languages are [[Tulu language|Tulu]] and [[Kodava language|Kodava]].{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|pp=20–21}}  There are also small groups of Dravidian-speaking [[List of Scheduled Tribes in India|scheduled tribes]], who live outside Dravidian-speaking areas, such as the [[Kurukh people|Kurukh]] in Eastern India and [[Gondi people|Gondi]] in Central India.&lt;ref name=&quot;West2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=West|first=Barbara A.|title=Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Asia and Oceania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pCiNqFj3MQsC&amp;pg=PA713|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-1913-7|page=713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only two Dravidian languages are spoken exclusively outside the post-1947 state of India: [[Brahui language|Brahui]] in the [[Balochistan]] region of Pakistan and Afghanistan; and Dhangar, a dialect of [[Kurukh language|Kurukh]], in parts of Nepal and Bhutan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aUDAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT72&amp;lpg=PT72&amp;dq=kurukh+people+bhutan+dravidian#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The History of Bhutan|first=Karma|last=Phuntsho|date=23 April 2013|publisher=Random House India|via=Google Books|isbn=9788184004113}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=December 2019}} Dravidian place names along the [[Arabian Sea]] coasts and Dravidian grammatical influence such as [[clusivity]] in the [[Indo-Aryan languages]], namely [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Konkani language|Konkani]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Marwari language|Marwari]], and [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], suggest that Dravidian languages were once spoken more widely across the [[Indian subcontinent]].{{sfnp|Erdosy|1995|p=271}}&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Bryant, Laurie L. Patton (2005), The Indo-Aryan controversy: evidence and inference in Indian history, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

Though some scholars have argued that the Dravidian languages may have been brought to India by migrations from the Iranian plateau in the fourth or third millennium BCE&lt;ref name=&quot;tls1963&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title=Tamil Culture | author=Tamil Literature Society | publisher=Academy of Tamil Culture | date=1963 |volume=10 | accessdate=2008-11-25 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cNUgAAAAMAAJ | quote=... together with the evidence of archaeology would seem to suggest that the original Dravidian-speakers entered India from Iran in the fourth millennium BC ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Andronov|2003|p=299}} or even earlier,&lt;ref name=&quot;mukherjee2001&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kumar2004&quot; /&gt; the Dravidian languages cannot easily be connected to any other language family and they could well be indigenous to India.{{sfnp|Avari|2007}}&lt;ref name=&quot;steven&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zB4n3MVozbUC&amp;pg=PA1118&amp;dq=Dravidian+languages|author=Amaresh Datta|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: Devraj to Jyoti, Volume 2|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|page=1118|isbn=9788126011940|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=Renfrew|Renfrew and Bahn conclude that several scenarios are compatible with the data, and that &quot;the linguistic jury is still very much out.&quot;&lt;ref name=Heggarty_Renfrew&gt;{{Citation|last1=Heggarty|first1=Paul|last2=Renfrew|first2=Collin|year=2014|chapter=South and Island Southeast Asia; Languages|editor-last1=Renfrew|editor-first1=Colin|editor-last2=Bahn|editor-first2=Paul|title=The Cambridge World Prehistory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vWbwAwAAQBAJ|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107647756}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Etymology==

The origin of the Sanskrit word ''{{IAST|drāviḍa}}'' is the word ''{{IAST|Tamiḷ}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tamil|last=Shulman|first=David|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kamil Zvelebil]] cites the forms such as ''dramila'' (in {{IAST|Daṇḍin}}&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s Sanskrit work ''Avanisundarīkathā'') ''{{IAST|damiḷa}}'' (found in the Sri Lankan (Ceylonese) chronicle ''[[Mahavamsa]]'') and then goes on to say, &quot;The forms ''damiḷa''/''damila'' almost certainly provide a connection of ''{{IAST|dr(a/ā)viḍa}}'' &quot; with the indigenous name of the Tamil language, the likely derivation being &quot;*''{{IAST|tamiṟ}}'' &gt; *''{{IAST|damiḷ}}'' &gt; ''{{IAST|damiḷa}}''- / ''damila''- and further, with the intrusive, 'hypercorrect' (or perhaps analogical) -''r''-, into ''{{IAST|dr(a/ā)viḍa}}''. The -''m''-/-''v''- alternation is a common enough phenomenon in Dravidian phonology&quot;.{{sfnp|Zvelebil|1990|p=xxi}}

Furthermore, another Dravidianist and linguist, [[Bhadriraju Krishnamurti]], in his book ''Dravidian Languages'' states:{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|loc=p. 2, footnote 2}} {{quote|Joseph (1989: IJDL 18.2:134-42) gives extensive references to the use of the term ''{{IAST|draviḍa}}'', ''dramila'' first as the name of a people, then of a country. Sinhala BCE inscriptions cite ''{{IAST|dameḍa}}''-, ''damela''- denoting Tamil merchants. Early Buddhist and Jaina sources used ''{{IAST|damiḷa}}''- to refer to a people of south India (presumably Tamil); ''{{IAST|damilaraṭṭha}}''- was a southern non-Aryan country; ''{{IAST|dramiḷa}}''-, ''{{IAST|dramiḍa}}'', and ''{{IAST|draviḍa}}''- were used as variants to designate a country in the south (''{{IAST|Bṛhatsamhita-}}'', ''Kādambarī'', ''Daśakumāracarita-'', fourth to seventh centuries CE) (1989: 134–138). It appears that ''{{IAST|damiḷa}}''- was older than ''{{IAST|draviḍa}}''- which could be its Sanskritization.}}

Based on what Krishnamurti states (referring to a scholarly paper published in the ''International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics''), the Sanskrit word ''{{IAST|draviḍa}}'' itself is later than ''{{IAST|damiḷa}}'' since the dates for the forms with -r- are centuries later than the dates for the forms without -r- (''{{IAST|damiḷa}}'', ''{{IAST|dameḍa}}''-, ''damela''- etc.).

== Discovery ==
The 14th century Sanskrit text ''[[Lilatilakam]]'', which is a grammar of [[Manipravalam]], states that the spoken languages of present-day Kerala and Tamil Nadu were similar, terming them as &quot;Dramiḍa&quot;. The author doesn't consider the &quot;Karṇṇāṭa&quot; (Kannada) and the &quot;Andhra&quot; (Telugu) languages as &quot;Dramiḍa&quot;, because they were very different from the language of the &quot;Tamil Veda&quot; (''[[Tiruvaymoli]]''), but states that some people would include them in the &quot;Dramiḍa&quot; category.{{sfn|Shulman|2016|p=6}}

In 1816, [[Alexander D. Campbell]] suggested the existence of a Dravidian language family in his ''Grammar of the Teloogoo Language'',&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Duncan Campbell (1816) [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_PubopwMmteIC ''A Grammar of the Teloogoo Language''], ''commonly termed the Gentoo, peculiar to the Hindoos inhabiting the north eastern provinces of the Indian peninsula'', College of Fort St. George Press, Madras {{oclc|416559272}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he and [[Francis Whyte Ellis|Francis W. Ellis]] argued that [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] descended from a common, non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] ancestor.{{sfnp|Sreekumar|2009}} In 1856 [[Robert Caldwell]] published his ''Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian Family of Languages'',&lt;ref&gt;Robert Caldwell (1856) [https://archive.org/details/cu31924023009966 ''A Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian Family of Languages''], Williams and Norgate, London {{oclc|20216805}}&lt;/ref&gt; which considerably expanded the Dravidian umbrella and established Dravidian as one of the major language groups of the world. Caldwell coined the term &quot;Dravidian&quot; for this family of languages, based on the usage of the [[Sanskrit]] word द्रविदा (Dravidā) in the work ''Tantravārttika'' by {{IAST|[[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa]]}}.{{sfnp|Zvelebil|1990|p=xx}} In his own words, Caldwell says,

{{quote|The word I have chosen is 'Dravidian', from {{IAST|Drāviḍa}}, the adjectival form of {{IAST|Draviḍa}}. This term, it is true, has sometimes been used, and is still sometimes used, in almost as restricted a sense as that of Tamil itself, so that though on the whole it is the best term I can find, I admit it is not perfectly free from ambiguity. It is a term which has already been used more or less distinctively by Sanskrit philologists, as a generic appellation for the South Indian people and their languages, and it is the only single term they ever seem to have used in this manner. I have, therefore, no doubt of the propriety of adopting it.{{sfnp|Caldwell|1856|p=4}}}} The 1961 publication of the ''Dravidian Etymological Dictionary'' by [[T. Burrow]] and [[M. B. Emeneau]] proved a notable event in the study of Dravidian linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/burrow/|title=A Dravidian etymological dictionary.|first1=T. (Thomas)|last1=Burrow|first2=M. B. ; 1904-; (Murray Barnson)|last2=Emeneau|date=7 February 1984|website=dsal.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
The Dravidian languages form a close-knit family. Most scholars agree on four groups: South (or South Dravidian{{nbsp}}I), South-Central (or South Dravidian{{nbsp}}II), Central, and North Dravidian, but there are different proposals regarding the relationship between these groups. Earlier classifications grouped Central and South-Central Dravidian in a single branch. Krishnamurti groups South-Central and South Dravidian.{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=21}} Languages recognized as [[List of official languages of India|official languages of India]] appear here in '''boldface'''.

Some authors deny that North Dravidian forms a valid subgroup, splitting it into Northeast (Kurukh–Malto) and Northwest (Brahui).{{sfnp|Ruhlen|1991|pp=138–141}} Their affiliation has been proposed based primarily on a small number of common phonetic developments, including:
* In some words, *k is retracted or spirantized, shifting to {{IPA|/x/}} in Kurukh and Brahui, {{IPA|/q/}} in Malto.
* In some words, *c is retracted to {{IPA|/k/}}.
* Word-initial *v develops to {{IPA|/b/}}. This development is, however, also found in several other Dravidian languages, including Kannada, Kodagu and Tulu.
McAlpin (2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=David W.|last=McAlpin|title=Velars, Uvulars and the Northern Dravidian hypothesis|year=2003|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=123 |issue=3|pages=521–546|doi=10.2307/3217749|jstor=3217749}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes that no exact conditioning can be established for the first two changes, and proposes that distinct Proto-Dravidian *q and *kʲ should be reconstructed behind these correspondences, and that Brahui, Kurukh-Malto, and the rest of Dravidian may be three coordinate branches, possibly with Brahui being the earliest language to split off. A few morphological parallels between Brahui and Kurukh-Malto are also known, but according to McAlpin they are analyzable as shared archaisms rather than shared innovations.

In addition, ''[[Ethnologue]]'' lists several unclassified Dravidian languages: [[Allar language|Allar]], [[Bazigar language|Bazigar]], [[Bharia language|Bharia]], [[Malankuravan language|Malankuravan]] (possibly a dialect of Malayalam), and [[Vishavan language|Vishavan]]. ''Ethnologue'' also lists several unclassified Southern Dravidian languages: [[Mala Malasar language|Mala Malasar]], [[Malasar language|Malasar]], [[Thachanadan language|Thachanadan]], [[Ullatan language|Ullatan]], [[Kalanadi language|Kalanadi]], [[Kumbaran language|Kumbaran]], [[Kunduvadi language|Kunduvadi]], [[Kurichiya language|Kurichiya]], [[Attapady Kurumba language|Attapady Kurumba]], [[Muduga language|Muduga]], [[Pathiya language|Pathiya]], and [[Wayanad Chetti language|Wayanad Chetti]].
[[Pattapu language|Pattapu]] may also be Southern.

A computational phylogenetic study of the Dravidian language family was undertaken by Kolipakam, et al. (2018).&lt;ref name=Kolipakam&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kolipakam |first1=Vishnupriya |last2=Jordan |first2=Fiona M. |last3=Dunn |first3=Michael |last4=Greenhill |first4=Simon J. |last5=Bouckaert |first5=Remco |last6=Gray |first6=Russell D. |last7=Verkerk |first7=Annemarie |title=A Bayesian phylogenetic study of the Dravidian language family |journal=Royal Society Open Science |date=21 March 2018 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=171504 |doi=10.1098/rsos.171504 |pmid=29657761 |pmc=5882685 |bibcode=2018RSOS....571504K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kolipakam, et al. (2018) supports the internal coherence of the four Dravidian branches South (or South Dravidian I), South-Central (or South Dravidian II), Central, and North, but is uncertain about the precise relationships of these four branches to each other. The date of Dravidian is estimated to be 4,500 years old.&lt;ref name=Kolipakam/&gt;

}}Since 1981, the [[Census of India]] has reported only languages with more than 10,000 speakers, including 17 Dravidian languages. In 1981, these accounted for approximately 24% of India's population.{{sfnp|Steever|1998|p=3}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Ishtiaq 1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Ishtiaq |first=M. |title=Language Shifts Among the Scheduled Tribes in India: A Geographical Study |year=1999 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers |location=Delhi |isbn=978-81-208-1617-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fkIgsfb95rAC|accessdate=7 September 2012|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[2001 Census of India|2001 census]], they included 214 million people, about 21% of India's total population of 1.02 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Abstract of speakers' strength of languages and mother tongues –2001 |url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/Statement1.aspx |accessdate=14 October 2017 |work=Census 2001 |publisher=Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner, India }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the largest Dravidian-speaking group outside India, Tamil speakers in Sri Lanka, number around 4.7 million. The total number of speakers of Dravidian languages is around 227 million people, around 13% of the population of the Indian subcontinent.

[[Telugu language|Telugu]] is the most spoken Dravidian language, with over 74 million native speakers. The total number of speakers of Telugu, including those whose first language is not Telugu, is around 84 million people, which is around 6% of India's total population.

The smallest branch of the Dravidian languages is the Central branch, which has only around 200,000 speakers. These languages are mostly tribal, and spoken in central India.

The second-smallest branch is the Northern branch, with around 6.3 million speakers. This is the only sub-group to have a language spoken in [[Pakistan]] — [[Brahui language|Brahui]].

The next-largest is the South-Central branch, which has 78 million native speakers, the vast majority of whom speak Telugu. This branch also includes the tribal language [[Gondi language|Gondi]] spoken in central India.

The largest group is South Dravidian, with almost 150 million speakers. [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Malayalam]], and [[Kannada language|Kannada]] make up around 98% of the speakers, with Tamil being by far the most spoken language, with almost half of all South Dravidian speakers speaking it.

==Proposed relations with other families==
[[File:South Asian Language Families.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Language families in South Asia]]

The Dravidian family has defied all of the attempts to show a connection with other languages, including [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Hurrian]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. Comparisons have been made not just with the other language families of the Indian subcontinent ([[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]], [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], and [[Nihali language|Nihali]]), but with all typologically similar language families of the Old World. Nonetheless, although there are no readily detectable genealogical connections, Dravidian shares strong [[areal feature]]s with the [[Indo-Aryan languages]], which have been attributed to a substratum influence from Dravidian.{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|pp=38–42}}

Dravidian languages display typological similarities with the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language group, suggesting to some a prolonged period of contact in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tyler | first1 = Stephen | year = 1968 | title = Dravidian and Uralian: the lexical evidence | url = | journal = Language | volume = 44 | issue = 4| pages = 798–812 | doi=10.2307/411899| jstor = 411899 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is popular amongst Dravidian linguists and has been supported by a number of scholars, including [[Robert Caldwell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Webb | first1 = Edward | year = 1860 | title = Evidences of the Scythian Affinities of the Dravidian Languages, Condensed and Arranged from Rev.

In the early 1970s, the linguist David McAlpin produced a detailed proposal of a genetic relationship between Dravidian and the extinct [[Elamite language]] of ancient [[Elam]] (present-day southwestern [[Iran]]).{{sfn|Zvelebil|1990|p=105}} The [[Elamo-Dravidian languages|Elamo-Dravidian]] hypothesis was supported in the late 1980s by the archaeologist [[Colin Renfrew]] and the geneticist [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza]], who suggested that Proto-Dravidian was brought to India by farmers from the Iranian part of the [[Fertile Crescent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Renfrew |first1=Colin |title=The Origins of Indo-European Languages |journal=Scientific American |date=October 1989 |volume=261 |issue=4 |pages=106–114 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1089-106 |bibcode=1989SciAm.261d.106R |jstor=24987446 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Cavalli-Sforza|2000|pp=157, 159}} (In his 2000 book, Cavalli-Sforza suggested western India, northern India and northern Iran as alternative starting points.{{sfn|Cavalli-Sforza|2000|pp=157, 160}}) However, linguists have found McAlpin's cognates unconvincing and criticized his proposed phonological rules as ''ad hoc''.{{sfn|Krishnamurti|2003|pp=44–45}}{{sfn|Steever|1998|p=37}}{{sfn|Campbell|Poser|2008|p=286}} Elamite is generally believed by scholars to be a [[language isolate]], and the theory has had no effect on studies of the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Matthew W. | last = Stolper | chapter = Elamite | editor-first = Roger D. | editor-last = Woodard | title = The Ancient Languages of Mesopotamia, Egypt and Aksum | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2008 | pages = 47–82 | isbn = 978-0-521-68497-2 }} p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dravidian is one of the primary language families in the [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic]] proposal, which would link most languages in North Africa, Europe and Western Asia into a family with its origins in the [[Fertile Crescent]] sometime between the [[Last Glacial Period]] and the emergence of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] 4,000–6,000 BCE. However, the general consensus is that such deep connections are not, or not yet, demonstrable.

==Prehistory==
The origins of the Dravidian languages, as well as their subsequent development and the period of their differentiation are unclear, partially due to the lack of [[comparative linguistics|comparative linguistic]] research into the Dravidian languages. Though some scholars have argued that the Dravidian languages may have been brought to India by migrations in the fourth or third millennium BCE&lt;ref name=&quot;tls1963&quot;/&gt;{{sfnp|Andronov|2003|p=299}} or even earlier,&lt;ref name=&quot;mukherjee2001&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title=High-resolution analysis of Y-chromosomal polymorphisms reveals signatures of population movements from central Asia and West Asia into India |author1=Namita Mukherjee |author2=Almut Nebel |author3=Ariella Oppenheim |author4=Partha P.

More recently, about 15,000–10,000 years before present (ybp), when agriculture developed in the Fertile Crescent region that extends from Israel through northern Syria to western Iran, there was another eastward wave of human migration (Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1994; Renfrew 1987), a part of which also appears to have entered India. This wave has been postulated to have brought the Dravidian languages into India (Renfrew 1987). Subsequently, the Indo-European (Aryan) language family was introduced into India about 4,000 ybp ... | pmid=11988631 | pages=125–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kumar2004&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title=Genetic Disorders of the Indian Subcontinent | author=Dhavendra Kumar | publisher=Springer | year=2004 | accessdate=2008-11-25 | isbn=1-4020-1215-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bpl0LXKj13QC | quote=...

===Proto-Dravidian and onset of diversification===
As a [[proto-language]],  the [[Proto-Dravidian]] language is not itself attested in the historical record. Its modern conception is based solely on reconstruction. It was suggested in the 1980s that the language was spoken in the 4th millennium BCE, and started disintegrating into various branches around 3rd millennium BCE.&lt;ref name=department&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=chvjAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=the+proto-+Dravidian+linguistic+community+disintegrated+at+the+beginning+of+the+4th+millennium+B.+C&amp;dq=the+proto-+Dravidian+linguistic+community+disintegrated+at+the+beginning+of+the+4th+millennium+B.+C&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y History and Archaeology, Volume 1, Issues 1-2] p.234, Department of Ancient History, Culture, and Archaeology, University of Allahabad&lt;/ref&gt; According to Krishnamurti, Proto-Dravidian may have been spoken in the Indus civilization, suggesting a &quot;tentative date of Proto-Dravidian around the early part of the third millennium.&quot;{{sfn|Krishnamurti|2003|p=501}} Krishnamurti further states that South Dravidian I (including pre-Tamil) and South Dravidian II (including Pre-Telugu) split around the eleventh century BCE, with the other major branches splitting off at around the same time.{{sfn|Krishnamurti|2003|p=501-502}} Kolipakam et al.

===Indus Valley Civilisation===
The [[Indus Valley civilisation]] (3,300–1,900 BCE), located in Northwestern [[Indian subcontinent]], is often understood to have been Dravidian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harappa.com/arrow/stone_celt_indus_signs.html |title=Stone celts in Harappa |last=Mahadevan |first=Iravatham |date=6 May 2006 |website=Harappa |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904034700/http://www.harappa.com/arrow/stone_celt_indus_signs.html |archivedate=4 September 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Already in 1924, when announcing the discovery of the IVC, [[John Marshall]] stated that (one of) the language(s) may have been Dravidic.&lt;ref&gt;M.T.

[[Yuri Knorozov]] surmised that the symbols represent a [[logosyllabic]] script and suggested, based on computer analysis, an underlying agglutinative Dravidian language as the most likely candidate for the underlying language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knorozov|1965|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knorozov's suggestion was preceded by the work of Henry Heras, who suggested several readings of signs based on a proto-Dravidian assumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heras|1953|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguist Asko Parpola writes that the Indus script and Harappan language are &quot;most likely to have belonged to the Dravidian family&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture: The Indo-Aryan Migration Debate|page=183|author=Edwin Bryant|publisher=Oxford|isbn=9780195169478|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parpola led a Finnish team in investigating the inscriptions using computer analysis. Based on a proto-Dravidian assumption, they proposed readings of many signs, some agreeing with the suggested readings of Heras and Knorozov (such as equating the &quot;fish&quot; sign with the Dravidian word for fish, &quot;min&quot;) but disagreeing on several other readings. A comprehensive description of Parpola's work until 1994 is given in his book ''Deciphering the Indus Script''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parpola|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indo-Aryan migrations and Sanskritization===

====Northern Dravidian pockets====
{{See also|Kurukh people|Malto people|Brahui language}}

Although in modern times speakers of the various Dravidian languages have mainly occupied the southern portion of India, in earlier times they probably were spoken in a larger area. After the [[Indo-Aryan migrations]] into north-western India, starting ca. 1500 BCE, and the establishment of the [[Kuru Kingdom|Kuru kingdom]] ca. 1100 BCE, a process of [[Sanskritisation]] started, which resulted in a [[language shift]] in northern India. Southern India has remained majority Dravidian, but pockets of Dravidian can be found in central India, Pakistan and Nepal.

The [[Kurukh people|Kurukh]] and [[Malto people|Malto]] are pockets of Dravidian languages in central India, spoken by people who may have migrated from south India. They do have myths about external origins.&lt;ref&gt;P. 83 ''The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture: The Indo-Aryan Migration'' Debate by Edwin Bryant&lt;/ref&gt; The Kurukh have traditionally claimed to be from the [[Deccan Peninsula]],&lt;ref&gt;P. 18 ''The Orāons of Chōtā Nāgpur: their history, economic life, and social organization.'' by Sarat Chandra Roy, Rai Bahadur;  Alfred C Haddon&lt;/ref&gt; more specifically [[Karnataka]]. The same tradition has existed of the Brahui,&lt;ref&gt;P. 12 ''Origin and Spread of the Tamils By V. R.'' Ramachandra Dikshitar&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;uszfyu&quot;&gt;P. 32 ''Ideology and status of Sanskrit : contributions to the history of the Sanskrit language'' by Jan E M Houben&lt;/ref&gt; who call themselves immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;P. 45 ''The Brahui language, an old Dravidian language spoken in parts of Baluchistan and Sind'' by [[Denys Bray|Sir Denys Bray]]&lt;/ref&gt; Holding this same view of the Brahui are many scholars &lt;ref&gt;''Ancient India; Culture and Thought'' By M. L. Bhagi&lt;/ref&gt; such as L.{{nbsp}}H. Horace Perera and M.{{nbsp}}Ratnasabapathy.&lt;ref&gt;P. 23 ''Ceylon &amp; Indian History from Early Times to 1505 A.D.'' By L. H. Horace Perera, M. Ratnasabapathy&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brahui people|Brahui]] population of Pakistan's [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan province]] has been taken by some as the linguistic equivalent of a [[relict]] population, perhaps indicating that Dravidian languages were formerly much more widespread and were supplanted by the incoming [[Indo-Aryan languages]].{{sfnp|Mallory|1989|p=44}}{{sfnp|Elst|1999|p=146}}{{sfnp|Trask|2000|p=97|ps=&quot;It is widely suspected that the extinct and undeciphered Indus Valley language was a Dravidian language, but no confirmation is available. The existence of the isolated northern outlier ''Brahui'' is consistent with the hypothesis that Dravidian formerly occupied much of North India but was displaced by the invading Indo-Aryan languages, and the presence in the Indo-Aryan languages of certain linguistic features, such as retroflex consonants, is often attributed to Dravidian substrate influence.&quot;}} However, it has been argued that the absence of any Old Iranian (Avestan) loanwords in Brahui suggests that the Brahui migrated to Balochistan from central India less than 1,000 years ago. The main Iranian contributor to Brahui vocabulary, [[Balochi language|Balochi]], is a western [[Iranian language]] like [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]], and arrived in the area from the west only around 1,000{{nbsp}}AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Josef | last = Elfenbein | title = A periplus of the 'Brahui problem' | journal = Studia Iranica | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | year = 1987 | pages = 215–233 | doi=10.2143/SI.16.2.2014604}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sound changes shared with Kurukh and Malto also suggest that Brahui was originally spoken near them in central India.{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|pp=27, 142}}

====Dravidian influence on Sanskrit====
{{main|Substratum in Vedic Sanskrit}}

Dravidian languages show extensive lexical (vocabulary) borrowing, but only a few traits of structural (either [[phonology|phonological]] or grammatical) borrowing from Indo-Aryan, whereas Indo-Aryan shows more structural than lexical borrowings from the Dravidian languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannicaOnline&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9109791 Dravidian languages.]&quot; [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. 2008. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 30 Jun. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these features are already present in the oldest known [[Indo-Aryan language]], the language of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' (c.{{nbsp}}1500 BCE), which also includes over a dozen words borrowed from Dravidian.{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=6}}

[[Vedic Sanskrit]] has [[retroflex consonant]]s ({{IAST|ṭ}}/{{IAST|ḍ}}, {{IAST|ṇ}}) with about 88 words in the ''Rigveda'' having unconditioned retroflexes.{{sfnp|Kuiper|1991}}{{sfnp|Witzel|1999}} Some sample words are ''{{IAST|Iṭanta}}'', ''{{IAST|Kaṇva}}'', ''{{IAST|śakaṭī}}'', ''{{IAST|kevaṭa}}'', ''{{IAST|puṇya}}'' and ''{{IAST|maṇḍūka}}''.
Since other [[Indo-European languages]], including other [[Indo-Iranian languages]], lack retroflex consonants, their presence in Indo-Aryan is often cited as evidence of substrate influence from close contact of the Vedic speakers with speakers of a foreign language family rich in retroflex consonants.{{sfnp|Kuiper|1991}}{{sfnp|Witzel|1999}} The Dravidian family is a serious candidate since it is rich in retroflex phonemes reconstructible back to the [[Proto-Dravidian language|Proto-Dravidian stage]].{{sfnp|Subrahmanyam|1983|p=40}}{{sfnp|Zvelebil|1990}}{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=36}}

In addition, a number of grammatical features of Vedic Sanskrit not found in its sister [[Avestan language]] appear to have been borrowed from Dravidian languages.  These include the [[gerund]], which has the same function as in Dravidian.{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|pp=36–37}} Some linguists explain this asymmetrical borrowing by arguing that Middle Indo-Aryan languages were built on a Dravidian [[substratum]].{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|pp=40–41}} These scholars argue that the most plausible explanation for the presence of Dravidian structural features in Indic is [[language shift]], that is, native Dravidian speakers learning and adopting Indic languages.{{sfnp|Erdosy|1995|p=18}} Although each of the innovative traits in Indic could be accounted for by internal explanations, early Dravidian influence is the only explanation that can account for all of the innovations at once; moreover, it accounts for several of the innovative traits in Indic better than any internal explanation that has been proposed.{{sfnp|Thomason|Kaufman|1988|pp=141–144}}

==Grammar==
The most characteristic grammatical features of Dravidian languages are:&lt;ref name=&quot;britannicaDVD&quot;/&gt;
* Dravidian languages are [[Agglutination|agglutinative]].
* Word order is [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV).
* Most Dravidian languages have a [[clusivity]] distinction (notably, [[Kannada]] does not).
* The major word classes are nouns (substantives, numerals, pronouns), adjectives, verbs, and indeclinables (particles, enclitics, adverbs, interjections, onomatopoetic words, echo words).
* Proto-Dravidian used only suffixes, never prefixes or infixes, in the construction of inflected forms. Hence, the roots of words always occurred at the beginning. Nouns, verbs, and indeclinable words constituted the original word classes.
* There are two numbers and four different gender systems, the ancestral system probably having &quot;male:non-male&quot; in the singular and &quot;person:non-person&quot; in the plural.
* In a sentence, however complex, only one finite verb occurs, normally at the end, preceded if necessary by a number of gerunds.
* Word order follows certain basic rules but is relatively free.
* The main (and probably original) dichotomy in tense is past:non-past. Present tense developed later and independently in each language or subgroup.
* Verbs are intransitive, transitive, and causative; there are also active and passive forms.
* All of the positive verb forms have their corresponding negative counterparts, [[negative verbs]].

==Phonology==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
Dravidian languages are noted for the lack of distinction between aspirated and unaspirated stops. While some Dravidian languages have accepted large numbers of loan words from [[Sanskrit]] and other [[Indo-Iranian languages]] in addition to their already vast vocabulary, in which the [[orthography]] shows distinctions in voice and [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]], the words are pronounced in Dravidian according to different rules of [[phonology]] and [[phonotactics]]: aspiration of [[plosives]] is generally absent, regardless of the spelling of the word. This is not a universal phenomenon and is generally avoided in formal or careful speech, especially when reciting. For instance, [[Tamil language|Tamil]] does not distinguish between voiced and voiceless stops. In fact, the [[Tamil alphabet]] lacks symbols for voiced and aspirated stops. Dravidian languages are also characterized by a three-way distinction between [[Dental consonant|dental]], [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]], and [[retroflex]] places of articulation as well as large numbers of [[Liquid consonant|liquids]].

===Proto-Dravidian===
{{main|Proto-Dravidian}}
Proto-Dravidian had five short and long vowels: ''*a'', ''*ā'', ''*i'', ''*ī'', ''*u'', ''*ū'', ''*e'', ''*ē'', ''*o'', ''*ō''. There were no diphthongs; ''ai'' and ''au'' are treated as *''ay'' and *''av'' (or *''aw'').{{sfnp|Subrahmanyam|1983}}{{sfnp|Zvelebil|1990}}{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=90}}
The five-vowel system is largely preserved in the descendent subgroups.{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=48}}

# This is the same as the word for another form of the number one in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Malayalam]], used as the [[indefinite article]] (&quot;a&quot;) and when the number is an [[Grammatical modifier|attribute]] preceding a noun (as in &quot;one person&quot;), as opposed to when it is a noun (as in &quot;How many are there?&quot; &quot;One&quot;).
# The stem *īr is still found in compound words, and has taken on a meaning of &quot;double&quot; in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]] and [[Malayalam]]. For example, ''irupatu'' (20, literally meaning &quot;double-ten&quot;), ''iravai'' (20 in Telugu), &quot;iraṭṭi&quot; (&quot;double&quot;) or ''iruvar'' (&quot;two people&quot;, in Tamil) and &quot;ippatthu&quot; (ipp-hatthu) literally meaning double ten in Kannada.
# The Kolami numbers 5 to 10 are borrowed from Telugu.
# The word ''tondu'' was also used to refer to the number nine in ancient [[Sangam literature|sangam]] texts but was later completely replaced by the word ''onpadu''.
# These forms are derived from &quot;one (less than) ten&quot;. Proto-Dravidian *toḷ is still used in Tamil and Malayalam as the basis of numbers such as 90, ''thonnooru''.
* Words indicated '''(II)''' are borrowings from [[Indo-Iranian languages]] (in Brahui's case, from [[Persian language|Persian]]).

==Literature==
[[File:Jambai Tamil Brahmi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Athiyamān Nedumān Añci|Jambai Tamil Brahmi inscription]] dated to the early [[Sangam period|Sangam age]]]]
Four Dravidian languages, [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Malayalam]], have lengthy literary traditions.{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=20}}
Literature in [[Tulu language|Tulu]] and [[Kodava language|Kodava]] is more recent.{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=20}}

The earliest known Dravidian inscriptions are 76 [[Tamil language#Old Tamil|Old Tamil]] inscriptions on cave walls in [[Madurai district|Madurai]] and [[Tirunelveli district|Tirunelveli]] districts in [[Tamil Nadu]], dating from the 2nd century BCE.{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=22}}
These inscriptions are written in a variant of the [[Brahmi script]] called [[Tamil Brahmi]].{{sfnp|Mahadevan|2003|pp=90–95}}
In 2019, the [[Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department]] released a report on excavations at [[Keeladi]], near [[Madurai]], [[Tamil Nadu]], including a description of potsherds dated to the 6th century BCE inscribed with personal names in the [[Tamil-Brahmi]] script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report

| editor1-first=R. | editor1-last=Sivanantham | editor2-first=M. | editor2-last=Seran
| location=Chennai | publisher=Department of Archaeology, Government of Tamil Nadu | year=2019
| pages=8–9, 14
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the report lacks the detail of a full archaeological study, and other archaeologists have disputed whether the oldest dates obtained for the site can be assigned to these potsherds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The earliest long text in Old Tamil is the ''[[Tolkāppiyam]]'', an early work on Tamil grammar and poetics, whose oldest layers could date from the 1st century BCE.{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=22}}

Kannada is first known from the [[Halmidi inscription]] (450 CE).  A 9th-century treatise on poetics, the ''[[Kavirajamarga]]'', is the first literary work.{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=23}}
The earliest Telugu inscription, from Erragudipadu in [[Kadapa district]], is dated 575.  The first literary work is an 11th-century translation of part of the ''[[Mahābhārata]]''.{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=23}}
The earliest Malayalam text is the [[Vazhappally copper plate]] (9th century).  The first literary work is ''Rāmacaritam'' (12th century).{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=22}}
