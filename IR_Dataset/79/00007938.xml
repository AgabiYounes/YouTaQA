'''Diatomic molecules''' are [[molecule]]s composed of only two [[atom]]s, of the same or different [[chemical element]]s. The prefix ''di-'' is of Greek origin, meaning &quot;two&quot;. If a diatomic molecule consists of two atoms of the same element, such as [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), then it is said to be [[homonuclear molecule|homonuclear]]. Otherwise, if a diatomic molecule consists of two different atoms, such as [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) or [[nitric oxide]] (NO), the molecule is said to be [[heteronuclear molecule|heteronuclear]]. The bond in a homonuclear diatomic molecule is non-polar.

[[File:Diatomic molecules periodic table.svg|thumb|450px|A [[periodic table]] showing the elements that exist as [[homonuclear molecule|homonuclear]] diatomic molecules under typical laboratory conditions.]]

The only [[chemical element]]s that form stable [[homonuclear molecule|homonuclear]] diatomic molecules at [[standard temperature and pressure]] (STP) (or typical laboratory conditions of 1 [[bar (pressure)|bar]] and 25&amp;nbsp;°C) are the [[gas]]es [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[fluorine]] (F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[chlorine]] (Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=C.R.|title=Handbook of Chemistry and Physics|year=2012|chapter-url=http://www.hbcpnetbase.com//articles/04_01_91.pdf|chapter=Section 4: Properties of the Elements and Inorganic Compounds}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[noble gas]]es ([[helium]], [[neon]], [[argon]], [[krypton]], [[xenon]], and [[radon]]) are also gases at STP, but they are [[monatomic]]. The homonuclear diatomic gases and noble gases together are called &quot;elemental gases&quot; or &quot;molecular gases&quot;, to distinguish them from other gases that are [[chemical compound]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Emsley, J. |title= The Elements |publisher= Oxford: Clarendon Press |year= 1989 |pages= 22–23 |id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At slightly elevated temperatures, the halogens [[bromine]] (Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[iodine]] (I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) also form diatomic gases.&lt;ref name=Chemistry&gt;{{cite book|title=Chemistry|author=Whitten, Kenneth W.|author2=Davis, Raymond E.|author3=Peck, M. Larry|author4=Stanley, George G.|year=2010|publisher=Brooks/Cole, Cengage Learning|pages=337–338|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Zwu9-qT0qQC&amp;pg=PA337#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=9th|isbn=9780495391630}}&lt;/ref&gt; All halogens have been observed as diatomic molecules, except for [[astatine]], which is uncertain.

The mnemonics '''BrINClHOF''', pronounced &quot;Brinklehof&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mnemonic-device.com/chemistry/brinclhof-pronounced-brinklehoff/|title=Mnemonic BrINClHOF (pronounced Brinklehoff) in Chemistry|language=en|access-date=2019-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''HONClBrIF''', pronounced &quot;Honkelbrif&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;sherman&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sherman|first1=Alan|title=Chemistry and Our Changing World|date=1992|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780131315419|page=82|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ai8YAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=honclbrif&amp;dq=honclbrif}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''HOFBrINCl''' (pronounced as Hofbrinkle) have been coined to aid recall of the list of diatomic elements.

Other elements form diatomic molecules when evaporated, but these diatomic species repolymerize when cooled. Heating (&quot;cracking&quot;) elemental phosphorus gives [[diphosphorus]], P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Sulfur vapor is mostly [[disulfur]] (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). [[Dilithium]] (Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and disodium (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lu |first1=Z.W. |last2=Wang |first2=Q. |last3=He |first3=W.M. |last4=Ma |first4=Z.G. |title=New parametric emissions in diatomic sodium molecules |journal=Applied Physics B |date=July 1996 |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=43–46 |doi=10.1007/BF01112836 |bibcode=1996ApPhB..63...43L }}&lt;/ref&gt; are known in the gas phase. Ditungsten (W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and dimolybdenum (Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) form with [[sextuple bond]]s in the gas phase. [[Dirubidium]] (Rb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is diatomic.

==Heteronuclear molecules==
All other diatomic molecules are [[chemical compound]]s of two different elements. Many elements can combine to form [[heteronuclear molecule|heteronuclear]] diatomic molecules, depending on temperature and pressure.

Examples are gases [[carbon monoxide]] (CO), [[nitric oxide]] (NO), and [[hydrogen chloride]] (HCl).

Many 1:1 [[binary compound]]s are not normally considered diatomic because they are [[polymer]]ic at room temperature, but they form diatomic molecules when evaporated, for example gaseous MgO, SiO, and many others.

==Occurrence==
Hundreds of diatomic molecules have been identified&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Huber, K. P. |author2=Herzberg, G. |title= Molecular Spectra and Molecular Structure IV. Constants of Diatomic Molecules |publisher= New York: Van Nostrand: Reinhold |year= 1979 |id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the environment of the Earth, in the laboratory, and in [[list of molecules in interstellar space|interstellar space]]. About 99% of the [[Earth's atmosphere]] is composed of two species of diatomic molecules: nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%). The natural abundance of [[hydrogen|hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]] in the Earth's atmosphere is only of the order of parts per million, but H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the most abundant diatomic molecule in the universe. The interstellar medium is, indeed, dominated by hydrogen atoms.

==Molecular geometry==
All diatomic molecules are linear and characterized by a single parameter which is the [[bond length]] or distance between the two atoms.

==Historical significance==
Diatomic elements played an important role in the elucidation of the concepts of element, atom, and molecule in the 19th century, because some of the most common elements, such as hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, occur as diatomic molecules. [[John Dalton]]'s original atomic hypothesis assumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another. For example, Dalton assumed water's formula to be HO, giving the atomic weight of oxygen as eight times that of hydrogen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Bq8aDsluyggC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=Dalton+assumed+water's+formula+to+be+HO,+giving+the+atomic+weight+of+oxygen+as+eight+times+that+of+hydrogen#v=onepage&amp;q=Dalton%20assumed%20water's%20formula%20to%20be%20HO,%20giving%20the%20atomic%20weight%20of%20oxygen%20as%20eight%20times%20that%20of%20hydrogen&amp;f=false|title=The Development of Chemical Principles|authorlink1=Cooper H. Langford|last=Langford|first=Cooper Harold|last2=Beebe|first2=Ralph Alonzo|date=1995-01-01|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486683591|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of the modern value of about 16. As a consequence, confusion existed regarding atomic weights and molecular formulas for about half a century.

As early as 1805, [[Gay-Lussac]] and [[Alexander von Humboldt|von Humboldt]] showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen, and by 1811 [[Amedeo Avogadro]] had arrived at the correct interpretation of water's composition, based on what is now called [[Avogadro's law]] and the assumption of diatomic elemental molecules. However, these results were mostly ignored until 1860, partly due to the belief that atoms of one element would have no [[chemical affinity]] toward atoms of the same element, and also partly due to apparent exceptions to Avogadro's law that were not explained until later in terms of dissociating molecules.

At the 1860 [[Karlsruhe Congress]] on atomic weights, [[Cannizzaro]] resurrected Avogadro's ideas and used them to produce a consistent table of atomic weights, which mostly agree with modern values. These weights were an important prerequisite for the discovery of the [[periodic law]] by [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] and [[Lothar Meyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Ihde, Aaron J. |title= The Karlsruhe Congress: A centennial retrospective |journal= Journal of Chemical Education |year= 1961 |volume= 38 |pages= 83–86 |url= http://search.jce.divched.org:8081/JCEIndex/FMPro?-db=jceindex.fp5&amp;-lay=wwwform&amp;combo=karlsruhe&amp;-find=&amp;-format=detail.html&amp;-skip=0&amp;-max=1&amp;-token.2=0&amp;-token.3=10 |accessdate= 2007-08-24 |doi= 10.1021/ed038p83 |issue= 2 |bibcode= 1961JChEd..38...83I |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928044137/http://search.jce.divched.org:8081/JCEIndex/FMPro?-db=jceindex.fp5&amp;-lay=wwwform&amp;combo=karlsruhe&amp;-find=&amp;-format=detail.html&amp;-skip=0&amp;-max=1&amp;-token.2=0&amp;-token.3=10 |archive-date= 28 September 2007 |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excited electronic states==
Diatomic molecules are normally in their lowest or ground state, which conventionally is also known as the &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; state. When a gas of diatomic molecules is bombarded by energetic electrons, some of the molecules may be excited to higher electronic states, as occurs, for example, in the natural aurora; high-altitude nuclear explosions; and rocket-borne electron gun experiments.&lt;ref name=gilmore1992/&gt; Such excitation can also occur when the gas absorbs light or other electromagnetic radiation. The excited states are unstable and naturally relax back to the ground state. Over various short time scales after the excitation (typically a fraction of a second, or sometimes longer than a second if the excited state is [[metastability|metastable]]), transitions occur from higher to lower electronic states and ultimately to the ground state, and in each transition results a [[photon]] is emitted. This emission is known as [[fluorescence]]. Successively higher electronic states are conventionally named &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, etc. (but this convention is not always followed, and sometimes lower case letters and alphabetically out-of-sequence letters are used, as in the example given below). The excitation energy must be greater than or equal to the energy of the electronic state in order for the excitation to occur.

In quantum theory, an electronic state of a diatomic molecule is represented by the [[molecular term symbol]]
:&lt;math&gt;^{2S+1} \Lambda (v)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the total electronic spin quantum number, &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the total electronic angular momentum quantum number along the internuclear axis, and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the vibrational quantum number. &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; takes on values 0, 1, 2, ..., which are represented by the electronic state symbols &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;,....
For example, the following table lists the common electronic states (without vibrational quantum numbers) along with the energy of the lowest vibrational level (&lt;math&gt;v=0&lt;/math&gt;) of diatomic nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref name=laher1991/&gt; In the table, the subscripts and superscripts after &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; give additional quantum mechanical details about the electronic state.

The aforementioned [[fluorescence]] occurs in distinct regions of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], called &quot;[[emission bands]]&quot;: each band corresponds to a particular transition from a higher electronic state and vibrational level to a lower electronic state and vibrational level (typically, many vibrational levels are involved in an excited gas of diatomic molecules). For example, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; emission bands (a.k.a. Vegard-Kaplan bands) are present in the spectral range from 0.14 to 1.45 μm (micrometres).&lt;ref name=gilmore1992/&gt; A given band can be spread out over several nanometers in electromagnetic wavelength space, owing to the various transitions that occur in the molecule's rotational quantum number, &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;. These are classified into distinct sub-band branches, depending on the change in &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=levine1975/&gt; The &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; branch corresponds to &lt;math&gt;\Delta J = +1&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; branch to &lt;math&gt;\Delta J = -1&lt;/math&gt;, and the &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; branch to &lt;math&gt;\Delta J = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Bands are spread out even further by the limited [[spectral resolution]] of the [[spectrometer]] that is used to measure the [[spectrum]]. The spectral resolution depends on the instrument's [[point spread function]].

==Energy levels==
The [[molecular term symbol]] is a shorthand expression of the angular momenta that characterize the electronic quantum states of a diatomic molecule, which are also [[eigenstate]]s of the electronic molecular [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]. It is also convenient, and common, to represent a diatomic molecule as two point masses connected by a massless spring. The energies involved in the various motions of the molecule can then be broken down into three categories: the translational, rotational, and vibrational energies.

===Translational energies===
The translational energy of the molecule is given by the [[kinetic energy]] expression:
:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{trans}=\frac{1}{2}mv^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the molecule and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is its velocity.

===Rotational energies===
Classically, the kinetic energy of rotation is
::&lt;math&gt;E_\text{rot} = \frac{L^2}{2 I} \,&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::&lt;math&gt;L \,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular momentum]]
::&lt;math&gt;I \,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[moment of inertia]] of the molecule

For microscopic, atomic-level systems like a molecule, angular momentum can only have specific discrete values given by
::&lt;math&gt;L^2 = \ell(\ell+1) \hbar^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is a non-negative integer and &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced Planck constant]].

Also, for a diatomic molecule the moment of inertia is
::&lt;math&gt;I = \mu r_{0}^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::&lt;math&gt;\mu \,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced mass]] of the molecule and
::&lt;math&gt;r_{0} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the average distance between the centers of the two atoms in the molecule.

So, substituting the angular momentum and moment of inertia into E&lt;sub&gt;rot&lt;/sub&gt;, the rotational energy levels of a diatomic molecule are given by:
::&lt;math style&gt;E_\text{rot} = \frac{l(l+1) \hbar^2}{2 \mu r_{0}^2} \ \ \ \ \ l=0,1,2,... \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Vibrational energies===
Another type of motion of a diatomic molecule is for each atom to oscillate—or [[vibration|vibrate]]—along the line connecting the two atoms. The vibrational energy is approximately that of a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]:

::&lt;math&gt;E_\text{vib} = \left(n+\frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar \omega \ \ \ \ \ n=0,1,2,.... \,&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is an integer
::&lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced Planck constant]] and
::&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]] of the vibration.

===Comparison between rotational and vibrational energy spacings===
The spacing, and the energy of a typical spectroscopic transition, between vibrational energy levels is about 100 times greater than that of a typical transition between [[rotational energy]] levels.

==Hund's cases==
{{Main|Hund's cases}}
The [[good quantum number]]s for a diatomic molecule, as well as good approximations of rotational energy levels, can be obtained by modeling the molecule using [[Hund's cases]].
