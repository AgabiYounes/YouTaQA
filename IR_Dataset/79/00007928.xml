'''James Dalton Trumbo''' (December 9, 1905 – September 10, 1976) was an American [[screenwriter]] and [[novelist]] who scripted many award-winning films including ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' (1953), ''[[Exodus (1960 film)|Exodus]]''&lt;!-- 1960 --&gt;, ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (both 1960), and ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'' (1944).

Trumbo, the other members of the Hollywood Ten, and hundreds of other professionals in the industry were [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted by Hollywood]]. He was, however, able to continue working clandestinely on major films, writing under other authors' names or pseudonyms. His uncredited work won two [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Story|Best Story]]: for ''Roman Holiday'' (1953), which was presented to a [[Front (identity)|front]] writer, and for ''[[The Brave One (1956 film)|The Brave One]]'' (1956) which was awarded to a [[Pen name|pseudonym]] used by Trumbo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2005/05.07.18.html |title=AMPAS Press Release |accessdate=March 20, 2008 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008054115/http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2005/05.07.18.html |archivedate=October 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/trivia.html AMPAS Oscar Trivia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216113055/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/trivia.html |date=December 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was given public screen credit for both ''Exodus'' and ''Spartacus'' in 1960, it marked the beginning of the end of the Hollywood Blacklist for Trumbo and other affected screenwriters.&lt;ref name=&quot;rapold&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rapold|first1=Nicolas|title='Trumbo' Recalls the Hunters and the Hunted of Hollywood|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/movies/trumbo-recalls-the-hunters-and-the-hunted-of-hollywood.html|accessdate=22 December 2015|date=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finally was given full credit by the Writers' Guild for all his achievements, the work of which encompassed six decades of screenwriting.&lt;ref name=&quot;kpcc&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheryl Devall|first=Paige Osburn|title=Blacklisted writer gets credit restored after 60 years for Oscar-winning film|url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2011/12/19/30417/blacklisted-writer-gets-credit-restored-oscar-winn/|accessdate=December 20, 2011|newspaper=89.3 KPCC|date=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes-verrier&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Verrier|first=Richard|title=Writers Guild restores screenplay credit to Trumbo for 'Roman Holiday'|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/12/writers-guild-restores-screenplay-credit-to-trumbo-for-roman-holiday.html|accessdate=December 20, 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Trumbo was born in [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]], [[Colorado]], the son of Maud (née Tillery) and Orus Bonham Trumbo. His family moved to [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]], in the same state, during 1908.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5VdFqKChbUEC&amp;pg=PA12 Peter Hanson, ''Dalton Trumbo, Hollywood Rebel: A Critical Survey and Filmography''], McFarland, 2007, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; He was proud of his paternal immigrant ancestor, a Protestant of Swiss origin named Jacob Trumbo, who settled in the colony of Virginia in 1736.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FnZBAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=jacob+trumbo+1736+swiss ''Additional Dialogue; Letters of Dalton Trumbo, 1942-1962''], edited by M. Evans, Lippincott, 1970, footnote #10, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Trumbo graduated from [[Grand Junction High School]]. While still in high school, he worked for [[Walter Walker (politician)|Walter Walker]] as a cub reporter for the ''[[Grand Junction Daily Sentinel]],'' covering courts, the high school, the mortuary and civic organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McIntyre |first=Erin |date=October 31, 2015 |title=Book, Movie Reminders of Dalton Trumbo's Ties to Grand Junction Leading Man |url=http://www.gjsentinel.com/lifestyle/articles/book-movie-reminders-of-dalton-trumbos-ties-to-gra |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104010203/http://www.gjsentinel.com/lifestyle/articles/book-movie-reminders-of-dalton-trumbos-ties-to-gra |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 4, 2015 |newspaper=Daily Sentinel |location=Grand Junction, CO }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He attended the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] in 1924 and 1925, working as a reporter for the ''Boulder Daily Camera'' and contributing to the campus humor magazine, the yearbook, and the campus newspaper. He was a member of [[Delta Tau Delta]] International Fraternity.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

For nine years after his father died, Trumbo worked the night shift wrapping bread at a Los Angeles bakery, and attended the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (1926) and the [[University of Southern California]] (1928-1930).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bloom |first=Harold |date=1988 |title=Twentieth-Century American Literature |url=https://books.google.com/?id=e7pZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22dalton+trumbo%22+%22university+of+southern+california%22&amp;dq=%22dalton+trumbo%22+%22university+of+southern+california%22 |location=Langhorne, PA |publisher=Chelsea House Publishers |page=3993|isbn=9780877548072 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he wrote movie reviews, 88 short stories, and six novels, all of which were rejected for publication.&lt;ref name=well&gt;{{cite news |last=Well |first=Martin |title=Dalton Trumbo, 70, Dies: Blacklisted Screenwriter |newspaper=Washington Post |date=September 9, 1976 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Early career===
Trumbo began his professional writing career in the early 1930s, when several of his articles and stories were published in mainstream magazines, including ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', ''[[McCall's]],'' ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', and the ''Hollywood Spectator''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, Trumbo was hired as managing editor of the ''Hollywood Spectator.'' Later he left the magazine to become a reader in the story department at [[Warner Bros.]] studio.&lt;ref name=well/&gt;

His first published novel was ''[[Eclipse (Trumbo novel)|Eclipse]]'' (1935), published during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. Writing in the [[Social realism|social realist]] style, Trumbo drew on his years in Grand Junction to portray a town and its people. The book was controversial in his home town, where many people took issue with his fictional portrayal.&lt;ref name=&quot;CLMThomas&quot;&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trumbo started working in movies in 1937 but continued writing prose. His [[anti-war]] novel ''[[Johnny Got His Gun]]'' won one of the [[List of National Book Award winners#1935 to 1941|early National Book Awards]]: the Most Original Book of 1939.&lt;ref name=nyt1940&gt;&quot;1939 Book Awards Given by Critics: Elgin Groseclose's 'Ararat' is Picked ...&quot;, ''The New York Times'', 1940-02-14, page 25. ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851–2007).&lt;/ref&gt; It was inspired by an article Trumbo had read several years earlier, an account of a hospital visit by the [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] to a Canadian soldier who had lost all his limbs in [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/johnnygun/context.html Sparknotes.com.] Retrieved December 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1930s and early 1940s, Trumbo became one of Hollywood's highest-paid screenwriters, at about $4,000 per week while on assignment,&lt;ref name=nordheimer&gt;Nordheimer 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; and earning as much as $80,000 in one year.&lt;ref name=well/&gt; He worked on such films as ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'' (1944), ''[[Our Vines Have Tender Grapes]]'' (1945), and ''[[Kitty Foyle (film)|Kitty Foyle]]'' (1940), for which he was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]].

===Political advocacy and blacklisting===
{{Main|Hollywood blacklist}}

Aligned with the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] in the United States before the 1940s, Trumbo was an [[Isolationism|isolationist]], but did not join the party until 1943.&lt;ref name=nordheimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;humanevents&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanevents.com/2003/09/02/coulter-and-her-critics/|title=Coulter and Her Critics &amp;#124; Human Events|publisher=humanevents.com|accessdate=September 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930210027/http://humanevents.com/2003/09/02/coulter-and-her-critics/|archive-date=September 30, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Navasky]], ''Naming Names'', New York: Viking, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; His novel ''The Remarkable Andrew'' featured the ghost of President [[Andrew Jackson]] appearing to caution the United States against getting involved in [[World War II]] and in support of [[Nazi-soviet pact|Nazi-Soviet pact]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; In a review of the book, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine wise-cracked, &quot;General Jackson's opinions need surprise no one who has observed [[George Washington]] and [[Abraham Lincoln]] zealously following the Communist Party Line in recent years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,765251,00.html Counsel from Hollywood], Time Magazine, February 3, 1941&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941]], Trumbo and his publisher decided to suspend reprinting ''Johnny Got His Gun'' until the end of the war. During the war, Trumbo received letters from individuals &quot;denouncing Jews&quot; and using ''Johnny'' to support their arguments for &quot;an immediate negotiated peace&quot; with [[Nazi Germany]]; Trumbo reported these correspondents to the [[FBI]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pg 5&quot;&gt;Dalton Trumbo.

Citadel Press, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LnnMLLk2uU4C&amp;pg=PA5&amp;output=html pg 5], introduction&lt;/ref&gt; Trumbo regretted this decision, which he called &quot;foolish.&quot; After two FBI agents showed up at his home, he understood that &quot;their interest lay not in the letters but in me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pg 5&quot;/&gt;

In a 1946 article titled &quot;The Russian Menace&quot; published in Rob Wagner's ''Script Magazine'', Trumbo wrote from the perspective of a post-[[World War II]] Russian citizen.&lt;ref name=&quot;oldmagazinearticles.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldmagazinearticles.com/Blacklisted-Hollywood_screenwriter_Dalton_Trumbo_information|title=The Russian Menace|last=Trumbo|first=Dalton|date=May 26, 1946|website=Old Magazine Articles|publisher=Script Magazine|accessdate=November 16, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214121041/http://oldmagazinearticles.com/Blacklisted-Hollywood_screenwriter_Dalton_Trumbo_information|archive-date=December 14, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that Russians were likely fearful of the mass of U.S. military power that surrounded them, at a time when any sympathetic view toward Communist countries was viewed with suspicion.&lt;ref name=&quot;oldmagazinearticles.com&quot;/&gt; He ended the article by stating, &quot;If I were a Russian ... I would be alarmed, and I would petition my government to take measures at once against what would seem an almost certain blow aimed at my existence. This is how it must appear in Russia today.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;oldmagazinearticles.com&quot;/&gt; He argued that the U.S. was a &quot;menace&quot; to Russia, rather than the more popular American view of Russia as the &quot;red menace&quot;. According to anti-Communist author Kenneth Billingsley in 2000, Trumbo had written in ''[[The Daily Worker]]'' that Communist influence in Hollywood had prevented films from being made from anti-Communist books, such as [[Arthur Koestler]]'s ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' and ''[[The Yogi and the Commissar]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Kenneth Billingsley.

[[File:Dalton Trumbo prison 1950.jpg|thumb|Trumbo mugshot, Ashland penitentiary]]
On July 29, 1946, [[William Wilkerson|William R. Wilkerson]], publisher and founder of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', published a &quot;TradeView&quot; column entitled &quot;A Vote For [[Joseph Stalin|Joe Stalin]]&quot;. It named Trumbo and several others as Communist sympathizers, the first persons identified on what became known as &quot;Billy's Blacklist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Wilkerson |first=William |author-link=William Wilkerson |date=July 29, 1946 |title=A Vote For Joe Stalin |periodical=The Hollywood Reporter |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baum&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Baum |first1=Gary |last2= Miller |first2=Daniel |title=Blacklist: THR Addresses Role After 65 Years |date=November 30, 2012 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/blacklist-thr-addresses-role-65-391931 |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1947, drawing upon these names, the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) summoned Trumbo and nine others to testify for their investigation as to whether Communist agents and sympathizers had surreptitiously planted propaganda in U.S. films. The writers refused to give information about their own or any other person's involvement and were convicted for [[contempt of Congress]]. They appealed the conviction to the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] on [[First Amendment]] grounds and lost. In 1950, Trumbo served eleven months in the [[federal penitentiary]] in [[Ashland, Kentucky]]. In the 1976 documentary ''Hollywood On Trial'', Trumbo said &quot;As far as I was concerned, it was a completely just verdict. I had contempt for that Congress and have had contempt for several since. And on the basis of guilt or innocence, I could never really complain very much. That this was a crime or misdemeanor was the complaint, my complaint.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|title=Dalton Trumbo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2SbJBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA648 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky|page=228|accessdate=December 15, 2015|isbn=9780813146829|date=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] had [[Waldorf Statement|issued a statement]] that Trumbo and his compatriots would not be permitted to work in the industry, unless they disavowed Communism under oath. After completing his sentence, Trumbo sold his ranch and moved with his family to [[Mexico City]] with [[Hugo Butler]] and his wife [[Jean Rouverol]], who had also been blacklisted.&lt;ref name=nordheimer/&gt; In Mexico, Trumbo wrote 30 scripts under pseudonyms, for [[B-movie]] studios such as [[King Brothers Productions]]. In the case of ''[[Gun Crazy]]'' (1950), adapted from a short story by [[MacKinlay Kantor]], Kantor agreed to be the front for Trumbo's screenplay. Trumbo's role in the screenplay was not revealed until 1992.&lt;ref name=Apostolou&gt;[http://www.mysteryfile.com/Kantor/Crime_Fiction.html John Apostolou, &quot;MacKinlay Kantor&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110601003618/http://www.mysteryfile.com/Kantor/Crime_Fiction.html |date=June 1, 2011 }}, ''The Armchair Detective'', Spring 1997, republished on ''Mystery File'', accessed October 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this blacklist period, Trumbo also wrote ''[[The Brave One (1956 film)|The Brave One]]'' (1956) for the King Brothers. Like ''Roman Holiday'', it received an [[Academy Award for Best Story]] he couldn't claim. The script was credited to Robert Rich, a name borrowed from a nephew of the producers. Trumbo recalled earning an average fee of $1,750 per film for 18 screenplays written in two years and said, &quot;None was very good&quot;.&lt;ref name=nordheimer/&gt;

In 1956 he published ''The Devil in the Book'', an analysis of the conviction of 14 California [[Smith Act]] defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/trumbo.htm |title=Dalton Trumbo |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024163811/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/trumbo.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The statute set criminal penalties for advocating the overthrow of the U.S. government and required all non-citizen adult residents to register with the government.

===Later career===
Gradually the blacklist weakened. With the support of director [[Otto Preminger]], Trumbo was credited for the screenplay of the film ''[[Exodus (1960 film)|Exodus]]'' (1960), adapted from the [[Exodus (Uris novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Leon Uris]]. Shortly thereafter, actor [[Kirk Douglas]] announced Trumbo had written the screenplay for [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s film ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (also 1960), adapted from the [[Spartacus (Fast novel)|novel]] by [[Howard Fast]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Trumbo&quot;&gt;{{IMDb title|0889671|Trumbo (2007)}} Retrieved April 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; With these actions, Preminger and Douglas helped end the power of the blacklist. Trumbo was reinstated into the [[Writers Guild of America, West]] and was credited on all subsequent scripts.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Eventually in 2011, the Guild gave him full credit for the script of ''[[Roman Holiday]]''. In 1971, Trumbo directed the [[Johnny Got His Gun (film)|film adaptation of his novel]] ''Johnny Got His Gun'', which starred [[Timothy Bottoms]], [[Diane Varsi]], [[Jason Robards]] and [[Donald Sutherland]]. One of the last films Trumbo wrote, ''[[Executive Action (film)|Executive Action]]'' (1973), was based on the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|Kennedy assassination]].&lt;ref&gt;Steve Jaffe, technical adviser|Warner Bros. publications |&quot;Executive Action&quot; (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the Academy officially recognized Trumbo as the winner of the Oscar for ''The Brave One'' and presented him with a statuette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Writer Collects Oscar for 1956 Film|work=Los Angeles Times|date=May 16, 1975|page=D2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1938, Trumbo married Cleo Fincher. She was born in [[Fresno]] on July 17, 1916, and moved with her divorced mother and her brother and sister to Los Angeles. Cleo Trumbo died of natural causes at the age of 93 on October 9, 2009, in [[Los Altos, California|Los Altos]].
