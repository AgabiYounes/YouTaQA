In [[logic]] and [[mathematics]], '''or''' is the [[truth function|truth-functional]] operator of ('''inclusive''') '''disjunction''', also known as '''alternation'''; the ''or'' of a set of operands is true [[if and only if]] ''one or more'' of its operands is true.  The [[logical connective]] that represents this operator is typically written as ∨ or +.

&lt;math&gt;A \lor B&lt;/math&gt; is true if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is true, or if &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is true, or if both &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are true.

In logic, ''or'' by itself means the ''inclusive'' ''or'', distinguished from an [[exclusive or]], which is false when both of its arguments are true, while an &quot;or&quot; is true in that case.

An operand of a disjunction is called a '''disjunct'''.

Related concepts in other fields are:
* In [[natural language]], the [[Grammatical conjunction#Coordinating conjunctions|coordinating conjunction]] &quot;or&quot;.
* In programming languages, the [[short-circuit evaluation|short-circuit or]] [[control structure]].
* In [[set theory]], [[union (set theory)|union]].
* In [[predicate logic]], [[existential quantification]].

==Notation==
'''Or''' is usually expressed with an infix operator: in mathematics and logic, '''∨'''; in electronics, '''+'''; and in most programming languages, '''|''', '''||''', or '''or'''.   In [[Jan Łukasiewicz]]'s [[Polish notation#Polish notation for logic|prefix notation for logic]], the operator is '''A''', for Polish ''alternatywa'' (English: alternative).&lt;ref&gt;[[Józef Maria Bocheński]] (1959), ''A Précis of Mathematical Logic'', translated by Otto Bird from the French and German editions, Dordrecht, North Holland:  D. Reidel, passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
'''Logical disjunction''' is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that has a value of ''false'' if and only if both of its operands are false. More generally, a disjunction is a logical formula that can have one or more [[literal (mathematical logic)|literal]]s separated only by 'or's. A single literal is often considered to be a degenerate disjunction.

The disjunctive [[identity element|identity]] is false, which is to say that the ''or'' of an expression with false has the same value as the original expression. In keeping with the concept of [[vacuous truth]], when disjunction is defined as an operator or function of arbitrary [[arity]], the empty disjunction (OR-ing over an empty set of operands) is generally defined as false.

===Truth table===

The [[truth table]] of &lt;math&gt;A \lor B&lt;/math&gt;:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center; background-color: #ddffdd;&quot;
|- bgcolor=&quot;#ddeeff&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;A \lor B&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| T || T || T
|-
| T || F || T
|-
| F || T || T
|-
| F || F || F
|}

==Properties==

The following properties apply to disjunction:

*[[associativity]]: &lt;math&gt;a \lor (b \lor c) \equiv (a \lor b) \lor c &lt;/math&gt;
*[[commutativity]]: &lt;math&gt;a \lor  b \equiv b \lor a &lt;/math&gt;
*[[distributivity]]: &lt;math&gt;(a \lor (b \land c)) \equiv ((a \lor b) \land (a \lor c))&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;(a \lor (b \lor c)) \equiv ((a \lor b) \lor (a \lor c))&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;(a \lor (b \equiv c)) \equiv ((a \lor b) \equiv (a \lor c))&lt;/math&gt;

*[[idempotency]]: &lt;math&gt;a \lor a \equiv a &lt;/math&gt;
*[[monotonicity]]: &lt;math&gt;(a \rightarrow b) \rightarrow ((c \lor a) \rightarrow (c \lor b))&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;(a \rightarrow b) \rightarrow ((a \lor c) \rightarrow (b \lor c))&lt;/math&gt;

*'''truth-preserving''': The interpretation under which all variables are assigned a [[truth value]] of 'true' produces a truth value of 'true' as a result of disjunction.
*'''falsehood-preserving''': The interpretation under which all variables are assigned a [[truth value]] of 'false' produces a truth value of 'false' as a result of disjunction.

==Symbol==
The mathematical symbol for logical disjunction varies in the literature. In addition to the word &quot;or&quot;, and the formula &quot;A''pq''&quot;, the symbol &quot;&lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt;&quot;, deriving from the Latin word ''[[wikt:en:vel#Latin|vel]]'' (“either”, “or”) is commonly used for disjunction. For example: &quot;''A'' &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; ''B''&amp;nbsp;&quot; is read as &quot;''A'' or ''B''&amp;nbsp;&quot;. Such a disjunction is false if both ''A'' and ''B'' are false. In all other cases it is true.

All of the following are disjunctions:
: &lt;math&gt;A \lor B&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\neg A \lor B&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;A \lor \neg B \lor \neg C \lor D \lor \neg E.&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding operation in set theory is the [[union (set theory)|set-theoretic union]].

==Applications in computer science==
[[File:Or-gate-en.svg|thumb|150px|OR [[logic gate]]]]
[[Operator (programming)|Operators]] corresponding to logical disjunction exist in most [[programming language]]s.

===Bitwise operation===
Disjunction is often used for bitwise operations. Examples:
* 0 or 0 = 0
* 0 or 1 = 1
* 1 or 0 = 1
* 1 or 1 = 1
* 1010 or 1100 = 1110

The &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; operator can be used to set bits in a [[bit field]] to 1, by &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt;-ing the field with a constant field with the relevant bits set to 1. For example, &lt;code&gt;x = x | 0b00000001&lt;/code&gt; will force the final bit to 1 while leaving other bits unchanged.

===Logical operation===
Many languages distinguish between bitwise and logical disjunction by providing two distinct operators; in languages following C, bitwise disjunction is performed with the single pipe (&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;) and logical disjunction with the double pipe (&lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt;) operators.

Logical disjunction is usually [[Short-circuit evaluation|short-circuited]]; that is, if the first (left) operand evaluates to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; then the second (right) operand is not evaluated. The logical disjunction operator thus usually constitutes a [[sequence point]].

{{anchor|parallel-or}}
In a parallel (concurrent) language, it is possible to short-circuit both sides: they are evaluated in parallel,
and if one terminates with value true, the other is interrupted. This operator is thus called the '''parallel or'''.

Although in most languages the type of a logical disjunction expression is boolean and thus can only have the value &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, in some (such as [[Python programming language|Python]] and [[JavaScript]]) the logical disjunction operator returns one of its operands: the first operand if it evaluates to a true value, and the second operand otherwise.

===Constructive disjunction===
The [[Curry–Howard correspondence]] relates a [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivist]] form of disjunction to [[tagged union]] types.

==Union==
The [[Element (mathematics)|membership]] of an element of a [[union (set theory)|union set]] in [[set theory]] is defined in terms of a logical disjunction: ''x'' ∈ ''A'' ∪ ''B'' if and only if (''x'' ∈ ''A'') ∨ (''x'' ∈ ''B''). Because of this, logical disjunction satisfies many of the same identities as set-theoretic union, such as associativity, commutativity, distributivity, and [[de Morgan's laws]], identifying [[logical conjunction]] with [[set intersection]], [[logical negation]] with [[set complement]].

==Natural language==
As with other notions formalized in [[mathematical logic]], the [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] of the natural-language [[Grammatical conjunction#Coordinating conjunctions|coordinating conjunction]] ''or'' is closely related to but different from the logical ''or''. For example, &quot;Please ring me or send an email&quot; likely means &quot;do one or the other, but not both&quot;. On the other hand, &quot;Her grades are so good that either she's very bright or she studies hard&quot; does not exclude the possibility of both. In other words, in ordinary language &quot;or&quot; (even if used with &quot;either&quot;) can mean either the inclusive &quot;or&quot; [exclusive-]or the exclusive &quot;or.&quot;

==Notes==
* [[George Boole]], closely following analogy with ordinary mathematics, premised, as a necessary condition to the definition of &quot;x + y&quot;, that x and y were mutually exclusive. [[William Stanley Jevons|Jevons]], and practically all mathematical logicians after him, advocated, on various grounds, the definition of &quot;logical addition&quot; in a form which does not necessitate mutual exclusiveness.
