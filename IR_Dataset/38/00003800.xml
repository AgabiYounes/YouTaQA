In [[baseball]], an '''at bat''' ('''AB''') or '''time at bat''' is a [[batting (baseball)|batter]]'s turn batting against a [[pitcher]]. An at bat is different from a [[plate appearance]]. A batter is credited with a plate appearance regardless of what happens during their turn at bat, but a batter is credited with an at bat only if that plate appearance does not have one of the results enumerated below. While at bats are used to calculate certain [[baseball statistics|statistics]], including [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] and [[slugging percentage]], a player can qualify for the season-ending rankings in these categories only if they accumulate 502 plate appearances during the season.

A batter will not receive credit for an at bat if their plate appearance ends under the following circumstances:
* They receive a [[base on balls]] (BB).&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;In [[1887 in baseball|1887]], [[Major League Baseball]] counted bases on balls as [[hit (baseball)|hits]]. The result was high [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]]s, including some near .500, and the experiment was abandoned the following season.&lt;/ref&gt;
* They are [[hit by pitch|hit by a pitch]] (HBP).
* They hit a [[sacrifice fly]] or a [[sacrifice bunt]] (also known as sacrifice hit).
* They are awarded [[Baseball field#First base|first base]] due to interference or obstruction, usually by the [[catcher]].
* They are replaced by another hitter before their at bat is completed, in which case the plate appearance and any related statistics go to the pinch hitter (unless they are replaced with two strikes and their replacement completes a strikeout, in which case the at bat and strikeout are still charged to the first batter).
In addition, if the [[Inning (baseball)|inning]] ends while they are still at bat (due to the third [[out (baseball)|out]] being made by a runner [[caught stealing]], for example), no at bat or plate appearance will result. In this case, the batter will come to bat again in the next inning, though the [[count (baseball)|count]] will be reset to no balls and no strikes.

Rule 9.02(a)(1) of the official rules of [[Major League Baseball]] defines an at bat as: &quot;Number of times batted, except that no time at bat shall be charged when a player: (A) hits a sacrifice bunt or sacrifice fly; (B) is awarded first base on four called balls; (C) is hit by a pitched ball; or (D) is awarded first base because of interference or obstruction[.]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MLBatbat&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/documents/0/8/0/268272080/2018_Official_Baseball_Rules.pdf|title=Official Baseball Rules|last=|first=|date=|work=[[Major League Baseball]]|publisher=Office of the Commissioner of Baseball|format=PDF|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=2018-07-07|edition=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
An at bat is counted when:
*The batter reaches first base on a [[Hit (baseball statistics)|hit]]
*The batter reaches first base on an [[Error (baseball statistics)|error]]
*The batter is called [[Out (baseball)|out]] for any reason other than as part of a sacrifice
*There is a [[fielder's choice]]

==At bat as a phrase==
&quot;At bat&quot;, &quot;up&quot;, &quot;up at bat&quot;, and &quot;at the plate&quot; are all phrases describing a batter who is facing the pitcher. Note that just because a player is described as being &quot;at bat&quot; in this sense, he will not necessarily be given an at bat in his statistics; the phrase actually signifies a [[plate appearance]] (assuming it is eventually completed). This ambiguous terminology is usually clarified by context. To refer explicitly to the technical meaning of &quot;at bat&quot; described above, the term &quot;official at bat&quot; is sometimes used.

=== &quot;Time at bat&quot; in the rulebook ===
Official Baseball Rule 5.06(c) provides that &quot;[a] batter has legally completed his ''time at bat'' when he is put out or becomes a runner&quot; (emphasis added). The &quot;time at bat&quot; defined in this rule is more commonly referred to as a [[plate appearance]], and the playing rules (Rules 1 through 8) uses the phrase &quot;time at bat&quot; in this sense.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;''See, e.g.,'' Rule 5.04(a)(3), which states that &quot;[t]he first batter in each inning after the first inning shall be the player whose name follows that of the last player who legally completed his ''time at bat'' in the preceding inning&quot; (emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the scoring rules use the phrase &quot;time at bat&quot; to refer to the statistic '''at bat''', defined in Rule 9.02(a)(1), but sometimes uses the phrase &quot;official time at bat&quot; or refers back to Rule 9.02(a)(1) when mentioning the statistic. The phrase &quot;plate appearance&quot; is used in Rules 9.22 and 9.23 dealing with batting titles and hitting streaks, but is not defined anywhere in the rulebook.&lt;ref name=&quot;MLBatbat&quot; /&gt;
