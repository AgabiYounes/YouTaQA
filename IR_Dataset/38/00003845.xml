'''Brigitte Anne-Marie Bardot''' ({{IPAc-en|b|r|ɪ|ˌ|ʒ|iː|t|_|b|ɑːr|ˈ|d|əʊ|audio=EN-AU ck1 Brigitte Bardot.ogg}} {{respell|brizh|EET|_|bar|DOH}}, {{IPA-fr|bʁiʒit baʁdo|lang|LL-Q150 (fra)-Exilexi-Brigitte Bardot.wav}}; born 28 September 1934), often referred to by the initials '''B.B.''',&lt;ref name=&quot;institut-francais&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.institut-francais.org.uk/cine-lumiere/whats-on/festivals-series/and-bardot-became-bb/ |publisher=[[Institut français du Royaume-Uni]] |title=And Bardot Became BB |accessdate=13 January 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808114518/https://www.institut-francais.org.uk/cine-lumiere/whats-on/festivals-series/and-bardot-became-bb/ |archivedate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Probst|2012|p=7}} is a French former actress and singer, and animal rights activist. Famous for portraying sexually emancipated personae with hedonistic lifestyles, she was one of the best known [[sex symbol]]s of the 1950s and 1960s. Although she withdrew from the entertainment industry in 1973, she remains a major [[popular culture]] icon.{{sfnm|Cherry|2016|1p=134|Vincendeau|1992|2p=73–76}}

Born and raised in [[Paris]], Bardot was an aspiring ballerina in her early life. She started her acting career in 1952. She achieved international recognition in 1957 for her role in the controversial ''[[And God Created Woman (1956 film)|And God Created Woman]]'', and also caught the attention of French intellectuals. She was the subject of [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s 1959 essay ''The Lolita Syndrome'', which described her as a &quot;locomotive of women's history&quot; and built upon [[existentialist]] themes to declare her the first and most liberated woman of post-war France. Bardot later starred in [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s 1963 film ''[[Contempt (film)|Le Mépris]]''. For her role in [[Louis Malle]]'s 1965 film ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' she was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actress]].

Bardot retired from the entertainment industry in 1973. She had acted in 47 films, performed in several musicals and recorded more than 60 songs. She was awarded the [[Legion of Honour]] in 1985 but refused to accept it. After retiring, she became an [[animal rights]] activist. During the 2000s she generated controversy by criticizing immigration and [[Islam in France]], and she has been fined five times for [[Incitement to ethnic or racial hatred|inciting racial hatred]].

==Life and career==
===Early life: 1934–1951===
Brigitte Anne-Marie Bardot was born on 28 September 1934 in the [[15th arrondissement of Paris|15th arrondissement]] of [[Paris]], to Louis Bardot (1896–1975) and Anne-Marie Mucel (1912–1978).{{sfn|Bardot|1996|p=15}} Bardot's father, originated from [[Ligny-en-Barrois]], was an engineer and the proprietor of several industrial factories in Paris.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lorrain&quot;&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202224142/http://www.republicain-lorrain.fr/actualite/2010/05/23/brigitte-bardot-j-en-ai-les-larmes-aux-yeux |url=http://www.republicain-lorrain.fr/actualite/2010/05/23/brigitte-bardot-j-en-ai-les-larmes-aux-yeux |title=Brigitte Bardot: 'J'en ai les larmes aux yeux' |work=[[Le Républicain Lorrain]] |language=French |date=23 May 2010 |archivedate=2 December 2013 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Singer|2006|p=6}} Her mother was the daughter of an insurance company director.{{sfn|Bigot|2014|p=12}} She grew up in a conservative [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] family, as had her father.{{sfn|Bigot|2014|p=11}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer_outrageous&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/20/brigitte-bardot-at-80-still-outrageous-outspoken |title=Brigitte Bardot at 80: still outrageous, outspoken and controversial |first=Agnès |last=Poirier |work=[[The Observer]] |date=20 September 2014 |accessdate=21 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; She suffered from [[amblyopia]] as a child, which resulted in [[decreased vision]] of her left eye.{{sfn|Lelièvre|2012|p=18}} She has one younger sister, [[Mijanou Bardot|Mijanou]].{{sfn|Bardot|1996|p=45}}

Bardot's childhood was prosperous; she lived in her family's seven-bedroom apartment in the luxurious [[16th arrondissement of Paris|16th arrondissement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer_outrageous&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Singer|2006|p=10}} However, she recalled feeling resentful in her early years.{{sfnm|Bardot|1996|1p=45|Singer|2006|2p=10–14}} Her father demanded she follow strict behavioural standards, including good table manners, and that she wear appropriate clothes.{{sfn|Singer|2006|p=10–12}} Her mother was extremely selective in choosing companions for her, and as a result Bardot had very few childhood friends.{{sfn|Singer|2006|p=10–11}} Bardot cited a personal traumatic incident when she and her sister broke her parents' favourite vase while they were playing in the house; her father [[whip]]ped the sisters 20 times and henceforth treated them like &quot;strangers&quot;, demanding them to address their parents by the pronoun &quot;[[wikt:vous#French|vous]]&quot;, which is used to address unfamiliar or respectable persons in the [[French language]].{{sfn|Singer|2006|p=11–12}} The incident decisively led to Bardot resenting her parents, and to her future rebellious lifestyle.{{sfn|Singer|2006|p=12}}

During [[World War II]], when Paris was [[Paris in World War II|occupied]] by [[Nazi Germany]], Bardot spent more time at home due to increasingly strict civilian surveillance.{{sfn|Singer|2006|p=10}} She became engrossed in dancing to [[phonograph record]]s, which her mother saw as a potential for a [[ballet]] career.{{sfn|Singer|2006|p=10}} Bardot was admitted at the age of seven to the private school [[Cours Hattemer]].{{sfn|Singer|2006|p=11}} She went to school three days a week, which gave her ample time to take dance lessons at a local studio, under her mother's arrangements.{{sfn|Singer|2006|p=10–11}} In 1949, Bardot was accepted at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]]. For three years she attended ballet classes held by Russian choreographer Boris Knyazev.{{sfn|Caron|2009|p=62}} She also studied at the Instistut de la Tour, a private Catholic high school near her home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Caroline |last=Pigozzi |title=Bardot s'en va toujours en guerre... pour les animaux |newspaper=[[Paris Match]] |issue=January 2018 |pp=76–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hélène Gordon-Lazareff]], the then-director of the magazines ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' and ''[[Le Jardin des Modes]]'', hired Bardot in 1949 as a &quot;junior&quot; fashion model.{{sfn|Bardot|1996|p=67}} On 8 March 1950, Bardot (aged 15 at the time) appeared on the cover of ''Elle'', which brought her an acting offer for the film ''Les Lauriers sont coupés'' from director [[Marc Allégret]].{{sfn|Singer|2006|p=19}} Her parents opposed her becoming an actress, but her grandfather was supportive, saying that &quot;If this little girl is to become a whore, cinema will not be the cause.&quot;{{efn-ua|Original quote: &quot;Si cette petite doit devenir putain ou pas, ce ne sera pas le cinéma qui en sera la cause.&quot;{{sfn|Bardot|1996|p=68–69}}}} At the audition, Bardot met [[Roger Vadim]], who later notified her that she did not get the role.{{sfn|Bardot|1996|p=69}} They subsequently fell in love.{{sfn|Bardot|1996|p=70}} Her parents fiercely opposed their relationship; her father announced to her one evening that she would continue her education in England and that he had bought her a train ticket, the journey to take place the following day.{{sfn|Bardot|1996|p=72}} Bardot reacted by putting her head into an oven with open fire; her parents stopped her and ultimately accepted the relationship, on condition that she marry Vadim at the age of 18.{{sfnm|Bardot|1996|1p=73|Singer|2006|2p=22}}

===First marriage and career beginnings: 1952–1955===
[[File:Brigitte Bardot, 1953 (36209530070).jpg|thumb|Brigitte Bardot at the [[1953 Cannes Film Festival]].]]
Bardot appeared on the cover of ''Elle'' again in 1952, which landed her a movie offer for the comedy ''[[Crazy for Love]]'' (1952), starring [[Bourvil]] and directed by [[Jean Boyer (director)|Jean Boyer]].{{sfn|Bardot|1996|p=81}} She was paid 200,000 [[French franc|francs]] (€4,700 in 2019 euros) for the small role portraying a cousin of the main character.{{sfn|Bardot|1996|p=81}} On 21 December 1952, Bardot (then 18 years old) married Vadim, under the consent of her parents. The wedding was held at the Notre-Dame-de-Grâce Church of Passy in the 16th arrondissement of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Éric |last=Neuhoff |title=Brigitte Bardot et Roger Vadim&amp;nbsp;– Le loup et la biche|work=[[Le Figaro]]|date=12 August 2013|language=French|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bardot had her second film role in ''[[Manina, the Girl in the Bikini]]'' (1953),{{efn-ua|While this is Bardot's second role, the film was released after ''The Long Teeth'' (1952).{{sfn|Bardot|1996|p=84}}}} directed by [[Willy Rozier]].{{sfn|Bardot|1996|p=84}} She also had roles in the 1953 films ''[[The Long Teeth]]'' and ''[[His Father's Portrait]]''.

Bardot had a small role in a Hollywood-financed film being shot in Paris, ''[[Act of Love (1953 film)|Act of Love]]'' (1953), starring [[Kirk Douglas]]. She received media attention when she attended the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in April 1953.&lt;ref name=&quot;twolives&quot;/&gt;

Bardot had a leading role in an Italian melodrama, ''[[Concert of Intrigue]]'' (1954) and in a French adventure film, ''[[Caroline and the Rebels]]'' (1954). She had a good part as a flirtatious student in ''[[School for Love]]'' (1955), opposite [[Jean Marais]], for director Marc Allégret.

Bardot played her first sizeable English-language role in ''[[Doctor at Sea (film)|Doctor at Sea]]'' (1955), as the love interest for [[Dirk Bogarde]]. The film was the third-most popular movie at the British box office that year.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;'The Dam Busters'.&quot; Times [London, England] 29 December 1955: 12. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 11 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

She had a small role in ''[[The Grand Maneuver]]'' (1955) for director [[René Clair]], supporting [[Gérard Philipe]] and [[Michèle Morgan|Michelle Morgan]]. The part was bigger in ''[[The Light Across the Street]]'' (1956) for director [[Georges Lacombe (director)|Georges Lacombe]]. She did another with Hollywood film, ''[[Helen of Troy (film)|Helen of Troy]]'', playing Helen's handmaiden.

For the 1956 Italian movie [[Nero's Weekend|''Mio figlio Nerone'']] Bardot was asked by the director to appear as a blonde. Rather than wear a wig to hide her naturally brunette hair she decided to dye her hair. She was so pleased with the results that she decided to retain the hair colour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Servat. Page 76&quot;&gt;Servat. Page 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise to stardom: 1956–1962===
[[File:Brigitte_Bardot_Venice_1958.jpg|thumb|left|Brigitte Bardot during 1958 [[Venice Film Festival]].]]
Bardot then appeared in four movies that made her a star. First up was a musical, ''[[Naughty Girl (film)|Naughty Girl]]'' (1956), where Bardot played a troublesome school girl. Directed by [[Michel Boisrond]], it was co-written by Roger Vadim and was a big hit, the 12th most popular film of the year in France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=search&amp;rurl=translate.google.com.au&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.boxofficestory.com/france-1956-c22750159&amp;usg=ALkJrhhiLGcr7S1Wd-3bM_0zuo9qMV9r9A Box office figures in France for 1956] at Box Office Story&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by a comedy, ''[[Plucking the Daisy]]'' (1956), written by Vadim with the director Marc Allegret, and another success at France. So too was the comedy ''[[The Bride Is Much Too Beautiful]]'' (1956) with [[Louis Jourdan]].

Finally there was the melodrama ''[[And God Created Woman (1956 film)|And God Created Woman]]'' (1956), Vadim's debut as director, with Bardot starring opposite [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]] and [[Curt Jurgens]]. The film, about an immoral teenager in a respectable small-town setting, was a huge success, not just in France but also around the world – it was among the ten most popular films in Britain in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Most Popular Film of the Year. ''The Times (London, England)'', Thursday, 12 Dec 1957; pg. 3; Issue 54022&lt;/ref&gt; It turned Bardot into an international star.&lt;ref name=&quot;twolives&quot;/&gt; From at least 1956&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55474324|title=Mam'selle Kitten New box-office beauty|date=5 December 1956|work=Australian Women's Weekly|access-date=5 March 2019|pages=32|via=[[Trove]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was being hailed as the &quot;[[sex kitten]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2014/sep/20/brigitte-bardot-her-life-and-times-so-far-in-pictures|work=The Guardian|title=Brigitte Bardot: her life and times so far – in pictures &amp;#124; Film &amp;#124; The Guardian |accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3649602/life-with-brigitte-bardot-rare-and-classic-photos-of-the-original-sex-kitten/|publisher=time.com|title=Brigitte Bardot: Rare and Classic Photos of the Original &amp;#039;Sex Kitten&amp;#039; |accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The earliest use cited in the [[Oxford English Dictionary#Electronic versions|OED Online]] (accessed 26 November 2011) is in the [[Daily Sketch]], 2 June 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

During her early career, professional photographer Sam Lévin's photos contributed to the image of Bardot's sensuality. One showed Bardot from behind, dressed in a white corset. British photographer [[Cornel Lucas]] made images of Bardot in the 1950s and 1960s that have become representative of her public persona.

Bardot followed ''And God Created Woman'' with ''[[La Parisienne (film)|La Parisienne]]'' (1957), a comedy co-starring [[Charles Boyer]] for director Boisrond. She was reunited with Vadim in another melodrama ''[[The Night Heaven Fell]]'' (1958) and played a criminal who seduced [[Jean Gabin]] in ''[[In Case of Adversity]]'' (1958). The latter was the 13th most seen movie of the year in France.&lt;ref name=&quot;box&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=search&amp;rurl=translate.google.com.au&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.boxofficestory.com/box-office-brigitte-bardot-c22691591/19&amp;usg=ALkJrhhIEncp1KXspugND8vN3RRD5RUhgA |title=Box office information for Love is My Profession|website=Box office story}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Female (1959 film)|The Female]]'' (1959) for director [[Julien Duvivier]] was popular, but ''[[Babette Goes to War]]'' (1959), a comedy set in World War Two, was a huge hit, the fourth biggest movie of the year in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=search&amp;rurl=translate.google.com.au&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.boxofficestory.com/box-office-brigitte-bardot-c22691591/21|title=1959 French box office|website=Box Office Story|access-date=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also widely seen was ''[[Come Dance with Me (1959 film)|Come Dance with Me]]'' (1959) from Boisrond.

Her next film was the courtroom drama ''[[The Truth (1960 film)|The Truth]]'' (1960), from [[Henri-Georges Clouzot]]. It was a highly publicised production, which resulted in Bardot having an affair and attempting suicide. The film was Bardot's biggest ever commercial success in France, the third biggest hit of the year, and was nominated for a Best Foreign Film Oscar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=search&amp;rurl=translate.google.com.au&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.boxofficestory.com/box-office-brigitte-bardot-c22691591/23&amp;usg=ALkJrhjiMrG7lbxo6Wu3IvVZsDYW_JPJvA Box office information for film] at Box Office Story&lt;/ref&gt;

She made a comedy with Vadim, ''[[Please, Not Now!]]'' (1961) and had a role in the all-star anthology, ''[[Famous Love Affairs]]'' (1962).

Bardot was awarded a [[David di Donatello|David di Donatello Award]] for Best Foreign actress for her role in ''[[A Very Private Affair]]'' (''Vie privée'', 1962), directed by [[Louis Malle]]. More popular in France was ''[[Love on a Pillow]]'' (1962), another for Vadim.

===International films and singing career: 1962–1969===
[[File:Brigitte_Bardot_em_visita_ao_Brasil,_1964.tif|thumb|Brigitte Bardot visiting [[Brazil]], 1964.]]
In the mid-1960s Bardot made films which seemed to be more aimed at the international market. In 1963, she starred in [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s film ''[[Contempt (film)|Le Mépris]]'', produced by [[Joseph E. Levine]] and starring [[Jack Palance]]. The following year she co-starred with [[Anthony Perkins]] in the comedy ''[[Une ravissante idiote]]'' (1964).

Bardot finally appeared in a Hollywood film in ''[[Dear Brigitte]]'' (1965), a comedy starring [[James Stewart]] as an academic whose son develops a crush on Bardot. Bardot's appearance was relatively brief and the film was not a big hit.

More successful was the Western buddy comedy ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965) for director Louis Malle, appearing opposite [[Jeanne Moreau]]. It was a big hit in France and around the world although it did not break through in the US as much as was hoped.&lt;ref name=&quot;tino&quot;&gt;Tino Balio, ''United Artists: The Company That Changed the Film Industry'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1987 p. 281&lt;/ref&gt;

After a cameo in Godard's ''[[Masculin Féminin]]'' (1966), she had her first flop in a long time, ''[[Two Weeks in September]]'' (1968), a French–English co-production. She had a small role in the all-star ''[[Spirits of the Dead]]'' (1968), acting opposite [[Alain Delon]], then tried a Hollywood film again: ''[[Shalako (film)|Shalako]]'' (1968), a Western starring [[Sean Connery]], which was a box office disappointment.&lt;ref name=&quot;variety&quot;&gt;&quot;ABC's 5 Years of Film Production Profits &amp; Losses&quot;, ''Variety'', 31 May 1973 p 3&lt;/ref&gt;

She participated in several musical shows and recorded many popular songs in the 1960s and 1970s, mostly in collaboration with [[Serge Gainsbourg]], Bob Zagury and [[Sacha Distel]], including &quot;Harley Davidson&quot;; &quot;Je Me Donne À Qui Me Plaît&quot;; &quot;Bubble gum&quot;; &quot;Contact&quot;; &quot;Je Reviendrai Toujours Vers Toi&quot;; &quot;L'Appareil À Sous&quot;; &quot;La Madrague&quot;; &quot;On Déménage&quot;; &quot;Sidonie&quot;; &quot;Tu Veux, Ou Tu Veux Pas?&quot;; &quot;Le Soleil De Ma Vie&quot; (the cover of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s &quot;[[You Are the Sunshine of My Life]]&quot;); and the notorious &quot;Je t'aime... moi non-plus&quot;. Bardot pleaded with Gainsbourg not to release this duet and he complied with her wishes; the following year, he rerecorded a version with British-born model and actress [[Jane Birkin]] that became a massive hit all over Europe. The version with Bardot was issued in 1986 and became a popular download hit in 2006 when [[Universal Music]] made its back catalogue available to purchase online, with this version of the song ranking as the third most popular download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6058742.stm|title=Bardot revived as download star|date=17 October 2006|work=BBC News|accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final films: 1969–1973===
[[File:Brigitte Bardot.jpg|thumb|left|Bardot in 1968]]
From 1969 to 1978, Bardot was the official face of [[Marianne]] (who had previously been anonymous) to represent the liberty of France.&lt;ref name=Sohn&gt;Anne-Marie Sohn (teacher at the [[École Normale Supérieure|ENS]]-Lyon), [http://hist-geo.ac-rouen.fr/doc/bls/2004/marian.htm Marianne ou l'histoire de l'idée républicaine aux XIXe et XXe siècles à la lumière de ses représentations] (résumé of Maurice Agulhon's three books, ''Marianne au combat'', ''Marianne au pouvoir'' and ''Les métamorphoses de Marianne'') {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Les Femmes]]'' (1969) was a flop, although the screwball comedy ''[[The Bear and the Doll]]'' (1970) performed slightly better. Her last few films were mostly comedies: ''[[Les Novices]]'' (1970), ''[[Boulevard du Rhum]]'' (1971) (with [[Lino Ventura]]). ''[[The Legend of Frenchie King]]'' (1971) was more popular, helped by Bardot co-starring with [[Claudia Cardinale]]. She made one more with Vadim, ''[[Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman]]'' (1973), playing the title role. Vadim said the film marked &quot;Underneath what people call &quot;the Bardot myth&quot; was something interesting, even though she was never considered the most professional actress in the world. For years, since she has been growing older, and the Bardot myth has become just a souvenir... I was curious in her as a woman and I had to get to the end of something with her, to get out of her and express many things I felt were in her. Brigitte always gave the impression of sexual freedom – she is a completely open and free person, without any aggression. So I gave her the part of a man – that amused me.&lt;ref name=&quot;vadim&quot;&gt;ROGER VADIM Wilson, Timothy. The Guardian (1959–2003) [London (UK)] 7 Apr 1973: 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;If ''Don Juan'' is not my last movie it will be my next to last,&quot; said Bardot during filming.&lt;ref&gt;Brigitte Bardot: No longer a sex symbol

In 1973, Bardot announced she was retiring from acting as &quot;a way to get out elegantly&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Modesto Bee-7 June 1973&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Brigitte Bardot Gives Up Films at Age of 39|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=d-EpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AYEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3388%2C1836097|agency=UPI|newspaper=The Modesto Bee|location=Modesto, California|date=7 June 1973|page=A-8|accessdate=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal rights activism: 1973–present===
In 1973, before her 39th birthday, Bardot announced her retirement. After appearing in more than forty motion pictures and recording several music albums, most notably with [[Serge Gainsbourg]], she used her fame to promote [[animal rights]].

In 1986, she established the [[Fondation Brigitte Bardot|Brigitte Bardot Foundation]] for the Welfare and Protection of Animals.&lt;ref name=foundationhistory&gt;

In August 2010, Bardot addressed a letter to the Queen of Denmark, [[Margrethe II of Denmark]], appealing for the sovereign to halt the [[Whaling in the Faroe Islands|killing of dolphins]] in the [[Faroe Islands]]. In the letter, Bardot describes the activity as a &quot;macabre spectacle&quot; that &quot;is a shame for Denmark and the Faroe Islands ...

==Personal life==
===''La Madrague''===
In May 1958, Bardot withdrew to the seclusion of [[Southern France]], where she had bought the house ''La Madrague'' in [[Saint-Tropez]].

===Relationships===
[[File:Brigitte Bardot - Sami Frey - Saint-Tropez - 1963.jpg|thumb|Bardot and [[Sami Frey]] in [[Saint-Tropez|St. Tropez]], 1963]]
On 21 December 1952, aged 18, Bardot married director [[Roger Vadim]]. They divorced in 1957, after less than five years of marriage; they had no children together, but remained in touch, and even collaborated on later projects. The stated reason for the divorce was Bardot's affairs with two other men. While married to Vadim, Bardot had an affair with [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]], who was her co-star in ''And God Created Woman.'' Trintignant at the time was married to actress [[Stéphane Audran]].&lt;ref name=&quot;InitialsBB&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Brigitte|last=Bardot|title=Initiales B.B.|publisher=Grasset &amp; Fasquelle|year=1996|isbn=978-2-246-52601-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;twolives&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Robinson, Jeffrey|title=Bardot&amp;nbsp;— Two Lives|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] (London)|edition=First British|year=1994|id=ASIN: B000KK1LBM|author-link=Jeffrey Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two lived together for about two years, spanning the period before and after Bardot's divorce from Vadim, but they never married. Their relationship was complicated by Trintignant's frequent absence due to [[military service]] and Bardot's affair with musician [[Gilbert Bécaud]].&lt;ref name=&quot;InitialsBB&quot;/&gt;

In early 1958, her divorce from Vadim was followed in quick order by her break-up with Trintignant, and a reported nervous breakdown in Italy, according to newspaper reports. A suicide attempt with sleeping pills two days earlier was also noted, but was denied by her public relations manager.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimesblog&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedailymirror/files/1958_0209_cover.jpg|title=LA times 1958|accessdate=21 August 2010|work=The Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; She recovered within weeks and began an affair with actor [[Jacques Charrier]]. She became pregnant well before they were married on 18 June 1959. Bardot's only child, her son Nicolas-Jacques Charrier, was born on 11 January 1960. After she and Charrier divorced in 1962, Nicolas was raised in the Charrier family and had little contact with his biological mother until his adulthood.&lt;ref name=&quot;InitialsBB&quot;/&gt;

Nicolas-Jacques married in 1984 to Anna Lina Bjerkan, Norwegian model and daughter of Norwegian diplomat and he has two daughters Anna (born 1985), and Thea (born 1990)[https://people.com/archive/a-bardot-mystery-vol-38-no-22/].
 
Bardot had an affair with [[Glenn Ford]] in the early 1960’s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2011-apr-11-la-et-classic-hollywood-20110411-story.html/ |title= A Ford Fiesta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bardot's third marriage was to German millionaire playboy [[Gunter Sachs]], and lasted from 14 July 1966 to 1 October 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;InitialsBB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;twolives&quot;/&gt; In 1968, she began dating Patrick Gilles, who went on to co-star with her in ''[[The Bear and the Doll]]'' (1970); but she ended their relationship in spring 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;google2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Brigitte Bardot: A Biography|author=Singer, B.|date=2006|publisher=McFarland, Incorporated Publishers|isbn=9780786484263|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3e5vfj0ybGYC|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next few years, Bardot dated in succession bartender/ski instructor Christian Kalt, club owner Luigi Rizzi, musician (later producer) Bob Zagury, singer [[Serge Gainsbourg]], writer [[John Gilmore (writer)|John Gilmore]], actor [[Warren Beatty]], and Laurent Vergez, her co-star in ''[[Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;google2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google3&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Latin Lover: The Passionate South|author=Malossi, G.|date=1996|publisher=Charta|isbn=9788881580491|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qIHr5w38ac8C|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The longest of these relationships was with sculptor Miroslav Brozek; she lived with him from 1975 to December 1979&lt;ref name=&quot;people.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20086210,00.html|publisher=people.com|title=Swept Away by Her Sadness|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and posed for some of his sculptures. After breaking up with Brozek, she was in a long-term relationship with French TV producer Allain Bougrain-duBourg.&lt;ref name=&quot;people.com&quot;/&gt;

Bardot's fourth and current husband is Bernard d'Ormale, a former adviser of [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]], former leader of the far right party National Front (now [[National Rally (France)|National Rally]]); they were married on 16 August 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8503379/Gunter-Sachs.html|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Gunter Sachs|date=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
In 1974 Bardot appeared in a nude photo shoot in ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, which celebrated her 40th birthday. On 28 September 1983, her 49th birthday, Bardot took an overdose of sleeping pills or tranquilizers with red wine. She had to be rushed to the hospital, where her life was saved after a [[stomach pump]] was used to evacuate the pills from her body.&lt;ref name=&quot;people.com&quot;/&gt; Bardot is also a breast cancer survivor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecoglamazine.blogspot.com/2011/10/famous-breast-cancer-survivors.html Famous breast cancer survivors], ecoglamazine.blogspot.com; accessed 4 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beliefnet.com/Wellness/Health/galleries/Famous-proof-that-breast-cancer-is-survivable.aspx?p=4 Famous proof that breast cancer is survivable], beliefnet.com; accessed 4 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 1999 book ''Le Carré de Pluton'' (&quot;''Pluto's Square''&quot;), Bardot criticizes the procedure used in the [[ritual slaughter]] of sheep during the Muslim festival of [[Eid al-Adha]]. Additionally, in a section in the book entitled, &quot;Open Letter to My Lost France&quot;, Bardot writes that &quot;my country, France, my homeland, my land is again invaded by an overpopulation of foreigners, especially Muslims&quot;.

In her 2003 book, ''Un cri dans le silence'' (''A Scream in the Silence''), she contrasted her close gay friends with today's homosexuals, who &quot;jiggle their bottoms, put their little fingers in the air and with their little castrato voices moan about what those ghastly heteros put them through&quot; and said some contemporary homosexuals behave like &quot;fairground freaks&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/may/15/france.davidhearst|title=Anti-gay, anti-Islam Bardot to be sued|last1=Webster|first1=Paul|last2=Hearst|first2=David|date=5 May 2003|work=The Guardian|location=UK|accessdate=3 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her own defence, Bardot wrote in a letter to a French gay magazine: &quot;Apart from my husband — who maybe will cross over one day as well — I am entirely surrounded by homos.

In 2008, Bardot was convicted of inciting racial/religious hatred in regard to a letter she wrote, a copy of which she sent to [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] when he was [[Interior Minister of France]]. The letter stated her objections to Muslims in France [[Dhabihah|ritually slaughtering sheep]] by slitting their throats without anesthetizing them first.

In fashion, the Bardot neckline (a wide open neck that exposes both shoulders) is named after her. Bardot popularized this style which is especially used for knitted sweaters or jumpers although it is also used for other tops and dresses. Bardot popularized the [[bikini]] in her early films such as ''[[Manina, the Girl in the Bikini|Manina]]'' (1952) (released in France as ''Manina, la fille sans voiles''). The following year she was also photographed in a bikini on every beach in the south of France during the [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bikinis: a brief history|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/picturegalleries/10160619/Bikinis-a-brief-history.html?frame=2609664|newspaper=Telegraph|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She gained additional attention when she filmed ''[[And God Created Woman (1956 film)|...And God Created Woman]]'' (1956) with [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]] (released in France as ''Et Dieu Créa La Femme''). In it Bardot portrays an immoral teenager cavorting in a bikini who seduces men in a respectable small-town setting. The film was an international success.&lt;ref name=&quot;twolives&quot;/&gt; The bikini was in the 1950s relatively well accepted in France but was still considered risqué in the United States. As late as 1959, Anne Cole, one of the United States' largest swimsuit designers, said, &quot;It's nothing more than a G-string. It's at the razor's edge of decency.&quot;&lt;ref name=WOJSI&gt;{{cite magazine|first=William Oscar|last=Johnson|archivedate=20 October 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020050948/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1068171/3/index.htm |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1068171/3/index.htm|title=In The Swim|magazine=Sports Illustrated|date=7 February 1989|accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also brought into fashion the ''[[choucroute]]'' (&quot;Sauerkraut&quot;) hairstyle (a sort of [[beehive (hairstyle)|beehive hair style]]) and [[gingham]] clothes after wearing a checkered pink dress, designed by Jacques Esterel, at her wedding to Charrier.&lt;ref name=femstyle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.femminastyle.com/index.php?main_page=page&amp;id=9|title=Style Icon: Brigitte Bardot|publisher=Femminastyle.com|accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the subject of an [[Andy Warhol]] painting.

The '''Bardot pose''' describes an iconic modeling portrait shot around 1960 where Bardot is dressed only in a pair of black [[pantyhose]], cross-legged over her front and cross-armed over her breasts.

In addition to popularizing the bikini swimming suit, Bardot has been credited with popularizing the city of [[St. Tropez]] and the town of [[Armação dos Búzios]] in Brazil, which she visited in 1964 with her boyfriend at the time, Brazilian musician Bob Zagury. The place where she stayed in Búzios is today a small hotel, Pousada do Sol, and also a French restaurant, Cigalon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TOemBUZIOS.com |url=http://www.toembuzios.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108111621/http://www.toembuzios.com/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 January 2013 |website=toembuzios.com |publisher=TOemBUZIOS.com |language=pt |accessdate=27 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The town hosts a Bardot statue by Christina Motta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buziosonline.com.br/indexe.htm|title=BuziosOnline.com|publisher=BuziosOnline.com|accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lennon and Bardot met in person once, in 1968 at the Mayfair Hotel, introduced by Beatles press agent [[Derek Taylor]]; a nervous Lennon took [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] before arriving, and neither star impressed the other.
