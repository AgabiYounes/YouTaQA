'''Boogie Down Productions''' was a [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group, originally composed of [[KRS-One]], [[D-Nice]], and DJ [[Scott La Rock]]. DJ Scott La Rock was murdered on August 27, 1987, five months after the release of BDP's debut album, ''[[Criminal Minded]]''. The name of the group, Boogie Down, derives from a nickname for the [[South Bronx]] section of [[The Bronx]], one of the five boroughs of [[New York City]]. The group pioneered the fusion of [[dancehall]] reggae and [[hip hop music]] and their debut LP ''Criminal Minded'' contained frank descriptions of life in the South Bronx during the late 1980s, thus setting the stage for what would eventually become [[gangsta rap]].

==Members==
The membership of BDP changed continuously throughout its existence, the only constant being [[KRS-One]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin80&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Eighties Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2003|edition=Third|isbn=1-85227-969-9|pages=78/9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was founded by KRS-One and DJ Scott La Rock, with producer Lee Smith, who was essential in the production of the songs in the group's first album ''Criminal Minded'', being added as a member shortly after.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin80&quot;/&gt;  From those beginnings, BDP members and collaborators included Lee Smith, [[Scott La Rock]], [[D-Nice]], Henry Wilkerson [[PoppyDa]], Kenny Parker (younger brother of KRS-One), Just-Ice, ICU, McBoo, [[Ms. Melodie]], [[Heather B.]], Scottie Morris, Tony Rahsan, Willie D., RoboCop, Harmony, [[DJ Red Alert]], Jay Kramer, D-Square, Rebekah Foster, Scott Whitehill, Scott King, Chris Tait and Sidney Mills. BDP as a group essentially ended because KRS-One began recording and performing under his own name rather than the group name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin80&quot;/&gt; Original member Lee Smith, who has co-producer credit on the original 12” &quot;South Bronx&quot; single, was the last to be inexplicably jettisoned by KRS-One and the future new label after Scott's death.

In the liner notes on BDP's 1992 album ''Sex and Violence'', KRS-One writes: &quot;BDP in 1992 is KRS-One, Willie D, and Kenny Parker! BDP is not D-Nice, Jamal-ski, Harmony, Ms. Melodie, and Scottie Morris. They are not down with BDP so stop frontin'.&quot; Steve &quot;Flash&quot; Juon of RapReviews.com claimed that this initiated the ultimate breakup of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/BTTL_sexandviolence.html|title=Boogie Down Productions :: Sex and Violence :: Jive Records|website=Rapreviews.com|accessdate=October 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural influences and impact==
===&quot;The Bridge Wars&quot;===
{{Main|The Bridge Wars}}

A conflict arose in the late 1980s concerning the origins of hip-hop, and BDP made conscious efforts in its early work to establish its interpretation of the issue. The origins of hip-hop to many, including BDP, are believed to be from [[the Bronx]]. A rival [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] collective, known as the [[Juice Crew]]'s lyrics, were misunderstood to contain a claim in the song &quot;The Bridge&quot; that hip hop was directly a result of artists originating from [[Queensbridge, Queens|Queensbridge]]. Boogie Down and KRS retorted angrily with songs such as “The Bridge is Over” and “South Bronx,” which started one of the first notable hip hop wars as [[MC Shan]], [[Marley Marl]], [[Roxanne Shanté]] and [[Blaq Poet]] all released songs featuring verses personally attacking KRS and Scott La Rock. The Bridge Wars, however, were only short-lived, and after the death of Scott La Rock prior to the group's second album, KRS began to concentrate on socially conscious music.

While ''Criminal Minded'' contained vivid descriptions of South Bronx street life, BDP changed after Scott's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin80&quot;/&gt; Producer Lee Smith was dropped and KRS-One adopted the Teacha moniker and made a deliberate attempt at creating politically and socially conscious hip-hop. BDP was influential in provoking political and social consciousness in hip-hop. However, the group was sometimes overshadowed by [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]].

===Jamaican inspirations===
The Jamaican influence present in ''Criminal Minded'' is well illustrated by the use of the &quot;Mad Mad&quot; or &quot;Diseases&quot; [[riddim]] started in 1981 with reggae star [[Yellowman]]'s song &quot;Zunguzung.&quot; BDP used this riff in the song &quot;Remix for P is Free,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoJeThDfdzk|title=YouTube|website=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was later resampled by artists such as [[Black Star (group)|Black Star]] and [[dead prez]]. As an album regarded by many as the start of the [[gangsta rap]] movement,&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin80&quot;/&gt; ''Criminal Minded'' played an important role in reaffirming the social acceptance of having Jamaican roots. BDP referenced reggae in a way that helped to solidify Jamaica's place in modern hip-hop culture.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Wayne.

==Political and social activism==
From its start, BDP was impactful in both the development of hip-hop and giving a sincere voice to the reality of life in the South Bronx, a section of New York City that is clouded with poverty and crime. With its debut album ''Criminal Minded'', this early hip-hop group combined the sounds of LaRock's harsh, spare, reggae-influenced beats and KRS-One's long-winded rhyme style on underground classics such as “9mm Goes Bang” and “South Bronx,” the album's gritty portrait of life on the streets (as well as the firearms that adorned its cover) influenced the [[gangsta rap]] movement that began in earnest two years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordaasc.com/public/index.jsp?url=%2Farticle%2Fopr%2Ft0002%2Fe2252%3Fhi%3D0%26highlight%3D1%26from%3Dquick%26pos%3D1&amp;failReason=|title=Oxford AASC: Home|website=Oxfordaasc.com|accessdate=October 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of BDP in the creation and development of gangsta rap highlights the cultural significance and impact of the type of music BDP and other early hip-hop artists like it created. This subgenre of hip-hop is most closely associated with hard-core hip-hop and is widely misinterpreted as promoting violence and gang activity. This misinterpretation or stigma is closely related to Boogie Down Productions and the general purpose behind their underlying themes of violence. For instance, the cover art of ''Criminal Minded'' displays the two artists in this group brandishing drawn guns and displaying other firearms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin80&quot;/&gt; This is not an encouragement of the violence described in BDP's music, but rather a portrayal or hinting at the violence present in the South Bronx as a means of expression, escape, and even condemnation. This album art is not meant to advocate for violence but to challenge the conception of a criminal, to assert that those who are really criminally minded are those who hold power.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The music of BDP became significantly more politically astute after the death of disc jockey Scott La Rock,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1987&quot;&gt;Iverem, Esther. &quot;Violent Death Halts Rap Musician's Rise.&quot; ''[[The New York Times]]'', 31 August 1987&lt;/ref&gt; KRS-One's went on to publish four more albums under the title of Boogie Down Productions, and each one was increasingly innovative and expanded from the thuggish imagery of ''Criminal Minded'' and began to explore themes like black-on-black crime, and black radicalism, using a riff on the words of [[Malcolm X]], “by any means necessary”, which became the title of the second BDP album, and still remains as one of the most political hip-hop albums to date.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;  It was in this album where KRS defined himself as the “teacha” or “teacher” symbolizing his emphasis on educating his audience members and fans about relevant social issues surrounding the African-American experience.

During his time in association with Boogie Down Productions, KRS-One joined with other rappers to create the [[Stop the Violence Movement]], which addressed many of the issues brought about through BDP's music and is the most conscious effort displayed by KRS-One and Boogie Down Productions of political Activism and engagement. The movement created the single “Self-Destruction” in 1989 through the collaboration of hip-hop artists Boogie Down Productions (KRS-One, D-Nice &amp; Ms. Melodie), [[Stetsasonic]] (Delite, Daddy-O, [[Wise (rapper)|Wise]], and Frukwan), [[Kool Moe Dee]], [[MC Lyte]], [[Doug E. Fresh]], [[Just-Ice]], [[Heavy D]], [[Biz Markie]], [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] ([[Chuck D]] &amp; [[Flavor Flav]]) with the aim of spreading awareness about violence throughout African-American and hip-hop communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;Nielson, E.. &quot;&quot;Can't C Me&quot;: Surveillance and Rap Music.&quot; Journal of Black Studies 40.6 (2010): 1254-1274. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; All proceeds from this effort went to the [[National Urban League]].
