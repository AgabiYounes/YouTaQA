      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Games played''' ('''GP''') is a [[statistic]] used in [[team sport]]s to indicate the total number of games in which a player has participated (in any capacity); the statistic is generally applied irrespective of whatever portion of the game is contested.

==Baseball==
In [[baseball]], the [[baseball statistics|statistic]] applies also to players who, prior to a game, are included on a [[starting lineup]] card or are announced as ''[[ex-ante|ex ante]]'' substitutes, whether or not they play,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/official_scorer_10.jsp Section 20 of the official scorer guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt; although, in [[Major League Baseball]], the application of this statistic does not extend to consecutive games played streaks. A [[starting pitcher]], then, may be credited with a game played even as he is not credited with a [[games started|game started]] or an [[innings pitched|inning pitched]].
