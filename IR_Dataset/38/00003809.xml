In [[baseball]], a '''sacrifice fly''' (sometimes abbreviated to '''sac fly''') is defined by Rule 9.08(d) &lt;ref name=&quot;MLB Rules&quot;&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/official_rules.jsp Official Rules | MLB.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;:
&quot;Score a sacrifice fly when, before two are out, the batter hits a ball in flight handled by an outfielder or an infielder running in the outfield in fair or foul territory that
# is caught, and a run scores after the catch, or
# is dropped, and a runner scores, if in the scorer's judgment the runner could have scored after the catch had the fly ball been caught.&quot;

It is called a &quot;sacrifice&quot; fly because the batter allows a teammate to score a run, while sacrificing his own ability to do so. Sacrifice flies are traditionally recorded in [[box score (baseball)|box scores]] with the designation &quot;SF&quot;.

== Rules ==

As addressed within Rule 9.02(a)(1) of the Official Baseball Rules&lt;ref name=&quot;MLB Rules&quot;/&gt; a sacrifice fly is not counted as a time [[at bat]] for the batter, though the batter is credited with a [[run batted in]].

The purpose of not counting a sacrifice fly as an at-bat is to avoid penalizing hitters for a successful action. The sacrifice fly is one of two instances in baseball where a batter is not charged with a time at bat after putting a ball in play; the other is the [[sacrifice hit]] (also known as a sacrifice bunt). But, while a sacrifice fly doesn't affect a player's [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]], it counts as a [[plate appearance]] and lowers his [[on-base percentage]]. A player on a [[hitting streak]] will have the hit streak end if he has no official at-bats but has a sacrifice fly. 

The reason for this is that the sacrifice fly, unlike the sacrifice bunt, is not considered a tactical maneuver (players don't try to hit a fly ball to advance a runner—they are unable to do that consistently anyway). Unlike a sacrifice bunt, which may be scored if a runner advances from any base to any base, a sacrifice fly is only credited if a runner scores on the play.  Therefore, when a runner on first or second base tags on a fly ball and advances no further than third base, no sacrifice is given and the batter is charged with an at-bat. Also, if a runner tags and advances from second base (or, theoretically, from first base) all the way to home and scores (without an intervening error) the batter is credited with a sacrifice fly, as well as a second RBI if a runner on third also scores. At the professional level this will only typically occur in unusual circumstances that prevent the defense from making an immediate throw back to the infield, such as an outfielder colliding with the wall while making a catch on the warning track. 

The sacrifice fly is credited even if another runner is put out so long as the run scores.  The sacrifice fly is credited on a dropped ball even if another runner is forced out by reason of the batter becoming a runner. 

On any fly ball, a runner can attempt to advance bases right as soon as a fielder touches the ball by tagging up, even before the fielder has full control of the ball.

==Records==
The most sacrifice flies by a team in one game is five; the record was established by the [[Seattle Mariners]] in 1988, tied by the [[Colorado Rockies]] in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=260607127|title=Torrealba's slam, five sac flies power Rockies past Bucs|publisher=ESPN.com|date=June 7, 2006|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tied again by the Mariners in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/PrintStory.pl?document_id=2004351837&amp;zsection_id=2002990524&amp;slug=mari16&amp;date=20080416|title=Seattle Mariners ride flurry of sacrifice flies to 11-6 victory over Kansas City Royals|date=April 16, 2008|first=Larry|last=Stone|newspaper=Seattle Times}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Five teams have collected three sacrifice flies in an inning: the [[Chicago White Sox]] (fifth inning, July 1, 1962 against the [[Cleveland Indians]]); the [[New York Yankees]] twice (fourth inning, June 29, 2000 against the [[Detroit Tigers]] and third inning, August 19, 2000 against the [[Anaheim Angels]]); the [[New York Mets]] (second inning, June 24, 2005 against the Yankees); and the [[Houston Astros]] (seventh inning, June 26, 2005 against the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/sacrifice_flies_records.shtml Sacrifice Flies Records&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In these cases one or more of the flies did not result in a putout due to an error.

Since the rule was reinstated in its present form in 1954, [[Gil Hodges]] of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers| Dodgers]] holds the record for most sacrifice flies in one season with 19, in 1954;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/SF_season.shtml Single Season Records], baseball-reference.com.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eddie Murray]] holds the record for most sacrifice flies in a career with 128.&lt;ref name=bbrefcareer&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/SF_career.shtml|title=Career Leaders &amp; Records for Sacrifice Flies|work=Baseball Reference|accessdate=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the end of the [[2018_Major_League_Baseball_season|2018 season]], players who had hit 115 or more career sacrifice flies:

1. [[Eddie Murray]] (128)&lt;BR&gt;
2. [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] (127)&lt;BR&gt;
3. [[Robin Yount]] (123)&lt;BR&gt;
4. [[Hank Aaron]] (121)&lt;BR&gt;
4. [[Frank Thomas (AL baseball player)|Frank Thomas]] (121)&lt;BR&gt;
6. [[George Brett (baseball)|George Brett]] (120)&lt;BR&gt;
6. [[Rubén Sierra]] (120)&lt;BR&gt;
8. [[Rafael Palmeiro]] (119)&lt;BR&gt;
8. [[Rusty Staub|Daniel &quot;Rusty&quot; Staub]] (119)&lt;BR&gt;
10. [[Andre Dawson]] (118)&lt;BR&gt;
11. [[Don Baylor]] (115)

Only once has the [[World Series]] been won on a sac fly. In [[1912 World Series|1912]], [[Larry Gardner]] of the [[Boston Red Sox]] hit a fly ball off a pitch from the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]]' [[Christy Mathewson]]. [[Steve Yerkes]] tagged up and scored from third base to win game 8 in the tenth inning and take the series for the Red Sox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/ws/world_series_final_outs.shtml|title=World Series Final Outs|publisher=Baseball Almanac|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/ws/yr1912ws.shtml|title=1912 World Series|publisher=Baseball Almanac|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2008}}
Batters have not been charged with a time at-bat for a sacrifice hit since 1893, but baseball has changed the sacrifice fly rule multiple times. The sacrifice fly as a statistical category was instituted in 1908, only to be discontinued in 1931. The rule was again adopted in 1939, only to be eliminated again in 1940, before being adopted for the last time in 1954.
