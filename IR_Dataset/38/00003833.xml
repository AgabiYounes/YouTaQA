'''''Beowulf''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|eɪ|ə|w|ʊ|l|f|}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/beowulf|title=Beowulf|work=[[Collins English Dictionary]]|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ang|Bēowulf }} {{IPA-ang|ˈbeːowulf|}}) is an Old English [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] consisting of 3,182 [[Alliterative verse|alliterative lines]]. It is one of the most important works of [[Old English literature]]. The date of composition is a matter of contention among scholars; the only certain dating pertains to the manuscript, which was produced between 975 and 1025.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Robert Chase|Chase, Colin]]. (1997). The dating of ''Beowulf''. pp. 9–22. University of Toronto Press&lt;/ref&gt; The anonymous poet is referred to by scholars as the &quot;''Beowulf'' poet&quot;.{{Sfn|Robinson|2001|loc=?|ps=: &quot;The name of the author who assembled from tradition the materials of his story and put them in their final form is not known to us.&quot;}}

The story is set in [[Scandinavia]]. [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]], a hero of the [[Geats]], comes to the aid of [[Hrothgar]], the king of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], whose [[mead hall]] in [[Heorot]] has been under attack by a monster known as [[Grendel]]. After Beowulf slays him, [[Grendel's mother]] attacks the hall and is then also defeated. Victorious, Beowulf goes home to Geatland ([[Götaland]] in modern Sweden) and becomes king of the Geats. Fifty years later, Beowulf defeats a [[The Dragon (Beowulf)|dragon]], but is mortally wounded in the battle. After his death, his attendants cremate his body and erect a tower on a headland in his memory.

The poem survives in a single copy in the manuscript known as the [[Nowell Codex]]. It has no title in the original manuscript, but has become known by the name of the story's protagonist.{{Sfn|Robinson|2001|ps=: &quot;Like most Old English stories, Beowulf has no title in the unique manuscript in which it survives (British Library, Cotton Vitellius A.xv, which was copied round the year 1000 AD), but modern scholars agree in naming it after the hero whose life is its subject&quot;.}} In 1731, the manuscript was damaged by a fire that swept through [[Ashburnham House]] in London that had a collection of medieval manuscripts assembled by [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington|Sir Robert Bruce Cotton]]; the margins were charred, and a number of readings were lost.{{Sfn|Mitchell|Robinson|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=uujn741w2Y4C&amp;pg=PA6 6]}} The Nowell Codex is housed in the [[British Library]].

== Historical background ==
[[File:Beowulf geography names.png|left|thumb|Approximate central regions of tribes mentioned in ''Beowulf'', with the location of the [[Angles]] in [[Angeln]]. See [[Scandza]] for details of Scandinavia's political fragmentation in the 6th century.]]
The events in the poem take place over most of the sixth century, and feature no English characters. Some suggest that ''Beowulf'' was first composed in the 7th century at [[Rendlesham]] in [[East Anglia]], as the [[Sutton Hoo]] [[ship burial|ship-burial]] shows close connections with Scandinavia, and the East Anglian royal dynasty, the [[Wuffingas]], may have been descendants of the Geatish [[Wulfing]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;chickering&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Chickering |first=Howell D. |title=Beowulf |edition=dual-language |location=New York |publisher=Doubleday |year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;newton&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton |first=Sam |title=The Origins of Beowulf and the Pre-Viking Kingdom of East Anglia |location=Woodbridge, Suffolk, [[England|ENG]] |publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-85991-361-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have associated this poem with the court of King [[Alfred the Great]] or with the court of King [[Cnut the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waugh|first1=Robin|title=Literacy, Royal Power, and King-Poet Relations in Old English and Old Norse Compositions|journal=Comparative Literature|date=1997|volume=49|issue=4|pages=289–315|doi=10.2307/1771534|jstor=1771534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem blends fictional, legendary and historic elements. Although Beowulf himself is not mentioned in any other Anglo-Saxon manuscript,&lt;ref&gt;Noted, for example, by John Grigsby, ''Beowulf &amp; Grendel'' 2005:12.&lt;/ref&gt; scholars generally agree that many of the other figures referred to in ''Beowulf'' also appear in Scandinavian sources. (Specific works are designated in the following section).&lt;ref name=&quot;shippey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shippey |first=TA |title=Wicked Queens and Cousin Strategies in Beowulf and Elsewhere, Notes and Bibliography |url=http://www.heroicage.org/issues/5/Shippey1.html |journal=The Heroic Age |issue=5|date=Summer 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concerns not only individuals (e.g., [[Halfdan|Healfdene]], [[Hrothgar|Hroðgar]], [[Halga]], [[Hrólfr Kraki|Hroðulf]], [[Eadgils]] and [[Ohthere]]), but also [[Norse clans|clans]] (e.g., [[Scylding]]s, [[Yngling|Scylfings]] and Wulfings) and certain events (e.g., the [[Battle on the Ice of Lake Vänern|battle between Eadgils and Onela]]). The raid by King [[Hygelac]] into [[Frisia]] is mentioned by [[Gregory of Tours]] in his ''History of the [[Franks]]'' and can be dated to around 521.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nFYeAQAAIAAJ&amp;q |title=Beowulf |last=Carruthers |first=Leo M. |date=1998 |publisher=Didier Erudition |page=37 |access-date=23 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Denmark, recent archaeological excavations at [[Lejre]], where Scandinavian tradition located the seat of the Scyldings, i.e., [[Heorot]], have revealed that a hall was built in the mid-6th century, exactly the time period of ''Beowulf''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Niles HT&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Niles |first=John D. |title=Beowulf's Great Hall |journal=History Today |volume=56 |issue=10 |date=October 2006 |url=http://www.historytoday.com/john-d-niles/beowulf%E2%80%99s-great-hall |pages=40–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three halls, each about {{convert|50|m}} long, were found during the excavation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Niles HT&quot; /&gt;

The majority view appears to be that people such as King Hroðgar and the Scyldings in ''Beowulf'' are based on historical people from 6th-century Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carlaz.com/phd/cea_phd_chap4.pdf |last=Anderson |first=Carl Edlund |year=1999 |title=Formation and Resolution of Ideological Contrast in the Early History of Scandinavia |type=Ph.D. thesis |publisher=University of Cambridge, Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse &amp; Celtic (Faculty of English) |page=115 |accessdate=1 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the ''[[Finnesburg Fragment]]'' and several shorter surviving poems, ''Beowulf'' has consequently been used as a source of information about Scandinavian figures such as Eadgils and Hygelac, and about continental Germanic figures such as [[Offa of Angel|Offa]], king of the continental [[Angles]].
[[File:Eadgil's barrow.PNG|thumb|upright=1.5|Finds from the western mound, left, excavated in 1874, support ''Beowulf'' and the sagas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nerman&quot; /&gt;]]

19th-century archaeological evidence may confirm elements of the ''Beowulf'' story. [[Eadgils]] was buried at Uppsala ([[Gamla Uppsala]], Sweden) according to [[Snorri Sturluson]]. When the western mound (to the left in the photo) was excavated in 1874, the finds showed that a powerful man was buried in a large barrow, c. 575, on a bear skin with two dogs and rich grave offerings. The eastern mound was excavated in 1854, and contained the remains of a woman, or a woman and a young man. The middle barrow has not been excavated.&lt;ref name=&quot;klingmark&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Klingmark |first=Elisabeth |title=Gamla Uppsala, Svenska kulturminnen 59 |language=Swedish |publisher=Riksantikvarieämbetet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nerman&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Nerman |first=Birger|title=Det svenska rikets uppkomst |location=Stockholm |year=1925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
The protagonist [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]], a hero of the Geats, comes to the aid of Hrothgar, king of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], whose great hall, [[Heorot]], is plagued by the monster [[Grendel]]. Beowulf kills Grendel with his bare hands and Grendel's mother with a giant's sword that he found in her lair.

Later in his life, Beowulf becomes king of the Geats, and finds his realm terrorized by a [[The Dragon (Beowulf)|dragon]], some of whose treasure had been stolen from his hoard in a burial mound. He attacks the dragon with the help of his ''[[thegn]]s'' or servants, but they do not succeed. Beowulf decides to follow the dragon to its lair at [[Earnaness|Earnanæs]], but only his young Swedish relative [[Wiglaf]], whose name means &quot;remnant of valour&quot;,{{refn|group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;|&quot;wíg&quot; means &quot;fight, battle, war, conflict&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wíg |url=http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/035625 |website=Bosworth-Toller Anglo-Saxon Dictionary |accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;láf&quot; means &quot;remnant, left-over&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Láf |url=http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/021034 |website=Bosworth-Toller Anglo-Saxon Dictionary |accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} dares to join him. Beowulf finally slays the dragon, but is mortally wounded in the struggle. He is cremated and a burial mound by the sea is erected in his honour.

''Beowulf'' is considered an epic poem in that the main character is a hero who travels great distances to prove his strength at impossible odds against supernatural demons and beasts. The poem also begins ''[[in medias res]]'' or simply, &quot;in the middle of things,&quot; which is a characteristic of the epics of antiquity. Although the poem begins with Beowulf's arrival, Grendel's attacks have been an ongoing event. An elaborate history of characters and their lineages is spoken of, as well as their interactions with each other, debts owed and repaid, and deeds of valour. The warriors form a kind of brotherhood linked by loyalty to their lord. The poem begins and ends with funerals: at the beginning of the poem for [[Scyld Scefing]] (26–45) and at the end for Beowulf (3140–3170).

=== First battle: Grendel  ===

''Beowulf'' begins with the story of Hrothgar, who constructed the great hall [[Heorot]] for himself and his warriors. In it, he, his wife [[Wealhþeow|Wealhtheow]], and his warriors spend their time singing and celebrating. Grendel, a troll-like monster said to be descended from the biblical [[Cain]], is pained by the sounds of joy.&lt;ref&gt;''Beowulf'', 87–98&lt;/ref&gt; Grendel attacks the hall and kills and devours many of Hrothgar's warriors while they sleep. Hrothgar and his people, helpless against Grendel, abandon Heorot.

Beowulf, a young warrior from Geatland, hears of Hrothgar's troubles and with his king's permission leaves his homeland to assist Hrothgar.&lt;ref&gt;''Beowulf'', 199–203&lt;/ref&gt;

Beowulf and his men spend the night in Heorot. Beowulf refuses to use any weapon because he holds himself to be the equal of Grendel.&lt;ref&gt;''Beowulf'', 675–687&lt;/ref&gt; When Grendel enters the hall, Beowulf, who has been feigning sleep, leaps up to clench Grendel's hand.&lt;ref&gt;''Beowulf'', 757–765&lt;/ref&gt; Grendel and Beowulf battle each other violently.&lt;ref&gt;''Beowulf'', 766–789&lt;/ref&gt; Beowulf's retainers draw their swords and rush to his aid, but their blades cannot pierce Grendel's skin.&lt;ref&gt;''Beowulf'', 793–804&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Beowulf tears Grendel's arm from his body at the shoulder and Grendel runs to his home in the marshes where he dies.&lt;ref&gt;''Beowulf'', 808–823&lt;/ref&gt; Beowulf displays &quot;the whole of Grendel's shoulder and arm, his awesome grasp&quot; for all to see at Heorot. This display would fuel Grendel's mother's anger in revenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simpson|first1=James|title=The Norton Anthology of English Literature vol. A|date=2012|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second battle: Grendel's mother ===
The next night, after celebrating Grendel's defeat, Hrothgar and his men sleep in Heorot. Grendel's mother, angry that her son has been killed, sets out to get revenge. &quot;Beowulf was elsewhere. Earlier, after the award of treasure, The Geat had been given another lodging&quot;; his assistance would be absent in this battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simpson|first1=James|title=The Norton Anthology of English Literature vol. A|date=2012|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grendel's mother violently kills [[Æschere]], who is Hrothgar's most loyal fighter, and escapes.

Hrothgar, Beowulf, and their men track Grendel's mother to her lair under a lake. [[Unferð]], a warrior who had earlier challenged him, presents Beowulf with his sword [[Hrunting]]. After stipulating a number of conditions to Hrothgar in case of his death (including the taking in of his kinsmen and the inheritance by Unferth of Beowulf's estate), Beowulf jumps into the lake, and while harassed by water monsters gets to the bottom, where he finds a cavern. Grendel's mother pulls him in, and she and Beowulf engage in fierce combat.

At first, Grendel's mother appears to prevail, and Hrunting proves incapable of hurting the woman; she throws Beowulf to the ground and, sitting astride him, tries to kill him with a short sword, but Beowulf is saved by his armour. Beowulf spots another sword, hanging on the wall and apparently made for giants, and cuts her head off with it. Travelling further into Grendel's mother's lair, Beowulf discovers Grendel's corpse and severs his head with the sword, whose blade melts because of the &quot;hot blood&quot;. Only the hilt remains. Beowulf swims back up to the rim of the pond where his men wait. Carrying the hilt of the sword and Grendel's head, he presents them to Hrothgar upon his return to Heorot.  Hrothgar gives Beowulf many gifts, including the sword [[Nægling]], his family's heirloom. The events prompt a long reflection by the king, sometimes referred to as &quot;Hrothgar's sermon&quot;, in which he urges Beowulf to be wary of pride and to reward his [[thegn]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Third battle: The dragon ===
{{Main|The dragon (Beowulf)}}
[[File:Beowulf face to face with fire-breathing Dragon.jpg|thumb|Beowulf face to face with the fire-breathing dragon]]
Beowulf returns home and eventually becomes king of his own people. One day, fifty years after Beowulf's battle with Grendel's mother, a [[slave]] steals a golden cup from the lair of a dragon at Earnanæs. When the dragon sees that the cup has been stolen, it leaves its cave in a rage, burning everything in sight. Beowulf and his warriors come to fight the dragon, but Beowulf tells his men that he will fight the dragon alone and that they should wait on the barrow. Beowulf descends to do battle with the dragon, but finds himself outmatched. His men, upon seeing this and fearing for their lives, retreat into the woods. One of his men, Wiglaf, however, in great distress at Beowulf's plight, comes to his aid. The two slay the dragon, but Beowulf is mortally wounded. After Beowulf dies, Wiglaf remains by his side, grief-stricken. When the rest of the men finally return, Wiglaf bitterly admonishes them, blaming their cowardice for Beowulf's death. Afterward, Beowulf is ritually burned on a great pyre in Geatland while his people wail and mourn him, fearing that without him, the Geats are defenceless against attacks from surrounding tribes. Afterwards, a barrow, visible from the sea, is built in his memory (''Beowulf'' lines 2712–3182).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Beowulf |publisher=MU |place=SA |url=https://faculty.mu.edu.sa/public/uploads/1348946962.7014beowulf.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324051854/https://faculty.mu.edu.sa/public/uploads/1348946962.7014beowulf.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-03-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Authorship and date ==
The dating of ''Beowulf'' has attracted considerable scholarly attention and opinion differs as to whether it was first written in the 8th century or whether the composition of the poem was nearly contemporary with its eleventh century manuscript and whether a proto-version of the poem (possibly a version of the [[Bear's Son Tale]]) was orally transmitted before being transcribed in its present form. [[Albert Lord]] felt strongly that the manuscript represents the transcription of a performance, though likely taken at more than one sitting.&lt;ref name=Lord|1960&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lord|first1=Albert|title=The Singer of Tales, Volume 1|date=2000|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|page=200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JrvQdPMXGmAC|isbn=9780674002838}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] believed that the poem retains too genuine a memory of [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]] to have been composed more than a few generations after the completion of the [[History of the Church of England|Christianisation of England]] around AD 700,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tolkien|first1=J.R.R.|title=Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics|date=1997|publisher=Gale}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Tolkien's conviction that the poem dates to the 8th century has been defended by [[Tom Shippey]], Leonard Neidorf, Rafael J. Pascual, and R.D. Fulk, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Tom |last=Shippey |contribution=Tolkien and the Beowulf-poet |title=Roots and Branches |year=2007 |publisher=Walking Tree Publishers |isbn=978-3-905703-05-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;link.springer.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Neidorf |first1=Leonard |last2=Pascual|first2=Rafael |title=The Language of Beowulf and the Conditioning of Kaluza's Law |year=2014 |journal=Neophilologus |volume=98 |issue=4 |pages=657–73 |doi=10.1007/s11061-014-9400-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fulk 2007 304–324&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Fulk |first=R.D.|title=Old English Meter and Oral Tradition: Three Issues Bearing on Poetic Chronology |jstor=27712658 |year=2007 |journal=Journal of English and Germanic Philology |volume=106 |pages=304–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of several Old English poems by a team including Neidorf suggests that Beowulf is the work of a single author.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian 2019&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/08/beowulf-old-english-poem-work-one-author-research-suggests |title=Beowulf the work of single author, research suggests  |last=Davis |first=Nicola |date=8 April 2019 |website=theguardian.com |publisher= |access-date=20 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The claim to an early 11th-century date depends in part on scholars who argue that, rather than the transcription of a tale from the oral tradition by an earlier literate monk, ''Beowulf'' reflects an original interpretation of an earlier version of the story by the manuscript's two scribes. On the other hand, some scholars argue that linguistic, [[palaeography|palaeographical]], [[Metre (poetry)|metrical]], and [[Onomastics|onomastic]] considerations align to support a date of composition in the first half of the eighth century;&lt;ref name=&quot;D.S.

== Manuscript ==
{{Main|Nowell Codex}}
[[File:BLBeowulf.jpg|thumb|left|Remounted page, [[British Library]] Cotton Vitellius A.XV]]
''Beowulf'' survives in a single manuscript dated on [[Palaeography|palaeographical]] grounds to the late 10th or early 11th century. The manuscript measures 245 × 185&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cotton MS Vitellius A XV|url=http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=cotton_ms_vitellius_a_xv|publisher=British Library|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Provenance ===
The poem is known only from a single manuscript, which is estimated to date from close to AD 1000, in which it appears with other works. The ''Beowulf'' manuscript is known as the Nowell Codex, gaining its name from 16th-century scholar [[Laurence Nowell]]. The official designation is &quot;[[British Library]], Cotton Vitellius A.XV&quot; because it was one of [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington|Sir Robert Bruce Cotton]]'s holdings in the [[Cotton library]] in the middle of the 17th century. Many private antiquarians and book collectors, such as Sir Robert Cotton, used their own [[library classification]] systems. &quot;Cotton Vitellius A.XV&quot; translates as: the 15th book from the left on shelf A (the top shelf) of the bookcase with the bust of Roman Emperor [[Vitellius]] standing on top of it, in Cotton's collection. Kevin Kiernan argues that Nowell most likely acquired it through [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]], in 1563, when Nowell entered Cecil's household as a [[tutor]] to his ward, [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kiernan|first=Kevin S.|title=Speculum|journal=Speculum |volume=73 |issue=3 |year=1998 |pages=879–881 |jstor=2887546|doi=10.2307/2887546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reverend [[Thomas Smith (scholar)|Thomas Smith]] (1638–1710) and [[Humfrey Wanley]] (1672–1726) both catalogued the Cotton library (in which the Nowell Codex was held). Smith's catalogue appeared in 1696, and Wanley's in 1705.{{sfn|Joy|2005|p=2}} The ''Beowulf'' manuscript itself is identified by name for the first time in an exchange of letters in 1700 between George Hickes, Wanley's assistant, and Wanley. In the letter to Wanley, Hickes responds to an apparent charge against Smith, made by Wanley, that Smith had failed to mention the ''Beowulf'' script when cataloguing Cotton MS. Vitellius A. XV. Hickes replies to Wanley &quot;I can find nothing yet of Beowulph.&quot;{{sfn|Joy|2005|p=24}} Kiernan theorised that Smith failed to mention the ''Beowulf'' manuscript because of his reliance on previous catalogues or because either he had no idea how to describe it or because it was temporarily out of the codex.{{sfn|Kiernan|1996|pp=73–74}}

It suffered damage in the Cotton Library fire at [[Ashburnham House]] in 1731. Since then, parts of the manuscript have crumbled along with many of the letters. Rebinding efforts, though saving the manuscript from much degeneration, have nonetheless covered up other letters of the poem, causing further loss. Kevin Kiernan, in preparing his electronic edition of the manuscript, used fibre-optic backlighting and ultraviolet lighting to reveal letters in the manuscript lost from binding, erasure, or ink blotting.&lt;ref name=&quot;KiernanE&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Kiernan|first=Kevin |title=Electronic Beowulf 3.0 |date=16 January 2014 |url=http://ebeowulf.uky.edu/ |publisher=U of Kentucky |accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Writing ===
The ''Beowulf'' manuscript was transcribed from an original by two scribes, one of whom wrote the prose at the beginning of the manuscript and the first 1939 lines before breaking off in mid sentence. The first scribe made a point of carefully regularizing the spelling of the original document by using the common West Saxon language and by avoiding any archaic or dialectical features. The second scribe, who wrote the remainder, with a difference in handwriting noticeable after line 1939, seems to have written more vigorously and with less interest. As a result, the second scribe's script retains more archaic dialectic features, which allow modern scholars to ascribe the poem a cultural context.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beowulf: Revised Edition&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swanton|first1=Michael|title=Beowulf: Revised Edition|date=1997|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=978-0719051463|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ks8nj3BGEQC|accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While both scribes appear to have proofread their work, there are nevertheless many errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Leonard Neidorf |year=2013 |journal=Anglo-Saxon England |volume=42 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9099642&amp;fileId=S0263675113000124 |pages=249–69 |title=Scribal errors of proper names in the ''Beowulf'' manuscript |doi=10.1017/s0263675113000124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second scribe was ultimately the more conservative copyist as he did not modify the spelling of the text as he wrote but copied what he saw in front of him. In the way that it is currently bound, the ''Beowulf'' manuscript is followed by the Old English poem ''[[Judith (poem)|Judith]]''. ''Judith'' was written by the same scribe that completed ''Beowulf'' as evidenced through similar writing style. Wormholes found in the last leaves of the ''Beowulf'' manuscript that are absent in the ''Judith'' manuscript suggest that at one point ''Beowulf'' ended the volume. The rubbed appearance of some leaves also suggest that the manuscript stood on a shelf unbound, as is known to have been the case with other Old English manuscripts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beowulf: Revised Edition&quot;/&gt; From knowledge of books held in the library at [[Malmesbury Abbey]] and available as source works, as well as from the identification of certain words particular to the local dialect found in the text, the transcription may have taken place there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lapidge |first=Michael |title=Anglo-Latin literature, 600–899|url=https://archive.org/details/anglolatinlitera0000lapi_i2t2 |url-access=registration |publisher=Hambledon Press|location=London |year=1996|page=[https://archive.org/details/anglolatinlitera0000lapi_i2t2/page/299 299]|isbn=978-1-85285-011-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debate over oral tradition ===
The question of whether ''Beowulf'' was passed down through [[oral tradition]] prior to its present [[manuscript]] form has been the subject of much debate, and involves more than simply the issue of its composition. Rather, given the implications of the theory of [[oral-formulaic composition]] and oral tradition, the question concerns how the poem is to be understood, and what sorts of interpretations are legitimate.

Scholarly discussion about ''Beowulf'' in the context of the oral tradition was extremely active throughout the 1960s and 1970s. The debate might be framed starkly as follows: on the one hand, we can hypothesise a poem put together from various tales concerning the hero (the Grendel episode, the Grendel's mother story, and the fire drake narrative). These fragments would have been told for many years in tradition, and learned by apprenticeship from one generation of illiterate poets to the next. The poem is composed orally and extemporaneously, and the archive of tradition on which it draws is oral, pagan, Germanic, heroic, and tribal. On the other hand, one might posit a poem which is composed by a literate scribe, who acquired literacy by way of learning Latin (and absorbing Latinate culture and ways of thinking), probably a monk and therefore profoundly Christian in outlook. On this view, the pagan references would be a sort of decorative archaising.&lt;ref name=&quot;COLORING210-217&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Blackburn|first=FA|title=The Christian Coloring of Beowulf|journal=PMLA|volume=12|issue=2|pages=210–17|year=1897|doi=10.2307/456133|jstor=456133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BENSON193-213&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Benson|first=Larry D|title=The Pagan Coloring of Beowulf|work=Old English Poetry: fifteen essays|pages=193–213|year=1967|editor-last=Creed|editor-first=RP|place=Providence, [[Rhode Island]]|publisher=Brown University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a third view that sees merit in both arguments above and attempts to bridge them, and so cannot be articulated as starkly as they can; it sees more than one [[Christianity]] and more than one attitude towards paganism at work in the poem; it sees the poem as initially the product of a literate Christian author with one foot in the pagan world and one in the Christian, himself perhaps a convert (or one whose forebears had been pagan), a poet who was conversant in both oral and literary composition and was capable of a masterful &quot;repurposing&quot; of poetry from the oral tradition.

However, scholars such as D.K. Crowne have proposed the idea that the poem was passed down from reciter to reciter under the theory of [[oral-formulaic composition]], which hypothesises that epic poems were (at least to some extent) improvised by whoever was reciting them, and only much later written down. In his landmark work, ''[[The Singer of Tales]]'', [[Albert Lord]] refers to the work of [[Francis Peabody Magoun]] and others, saying &quot;the documentation is complete, thorough, and accurate. This exhaustive analysis is in itself sufficient to prove that ''Beowulf'' was composed orally.&quot;{{Sfn|Lord|1960|p=198}}

Examination of ''Beowulf'' and other [[Old English literature]] for evidence of oral-formulaic composition has met with mixed response. While &quot;themes&quot; (inherited narrative subunits for representing familiar classes of event, such as the &quot;arming the hero&quot;,{{Sfn|Zumthor|1984|pp=67–92}} or the particularly well-studied &quot;hero on the beach&quot; theme&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Crowne|first=DK|title=The Hero on the Beach: An Example of Composition by Theme in Anglo-Saxon Poetry|journal=Neuphilologische Mitteilungen|volume=61|year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;) do exist across Anglo-Saxon and other Germanic works, some scholars conclude that Anglo-Saxon poetry is a mix of oral-formulaic and literate patterns, arguing that the poems both were composed on a word-by-word basis and followed larger formulae and patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Benson|first=Larry D|title=The Literary Character of Anglo-Saxon Formulaic Poetry|journal=Publications of the Modern Language Association|volume=81|issue=5|pages=334–41|year=1966|doi=10.2307/460821|jstor=460821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larry Benson argued that the interpretation of ''Beowulf'' as an entirely formulaic work diminishes the ability of the reader to analyse the poem in a unified manner, and with due attention to the poet's creativity. Instead, he proposed that other pieces of Germanic literature contain &quot;kernels of tradition&quot; from which ''Beowulf'' borrows and expands upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Benson|first=Larry|title=The Interpretation of Narrative|pages=1–44|year=1970|contribution=The Originality of ''Beowulf''|place=Cambridge, MA|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Foley&quot;&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography''. New York: Garland, 1985. p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, Ann Watts argued against the imperfect application of one theory to two different traditions: traditional, Homeric, oral-formulaic poetry and Anglo-Saxon poetry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foley&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Watts|first=Ann C.|title=The Lyre and the Harp: A Comparative Reconsideration of Oral Tradition in Homer and Old English Epic Poetry|page=124|year=1969|place=New Haven, CT|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-00797-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Gardner agreed with Watts, arguing that the ''Beowulf'' text is of too varied a nature to be completely constructed from set formulae and themes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foley&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Thomas. &quot;How Free Was the ''Beowulf'' Poet?&quot; ''Modern Philology.'' 1973. pp. 111–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Miles Foley]] wrote, referring to the ''Beowulf'' debate,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Foley|first=John Miles|title=The Theory of Oral Composition: History and Methodology|pages=109ff|year=1991|place=Bloomington|publisher=IUP}}&lt;/ref&gt; that while comparative work was both necessary and valid, it must be conducted with a view to the particularities of a given tradition; Foley argued with a view to developments of oral traditional theory that do not assume, or depend upon, ultimately unverifiable assumptions about composition, and instead delineate a more fluid continuum of traditionality and textuality.&lt;ref&gt;Bäuml, Franz H. &quot;Varieties and Consequences of Medieval Literacy and Illiteracy&quot;, Speculum, Vol. 55, No. 2 (1980), pp. 243–44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Havelock|first=Eric Alfred|title=A History of the Greek Mind, vol. 1.

Finally, in the view of Ursula Schaefer, the question of whether the poem was &quot;oral&quot; or &quot;literate&quot; becomes something of a [[red herring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Schaefer|first=Ursula|title=Vokalitat: Altenglische Dichtung zwischen Mundlichkeit und Schriftlichkeit|journal=ScriptOralia|volume=39|year=1992|place=Tübingen|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the poem is created, and is interpretable, within both noetic horizons. Schaefer's concept of &quot;vocality&quot; offers neither a compromise nor a synthesis of the views which see the poem as on the one hand Germanic, pagan, and oral and on the other Latin-derived, Christian, and literate, but, as stated by Monika Otter: &quot;...&amp;nbsp;a 'tertium quid', a modality that participates in both oral and literate culture yet also has a logic and aesthetic of its own.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://serials.infomotions.com/bmcr/bmcr-9404-otter-vokalitaet.txt|title=Vokalitaet: Altenglische Dichtung zwischen Muendlichkeit und Schriftlichkeit|last=Otter|first=Monika|journal=Bryn Mawr Classical Review|accessdate=19 April 2010|number=9404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptions and translations ==

=== Transcriptions ===
Icelandic scholar [[Grímur Jónsson Thorkelin]] made the first transcriptions of the manuscript in 1786 and published the results in 1815, working as part of a Danish government historical research commission. He made one himself, and had another done by a professional copyist who knew no Anglo-Saxon. Since that time, however, the manuscript has crumbled further, making these transcripts a prized witness to the text. While the recovery of at least 2000 letters can be attributed to them, their accuracy has been called into question,{{refn|group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;|For instance, by Chauncey Brewster Tinker in ''The Translations of Beowulf'',&lt;ref name=&quot;chaucey&quot;&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/25942 |publisher=Gutenberg |first=Chauncey Brewster |last=Tinker |title=The Translations of Beowulf |year=1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; a comprehensive survey of 19th-century translations and editions of ''Beowulf''.}} and the extent to which the manuscript was actually more readable in Thorkelin's time is uncertain.

== Sources and analogues ==
Neither identified sources nor [[Analogue (literature)|analogues]] for ''Beowulf'' can be definitively proven, but many conjectures have been made. These are important in helping historians understand the ''Beowulf'' manuscript, as possible source-texts or influences would suggest time-frames of composition, geographic boundaries within which it could be composed, or range (both spatial and temporal) of influence (i.e. when it was &quot;popular&quot; and where its &quot;popularity&quot; took it).

There are Scandinavian sources, international folkloric sources, and Celtic sources.{{Efn|Ecclesiastical or biblical influences are only seen as adding &quot;Christian color&quot;, in Andersson's survey. Old English sources hinges on the hypothesis that ''[[Genesis A]]'' predates ''Beowulf''.}}{{sfn|Andersson|1998|pp=125, 129}}

===Scandinavian parallels and sources===
19th century studies proposed that ''Beowulf'' was translated from a lost original Scandinavian work, but this idea was quickly abandoned. But Scandinavian works have continued to be studied as a possible source.{{sfn|Andersson|1998|pp=130–131}} Proponents included Gregor Sarrazin writing in 1886 that an [[Old Norse]] original version of ''Beowulf'' must have existed,{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=130}} but that view was later debunked by Carl Wilhelm von Sydow (1914) who pointed out that ''Beowulf'' is fundamentally [[Christianity|Christian]] and written at a time when any Norse tale would have most likely been [[paganism|pagan]].{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=135}}&lt;!--This bit relocated from &quot;Irish folktale&quot; content below--&gt;

====Grettis saga====
The epic's possible connection to ''[[Grettis saga]]'', an Icelandic [[Sagas of Icelanders|family saga]], was made early on by [[Guðbrandur Vigfússon]] (1878).{{sfn|Andersson|1998|pp=130–31}}

''Grettis saga'' is a story about [[Grettir Ásmundarson]], a great-grandson of an Icelandic settler, and so cannot be as old as ''Beowulf''. [[Axel Olrik]] (1903) claimed that on the contrary, this saga was a reworking of ''Beowulf'', and others followed suit.{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=130}}

However, Friedrich Panzer (1910) wrote a thesis in which both ''Beowulf'' and ''Grettis saga'' drew from a common folkloric source, and this encouraged even a detractor such as W. W. Lawrence to reposition his view, and entertain the possibility that certain elements in the saga (such as the waterfall in place of the ''mere'') retained an older form.{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=130}}

The viability of this connection has enjoyed enduring support, and was characterized as one of the few Scandinavian [[Analogue (literature)|analogues]] to receive a general consensus of potential connection by Theodore M. Andersson (1998).{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=125}} But that same year, Magnús Fjalldal published a volume challenging the perception that there is a close parallel, and arguing that tangential similarities were being overemphasized as analogies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref={{SfnRef|Magnús Fjalldal|1998}} |author=Magnús Fjalldal |title=The long arm of coincidence: the frustrated connection between Beowulf and Grettis saga  |year=1998 |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] |url=https://archive.org/details/longarmofcoincid0000fjal |url-access=registration |isbn=978-0-8020-4301-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hrolf kraki and Bodvar Bjarki====
{{See also|Bödvar Bjarki}}

Another candidate for an analogue or possible source is the story of [[Hrólfr Kraki|Hrolf kraki]] and his servant, the legendary bear-[[shapeshifter]] [[Böðvarr Bjarki|Bodvar Bjarki]]. The story survives in Old Norse ''[[Hrólfs saga kraka]]'' and [[Saxo Grammaticus|Saxo]]'s ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''. Hrolf kraki, one of the [[Scylding|Skjöldungs]], even appears as &quot;Hrothulf&quot; in the Anglo-Saxon epic. Hence a story about him and his followers may have developed as early as the 6th century.{{sfn|Chambers|1921|p=55}}&lt;!--Paul Beekman Taylor argued that the ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'' was proof that the ''Beowulf'' poet was likewise working from Germanic tradition.{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=133}}--&gt;

===International folktale sources===
{{See also|Bear's Son Tale}}

====Bear's Son Tale====
Friedrich Panzer (1910) wrote a thesis that the first part of ''Beowulf'' (the Grendel Story) incorporated preexisting folktale material, and that the folktale in question was of the [[Bear's Son Tale]] (''Bärensohnmärchen'') type, which has surviving examples all over the world.{{sfn|Panzer|1910}}{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=130}}

This tale type was later catalogued as international [[folklore|folktale]] type 301, now formally entitled &quot;The Three Stolen Princesses&quot; type in Hans Uther's catalogue, although the &quot;Bear's Son&quot; is still used in Beowulf criticism, if not so much in folkloristic circles.{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=130}}

However, although this [[Folkloristics|folkloristic]] approach was seen as a step in the right direction, &quot;The Bear's Son&quot; tale has later been regarded by many as not a close enough parallel to be a viable choice.{{sfn|Andersson|1998|pp=137, 146}} Later, Peter A. Jorgensen, looking for a more concise frame of reference, coined a &quot;two-troll tradition&quot; that covers both ''Beowulf'' and ''Grettis saga'': &quot;a [[Viking art|Norse]] '[[ecotype]]' in which a hero enters a cave and kills two giants, usually of different sexes&quot;;{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=134}} which has emerged as a more attractive folk tale parallel, according to a 1998 assessment by Andersson.{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=146}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Vickrey|2009|p=209}}: &quot;I shall continue to use the term ''Bear's Son'' for the folktale in question; it is established in Beowulf criticism and certainly Stitt has justified its retention&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Celtic folktales====
&lt;!-- [[Wilhelm Grimm]] is noted to be the first person to link ''Beowulf'' with Irish folklore; ** Andersson pp. 134–135 suggests this was misconception by Hugo Gering--&gt;Similarity of the epic to the Irish folktale &quot;The Hand and the Child&quot; had already been noted by [[Albert Stanburrough Cook|Albert S. Cook]] (1899), and others even earlier,{{Efn|[[Ludwig Laistner]] (1889), II, p. 25; [[Stopford Brooke (chaplain)|Stopford Brooke]], I, p. 120; [[Albert Stanburrough Cook|Albert S. Cook]] (1899) pp. 154–156.}}{{sfn|Puhvel|1979|p=2–3}}{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=135}}{{Efn|In the interim, {{illm|Max Deutschbein|de}} (1909) is credited by Andersson to be the first person to present the Irish argument in academic form. He suggested the Irish ''[[Bricriu|Feast of Bricriu]]'' (which is not a folktale) as a source for ''Beowulf''—a theory that was soon denied by Oscar Olson.{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=135}}}} Swedish folklorist Carl Wilhelm von Sydow (1914) then made a strong argument for the case of parallelism in &quot;The Hand and the Child&quot;, because the [[folklore|folktale]] type demonstrated a &quot;monstrous arm&quot; [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] that corresponded with Beowulf wrenching off Grendel's arm. For no such correspondence could be perceived in the Bear's Son Tale or ''Grettis saga''.{{Refn|group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;|von Sydow was also anticipated by Heinz Dehmer in the 1920s as well besides the writers from the 19th century in pointing out &quot;The Hand and the Child&quot; as a parallel.{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=136}}}}{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=136}}{{sfn|Puhvel|1979|p=2–3}}

[[James Carney (scholar)|James Carney]] and [[Martin Puhvel]] also agree with this &quot;Hand and the Child&quot; contextualisation.{{Efn|Carney also sees the ''[[Táin Bó]]'' ''[[Fráech]]'' story (where a half-fairy hero fights a dragon in the &quot;Black Pool (Dubh linn)&quot;), but this has not received much support for forty years, as of Andersson's writing.}} Puhvel supported the &quot;Hand and the Child&quot; theory through such motifs as (in Andersson's words) &quot;the more powerful giant mother, the mysterious light in the cave, the melting of the sword in blood, the phenomenon of battle rage, swimming prowess, combat with water monsters, underwater adventures, and the bear-hug style of wrestling.&quot;{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=137}}

In the [[Mabinogion]] [[Teyrnon]] discovers the otherworldly boy child [[Pryderi]] fab [[Pwyll]] , the principle character of the cycle, after cutting off the arm of a monstrous beast which is stealing foals from his stables,  an episode which is highly reminiscent in its description of the Grendel tale.

===Classical sources===
Attempts to find [[Classics|classical]] or [[Late Latin]] influence or analogue in ''Beowulf'' are almost exclusively linked with [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' or [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''. In 1926, [[Albert Stanburrough Cook|Albert S. Cook]] suggested a Homeric connection due to equivalent formulas, [[metonymy|metonymies]], and analogous voyages.{{sfn|Cook|1926}} In 1930, James A. Work also supported the Homeric influence, stating that encounter between Beowulf and [[Unferð|Unferth]] was parallel to the encounter between Odysseus and [[Nisus and Euryalus|Euryalus]] in Books 7–8 of the ''Odyssey,'' even to the point of both characters giving the hero the same gift of a sword upon being proven wrong in their initial assessment of the hero's prowess. This theory of Homer's influence on ''Beowulf'' remained very prevalent in the 1920s, but started to die out in the following decade when a handful of critics stated that the two works were merely &quot;comparative literature&quot;,{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=138}} although Greek was known in late 7th century England: [[Bede]] states that [[Theodore of Tarsus]], a Greek, was appointed [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 668, and he taught Greek. Several English scholars and churchmen are described by Bede as being fluent in Greek due to being taught by him; Bede claims to be fluent in Greek himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Bede |title=Ecclesiastical History |at=V.24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frederick Klaeber]], among others, argued for a connection between ''Beowulf'' and [[Virgil]] near the start of the 20th century, claiming that the very act of writing a secular epic in a Germanic world represents Virgilian influence. Virgil was seen as the pinnacle of Latin literature, and Latin was the dominant literary language of England at the time, therefore making Virgilian influence highly likely.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{Citation |first=Tom Burns |last=Haber |title=A Comparative Study of the Beowulf and the Aeneid |place=Princeton |year=1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in 1971, [[Alistair Campbell (academic)|Alistair Campbell]] stated that the [[apologue]] technique used in ''Beowulf'' is so rare in epic poetry aside from Virgil that the poet who composed ''Beowulf'' could not have written the poem in such a manner without first coming across [[Virgil]]'s writings.{{sfn|Andersson|1998|pp=140–41}}

===Biblical influences===
It cannot be denied that Biblical parallels occur in the text, whether seen as a pagan work with &quot;Christian colouring&quot; added by scribes or as a &quot;Christian historical novel, with selected bits of paganism deliberately laid on as 'local colour',&quot; as Margaret E. Goldsmith did in &quot;The Christian Theme of ''Beowulf''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irving&quot;&gt;Irving, Edward B., Jr. &quot;Christian and Pagan Elements.&quot; ''A Beowulf Handbook.'' Eds. Bjork, Robert E. and John D. Niles. Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, 1998. 175–92. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Beowulf'' channels the [[Book of Genesis]], the [[Book of Exodus]], and the [[Book of Daniel]]{{sfn|Andersson|1998|pp=142–43}} in its inclusion of references to the [[Genesis creation narrative]], the story of [[Cain and Abel]], [[Noah]] and the [[Genesis flood narrative|flood]], the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]], [[Hell]], and the [[Last Judgment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Irving&quot; /&gt;

== Dialect ==
{{Old English topics}}
The poem mixes the [[West Saxon dialect|West Saxon]] and [[Old English#Dialects|Anglian dialects]] of Old English, though it predominantly uses West Saxon, as do other Old English poems copied at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heorot.dk/beowulf-vorwort.html|title=An Introduction to the Structure &amp; Making of the Old English poem known as ''Beowulf'' or ''The Beowulf'' and the Beowulf-codex of the British Museum MS Cotton Vitellius A.xv|last=Slade|first=Benjamin|website=Beowulf on Steorarume |date=21 December 2003 |access-date=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a wide array of linguistic forms in the ''Beowulf'' manuscript. It is this fact that leads some scholars to believe that ''Beowulf'' has endured a long and complicated transmission through all the main dialect areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3189145 |jstor=3189145|title=Beowulf's Dialectal Vocabulary and the Kiernan Theory|journal=South Central Review|volume=2|issue=2|pages=1–9|year=1985|last1=Tuso|first1=Joseph F}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem retains a complicated mix of the following dialectical forms: [[Mercian dialect|Mercian]], [[Northumbrian dialect|Northumbrian]], Early West Saxon, Kentish and Late West Saxon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beowulf and the Beowulf Manuscript&quot;/&gt;{{rp|20–21}} There are in ''Beowulf'' more than 3100 distinct words, and almost 1300 occur exclusively, or almost exclusively, in this poem and in the other poetical texts. Considerably more than one-third of the total vocabulary is alien from ordinary prose use. There are, in round numbers, three hundred and sixty uncompounded verbs in ''Beowulf'', and forty of them are poetical words in the sense that they are unrecorded or rare in the existing prose writings. One hundred and fifty more occur with the prefix ''ge''- (reckoning a few found only in the past-participle), but of these one hundred occur also as simple verbs, and the prefix is employed to render a shade of meaning which was perfectly known and thoroughly familiar except in the latest Anglo-Saxon period. The nouns number sixteen hundred. Seven hundred of them, including those formed with prefixes, of which fifty (or considerably more than half) have ''ge''-, are simple nouns, at the highest reckoning not more than one-quarter is absent in prose. That this is due in some degree to accident is clear from the character of the words, and from the fact that several reappear and are common after the Norman Conquest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Ritchie |last=Girvan |title=Beowulf and the Seventh Century Language and Content |publisher=Methuen &amp; Co |place=New Feller Lane: London EC4 |year=1971 |type=print}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Form and metre ==
An Old English poem such as ''Beowulf'' is very different from modern poetry. Anglo-Saxon poets typically used [[alliterative verse]], a form of [[poetry|verse]] in which the first half of the line (the a-verse) is linked to the second half (the b-verse) through [[alliteration|similarity in initial sound]]. In addition, the two halves are divided by a [[caesura]]: &quot;Oft '''Sc'''yld '''Sc'''efing \\ '''sc'''eaþena þreatum&quot; (l. 4). This verse form maps stressed and unstressed syllables onto abstract entities known as metrical positions. There is no fixed number of beats per line: the first one cited has three (Oft SCYLD SCEFING, with [[Systems of scansion#Overview|ictus]] on the suffix -ING) whereas the second has two (SCEAþena ÞREATum).

The poet has a choice of [[epithets]] or formulae to use in order to fulfil the alliteration. When speaking or reading Old English poetry, it is important to remember for alliterative purposes that many of the letters are not pronounced in the same way as in [[modern English]]. The letter {{angbr|h}}, for example, is always pronounced (''Hroðgar'': {{IPA-ang|ˈhroðgar|}}), and the digraph {{angbr|cg}} is pronounced {{IPA-ang|dʒ|}}, as in the word ''edge''. Both {{angbr|f}} and {{angbr|s}} vary in pronunciation depending on their phonetic environment. Between vowels or [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] consonants, they are voiced, sounding like modern {{angbr|v}} and {{angbr|z}}, respectively. Otherwise they are unvoiced, like modern {{angbr|f}} in ''fat'' and {{angbr|s}} in ''sat''. Some letters which are no longer found in modern English, such as thorn, {{angbr|þ}}, and eth, {{angbr|ð}} – representing both pronunciations of modern English {{angbr|th}}, as {{IPAc-en|θ}} in ''thing'' and {{IPAc-en|ð}} ''this'' – are used extensively both in the original manuscript and in modern English editions. The voicing of these characters echoes that of {{angbr|f}} and {{angbr|s}}. Both are voiced (as in ''this'') between other voiced sounds: ''oðer'', ''laþleas'', ''suþern''. Otherwise they are unvoiced (as in ''thing''): ''þunor'', ''suð'', ''soþfæst''.

[[Kenning]]s are also a significant technique in ''Beowulf''. They are evocative poetic descriptions of everyday things, often created to fill the alliterative requirements of the metre. For example, a poet might call the sea the &quot;swan-road&quot; or the &quot;whale-road&quot;; a king might be called a &quot;ring-giver.&quot; There are many kennings in ''Beowulf'', and the device is typical of much of classic poetry in Old English, which is heavily formulaic. The poem also makes extensive use of [[elision|elided]] [[metaphor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Greenblatt|editor1-first=Stephen|editor2-last=Abrams|editor2-first=Meyer Howard|editor1-link=Beowulf|title=The Norton Anthology of English Literature|date=2006|publisher=W. W.

[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] argued in ''[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics]]'' that the poem is not an epic, and while no conventional term exactly fits, the nearest would be [[elegy]].{{Sfn|Tolkien|1997|p=31}}&lt;!--Tolkien wrote (on the 27th of 29 pages of the essay):  Beowulf is not an &quot;epic,&quot; not even a magnified &quot;lay.&quot; No terms borrowed from Greek or other literatures exactly fit: there is no reason why they should. Though if we must have a term, we should choose rather &quot;elegy.&quot; It is an heroic-elegiac poem; and in a sense all its first 3,136 lines are the prelude to a dirge: him tha gegiredan Geata leode ad ofer eorthan unwaclicne [&quot;the Geatish people then built a pyre on that high ground, no mean thing&quot;]: one of the most moving ever written.     --&gt;

== Interpretation and criticism ==
[[File: David Woodard Exploding Beowulf.jpg|thumb|[[David Woodard]] appears as both Beowulf and Grendel in the stage production ''Exploding Beowulf'' (Berlin, 2010)]]

The history of modern ''Beowulf'' criticism is often said to begin with [[J. R. R. Tolkien]],{{sfn|Orchard|2003a|p=7}} author and Merton professor of Anglo-Saxon at [[University of Oxford]], who in his 1936 lecture to the [[British Academy]] criticised his contemporaries' excessive interest in its historical implications.{{Sfn|Tolkien|2006|p=7}} He noted in ''Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics'' that as a result the poem's literary value had been largely overlooked and argued that the poem &quot;is in fact so interesting as poetry, in places poetry so powerful, that this quite overshadows the historical content...&quot;{{Sfn|Tolkien|1958|p=7}}&lt;!--Tolkien wrote on the 3rd page of the essay:   So far from being a poem so poor that only its accidental historical interest can still recommend it, Beowulf is in fact so interesting as poetry, in places poetry so powerful, that this quite overshadows the historical content, and is largely independent even of the most important facts (such as the date and identity of Hygelac) that research has discovered. It is indeed a curious fact that it is one of the peculiar poetic virtues of Beowulf that has contributed to its critical misfortunes. The illusion of historical truth and perspective, which has made Beowulf seem such an attractive quarry, is largely a product of art.     --&gt;

=== Paganism and Christianity ===
In historical terms, the poem's characters would have been [[Norse religion|Norse pagans]] (the historical events of the poem took place before the [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianisation of Scandinavia]]), yet the poem was recorded by Christian Anglo-Saxons who had mostly converted from their native [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]] around the 7th century – both Anglo-Saxon paganism and Norse paganism share a common origin as both are forms of [[Germanic paganism]]. ''Beowulf'' thus depicts a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic warrior society]], in which the relationship between the lord of the region and those who served under him was of paramount importance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leyerle&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Leyerle |first=John |editor-last =Fulk |editor-first=Robert Dennis |title=Interpretations of Beowulf: A Critical Anthology |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_sU0bTfcIjYC&amp;pg=PA155 |accessdate =17 August 2013|year=1991|publisher=Indiana UP|isbn=978-0-253-20639-8 |pages=146–67|chapter=The Interlace Structure of Beowulf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the relationship between characters in ''Beowulf'' to God, one might recall the substantial amount of paganism that is present throughout the work. Literary critics such as [[Fred C. Robinson]] argue that the ''Beowulf'' poet tries to send a message to readers during the Anglo-Saxon time period regarding the state of Christianity in their own time. Robinson argues that the intensified religious aspects of the Anglo-Saxon period inherently shape the way in which the poet alludes to paganism as presented in ''Beowulf''. The poet calls on Anglo-Saxon readers to recognize the imperfect aspects of their supposed Christian lifestyles. In other words, the poet is referencing their &quot;Anglo-Saxon Heathenism.&quot; In terms of the characters of the epic itself, Robinson argues that readers are &quot;impressed&quot; by the courageous acts of Beowulf and the speeches of Hrothgar (181). But one is ultimately left to feel sorry for both men as they are fully detached from supposed &quot;Christian truth&quot; (181). The relationship between the characters of ''Beowulf'', and the overall message of the poet, regarding their relationship with God is debated among readers and literary critics alike.

At the same time, Richard North argues that the ''Beowulf'' poet interpreted &quot;Danish myths in Christian form&quot; (as the poem would have served as a form of entertainment for a Christian audience), and states: &quot;As yet we are no closer to finding out why the first audience of ''Beowulf'' liked to hear stories about people routinely classified as damned. This question is pressing, given... that Anglo-Saxons saw the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] as '{{linktext|heathen}}s' rather than as foreigners.&quot;{{Sfn|North|2006|p=195}} [[Grendel's mother]] and [[Grendel]] are described as descendants of Cain, a fact which some scholars link to the Cain tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Williams |first=David |title=Cain and Beowulf: A Study in Secular Allegory |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars disagree, however, as to the meaning and nature of the poem: is it a Christian work set in a Germanic pagan context? The question suggests that the conversion from the Germanic pagan beliefs to Christian ones was a prolonged and gradual process over several centuries, and it remains unclear the ultimate nature of the poem's message in respect to religious belief at the time it was written. Robert F. Yeager notes the facts that form the basis for these questions:

{{Quote |That the scribes of Cotton Vitellius A.XV were Christian beyond doubt, and it is equally sure that Beowulf was composed in a Christianised England since conversion took place in the sixth and seventh centuries. The only Biblical references in Beowulf are to the Old Testament, and Christ is never mentioned. The poem is set in pagan times, and none of the characters is demonstrably Christian. In fact, when we are told what anyone in the poem believes, we learn that they are pagans. Beowulf's own beliefs are not expressed explicitly. He offers eloquent prayers to a higher power, addressing himself to the &quot;Father Almighty&quot; or the &quot;Wielder of All.&quot; Were those the prayers of a pagan who used phrases the Christians subsequently appropriated? Or, did the poem's author intend to see Beowulf as a Christian Ur-hero, symbolically refulgent with Christian virtues?&lt;ref name=&quot;nhum&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Yeager |first=Robert F |publisher=National Endowment For The Humanities |accessdate=2 October 2007 |url=http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/1999-03/yeager.html |title=Why Read Beowulf? |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930202351/http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/1999-03/yeager.html |archive-date=30 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The location of the composition of the poem is also intensely disputed. In 1914, [[F.W. Moorman]], the first professor of English Language at [[University of Leeds]], claimed that ''Beowulf'' was composed in Yorkshire,&lt;ref&gt;F. W. Moorman, 'English Place Names and the Teutonic Sagas,'in Oliver Elton (ed.), ''English Association Essays and Studies,'' vol. 5 (Oxford: Clarendon, 1914) pp. 75ff&lt;/ref&gt; but E. Talbot Donaldson claims that it was probably composed more than twelve hundred years ago, during the first half of the eighth century, and that the writer was a native of what was then called West Mercia, located in the Western Midlands of England. However, the late tenth-century manuscript &quot;which alone preserves the poem&quot; originated in the kingdom of the [[Wessex|West Saxons]] – as it is more commonly known.&lt;ref name=&quot; Tuso, F. Joseph 1975&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last=Tuso |first=F Joseph |title=Beowulf: The Donaldson Translation Backgrounds and Sources Criticism |publisher=Norton &amp; Co |place=New York |year=1975 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donaldson wrote that &quot;the poet who put the materials into their present form was a Christian and&amp;nbsp;... poem reflects a Christian tradition&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tuso, &quot;''Donaldson Translation'',&quot; 98&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics and warfare ===
[[Stanley B. Greenfield]] has suggested that references to the human body throughout ''Beowulf'' emphasise the relative position of [[Thegn|thanes]] to their lord. He argues that the term &quot;shoulder-companion&quot; could refer to both a physical arm as well as a thane (Aeschere) who was very valuable to his lord (Hrothgar). With Aeschere's death, Hrothgar turns to Beowulf as his new &quot;arm.&quot;{{Sfn|Greenfield|1989|p=59}} Also, Greenfield argues the foot is used for the opposite effect, only appearing four times in the poem. It is used in conjunction with [[Unferð]] (a man described by Beowulf as weak, traitorous, and cowardly). Greenfield notes that Unferð is described as &quot;at the king's feet&quot; (line 499). Unferð is also a member of the foot troops, who, throughout the story, do nothing and &quot;generally serve as backdrops for more heroic action.&quot;{{Sfn|Greenfield|1989|p=61}}

Daniel Podgorski has argued that the work is best understood as an examination of inter-generational vengeance-based conflict, or [[feud]]ing.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/book-reviews-tuesday-tome-beowulf/|title=Ending Unending Feuds: The Portent of ''Beowulf'''s Historicization of Violent Conflict|last=Podgorski|first=Daniel|date=3 November 2015|website=The Gemsbok|access-date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the poem operates as an indictment of feuding conflicts as a function of its conspicuous, circuitous, and lengthy depiction of the [[Geatish-Swedish wars]]—coming into contrast with the poem's depiction of the protagonist Beowulf as being disassociated from the ongoing feuds in every way.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
