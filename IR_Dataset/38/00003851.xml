      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Baseball''' is a [[Bat-and-ball games|bat-and-ball game]] played between two opposing teams who take turns [[Batting (baseball)|batting]] and fielding. Within the game there are positions in which each player can play in. {{Distinguish|Baseball positioning}}
[[Image:Baseball positions.svg|300px|right]]
There are nine '''fielding positions''' in [[baseball]]. Each position conventionally has an associated number, [[baseball scorekeeping|for use in scorekeeping]] by the [[official scorer]]:

1 ([[pitcher]]), 2 ([[catcher]]), 3 ([[first baseman]]), 4 ([[second baseman]]), 5 ([[third baseman]]), 6 ([[shortstop]]), 7 ([[left fielder]]) also, less commonly known as left outfield, 8 ([[center fielder]]), and 9 ([[right fielder]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Lyle|last=Spatz|title=Historical Dictionary of Baseball|page=3|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2012|isbn=9780810879546}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Collectively, these positions are usually grouped into three groups: the [[outfield]] (left field, center field, and right field), the [[infield]] (first base, second base, third base, and shortstop), and the [[Battery (baseball)|battery]] (pitcher and catcher).  Traditionally, players within each group will often be more able to exchange positions easily (that is, a second baseman can usually play shortstop well, and a center fielder can also be expected to play right field); however the pitcher and catcher are highly specialized positions and rarely will players at other positions play there.
