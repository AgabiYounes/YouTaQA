'''Michael Bruce Sterling''' (born April 14, 1954) is an American [[science fiction author]] known for his novels and work on the ''[[Mirrorshades]]'' anthology, which helped to define the [[cyberpunk]] genre.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://egs.edu/faculty/bruce-sterling|title=Bruce Sterling - The European Graduate School|website=egs.edu|access-date=2019-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sterling's first ever science fiction story, ''Man-Made Self'', was sold in 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nndb.com/people/722/000023653/|title=Bruce Sterling|website=www.nndb.com|access-date=2019-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first became famous by hosting annual Christmas event to present digital art.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; He spent many years after this creating many science fiction novels such as ''Schismatrix'' (1985), ''Islands In The Net'' (1988), and ''Heavy Weather'' (1994). In 1992, he published his first nonfiction novel, ''The Hacker Crackdown: Law And Disorder On The Electronic Frontier.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edge.org/memberbio/bruce_sterling|title=Bruce Sterling {{!}} Edge.org|website=www.edge.org|language=en|access-date=2019-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
Sterling is one of the founders of the cyberpunk movement in science fiction, along with [[William Gibson]], [[Rudy Rucker]], [[John Shirley]], [[Lewis Shiner]], and [[Pat Cadigan]].{{cn|date=February 2019}} In addition, he is one of the subgenre's chief [[ideological]] promulgators. This has earned him the nickname &quot;Chairman Bruce&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nisi Shawl |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/books/2008758249_br22sterling.html |title=Books &amp;#124; &quot;The Caryatids&quot;: four clones need a home &amp;#124; Seattle Times Newspaper |publisher=Seattletimes.nwsource.com |date=2009-02-19 |accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also one of the first organizers of the [[Turkey City Writer's Workshop]], and is a frequent attendee at the [[Sycamore Hill Writer's Workshop]]. He won [[Hugo Award]]s for his novelettes ''[[Bicycle Repairman]]'' and ''[[Taklamakan (story)|Taklamakan]]''. His first novel, ''[[Involution Ocean]]'', published in 1977, features the world Nullaqua where all the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] is contained in a single, miles-deep [[Impact crater|crater]]. The story concerns a ship sailing on the [[ocean]] of dust at the bottom, which hunts creatures called dustwhales that live beneath the surface. It is partially a science-fictional [[pastiche]] of ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' by [[Herman Melville]].

From the late 1970s onwards, Sterling wrote a series of stories set in the [[Shaper/Mechanist universe]]: the [[Solar System]] is colonised, with two major warring factions. The Mechanists use a great deal of computer-based mechanical technologies; the Shapers do [[genetic engineering]] on a massive scale. The situation is complicated by the eventual contact with [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[civilization]]s; humanity eventually splits into many subspecies, with the implication that many of these effectively vanish from the [[galaxy]], reminiscent of [[Technological singularity|The Singularity]] in the works of [[Vernor Vinge]]. The Shaper/Mechanist stories can be found in the collection ''Crystal Express'' and the collection ''Schismatrix Plus'', which contains the original novel ''Schismatrix'' and all of the stories set in the Shaper/Mechanist universe. [[Alastair Reynolds]] identified ''Schismatrix'' and the other Shaper/Mechanist stories as one of the greatest influences on his own work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.impactlab.net/2008/04/16/bruce-sterling-at-the-innovations-forum/ |title=The World According to Bruce Sterling |publisher=Impact Lab |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, Sterling edited the science fiction critical fanzine ''[[Cheap Truth]]'' under the alias of Vincent Omniaveritas. He wrote a column called ''[[Catscan (magazine column)|Catscan]]'' for the now-defunct science fiction critical magazine ''SF Eye''.

He contributed a chapter to ''Sound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture'' (The MIT Press, 2008) edited by Paul D. Miller a.k.a. [[DJ Spooky]]. He also contributed, along with Lewis Shiner, to the short story &quot;[[Mozart in Mirrorshades]]&quot;.

From April 2009 through May 2009, he was an editor at [[Cool Tools]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/003672.php |title=Cool Tools: New Editor, Same Deal |publisher=Kk.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since October 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2003/10/hello_world/ |title=HELLO WORLD &amp;#124; Beyond The Beyond |website=[[Wired.com]] |date=2003-10-30 |accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sterling has blogged at [http://blog.wired.com/sterling/ &quot;Beyond the Beyond&quot;], which is hosted by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' along with contributions to several other print and online platforms like the Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

His most recent novel (as of 2013) is ''Love Is Strange'' (December 2012), a Paranormal Romance (40k).

===Projects===
He has been the instigator of three projects which can be found on the Web -
* The [[Dead Media Project]] - A collection of &quot;research notes&quot; on dead media technologies, from [[Inca]]n [[quipu]]s, through Victorian [[phenakistoscope]]s, to the departed [[video game]] and home computers of the 1980s. The Project's homepage, including Sterling's original ''Dead Media Manifesto'' can be found at http://www.deadmedia.org
* The [[Viridian Design Movement]] - his attempt to create a &quot;green&quot; design movement focused on high-tech, stylish, and ecologically sound design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigpicture.tv/index.php?id=83&amp;cat=&amp;a=224 |title=Big Picture Business |publisher=Bigpicture.tv |accessdate=2012-12-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314025831/http://www.bigpicture.tv/index.php?a=224&amp;cat=&amp;id=83 |archivedate=2016-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Viridian Design home page, including Sterling's ''Viridian Manifesto'' and all of his ''Viridian Notes'', is managed by [[Jon Lebkowsky]] at http://www.viridiandesign.org. The Viridian Movement helped to spawn the popular &quot;bright green&quot; environmental weblog [[Worldchanging]]. WorldChanging contributors include many of the original members of the Viridian &quot;curia&quot;.
* Embrace the Decay - a web-only art piece commissioned by the LA Museum of Contemporary Art in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moca.org/museum/dg_detail.php?&amp;dgDetail=bsterling &quot;DIGITAL GALLERY: Bruce Sterling: Embrace the Decay&quot;], ''moca.org''&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporating contributions solicited through The Viridian Design 'movement', Embrace the Decay was the most visited piece/page at LA MOCA's Digital Gallery, and included contributions from Jared Tarbell of [http://www.levitated.net/ levitated.net] and co-author of several books on advanced Flash programming, and Monty Zukowski, creator of the winning 'decay algorithm' sponsored by Bruce.

===Neologisms===
Sterling has coined multiple [[neologisms]] to describe things that he believes will be common in the future, especially items which already exist in limited numbers.
* In the December 2005 issue of ''Wired'' magazine, Sterling coined the term buckyjunk. Buckyjunk refers to future, difficult-to-recycle consumer waste made of carbon nanotubes (a.k.a. buckytubes, based on buckyballs or [[fullerene|buckminsterfullerene]]).
* In his 2005 book ''Shaping Things'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/shaping-things|title=Shaping Things|website=MIT Press|access-date=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; he coined the term [[design fiction]] which refers to a type of speculative design which focuses on [[world building]].
* In July 1989, in ''SF Eye #5'', he was the first to use the word &quot;[[slipstream (genre)|slipstream]]&quot; to refer to a type of speculative fiction between traditional science fiction and fantasy and mainstream literature.
* In December 1999 he coined the term &quot;Wexelblat disaster&quot;, for a disaster caused when a natural disaster triggers a secondary, and more damaging, failure of human technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viridiandesign.org/notes/101-125/00120.html |title=Viridian Note 00120: Viridian Disasters (Storms in France) |publisher=Viridiandesign.org |date=1999-12-27 |accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In his book ''Zeitgeist'' (2000), he introduced the term &quot;major consensus narrative&quot; as an explanatory [[synonym]] for [[truth]].
* In August 2004, he suggested a type of technological device (he called it &quot;[[spime]]&quot;) that, through pervasive [[RFID]] and [[GPS]] tracking, can track its history of use and interact with the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viridiandesign.org/notes/401-450/00422_the_spime.html |title=Viridian Note |publisher=Viridiandesign.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the speech where he offered &quot;spime&quot;, he noted that the term &quot;[[blobject]]&quot;, with which he is sometimes credited, was passed on to him by industrial designer [[Karim Rashid]]. The term may originally have been coined by [[Steven Skov Holt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2005/julaug/features/curve.html |title=STANFORD Magazine: July/August 2005 &gt; Thrown a Curve |publisher=Stanfordalumni.org |date=2003-07-02 |accessdate=2010-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313111941/http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2005/julaug/features/curve.html |archive-date=2009-03-13 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* He discussed and expanded on [[Sophia Al Maria]]'s  neologism  &quot;Gulf Futurism&quot; in his column for ''Wired'' magazine, &quot;Beyond The Beyond&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bruce SterlingEmail Author |url=https://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2012/11/gulf-futurism/ |title=Gulf Futurism &amp;#124; Beyond The Beyond |website=Wired.com |date=1999-12-07 |accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
