'''Bilgä Qaghan''' ({{lang-otk|𐰋𐰃𐰠𐰏𐰀:𐰴𐰍𐰣|Bilgä Qaγan}}, {{zh|c=毗伽可汗||p=píjiā kěhàn}})&lt;ref name=&quot;irq.kaznpu.kz&quot;&gt;[http://irq.kaznpu.kz/?lang=e&amp;mod=1&amp;tid=1&amp;oid=16&amp;m=1 Bilge kagan’s Memorial Complex, TÜRIK BITIG]&lt;/ref&gt; (683 – 25 November 734) was the fourth [[khagan|Qaghan]] of [[Second Turkic Khaganate]]. His accomplishments were described in the [[Orkhon inscriptions]].

==Names==
As was the custom, his personal name and the name after assuming the title [[khagan|Qaghan]] were different. His personal name was recorded in Chinese characters as {{lang|zh|阿史那默棘連}} ({{zh|p=Ashǐnà Mòjílián|c=|s=|t=}}). His name after assuming the title was ''Bilgä Qaγan''. ({{lang-otk|𐰋𐰃𐰠𐰏𐰀 𐰴𐰍𐰣|Bilgä Qaγan}},&lt;ref name=&quot;irq.kaznpu.kz&quot;/&gt; {{zh|c=毗伽可汗||p=píjiā kěhàn}}). He was called '''Tengri-like and Tengri-born Turk Bilge Kagan''' ({{lang-otk|𐱅𐰭𐰼𐰃𐱅𐰏:𐱅𐰭𐰼𐰃𐰓𐰀:𐰉𐰆𐰞𐰢𐱁:𐱅𐰇𐰼𐰜:𐰋𐰃𐰠𐰏𐰀:𐰴𐰍𐰣|Teŋіriteg Тeŋiride bolmuš Türük Bilge Qaγan}} or 𐱅𐰇𐰼𐰜:𐰋𐰃𐰠𐰏𐰀:𐰴𐰍𐰣:𐱅𐰭𐰼𐰃:𐱅𐰏:𐱅𐰭𐰼𐰃:𐰖𐰺𐱃𐰢𐱁 ''Teŋіriteg Тeŋiri yaratmïš Türük Bilge Qaγan''), in [[Orkhon inscriptions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://irq.kaznpu.kz/index.php?l=t&amp;wi=726&amp;lang=e&amp;mod=3 Ethno Cultural Dictionary, TÜRIK BITIG]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042814036015]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early years ==
He was born in 683, just in early years of the khaganate. He campaigned alongside his father from early years as a child. He was created as Tardush shad and given command over western wing of empire in 697 by [[Qapaghan Qaghan|Qapaghan]]. He managed to annihilate [[Wei Yuanzhong]]'s army in 701 with his brother. He also reconquered [[Basmyl]] tribes in 703. He also subdued [[Yenisei Kyrgyz]] forces in 709, after their disobedience had to reconquer and kill their Qaghan in 710. He killed [[Türgesh]] khagan [[Suoge]] at [[Battle of Bolchu]].

In later years of [[Qapaghan Qaghan|Qapaghan]], he had to fight four battles in a year starting from 714, resubduing tribes and nearly was killed in an ambush from [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] forces in 716.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gök-Türkler|last=Ahmet.|first=Taşağil|date=1995|publisher=Türk Tarih Kurumu Basımevi|others=Atatürk Kültür, Dil, ve Tarih Yüksek Kurumu (Turkey)|isbn=975161113X|location=Ankara|pages=|oclc=33892575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reign==
In 716, [[Qapaghan Qaghan]], the second Qaghan, was killed in his campaign against the [[Toquz Oghuz]] alliance and his severed head was sent to [[Chang'an]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tang194&quot;&gt;''[[Old Book of Tang]]'', [[:zh:s:舊唐書/卷194上|Vol. 194-I]]&lt;/ref&gt; Although his son [[Inel Khagan]] succeeded him, Bilgä's brother [[Kul Tigin]] and [[Tonyukuk]] carried out a [[coup d'état]] against Inel Qaghan. They killed him and made him ''Bilgä'' ''Qaghan''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tang194&quot; /&gt; His name literally means &quot;wise king&quot;.

He appointed his brother [[Kul Tigin]] to be Left Wise Prince, which made second most powerful person in realm. He resubdued [[Huige]] in 716. Also appointed his father-in-law [[Tonyukuk]] to be Master Strategist.

New reforms and stabilization of regime caused tribes that fled Tujue to come back. Tang chancellor [[Wang Jun (Tang chancellor)|Wang Jun]], believing that the Göktürks who surrendered would try to flee back to the Göktürk state, suggested that they be forcibly moved into the heart of the empire to prevent them from doing so. Before Wang's suggestion could be acted upon, however, there was an uprising by the Göktürks who surrendered, under the leadership of Xiedie Sitai (𨁂跌思泰) and Axilan (阿悉爛). [[Xue Ne|Xue]] and Wang tried to intercept them and dealt them defeats, but they were able to flee back to the Göktürk state anyway. This defeat led to Xue Ne's retirement.

== Religious policy ==
At some point in his life, he wanted to convert to [[Buddhism]], settle in cities. However, [[Tonyukuk]] discouraged him from this, citing Tujue's small numbers and vulnerability to Chinese attack. While Turks' power rested on their mobility, conversion to Buddhism would bring pacifism among population. Therefore, sticking to [[Tengrism|Tengriism]] was necessary to survive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tang194&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wenxian Tongkao]]'', 2693a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[New Book of Tang]]'', [https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E6%96%B0%E5%94%90%E6%9B%B8/%E5%8D%B7215%E4%B8%8B vol 215-II]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later reign ==
[[File:Bilge_Khagan_monument_Mongolia.JPG|thumb|The Bilgä Qaghan monument with inscriptions, Mongolia|369x369px]]In 720, Wang believed that the Pugu (僕固) and Xiedie tribes of the region were planning to defect to Eastern Tujue and attack with Eastern Tujue troops. He thus held a feast and invited the chieftains, and, at the feast, massacred them. He then attacked the Pugu and Xiedie tribes in the area, nearly wiping them out. He then proposed a plan to attack Qaghan along with the [[Basmyl|Baximi]], [[Kumo Xi|Xi]], and [[Khitan people|Khitan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tang194&quot; /&gt; [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] also recruited [[Qapaghan Qaghan|Qapaghan Khagan]]'s sons Bilgä Tigin and Mo Tigin, [[Yenisei Kyrgyz]] Qaghan Kutluk Bilgä Qaghan and Huoba Guiren to fight against Tujue. [[Tonyukuk]] cunningly launched first attack on Baximi in 721 autumn, completely crushing them. Meanwhile, Bilgä raided [[Gansu]], taking much of the livestock. Later that year [[Khitan people|Khitan]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, next year [[Kumo Xi|Xi]] were also crushed.

In 726, his father-in-law and chancellor [[Tonyukuk]] died.

In 727, he sent Buyruk Chor ({{zh|c=梅錄啜/梅录啜|p=Méilù Chuò}}) as en emissary to [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Xuanzong]] to send 30 horses as gift. He also alarmed him of [[Me Agtsom]]'s proposal of anti-Tang alliance. This alarm proved to be true when Tibetan general [[We Tadra Khonglo]] invaded Tang China in 727, sack [[Guazhou County|Guazhou]] (瓜州, in mordern [[Gansu]]), Changle (常樂, in south of mordern Guazhou County), Changmenjun (長門軍, in north of mordern [[Yumen City|Yumen]]) and Anxi (安西, mordern [[Lintan County|Lintan]]).

On 27 February 731, [[Kul Tigin]] died, for which Qaghan mourned and ordered a great funeral ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bitig.org/?lang=e&amp;mod=1&amp;tid=1&amp;oid=15&amp;m=1|title=Kultegin's Memorial Complex|last=|first=|date=|website=bitig.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 733, he defeated rebellious Khitan tribes.&lt;ref name=&quot;irq.kaznpu.kz&quot; /&gt;

== Death ==
Just after sending an emissary to [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Xuanzong]] to gain heqin alliance, he was poisoned by Buyruk Chor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mtad.humanity.ankara.edu.tr/IV-3_Eylul2007/240_47_MTAD4-3_EEkrem.pdf Erkin Ekrem, &quot;Sarı Uygurların Kökeni&quot;, ''Modern Türklük Araştırma Dergisi'', Vol. 4, No. 3, 2007, p. 175.]&lt;/ref&gt; He did not die immediately and he had time to punish the family of Buyruk Chor with death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tang194&quot; /&gt; He died on 25 November 734, his burial ceremony took place on 22 June 735.

== Family ==
He was married to [[Po Beg|El Etmish Bilge Khatun]], [[Tonyukuk]]'s daughter. He had several issues:

* [[Yollıg Khagan|Ashina Yiran]] (阿史那伊然)
* [[Tengri Qaghan|Ashina Kutluk]] (阿史那骨咄)
* 2 unnamed sons who both became puppet Qaghans under [[Kutluk Yabgu Khagan]]
* A daughter who was married to Suluk
* [[Po Beg]] - submitted to Tang after 744.

== Legacy ==
After his death from poisoning, several [[stele]]s were erected in [[Orkhon Valley|the capital area]] by the [[Orkhon River]]. These [[Orkhon inscriptions]] are the first known texts in the [[Old Turkic language]].
