[[File:Portrait of Boston Red Sox legend Ted Williams Sarasota, Florida.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ted Williams]] is the all-time [[Major League Baseball]] leader in on-base percentage.]] 
In [[baseball statistics]], '''on-base percentage''' (OBP), also known as '''on-base average/OBA''', measures how frequently a [[batting (baseball)|batter]] reaches [[base (baseball)|base]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Glossary&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Glossary / Standard Stats / On-base Percentage (OBP)  |url=http://m.mlb.com/glossary/standard-stats/on-base-percentage  |publisher=MLB.com |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the ratio of the batter's [[Times on base|times-on-base (TOB)]] (the sum of [[Hit (baseball)|hits]], [[Base on balls|walks]], and times [[hit by pitch]]) to their number of plate appearances.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glossary&quot;/&gt; OBP does not credit the batter for reaching base due to [[error (baseball)|fielding error]], [[fielder's choice]], [[Uncaught third strike|dropped/uncaught third strike]], [[Obstruction (baseball)|fielder's obstruction]], or [[catcher's interference]].

An official [[MLB]] statistic since 1984, it is sometimes referred to as on-base average/OBA, as it is rarely presented as a true [[percentage]].

On-base percentage is added to [[slugging average]] to determine [[on-base plus slugging]] (OPS). The on-base percentage of all batters faced by one pitcher or team is referred to as on-base against.

==Overview==
Traditionally, players with the best on-base percentages bat as [[leadoff hitter]], unless they are power hitters, who traditionally bat slightly lower in the [[Batting order (baseball)|batting order]]. The league average for on-base percentage in [[Major League Baseball]] has varied considerably over time; at its peak in the late 1990s, it was around .340, whereas it was typically .300 during the [[dead-ball era]]. On-base percentage can also vary quite considerably from player to player. The highest career OBP of a batter with more than 3,000 [[plate appearance]]s is .482 by [[Ted Williams]]. The lowest is by [[Bill Bergen]], who had an OBP of .194.

On-base percentage is calculated using this formula&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/onbase_perc_career.shtml Baseball reference: OBP&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2014/7/17/5911131/on-base-percentage-obp-formula-include-errors Beyond the Box Score]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fangraphs&quot;&gt;[http://www.fangraphs.com/library/offense/obp/ Fangraphs]&lt;/ref&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;OBP = \frac{H+BB+HBP}{AB+BB+HBP+SF}&lt;/math&gt;

where

*''H'' = [[Hit (baseball)|Hits]]
*''BB'' = [[Base on balls|Bases on Balls (Walks)]]
*''HBP'' = [[Hit by pitch|Hit By Pitch]]
*''AB'' = [[At bat]]
*''SF'' = [[Sacrifice fly]]

In certain unofficial calculations, the denominator is simplified and replaced by [[Plate appearance|Plate Appearance]] (PA); however, the calculation PAs includes certain infrequent events that will slightly lower the calculated OBP (i.e. [[catcher's interference]], and [[sacrifice bunt]]s).&lt;ref name=&quot;fangraphs&quot;/&gt; Sacrifice bunts are excluded from consideration on the basis that they are usually imposed by the manager with the expectation that the batter will not reach base, and thus do not accurately reflect the batter's ability to reach base when attempting to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glossary&quot;/&gt;
