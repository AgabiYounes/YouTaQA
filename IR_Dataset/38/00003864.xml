The '''2001 World Series''' was the [[World Series|championship series]] of [[Major League Baseball]]'s (MLB) [[2001 Major League Baseball season|2001 season]]. The 97th edition of the World Series,&lt;ref name=&quot;baseball-reference1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2001_WS.shtml|title=2001 World Series|website=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=January 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;baseball-reference1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2001_WS.shtml|title=2001 World Series|website=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=January 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was a [[best-of-seven playoff]] between the [[National League]] (NL) champion [[2001 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Arizona Diamondbacks]] and the three-time defending World Series champions and [[American League]] (AL) champion [[2001 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]]. The Diamondbacks defeated the Yankees, four games to three to win the series.

Diamondbacks pitchers [[Randy Johnson]] and [[Curt Schilling]] were both named [[World Series Most Valuable Player Award|World Series Most Valuable Player]]s.

The Yankees advanced to the World Series by defeating the [[Oakland Athletics]], three games to two, in the [[2001 American League Division Series|AL Division Series]], and then the [[Seattle Mariners]] in the [[2001 American League Championship Series|AL Championship Series]], four games to one. It was the Yankees' fourth consecutive World Series appearance, after winning championships in {{wsy|1998}}, {{wsy|1999}}, and {{wsy|2000}}. The Diamondbacks advanced to the World Series by defeating the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], three games to two, in the [[2001 National League Division Series|NL Division Series]], and then the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the [[2001 National League Championship Series|NL Championship Series]], four games to one. It was the franchise's first appearance in a World Series.

The Series began later than usual as a result of a delay in the regular season after the [[September 11 attacks]] and was the first to extend into November. The Diamondbacks won the first two games at home, limiting the Yankees to just one run. The Yankees responded with a close win in game 3, at which U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] threw out the [[ceremonial first pitch]]. In games 4 and 5, the Yankees won in comeback fashion, hitting game-tying [[home run]]s off Diamondbacks [[closer (baseball)|closer]] [[Byung-hyun Kim]] with one out remaining in consecutive games, before winning in extra innings. The Diamondbacks won game 6 in a blowout, forcing a decisive game 7. In the final game, the Yankees led in the ninth inning before the Diamondbacks staged a comeback against closer [[Mariano Rivera]], capped off by a [[Glossary of baseball (W)#walk-off home run|walk-off]], bases-loaded bloop single by [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]] to clinch Arizona's championship victory. This was the third World Series to end in a bases-loaded, walk-off hit, following {{wsy|1991}} and {{wsy|1997}}. 

Among several firsts, the 2001 World Series was: the first World Series championship for the Diamondbacks; the first World Series ever played in the state of Arizona and the Mountain Time Zone; the first championship for a [[Western United States|Far West state]] other than California; the first major professional sports team from the state of Arizona to win a championship; and the earliest an MLB franchise had ever won a World Series (the Diamondbacks had only existed for four years). The home team won every game in the Series, which had only happened twice before, in [[1987 World Series|1987]] and [[1991 World Series|1991]], both won by the [[Minnesota Twins]]. The Diamondbacks outscored the Yankees, 37–14, as a result of large margins of victory achieved by Arizona at [[Bank One Ballpark]] relative to the one-run margins the Yankees achieved at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. Arizona's pitching held powerhouse New York to a .183 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]], the lowest in a seven-game World Series. This and the [[2002 World Series]] were the last two consecutive World Series to have game sevens until the World Series of [[2016 World Series|2016]] and [[2017 World Series|2017]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2017/11/1/16589848/world-series-2017-dodgers-astros-game-7&lt;/ref&gt; The 2001 World Series was the subject of an [[HBO]] documentary, ''Nine Innings from Ground Zero'', in 2004.

The Series commenced on October 27, which was the latest a World Series had ever started, beating the previous record by 4 days (1999 World Series, October 23). The Yankees struck first in Game 1 when [[Derek Jeter]] was hit by a pitch with one out in the first and scored on [[Bernie Williams]]'s double two batters later. However, Arizona's [[Curt Schilling]] and two relievers, [[Mike Morgan (baseball)|Mike Morgan]] and [[Greg Swindell]] held the Yankees scoreless afterward. They managed to get only two walks and two hits for the rest of the game, [[Scott Brosius]]'s double in the second and [[Jorge Posada]]'s single in the fourth, both with two outs.

Meanwhile, the Diamondbacks tied the game on [[Craig Counsell]]'s one-out home run in the first off of [[Mike Mussina]]. After a scoreless second, Mussina led off the third by hitting [[Tony Womack]] with a pitch. He moved to second on Counsell's sacrifice bunt before [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]]'s home run put the Diamondbacks up 3-1. A single and right fielder [[David Justice]]'s error put runners on second and third before [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]]'s sacrifice fly put Arizona up 4-1. After [[Mark Grace]] was intentionally walked, [[Damian Miller]]'s RBI double gave Arizona a 5-1 lead.

Next inning, Gonzalez hit a two-out double off of [[Randy Choate]]. [[Reggie Sanders]] was intentionally walked before Gonzalez scored on [[Steve Finley]]'s single. An error by third baseman Brosius scored Sanders, put Finley at third, and Williams at second. Both men scored on [[Mark Grace]]'s double, putting Arizona up 9-1. Though the Diamondbacks got just one more hit for the rest of the game off of [[Sterling Hitchcock]] and [[Mike Stanton (left-handed pitcher)|Mike Stanton]] (Williams's leadoff single in the seventh), they went up 1-0 in the series.

The Big Unit pitched a complete game shutout, allowing only four baserunners and three hits while striking out eleven Yankees. [[Andy Pettitte]] meanwhile nearly matched him, retiring Arizona in order in five of the seven innings he pitched. In the second, he allowed a leadoff single to [[Reggie Sanders]], who scored on [[Danny Bautista]]'s double. Bautista was the only Arizona runner stranded for the entire game. In the seventh, Pettitte hit [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]] with a pitch before Sanders grounded into a forceout. After Bautista singled, [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]]'s three-run home run put Arizona up 4-0. They won the game with that score and led the series two games to none as it moved to New York City.

The game was opened in New York by President [[George W. Bush]], who threw the [[ceremonial first pitch]], a strike to Yankees backup catcher [[Todd Greene]]. Bush became the first [[incumbent]] U.S. president to throw a World Series first pitch since [[Jimmy Carter]] in {{wsy|1979}}. He also threw the baseball from the mound where the pitcher would be set (unlike most ceremonial first pitches which are from in front of the mound) and threw it for a strike. Chants of ''&quot;[[U-S-A! cheer|U-S-A]], U-S-A&quot;'' rang throughout Yankee Stadium. Yankees starter [[Roger Clemens]] allowed only three hits and struck out nine in seven innings of work. Yankees closer [[Mariano Rivera]] pitched two innings for the save.

[[Jorge Posada]]'s leadoff home run off of [[Brian Anderson (pitcher)|Brian Anderson]] in the second put the Yankees up 1-0. The Diamondbacks loaded the bases in the fourth on two walks and one hit before [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]]'s sacrifice fly tied the game. [[Bernie Williams]] hit a leadoff single in the sixth and moved to second on a wild pitch one out later before Posada walked. [[Mike Morgan (baseball)|Mike Morgan]] relieved Anderson and struck out [[David Justice]] before [[Scott Brosius]] broke the tie with an RBI single. That would be all the scoring as Morgan and [[Greg Swindell]] pitched the rest of the game for the Diamondbacks. The Yankees cut Arizona's series lead to 2-1 with the win.

Game 4 saw the Yankees send [[Orlando Hernández]] to the mound while the Diamondbacks elected to bring back [[Curt Schilling]] on three days' rest. Both pitchers gave up home runs, with Schilling doing so to [[Shane Spencer]] in the third inning and Hernandez doing so to [[Mark Grace]] in the fourth. Hernandez pitched {{frac|6|1|3}} solid innings, giving up four hits while Schilling went seven innings and gave up three.

With the game still tied entering the eighth, Arizona struck. After [[Mike Stanton (left-handed pitcher)|Mike Stanton]] recorded the first out of the inning, [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]] singled and [[Erubiel Durazo]] hit a double to bring him in. [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]] followed by grounding into a fielder's choice off of [[Ramiro Mendoza]], which scored pinch runner [[Midre Cummings]] and gave the team a 3-1 lead.

With his team on the verge of taking a commanding 3-1 series lead, Diamondbacks manager [[Bob Brenly]] elected to bring in closer [[Byung-hyun Kim]] in the bottom of the eighth for a two-inning save. Kim, at 22, became the first Korean-born player ever to play in the MLB World Series. Kim struck out the side in the eighth, but ran into trouble in the ninth.

[[Derek Jeter]] led off by trying to bunt for a hit but was thrown out by Williams. [[Paul O'Neill (baseball)|Paul O'Neill]] then lined a single in front of Gonzalez. After [[Bernie Williams (born 1968)|Bernie Williams]] struck out, Kim seemed to be out of trouble with [[Tino Martinez]] coming to the plate. However, Martinez drove the first pitch he saw from Kim into the right-center field bleachers, tying the score at 3-3. The Yankees were not done, as [[Jorge Posada]] walked and [[David Justice]] moved him into scoring position with a single. Kim struck Spencer out to end the threat.

When the scoreboard clock in Yankee Stadium passed midnight, World Series play in November began, with the message on the scoreboard &quot;Welcome to November Baseball&quot;.

[[Mariano Rivera]] took the hill for the Yankees in the tenth and retired the Diamondbacks in order. Kim went out for a third inning of work and retired [[Scott Brosius]] and [[Alfonso Soriano]], but Jeter hit an opposite field home run on a 3–2 pitch count from Kim. This home run gave the Yankees a 4–3 victory and tied the Series at two games apiece, making Jeter the first player to hit a November home run and earning him the tongue-in-cheek nickname of &quot;Mr. November&quot;.

Game 5 saw the Yankees return to [[Mike Mussina]] for the start while the Diamondbacks sent [[Miguel Batista]], who had not pitched in twelve days, to the mound. Batista pitched a strong {{frac|7|2|3}} scoreless innings, striking out six. Mussina bounced back from his poor Game 1 start, recording ten strikeouts, but allowed solo home runs in the fifth inning to [[Steve Finley]] and [[Rod Barajas]].

With the Diamondbacks leading 2–0 in the ninth, [[Byung-hyun Kim]] was called upon for the save despite having thrown three innings the night before. [[Jorge Posada]] doubled to open the inning, but Kim got [[Shane Spencer]] to ground out and then struck out [[Chuck Knoblauch]]. As had happened the previous night, Kim could not hold the lead as [[Scott Brosius]] hit a 1–0 pitch over the left field wall, the second straight game tying home run in the bottom of the ninth for the Yankees. Kim was pulled from the game in favor of [[Mike Morgan (baseball)|Mike Morgan]] who recorded the final out.

Morgan retired the Yankees in order in the tenth and eleventh innings, while the Diamondbacks got to [[Mariano Rivera]] in the eleventh. [[Danny Bautista]] and [[Erubiel Durazo]] opened the inning with hits and [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]] advanced them into scoring position with a sacrifice bunt. Rivera then intentionally walked [[Steve Finley]] to load the bases, then got [[Reggie Sanders]] to line out and [[Mark Grace]] grounded out to end the inning.

Arizona went to midseason trade acquisition [[Albie Lopez]] in the twelfth, and in his first at bat he gave up a single to Knoblauch (who had entered the game as a pinch runner). Brosius moved him over with a bunt, and then [[Alfonso Soriano]] ended the game with an RBI single to give the Yankees a 3–2 victory and a 3–2 series lead as the series went back to Phoenix. Lopez would not pitch again in the series. [[Sterling Hitchcock]] got the win for the Yankees after he relieved Rivera for the twelfth.

With Arizona in a must-win situation, [[Randy Johnson]] pitched seven innings and struck out seven, giving up just two runs, and [[Bobby Witt]] and [[Troy Brohawn]] finished the blowout. The Diamondbacks struck first when [[Tony Womack]] hit a leadoff double off of [[Andy Pettitte]] and scored on [[Danny Bautista]]'s single in the first. Next inning, Womack's bases-loaded single scored two and Bautista's single scored another. The Yankees loaded the bases in the third on a single and two walks, but Johnson struck out [[Jorge Posada]] to end the inning. The Diamondbacks broke the game open with eight runs in the bottom half. Pettitte allowed a leadoff walk to [[Greg Colbrunn]] and subsequent double to [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]] before being relieved by [[Jay Witasick]], who allowed four straight singles to [[Reggie Sanders]], [[Jay Bell]], [[Damian Miller]], and Johnson that scored three runs. After Womack struck out, Bautista's single scored two more runs and [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]]'s double scored another, with Bautista being thrown out at home. Colbrunn's single and Williams's double scored a run each before Sanders struck out to end the inning. In the fourth, Bell reached first on a strike-three wild pitch before scoring on Miller's double. Johnson struck out before Womack singled to knock Witasick out of the game. With [[Randy Choate]] pitching, Yankees second baseman [[Alfonso Soriano]]'s error on Bautista's ground ball allowed Miller to score and put runners on first and second before Gonzalez's single scored the Diamondbacks' final run. Choate and [[Mike Stanton (left-handed pitcher)|Mike Stanton]] kept them scoreless for the rest of the game. Pettitte was charged with six runs in two innings while Witasick was charged with nine runs in 1 1/3 innings. The Yankees scored their only runs in the sixth on back-to-back one-out singles by [[Shane Spencer]] and [[Luis Sojo]] with runners on second and third. The Diamondbacks hit six doubles and Danny Bautista batted 3-for-4 with five RBIs. The team set a World Series record with 22 hits and defeated the New York Yankees in its most lopsided postseason loss in 293 postseason games, since surpassed by a 16-1 loss to the [[Boston Red Sox]] in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://sports.yahoo.com/alds-game-3-red-sox-hand-yankees-worst-postseason-loss-team-history-032442415.html&lt;/ref&gt; The 15–2 win evened the series at three games apiece and set up a Game 7 for the ages between Roger Clemens and Curt Schilling, again pitching on three days' rest.

It was a matchup of two twenty-game winners in the Series finale. [[Roger Clemens]], at 39 years old, became the oldest Game 7 starter ever. [[Curt Schilling]] had already started two games of the Series and pitched his 300th inning of the season on just three days' rest. The two aces matched each other inning by inning and after seven full innings, the game was tied at 1–1. The Diamondbacks scored first in the sixth inning with a [[Steve Finley]] single and a [[Danny Bautista]] double (Bautista would be called out at third base). The Yankees responded with an RBI single from [[Tino Martinez]], which drove in [[Derek Jeter]] who had singled earlier. Brenly stayed with Schilling into the eighth, and the move backfired as [[Alfonso Soriano]] hit a home run on an 0–2 pitch. After Schilling struck out [[Scott Brosius]], he gave up a single to [[David Justice]], and he left the game trailing 2–1. When Brenley came to the mound to remove Schilling, he was heard on the Sounds of the Game microphone telling his clearly upset pitcher, &quot;love you brother, you're my hero&quot; and assuring him that &quot;that ain't gonna beat us, we're gonna get that back and then some.&quot; He then brought in Game 5 starter [[Miguel Batista]] to get Jeter out and then in an unconventional move, brought in the previous night's starter and winner [[Randy Johnson]], who had thrown 104 pitches, in relief to keep it a one-run game. It proved to be a smart move, as Johnson retired pinch hitter [[Chuck Knoblauch]] (who batted for the left handed [[Paul O'Neill (baseball)|Paul O'Neill]]) on a fly out to Bautista in right field, then Johnson returned to the mound for the top of the ninth where he got [[Bernie Williams]] to fly out to [[Steve Finley]] in center field, Martinez to ground out to [[Tony Womack]] at shortstop and he then struck out catcher [[Jorge Posada]] to send the game to the bottom of the ninth inning.

With the Yankees ahead 2–1 in the bottom of the eighth, manager [[Joe Torre]] turned the game over to his ace closer [[Mariano Rivera]] for a two-inning save. Rivera struck out the side in the eighth, including Arizona's [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]], [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]], and Bautista, lowering his postseason ERA to a Major League-best 0.70.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/Playoffs_pitching.shtml|title=All-time and Single-Season Postseason Pitching Leaders {{!}} Baseball-Reference.com|website=Baseball-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Although he was effective in the eighth, this game would end in the third ninth-inning comeback of the Series.

[[Mark Grace]] led off the inning with a single to center on a 1–0 pitch. Rivera's errant throw to second base on a bunt attempt by catcher [[Damian Miller]] on an 0–1 pitch put runners on first and second. Jeter tried to reach for the ball, but got tangled in the legs of pinch-runner [[David Dellucci]], who was sliding in an attempt to break up the double play. During the next at bat, Rivera appeared to regain control when he fielded pinch hitter [[Jay Bell]]'s (who was hitting for Johnson) bunt and threw out Dellucci at third base, but third baseman Brosius decided to hold onto the baseball instead of throwing to first to complete the [[double play]]. [[Midre Cummings]] was sent in to pinch-run for [[Damian Miller]], who had reached second base safely. With Cummings at second and Bell at first, the next batter, Womack, hit a double down the right-field line on a 2–2 pitch that tied the game and earned Rivera a blown save. Bell advanced to third and the Yankees pulled the infield and outfield in as the potential winning run (Bell) stood at third with fewer than two outs. After Rivera hit [[Craig Counsell]] unintentionally with an 0–1 pitch, the bases were loaded. On an 0–1 pitch, with Williams in the on-deck circle, Gonzalez lofted a soft floater single over the drawn-in Jeter that barely reached the outfield grass, plating Jay Bell with the winning run. This ended New York's bid for a fourth consecutive title and brought Arizona its first championship in its fourth year of existence, making the Diamondbacks the fastest expansion team to win a World Series. It was also the first, and remains the only, major professional sports championship for the state of Arizona.  [[Randy Johnson]] picked up his third win.

Days after the game, however, the blown save proved to be a life-saving move towards himself and [[Enrique Wilson]] as he, and possibly the Yankees, were spared from boarding [[American Airlines Flight 587]] that crashed in Belle Harbor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1175851-mariano-rivera-why-hes-the-most-irreplaceable-reliever-in-mlb-history|title=Mariano Rivera: Why He's the Most Irreplaceable Reliever in MLB History|last=Buckley|first=Brian|website=Bleacher Report|language=en|access-date=2019-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
For the second consecutive year, [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]] carried the World Series over its network with its top broadcast team, [[Joe Buck]] and [[Tim McCarver]] (himself a [[List of New York Yankees broadcasters|Yankees broadcaster]]). This was the first year of Fox's exclusive rights to the World Series (in the previous contract, Fox only broadcast the World Series in even numbered years while [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] broadcast it in odd numbered years), which it has held ever since (this particular contract also had given Fox exclusive rights to the entire baseball postseason, which aired over its family of networks; the contract was modified following [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s purchase of [[ABC Family|Fox Family Channel]] shortly after the World Series ended, as ESPN regained their postseason rights following a year of postseason games on ABC Family, Fox Family's successor). [[Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio|ESPN Radio]] provided national radio coverage for the fourth consecutive year, with [[Jon Miller]] and [[Joe Morgan]] calling the action.

Locally, the Series was broadcast by [[KTAR (AM)|KTAR-AM]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] with [[Thom Brennaman]], [[Greg Schulte]], [[Rod Allen]] and [[Jim Traber]], and by [[WABC (AM)|WABC-AM]] in New York City with [[John Sterling (sportscaster)|John Sterling]] and [[Michael Kay (sports broadcaster)|Michael Kay]]. This would be Sterling and Kay's last World Series working together, and Game 7 would be the last Yankee broadcast on WABC. Kay moved to television and the new [[YES Network]] the following season and [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]] picked up radio rights to the Yankees. It was Kay who announced [[Derek Jeter]]'s game-winning home run in Game 4 of the series and subsequently anointed him as &quot;Mr. November&quot;.

==Aftermath==
After the Yankees lost the World Series, several players moved onto other teams or retired, the most notable changes being the signing of [[Jason Giambi]] to replace Martinez and the retirements of Brosius and O'Neill. Martinez would later finish his career with the Yankees in 2005 after spending the previous three years in St. Louis and Tampa Bay.

After winning the NL West again in 2002 the [[2002 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Diamondbacks]] were swept 3–0 by [[2002 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis]] in the [[2002 National League Division Series|NLDS]]. From here they declined, losing 111 games in 2004 as Bob Brenly was fired during that season. Arizona would not win another NL West title until 2007. Schilling was traded to the [[Boston Red Sox]] after the 2003 season and in 2004 helped lead them to their first world championship since 1918. He helped them win another championship in 2007 and retired after four years with Boston, missing the entire 2008 season with a shoulder injury. Johnson was traded to the Yankees after the 2004 season, a season that saw him [[Randy Johnson's perfect game|throw a perfect game]] against the [[2004 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]], though he would be traded back to the Diamondbacks two years later and finish his career with the [[San Francisco Giants]] in 2009. The last player from the 2001 Diamondbacks roster, [[Lyle Overbay]], retired following the 2014 season with the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] while the last player from the 2001 Yankees, [[Randy Choate]], retired on February 16, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/02/16/sweeny-randy-choate-retirement/&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2002 through 2007, the Yankees' misfortune in the postseason continued, with the team losing the [[2002 American League Division Series|ALDS]] to the [[2002 Anaheim Angels season|Anaheim Angels]] in 2002, the [[2003 World Series|World Series]] to the [[2003 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]] in 2003, the [[2004 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] to the [[2004 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] (in the process becoming the first ever team in postseason history to blow a 3-0 series lead) in 2004, the [[2005 American League Division Series|ALDS]] again to the [[2005 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Angels]] in 2005, the [[2006 American League Division Series|ALDS]] to [[2006 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit]] in 2006, and the [[2007 American League Division Series|ALDS]] to [[2007 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland]] in 2007. [[Joe Torre]]'s contract was allowed to expire and he was replaced by [[Joe Girardi]] in 2008, a season in which the Yankees would miss the playoffs for the first time since 1993. The Yankees won their 27th World Series championship in 2009, defeating the defending champion [[Philadelphia Phillies]] in six games.

[[Buster Olney]], who covered the Yankees for ''[[The New York Times]]'' before joining ESPN, would write a book titled ''[[The Last Night of the Yankee Dynasty]]''. The book is a play by play account of Game 7 in addition to stories about key players, executives, and moments from the 1996–2001 dynasty. In a 2005 reprinting, Olney included a new epilogue covering the aftermath of the 2001 World Series up to the Boston Red Sox epic comeback from down 3–0 in the 2004 ALCS.

On October 11, 2005, A&amp;E Home Video released the ''New York Yankees Fall Classic Collectors Edition (1996–2001)'' DVD set. Game 4 of the 2001 World Series is included in the set. On April 29, 2008, ''The Arizona Diamondbacks 2001 World Series'' DVD set was released. All seven games are included on this set.

{{as of|2019}}, and excluding titles won by the [[Phoenix Mercury]] of the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]], this is the state of [[Arizona]]'s only world championship among the [[major professional sports teams of the United States and Canada|four major professional sports]].

This was the last time where [[2000 Baltimore Ravens season|multiple]] [[2001 Arizona Diamondbacks season|teams]] win a championship game on their first attempt in the same year until 2019.
