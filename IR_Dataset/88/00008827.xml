The '''Docklands Light Railway''' ('''DLR''') is an automated [[medium-capacity rail transport system|light metro]] system opened in 1987 to serve the redeveloped [[London Docklands|Docklands]] area of East London, England.&lt;ref name=&quot;RWT-DLR-upgrade&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/docklands/ |title=Docklands Light Railway Capacity Upgrading, United Kingdom |website=Railway-Technology.com |accessdate=13 June 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615163255/https://www.railway-technology.com/projects/docklands/ |archivedate=15 June 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;open&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Cross |first=David |date=1 September 1987 |title=Enthusiasts flock to busy opening day: Docklands Light Railway |newspaper=The Times |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reaches north to [[Stratford, London|Stratford]], south to [[Lewisham]] across the [[River Thames]], west to {{DLR stations|station=Tower Gateway}} and {{LUL stations|station=Bank}} in the [[City of London]] financial district, and east to [[Beckton]], [[London City Airport]], and to [[Woolwich Arsenal station|Woolwich Arsenal]] south of the river.

The system uses minimal staffing on trains and at major interchange stations; the four below-ground stations are staffed to comply with underground station fire and safety requirements. Similar proposals have been made for [[London Underground|the Tube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1347012/Boris-Johnson-Ill-use-driverless-Tube-trains-break-strikes.html |first=James |last=Chapman |title=Boris Johnson: I'll use driverless Tube trains to break strikes |newspaper=Daily Mail |location=London |date=14 January 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120731105607/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1347012/Boris-Johnson-Ill-use-driverless-Tube-trains-break-strikes.html |archivedate=31 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins and development===
[[File:DLR tower gateway.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tower Gateway DLR station]] was the DLR's original link to central London.]]
The docks immediately east of Central London began to decline in the early 1960s as cargo became [[containerised]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bardaglea.org.uk/docklands/9-the-end.html |title=The closure of the docks: The end of the upstream docks |publisher=Barking &amp; Dagenham Council |accessdate=24 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917134945/http://www.bardaglea.org.uk/docklands/9-the-end.html |archivedate=17 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They had been connected to the national railway network via the [[London and Blackwall Railway]] (L&amp;BR), which was closed in 1966 for lack of traffic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christopher63&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Christopher|first=John|title=The London &amp; Blackwall Railway|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wg2oAwAAQBAJ|date=30 September 2013|publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited|isbn=978-1-4456-2187-6|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening of the [[Port of Tilbury|Tilbury container docks]], further east in [[Essex]], finally rendered them redundant, and in 1980 the government gained control of the now-derelict area.

As early as 1972, consideration was given to how to redevelop the moribund Docklands. Travis Morgan &amp; Partners were commissioned by the London Docklands Study Team to consider the issue. They proposed, among other recommendations, that a &quot;minitram&quot; people-mover system capable of carrying up to 20 people in each unit should be constructed to connect the Docklands with the planned Fleet line tube railway terminus at [[Fenchurch Street railway station]]. The [[Greater London Council]] formed a Docklands Joint Committee with the Boroughs of [[Greenwich]], [[Lewisham]], [[Newham]], [[Southwark]] and [[Tower Hamlets]] in 1974 to undertake the redevelopment of the area. A light railway system was envisaged, terminating either at [[Tower Hill tube station|Tower Hill Underground station]] or at Fenchurch Street, but both options were seen as too expensive. Nonetheless, in 1976 another report proposed a conventional tube railway for the area and London Transport obtained Parliamentary powers to build a line from [[Charing Cross railway station]] to Fenchurch Street, Surrey Docks (now [[Surrey Quays railway station]]), the [[Isle of Dogs]], [[North Greenwich, Isle of Dogs|North Greenwich]] and Custom House to [[Woolwich Arsenal station|Woolwich Arsenal]]. This was intended to be the second stage of the Fleet line&amp;nbsp;â€“ which had been renamed the [[Jubilee line]], the first stage of which opened in 1979 from {{LUL stations|station=Stanmore}} to {{LUL stations|station=Charing Cross}}. However, when the Conservative Party came to power in May 1979 under [[Margaret Thatcher]], the plans to extend the Jubilee line were halted and the new government insisted that a lower-cost option should be pursued.&lt;ref name=&quot;DLRhandbook-p4-5&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Docklands Light Railway Official Handbook|last2=Hardy|first2=Brian|last3=Stannard|first3=Colin|date=November 2000|publisher=Capital Transport Publishing|isbn=978-185414-223-8|location=Harrow Weald|pages=4â€“5|last1=Pearce|first1=Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government created the [[London Docklands Development Corporation]] (LDDC) in July 1981 to coordinate the redevelopment of the Docklands. The need to provide a cheap public transport solution led to it commissioning London Transport to evaluate a number of exclusively light rail options. The core of the route ran alongside the [[Great Eastern Main Line|Great Eastern line]] out of London and south along the former London &amp; Blackwall Railway line through the Isle of Dogs. Three terminus options were proposed at the west end, at Tower Hill, Minories and Aldgate East. The Tower Hill option would have required a low-level interchange to be constructed alongside the existing Underground station, but this would have been a very costly venture. The Minories option, a high-level station virtually on the site of the old [[Minories railway station]], was selected and became the current Tower Gateway DLR terminus.&lt;ref name=&quot;DLRhandbook-p4-5&quot; /&gt; Aldgate East would have been perhaps the most ambitious of all of the options, as it originally envisaged a low-level connection with the [[District line]] that would have allowed DLR trains to run on Underground tracks to a variety of central London destinations. However, it quickly became apparent that there was no capacity on the existing network for integrating the DLR into the Underground.&lt;ref name=&quot;DLRhandbook-p6&quot;&gt;Pearce, Hardy &amp; Stannard, ''Docklands Light Railway Official Handbook'' (2000), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Two southern terminus options were put forward, at Cubitt Town (today's Island Gardens station) and Tiller Road, on the west side of Millwall Dock, with two possible routes to reach them. A &quot;western&quot; route would have run from the Westferry station alongside West Ferry Road via Cuba Street, then either terminating at Tiller Road or continuing over Millwall Docks Cut to a terminus at Cubitt Town. The &quot;central&quot; option required the West India Docks to be infilled or bridged and would run down the middle of the peninsula, through what was at the time an area of derelict warehouses.&lt;ref name=&quot;DLRhandbook-p6&quot; /&gt; Ultimately this latter option was chosen, though the 1981 London Transport report warned that without extensive development around Canary Wharf the area would be &quot;very isolated with poor traffic prospects&quot;&amp;nbsp;â€“ as indeed it was, for a number of years.&lt;ref name=&quot;DLRhandbook-p7&quot;&gt;Pearce, Hardy &amp; Stannard, ''Docklands Light Railway Official Handbook'' (2000), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The contract for the initial system was awarded to [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] [[Mowlem]] in 1984&lt;ref name=&quot;20CentLondon&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.20thcenturylondon.org.uk/server.php?show=conInformationRecord.27 |title=Docklands Light Railway (D.L.R.) |publisher=Exploring 20th Century London |accessdate=3 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315042111/http://www.20thcenturylondon.org.uk/docklands-light-railway-d-l-r |archivedate=15 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the system was constructed from 1985 to 1987 at a cost of Â£77&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=ModernRailways3&gt;[[Roger Ford|Ford, Roger]]. &quot;Opening of the Docklands Light Railway&quot;.

===Initial system (1987â€“1990)===
[[File:DLR-WestIndiaDocks-1.jpg|thumb|left|A first generation DLR EMU crosses West India Dock, September 1987.]]
The initial system comprised two routes, from {{DLR stations |station=Tower Gateway}} and [[Stratford station|Stratford]] to {{DLR stations |station=Island Gardens}}. It was mainly elevated on disused railway viaducts or new concrete viaducts, and adopted disused surface railway [[Track bed|formations]] between Poplar and Stratford. The trains were fully automated, controlled by computer, and had no driver; a Passenger Service Agent (PSA) on each train, originally referred to as a &quot;Train Captain&quot;, was responsible for patrolling the train, checking tickets, making announcements and controlling the doors. PSAs could take control of the train in circumstances including equipment failure and emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technology: Signalling &amp; Control |publisher=Transport for London |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/dlr/keyfacts/1546.aspx |accessdate=29 August 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165625/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/dlr/keyfacts/1546.aspx |archivedate=30 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A9948757|title=The Docklands Light Railway, London, UK|publisher=BBC&amp;nbsp;â€“ h2g2|accessdate=29 August 2007|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105152825/http://www.h2g2.com/approved_entry/A9948757|archivedate=5 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of eleven [[electric multiple unit|EMUs]] supplied by [[Linke-Hofmann]]-Busche comprised the first generation of the [[Docklands Light Railway rolling stock]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McCarthy2009p12&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Railways of Britain&amp;nbsp;â€“ London North of the Thames|last2=McCarthy|first2=David|publisher=Ian Allan Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7110-3346-7|location=Hersham, Surrey|page=12|last1=McCarthy|first1=Colin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system was lightweight, with stations designed for trains of only a single articulated vehicle. The three branches totalled {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=|order=flip}}, had 15 stations, and were connected by a flat triangular junction near {{DLR stations |station=Poplar}}. Services ran from Tower Gateway to Island Gardens and from Stratford to Island Gardens; the north side of the junction was used only for access to the depot at Poplar.&lt;ref name=&quot;RWT-DLR-upgrade&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;20CentLondon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MayorLondon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/transport/dlr.jsp|title=Mayor of London&amp;nbsp;â€“ Transport Strategy&amp;nbsp;â€“ DLR|year=c. 2006|publisher=Greater London Authority|accessdate=19 March 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312115619/http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/transport/dlr.jsp|archivedate=12 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stations were mostly of a common design and constructed from standard components. A common feature was a short half-cylindrical glazed blue canopy. All stations were above ground and were generally unstaffed, although later extension included stations below ground which were required by law to be staffed in case of evacuation.

===First stage extensions (1991â€“1994)===

The initial system had a relatively low capacity, but the Docklands area very quickly developed into a major financial centre and employment zone, increasing traffic. In particular Tower Gateway, at the edge of the [[City of London]], attracted criticism for its poor connections, as it did not connect directly with the nearby [[Tower Hill tube station]] or [[Fenchurch Street railway station]]. The criticism arose partly because the system usage was higher than expected.&lt;ref name=&quot;statement&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/blog/2009/01/13/new-games-transport-link-marks-20-years-of-dlr-progress.php |title=New Games transport link marks 20 years of progress |publisher=London 2012 Official Blog |date=13 January 2009 |accessdate=24 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528013329/http://london2012.com/blog/2009/01/13/new-games-transport-link-marks-20-years-of-dlr-progress.php |archivedate=28 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans were developed, before the system opened, to extend it to {{LUL stations|station=Bank}} in the west and [[Beckton]] in the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1987/may/06/docklands-light-railway#S6CV0115P0_19870506_CWA_30 |title=Hansard Written Answers |publisher=UK Parliament |date=6 May 1987 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006063136/http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1987/may/06/docklands-light-railway#S6CV0115P0_19870506_CWA_30 |archivedate=6 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stations and trains were extended to two-unit length, and the system was expanded into the heart of the [[City of London]] to {{LUL stations|station=Bank}} through a tunnel, which opened in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnplus.co.uk/news/16feb90-uk-ben-roskrow-reports-on-nuttalls-extension-of-the-docklands-light-railway-(1-of-2)/1689334.article |title=Ben Roskrow reports on Nuttal's extension of the Docklands Light Railway |newspaper=Construction News |date=16 February 1990 |accessdate=25 June 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928121337/http://www.cnplus.co.uk/news/16feb90-uk-ben-roskrow-reports-on-nuttalls-extension-of-the-docklands-light-railway-(1-of-2)/1689334.article |archivedate=28 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This extension left {{DLR stations |station=Tower Gateway}} on a stub.

As the [[Canary Wharf]] office complex grew, [[Canary Wharf DLR station]] was redeveloped from a small wayside station to a large one with six platforms serving three tracks and a large overall roof, fully integrated into the malls below the office towers.&lt;ref name=&quot;history one&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/dlr/history/2982.aspx |title=DLR history timeline |publisher=Transport for London |accessdate=3 September 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930190323/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/dlr/history/2982.aspx |archivedate=30 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The east of [[London Docklands|Docklands]] needed better transport connections to encourage development, and a fourth branch, towards [[Beckton]], was planned, with several route options available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lddc-history.org.uk/transport/3tran15.jpg |title=Options for the DLR Beckton Extension route |publisher=London Docklands Development Corporation |accessdate=23 February 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207140704/http://www.lddc-history.org.uk/transport/3tran15.jpg |archivedate=7 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A route from {{DLR stations |station=Poplar}} via {{LUL stations|station=Canning Town}} and the north side of the Royal Docks complex was chosen, and opened in 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;20CentLondon&quot;/&gt; Initially it was thought the line was likely to be underutilised, due to the sparse development in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/architecture-a-driverless-train-a-blighted-destination-a-railway-deep-into-londons-docklands-emphasises-the-potential-yet-to-be-realised-in-the-east-says-gillian-widdicombe-1432567.html |title=Architecture: A driverless train, a blighted destination |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=24 June 2009 |location=London |first=Gillian |last=Widdicombe |date=30 March 1994 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118214052/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/architecture-a-driverless-train-a-blighted-destination-a-railway-deep-into-londons-docklands-emphasises-the-potential-yet-to-be-realised-in-the-east-says-gillian-widdicombe-1432567.html |archivedate=18 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this extension, one side of the original flat triangular junction was replaced by a [[grade separation|grade-separated]] junction west of Poplar. Poplar was rebuilt to give [[cross-platform interchange]] between the Stratford and Beckton lines, with a new grade-separated junction built east of the station at the divergence of the Stratford and Beckton lines.

===Second stage extensions (1996â€“1999)===

The Lewisham extension opened on 22 November 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/344110.credit_crunch_shows_signs_of_easing |title=Getting Back on the Right Track (letter to the editor) |first=Judy |last=De Haan |newspaper=[[The Bolton News]] |date=29 August 2000 |accessdate=25 June 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503100311/http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/344110.credit_crunch_shows_signs_of_easing/ |archivedate=3 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It left the Island Gardens route south of the [[Crossharbour DLR station|Crossharbour]] turn-back sidings, and dropped gently to {{DLR stations |station=Mudchute}}, where a street-level station replaced the high-level one on the former [[London and Blackwall Railway|London &amp; Blackwall Railway]] viaduct. The line then entered a tunnel, following the route of the viaduct to a shallow subsurface station at {{DLR stations |station=Island Gardens}}, accessible by stairs or a lift. It crossed under the Thames to {{DLR stations |station=Cutty Sark}} in the centre of Greenwich, and surfaced at [[Greenwich station|Greenwich railway station]], with cross-platform interchange between the northbound track and the London-bound [[Greenwich Line|main line]]. The line snaked on a concrete viaduct to {{DLR stations |station=Deptford Bridge}}, before descending to {{DLR stations |station=Elverson Road}} at street level, close to Lewisham town centre, terminating in two platforms between and below the main-line platforms at Lewisham railway station, with buses stopping outside the station.

A further extension from {{DLR stations |station=King George V}} to [[Woolwich Arsenal station|Woolwich Arsenal]] opened on 10 January 2009, providing interchange with the North Kent main line, close to the planned future stop on the [[Crossrail]] line to Abbey Wood via West India and Royal Docks,&lt;ref name=&quot;RWT-DLR-upgrade&quot;/&gt; met by [[Private Finance Initiative]] funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3489298.stm |title=New DLR extension wins approval |work=BBC News |accessdate=24 June 2009 |date=26 February 2004 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216013429/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3489298.stm |archivedate=16 February 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction began in June 2005, the same month that the contracts were finalised,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2005/06/01/afx2068185.html |title=AMEC, RBoS jv finalise contract for DLR extension to Woolwich Arsenal |work=Forbes |location =New York |accessdate=24 June 2009 |date=6 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the tunnels were completed on 23 July 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url=http://pressroom.dlr.co.uk/news/details.asp?id=141 |title=Tunnel extending Docklands Light Railway to Woolwich completed |date=23 July 2007 |publisher=Transport for London |accessdate=29 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011206/http://pressroom.dlr.co.uk/news/details.asp?id=141 |archivedate=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and formally opened by [[Boris Johnson]], [[Mayor of London]] on 12 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/static/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/10970.html |title=Mayor unveils DLR Woolwich Arsenal station |publisher=Transport for London |date=12 January 2009 |accessdate=19 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425184416/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/static/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/10970.html |archivedate=25 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following completion, the project was shortlisted for the 2009 Prime Minister's Better Public Building Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/archive/dlr-extension-award-10-06-2009/ |title=DLR extension award |work=Construction News |date=10 June 2009 |accessdate=24 June 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/archive/dlr-extension-award-10-06-2009/ |archivedate=3 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original {{DLR stations |station=Tower Gateway|link=true}} was closed in mid-2008 for complete reconstruction.

As part of an upgrade to allow three-car trains, strengthening work was necessary at the Delta Junction north of {{DLR stations |station=West India Quay}}.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher (2013), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; It was decided to include this in a plan for further grade separation to eliminate the conflict between services to Stratford and from Bank. A new timetable was introduced, with improved frequencies at peak hours. The new grade-separated route from Bank to Canary Wharf is used throughout the day, bypassing West India Quay station until mid-evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://developments.dlr.co.uk/pdf/enhancements/phase2/delta.pdf |title=Docklands Light Railway (DLR) Delta Junction Grade Separation |publisher=Transport for London |accessdate=21 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003191051/http://developments.dlr.co.uk/pdf/enhancements/phase2/delta.pdf |archivedate=3 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on this project proceeded concurrently with the three-car upgrade work and the 'diveunder' (sometimes referred to as a flyunder but DLR have coined the term in this instance 'diveunder'), and the improved timetable came into use on 24 August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developments.dlr.co.uk/enhancements/capacity/wiqpoplar.asp |title=Docklands Light Railway&amp;nbsp;â€“ West India Quay/Poplar Junction Improvements |publisher=Transport for London |accessdate=1 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627085203/http://developments.dlr.co.uk/enhancements/capacity/wiqpoplar.asp |archivedate=27 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stratford International to Canning Town extension (2011)===
[[File:Stratford International DLR stn east entrance.jpg|thumb|The {{DLR stations|station=Stratford International}} DLR forecourt, soon after opening in 2011]]
In addition to the three-car station extensions, part of which was funded from the 2012 Olympics budget, a line was opened from Canning Town to Stratford and [[Stratford International]] railway station along the former [[North London Line]] of the national railway system, with additional stations. It parallels the London Underground Jubilee line for much of its length. A substantial multi-level flying junction was built south of Canning Town to enable trains from Bank/Poplar and Stratford International to operate to either of the eastern termini at Beckton and Woolwich Arsenal. There are through trains between all these points, with different patterns at different times of the day. The extension suffered some delay in opening, being completed in August 2011. It provides a direct link between two of the major Olympics locations: the Stadium and Park at Stratford and the ExCeL adjacent to Custom House on the Beckton line.

There is capability for an additional shuttle from Canning Town to Prince Regent when exhibitions are in progress at the [[ExCeL London|ExCeL exhibition centre]].

At terminal stations trains reverse direction in the platforms except at Bank where there is a reversing [[headshunt]] in the tunnel beyond the station. Many peak-hour trains on the Lewisham route from Stratford turn back at Canary Wharf. During service disruption or planned engineering work, trains can also turn back at {{DLR stations |station=Crossharbour}} and {{DLR stations |station=Mudchute}}. Trains serve every station on the route, but trains from Bank to Lewisham do not call at [[West India Quay DLR station|West India Quay]] because they are routed along the diveunder track to avoid junction conflicts. During long-term works for extension projects, other routes may be operated at weekends, such as Beckton to Lewisham if the Bank branch is closed.

===Stations===
[[File:DLR Westferry aerial view.jpg|upright|thumb|right|An eastbound train leaving Westferry Station.]]
{{Main|List of Docklands Light Railway stations}}
Most stations are [[Elevated railway|elevated]], with others at street level, in cutting or underground. Access to the platforms is mostly by staircase and lift, with escalators at some stations. From the outset the system has been fully accessible to wheelchairs; much attention was paid to quick and effective accessibility for all passengers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/gettingaround/transportaccessibility/2986.aspx |title=DLR was the first fully accessible railway in the UK, making access much easier for everyone |publisher=Transport for London |accessdate=4 March 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530014302/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/gettingaround/transportaccessibility/2986.aspx |archivedate=30 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stations have high platforms matching the floor height of the cars, allowing level access for passengers with wheelchairs or pushchairs.

Most stations are of a modular design dating back to the initial system, extended and improved with two side platforms, each with separate access from the street, and platform canopies, although few examples remain of the original, distinctive rounded roof design. Stations are unstaffed, except the underground stations at {{LUL stations|station=Bank}}, {{DLR stations |station=Island Gardens}}, {{DLR stations |station=Cutty Sark}}, [[Stratford International railway station|Stratford International]] and [[Woolwich Arsenal station|Woolwich Arsenal]] for safety reasons, a few of the busier interchange stations, and City Airport, which has a ticket office for passengers unfamiliar with the system. Canning Town, Custom House and Prince Regent are normally staffed on the platform whenever there is a significant exhibition at the ExCeL exhibition centre.

On 3 July 2007, DLR officially launched&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Transport for London |date=3 July 2007 |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/static/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/5426.html |title=Docklands Light Railway draws up public arts strategy |accessdate=4 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425190215/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/static/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/5426.html |archivedate=25 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an art programme called DLR Art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dlrart.co.uk/ |title=The DLR Public Arts Programme |publisher=DLR Art |accessdate=5 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509043254/http://www.dlrart.co.uk/home/ |archivedate=9 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to that on the [[London Underground]], [[Art on the Underground]].

===Fares and ticketing===
[[File:Unit 90 at Woolwich Arsenal DLR.JPG|thumb|A train awaits departure from Woolwich Arsenal.]]
The system is part of the [[London Underground ticketing#Fare zones|London fare zone]] system, and [[Travelcard]]s that cover the appropriate zones are valid. There are one-day and season DLR-only &quot;Rover&quot; tickets, plus a one-day DLR &quot;Rail and River Rover&quot; ticket for the DLR and City Cruises river boats.

===Rolling stock===
[[File:DLR 106.jpg|thumb|right|A B2007 rolling stock at [[Poplar DLR station]]]]
{{Main|Docklands Light Railway rolling stock}}
The DLR is operated by 145&lt;ref name=&quot;WWD-DLR&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/what-we-do/docklands-light-railway |title=About TfL - What we do - Docklands Light Railway |publisher=Transport for London (TfL) |accessdate=13 June 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604174334/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/what-we-do/docklands-light-railway |archivedate=4 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; high-floor bi-directional single-articulated [[Electric Multiple Units]] (EMUs). Each car has four doors on each side, and two or three cars make up a train.&lt;ref name=&quot;RWT-DLR-upgrade&quot; /&gt; There are no cabs because normal operations are automated, and a small driver's console is concealed behind a locked panel at each end, from which the PSA can drive the car.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://londonist.com/2007/11/unmanned_train.php |title=Unmanned Train: DLR Respond |newspaper=The Londonist (blog) |date=2 November 2007 |accessdate=19 March 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222004250/http://londonist.com/2007/11/unmanned_train.php |archivedate=22 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consoles at each door opening allow the PSA to control door closure and make announcements whilst patrolling the train. With the absence of a driver's position, the fully glazed car ends provide a forward and rear view for passengers. The top speed is {{convert|100|km/h|mph|abbr=}}.

Despite having high floors and being automated, the cars are derived from a German [[light rail|light-rail]] design intended for street running. All cars look similar but there have been several different types, some still in service, others sold to other operators. B2007 units were purchased from [[Bombardier Inc.|Bombardier]] in 2005 and delivered between 2007 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://bombardier.com/en/corporate/media-centre/press-releases/details?docID=0901260d8000fc2d |title=Bombardier receives a $94&amp;nbsp;million US order from Docklands Light Railway for automatic Light Rail cars to be used in London, UK |publisher=[[Bombardier Inc.|Bombardier]] |date=4 May 2005 |location=Montreal |accessdate=14 July 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821135659/http://bombardier.com/en/corporate/media-centre/press-releases/details?docID=0901260d8000fc2d |archivedate=21 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Future rolling stock====
In 2017, TfL opened bidding for new trains to run on the DLR. It will order 43 new trains, which will increase capacity by 30% when they are introduced in 2022. The contract will be awarded in 2018 and the trains will feature charging points and air-conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railtechnologymagazine.com/Rail-News/tfl-opens-bidding-for-43-new-dlr-trains |title=TfL opens bidding for 43 new DLR trains |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201035438/http://www.railtechnologymagazine.com/Rail-News/tfl-opens-bidding-for-43-new-dlr-trains |archivedate=1 December 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 12 June 2019, it was announced [[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles|CAF]] have been successful in their bid and have been awarded the contract to provide the new trains, entering service in 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caf.net/en/sala-prensa/nota-prensa-detalle.php?e=279|title=CAF WINS DRIVERLESS TRAINS CONTRACT IN LONDON|last=|first=|date=12 June 2019|website=CAF|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depots===
There are operating and maintenance depots at [[Poplar DLR depot|Poplar]], now secondary to the larger site at [[Beckton DLR depot|Beckton]], built on the site of the [[Beckton Gas Works]] in 1996 and accessed via a spur at Gallions Reach.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher (2013), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Rolling stock is kept at both locations, which have maintenance workshops and extensive open-air carriage sidings. The Poplar depot, which is also the operating headquarters of Docklands Light Railway Ltd, Keolis Amey Docklands Ltd and the [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|Emirates Air-Line cable car]], houses diesel locomotives used for track maintenance. Poplar depot is alongside the north side of the Stratford line east of the station, and Beckton depot is to the east of the line on a long spur north-east of Gallions Reach. Beckton Depot has the only [[level crossing]] on DLR. It is an AHB type and the barriers are down unless a user wants to cross, much like Appleford but AHB styled.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

One of the diesel locos stabled at [[Poplar DLR depot|Poplar]] is 1979 GEC Traction 0-4-0, one of three built for Shotton Steelworks. Since they were used at the steelworks, one has been scrapped, one has recently been acquired by the Yorkshire Wolds Railway and the third is now at Poplar named &quot;Kevin Keaney&quot;. Its original nickname was &quot;Sooty&quot; because of the amount of exhaust this old engine produced.

===Signalling technology===
Originally the DLR used [[Railway signalling|signalling]] based on a [[Railway signalling#Fixed block|fixed-block]] technology developed by [[General Electric Company plc|GEC-General Signal]] and [[General Railway Signal]]. This was replaced in 1994 with a [[Moving block signalling|moving-block]] TBTC (Transmission Based Train Control) system developed by [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]], called [[SelTrac]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DLRhandbookDLRhandbook-66&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Pearce |first1=Alan |last2=Hardy |first2=Brian |last3=Stannard |first3=Colin |title=Docklands Light Railway Official Handbook |publisher=Capital Transport Publishing |location=Harrow Weald |date=November 2000 |page=66 |isbn=978-185414-223-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SelTrac system was bought by [[Thales Group|Thales]] in 2007 and updates are provided by Thales Rail Signalling Solutions. The same technology is used by [[rapid transit]] systems including Vancouver's [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]], Toronto's [[Scarborough RT|SRT]], San Francisco's Municipal Railway ([[MUNI]]) and Hong Kong's [[MTR]]. The [[SelTrac]] S40 system has also been adopted by the [[London Underground]] [[Jubilee line]] and [[Northern line]]. Transmissions occur via an inductive loop cable between each train's Vehicle On-Board Controller ([[VOBC]]) and the control centre (VCC, SMC) at Beckton. If this link is broken and communication is lost between the VOBC and VCC, SMC, the train stops until it is authorised to move again. If the whole system fails the train can run in restricted manual at {{convert|12|mph|km/h|abbr=|order=flip}} for safety until the system is restored and communication is re-established. Emergency brakes can be applied if the train breaks the speed limit during manual control or overshoots a fixed stopping point, or if it leaves the station when the route has not been set.&lt;ref name=&quot;RWT-DLR-upgrade&quot; /&gt;

==Developments since 2008==
With the development of the eastern Docklands as part of the [[Thames Gateway]] initiative and London's staging of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], several extensions and enhancements have been undertaken.&lt;ref name=&quot;dlrdev&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developments.dlr.co.uk/index.asp |title=Docklands Light Railway&amp;nbsp;â€“ Development Projects |publisher=Transport for London |accessdate=9 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705084414/http://developments.dlr.co.uk/index.asp |archivedate=5 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upgrading entire system to three-car trains===
[[File:Cutty Sark stn southbound look south.JPG|{{DLR stations|station=Cutty Sark |link=true}}, southbound platform 1 looking south|thumb|right]]
Capacity has been increased by upgrading for trains with three cars, each with four doors per side. The alternative of more frequent trains was rejected as the signalling changes needed would have cost no less than upgrading to longer trains and with fewer benefits.&lt;ref name=&quot;dlrcapen&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developments.dlr.co.uk/enhancements/capacity/index.asp |title=Docklands Light Railway&amp;nbsp;â€“ Three-carriage Capacity Enhancement Project |publisher=[[Transport for London]] |accessdate=9 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803062955/http://developments.dlr.co.uk/enhancements/capacity/index.asp |archivedate=3 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The railway was built for single-car operation, and the upgrade required both strengthening viaducts to take heavier trains and lengthening many pre-extension platforms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6924214.stm |title=Longer trains for Docklands Line |work=BBC News |accessdate=24 June 2009 |date=31 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were not originally built to take three-car trains.

Elverson Road, Royal Albert, Gallions Reach and Cutty Sark have not been extended for three-car trains; such extension may be impossible in some cases. [[Selective door operation]] is used, with emergency walkways in case a door fails to remain shut. {{DLR stations |station=Cutty Sark |link=true}} is underground, and both costs and the risk to nearby historic buildings prevent platform extension. The tunnel has an emergency walkway. Additional work beyond that needed to take the three-car trains was also carried out at some stations. This included replacing canopies with more substantial ones along the full platform length. A new {{DLR stations |station=South Quay |link=true}} has been built {{convert|200|m}} east of the former location as nearby curves precluded lengthening. {{DLR stations |station=Mudchute}} now has a third platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://londonconnections.blogspot.com/2008/04/mudchute-third-platform.html |title=Mudchute third platform |date=11 April 2008 |publisher=London Connections |accessdate=29 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708051923/http://londonconnections.blogspot.com/2008/04/mudchute-third-platform.html |archivedate=8 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For this upgrade DLR purchased an additional 31 cars compatible with existing rolling stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQQ/is_7_46/ai_n26701780/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712232246/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQQ/is_7_46/ai_n26701780/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-12 |title=Olympic rail gets a head start |work=International Railway Journal |accessdate=12 March 2012 |author=Barrow, Keith |date=July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The works were originally planned as three phases: Bank-Lewisham, Poplar-Stratford, and the Beckton branch.

However, the work programme for the first two phases was merged and the infrastructure work was completed by the end of January 2010. The Lewisham-Bank route now runs three-car trains exclusively. They started running on the Beckton branch on 9 May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/19961.aspx |publisher= Transport for London |title= Docklands Light Railway ready for 2012 Games with three-car upgrade completed |date= 10 May 2011 |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110513075914/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/19961.aspx |archivedate= 13 May 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stratford to Lewisham and Bank to Woolwich Arsenal services sometimes operate as three-car trains; other routes will run the longer trains when demand requires it.

Station names '''in bold''' are former North London Line stations.

New stations are:
* '''{{LUL stations|station=Canning Town}}'''
* {{DLR stations |station=Star Lane}}
* '''{{LUL stations|station=West Ham}}'''
* {{DLR stations |station=Abbey Road}}
* {{DLR stations |station=Stratford High Street}} (on the site of {{Stnlnk|Stratford Market}} railway station)
* '''{{LUL stations|station=Stratford}}'''
* [[Stratford International station|Stratford International]]

From Canning Town to Stratford the extension runs parallel to the [[Jubilee line]] of the [[London Underground]]. As well as providing interchange with the adjacent Jubilee line stations, there are additional DLR stations at Star Lane, Abbey Road and Stratford High Street.

At Stratford new platforms have been built for the North London Line at the northern end of the station. The old platforms (formerly 1 and 2) adjacent to the Jubilee line have been rebuilt for the DLR, renumbered 16 (towards Stratford International) and 17 (towards Beckton/Woolwich Arsenal). Interchange between the Stratford International branch and DLR trains via Poplar is possible although the platforms are widely separated and at different levels. There is no physical connection between the two branches. As part of the [[Transport and Works Act 1992|Transport &amp; Works Act]] (TWA) application, [[Royal Victoria DLR station|Royal Victoria]] on the Beckton branch has been extended to accommodate three-car trains, with a siding to enable trains to reverse there, using land released by the closure of the parallel North London Line. A partly grade-separated junction has been built south of Canning Town to prevent conflicting movements between the Bank branch and the Stratford International branch to and from the Beckton and Woolwich Arsenal branches.

===Relocation of Pudding Mill Lane station===
[[File:Pudding Mill Lane 2014, platforms.JPG|thumb|left|The resited {{DLR stations|station=Pudding Mill Lane |link=true}} features new, wider platforms]]
One of the tunnel portals for [[Crossrail]] is on the original site of [[Pudding Mill Lane DLR station|Pudding Mill Lane station]]. As a consequence, work was carried out to divert the DLR between City Mill River and the River Lea onto a new viaduct further south. This included a replacement station, which opened on 28 April 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;new-station-open&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2014/april/new-dlr-station-opens-at-pudding-mill-lane|title = New DLR station opens at Pudding Mill Lane|date = 28 April 2014|publisher = [[Transport for London]]|accessdate = 20 April 2015|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150427102931/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2014/april/new-dlr-station-opens-at-pudding-mill-lane|archivedate = 27 April 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://londonist.com/2011/07/pudding-mill-lane-station-to-be-rebuilt.php |title= Pudding Mill Lane Station To Be Rebuilt |work= Londonist |date= 28 July 2011 |accessdate= 13 August 2011 |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110812075353/http://londonist.com/2011/07/pudding-mill-lane-station-to-be-rebuilt.php |archivedate= 12 August 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The former station stood on the only significant section of single track on the system, between [[Bow Church DLR station|Bow Church]] and [[Stratford station|Stratford]],&lt;ref name=&quot;mrmarch&quot;&gt;{{cite news |work=Modern Railways |date=March 2006 |title=DLR aims for Charing Cross |author=Abbott, James |location =London |page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the opportunity was taken to double the track in three stages, to improve capacity.

==Proposed developments==

===Dagenham Dock extension===
[[File:Dagenham Dock station - geograph.org.uk - 194906.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dagenham Dock railway station]] has been proposed as the new terminus of the extension]]
{{Main|Docklands Light Railway extension to Dagenham Dock}}
:'''''Status'''&amp;nbsp;â€“ Not currently being developed''
This proposed extension from {{DLR stations |station=Gallions Reach}} to {{Stnlnk|Dagenham Dock}} via the riverside at Barking would connect the Barking Reach area, a formerly industrial area now due to be a major redevelopment as part of the [[London Riverside]], with Docklands.&lt;ref name=&quot;dlr_next&quot;&gt;[http://developments.dlr.co.uk/extensions/dagenham/whatnext.asp Docklands Light Railway&amp;nbsp;â€“ Dagenham Dock: Key Project Milestones] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615075056/http://developments.dlr.co.uk/extensions/dagenham/whatnext.asp |date=15 June 2009 }} [[Transport for London]]&lt;/ref&gt; It would cover major developments at Creekmouth, Barking Riverside, Dagenham Dock Opportunity Area, and five stations are planned, at Beckton Riverside, Creekmouth, Barking Riverside, Goresbrook (formerly Dagenham Vale) and Dagenham Dock. The extension is key if [[English Partnerships]]' plan is to work.

In October 2009, the plan had seemed to be once again under consideration. The Mayor's Transport Strategy stated that the Mayor, through Transport for London, would investigate the feasibility of the extension to Dagenham Dock as part of the housing proposals for [[Barking Riverside]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mts.tfl.gov.uk/documents/MTS09-Chapter-5-Proposals.aspx |title=Mayor's Transport Strategy, Chapter fiveâ€”transport proposals |publisher=Transport for London |accessdate=21 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017032016/http://mts.tfl.gov.uk/documents/MTS09-Chapter-5-Proposals.aspx |archivedate=17 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thames Wharf station===
{{Main|Thames Wharf DLR station}}
:'''''Status'''&amp;nbsp;â€“ On hold''
''Thames Wharf'' has been the planned name for two separate DLR stations. In 1994 the proposed location was between {{LUL stations|station=Canning Town}} and {{DLR stations |station=Royal Victoria}}.&lt;ref&gt;Mr Beck's Underground map, Garland, K. p 63&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the name was transferred to a potential future development on the London City Airport extension between {{LUL stations|station=Canning Town}} and {{DLR stations |station=West Silvertown}}, due west of the western end of [[Royal Victoria Dock]]. Since the station's intended purpose is to serve the surrounding area (currently a mix of [[brownfield]] and run-down industrial sites) when it is regenerated, the development is indefinitely on hold due to the area being safeguarded for the [[Silvertown Tunnel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://developments.dlr.co.uk/pdf/factsheets/lcy_ext.pdf |title=London City Airport Extension |date=10 November 2006 |publisher=Docklands Light Railway |accessdate=24 June 2009 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; a new Thames river crossing that has been proposed but currently has no timetable for implementation.

===Connaught Road/Silvertown Interchange station===
:'''''Status'''&amp;nbsp;â€“ Proposed''
A site near to [[London City Airport]] has been identified as a possible additional station on the London City Airport branch. The [[Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway|Connaught Tunnel]] is here, and will be used again when some of the former Custom House to North Woolwich section of the Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway is taken over by Crossrail.&lt;ref name=&quot;ConnaughtTunnel&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-13210232 |title=Crossrail brings old tunnel back to life |work=BBC News |accessdate=27 April 2011 |date=27 April 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430110855/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-13210232 |archivedate=30 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no plans have emerged as to if or when a station might be built here, even though the original extension was designed to allow this.

===Victoria/Charing Cross extensions===
[[File:Docklands Light Railway banner.svg|thumb|right|Docklands Light Railway flag box]]
:'''''Status'''&amp;nbsp;â€“ Proposed''&amp;nbsp;â€“ 2006
In February 2006 a proposal to extend the DLR to {{LUL stations|station=Charing Cross|link=true}} from {{LUL stations|station=Bank}} DLR branch was revealed.&lt;ref name = &quot;mrmarch&quot;/&gt; The idea, originating from a DLR &quot;Horizon Study&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bank-Aldwych-Charing Cross (E2)|url=http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/18439/response/46991/attach/4/Report%20Horizon%202020%20Final%20Issue.pdf|work=DLR Horizon 2020 Study: Business Case Appraisal|publisher=Docklands Light Railway Ltd.|accessdate=19 October 2012|author=Ove Arup &amp; Partners Ltd.|page=34|date=July 2005|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108214018/http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/18439/response/46991/attach/4/Report%20Horizon%202020%20Final%20Issue.pdf|archivedate=8 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is at a very early stage at the moment, but would involve extending the line from Bank in bored tunnels under Central London to the Charing Cross [[Jubilee line]] platforms, which would be brought back to public use. These platforms are now on a spur off the current Jubilee line and are not used by passenger trains. It has since been revealed that a proposed route as far as {{LUL stations|station=Victoria|link=true}} will be investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://districtdave.proboards39.com/index.cgi?board=dlr&amp;action=display&amp;thread=9383|title=DLR Victoria extension&amp;nbsp;â€“ official|date=23 October 2008|publisher=District Dave's London Underground Site|accessdate=10 January 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216150506/http://districtdave.proboards39.com/index.cgi?board=dlr&amp;action=display&amp;thread=9383|archivedate=16 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2018}}

While not confirmed, it is probable that the Charing Cross scheme would use the overrun tunnels between Charing Cross Jubilee platforms and slightly west of {{LUL stations|station=Aldwych}}. These tunnels were intended to be incorporated into the abandoned Phase 2 of the ''Fleet Line'' (Phase 1 became the original Jubilee line, prior to the Jubilee line Extension).&lt;ref name=&quot;clugjubilee&quot;&gt;Clive Feather, Clive's UndergrounD Line Guides (CLUG), [http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/jubilee.html Jubilee Line, A Modern Tube] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424014730/http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/jubilee.html |date=24 April 2012 }}. Retrieved 26 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However they would need enlargement because DLR [[loading gauge|gauge]] is larger than tube gauge and current safety regulations would require an emergency walkway in the tunnel.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Two reasons driving the proposal are capacity problems at Bank, having just one interchange between the DLR and the central portion of [[London Underground|Underground]], and the difficult journeys faced by passengers from [[Kent]] and South Coast between their rail termini and the DLR. Intermediate stations would be at [[City Thameslink railway station|City Thameslink/Ludgate Circus]] and [[Aldwych station|Aldwych]], which was intended for future connection with the proposed but now abandoned [[Cross River Tram]].

===Euston/St Pancras extension===

It would create a new artery in central London and help relieve the Northern and Circle lines and provide another metro line to serve the High Speed line into Euston.

===Lewisham to Catford/Lewisham to Beckenham Junction extension===
:'''''Status'''&amp;nbsp;â€“ Proposed''&amp;nbsp;â€“ 2006
This possible extension was considered during the latest Horizon Study. The route would follow the [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]] line and terminate between {{Stnlnk|Catford}} and {{Stnlnk|Catford Bridge}} stations. It has been seen as attractive to the district, as has the current terminus at Lewisham, built in an earlier extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/propertyadvice/propertymarket/3303494/One-long-picnic-it-certainly-aint.html |title=One long picnic, it certainly ain't |date=19 June 2002 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=24 June 2009 |location=London |first=Roger |last=Wilkes |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111233631/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/propertyadvice/propertymarket/3303494/One-long-picnic-it-certainly-aint.html |archivedate=11 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://business.highbeam.com/410604/article-1G1-116283467/dlr-takes-off |title=DLR takes off |date=6 May 2004 |work=Contract Journal |accessdate=24 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120709053121/http://business.highbeam.com/410604/article-1G1-116283467/dlr-takes-off |archivedate=9 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A map published in 2010 by Transport for London suggests that a further extension from Catford to {{stnlnk|Forest Hill}} has also been considered.&lt;ref name=&quot;potential-dlr-map&quot; /&gt;

However, early plans showed problems due to {{DLR stations |station=Lewisham |link=true}} being only marginally lower than the busy A20 road, which impedes any extension. The plan is however being revised.&lt;ref name=&quot;atoproj129&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/129 |title= DLR to Catford |date= 27 October 2007 |publisher= Always Touch Out |accessdate= 9 July 2008 |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080513060822/http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/129 |archivedate= 13 May 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Lewisham extension was first completed there were proposals to continue further to [[Beckenham]] to link it up with the [[Tramlink]] system. However, the way in which Lewisham station was built impedes this possible extension and it would prove costly to redevelop.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

[[File:Bromley north line connections.png|thumb|left|Proposals for the DLR to take over the [[Bromley North Line]] ''(blue line)'' is one of a number of proposals for Transport for London to run the Line by extending existing networks.]]
Another proposal is to {{stnlnk|Bromley North}} by taking over the [[Bromley North Line]], a short National Rail branch line which has no direct services into Central London. The scheme being considered by [[Transport for London]]&lt;ref name=locallondon&gt;{{cite news|title=Could the DLR or Bakerloo line be coming to Bromley?|url=http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/9487309.Could_the_DLR_or_Bakerloo_line_be_coming_to_Bromley_/|accessdate=26 January 2013|newspaper=This is Local London|date=23 January 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052933/http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/9487309.Could_the_DLR_or_Bakerloo_line_be_coming_to_Bromley_/|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[London Borough of Bromley]]&lt;ref name=&quot;lbbromley-2012&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Future Rail and Tram Links to Bromley|url=http://cds.bromley.gov.uk/documents/s12298/ENV%20PDS%20180112%20Future%20Rail%20and%20Tram%20Link.pdf|work=Report No. ES12004|publisher=London Borough of Bromley|accessdate=26 January 2013|date=18 January 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604211854/http://cds.bromley.gov.uk/documents/s12298/ENV%20PDS%20180112%20Future%20Rail%20and%20Tram%20Link.pdf|archivedate=4 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; would convert the branch line to DLR operation. Although [[Lewisham London Borough Council|Lewisham Council]] planned to re-route the [[A20 road (England)|A20 road]] and redevelop the area south of Lewisham DLR station, the plans published in 2012 have no safeguarded route for an extension, making one unlikely.&lt;ref name=lewisham_gateway&gt;{{cite web|title=Masterplan |url=http://newlewisham.com/masterplan.html |work=Lewisham Gateway: Phase A Consultation |publisher=Lewisham Council |accessdate=27 January 2013 |date=December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521234130/http://newlewisham.com/masterplan.html |archivedate=21 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;recon-201301&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Past and Future of the Bromley North Branch|url=http://www.londonreconnections.com/2013/the-past-and-future-of-the-bromley-north-branch/|work=London Reconnections|accessdate=26 January 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128103307/http://www.londonreconnections.com/2013/the-past-and-future-of-the-bromley-north-branch/|archivedate=28 January 2013|df=dmy-all|date=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gallions Reach Crossing &amp; Thamesmead Extension===
:'''''Status'''&amp;nbsp;â€“ Proposed''
The proposed [[Gallions Reach Crossing]] has been suggested by TfL as allowing a branch to leave the existing DLR network at [[Gallions Reach]], and cross the river on the proposed tunnel/bridge and into [[Thamesmead]]. The new branch could then pass through Thamesmead and towards Abbey Wood, Woolwich, or northwards towards Barking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/rivercrossings/east-of-silvertown?cid=east-london-crossings |title=Have your say on new river crossings in east and southeast London |website=Transport for London |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129163940/https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/rivercrossings/east-of-silvertown?cid=east-london-crossings |archivedate=29 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 October 2016 the London Assembly approved the extension to Thamesmead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayor-commits-to-east-london-crossings |title=Mayor commits to building greener, public transport-focused crossings |date=4 October 2016 |publisher=Greater London Authority |access-date=2016-10-04 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005142028/https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayor-commits-to-east-london-crossings |archivedate=5 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Replacement of Tower Gateway station with interchange at Tower Hill===
:'''''Status'''&amp;nbsp;â€“ Proposed''
A Transport Supporting Paper released by the office of the Mayor of London envisages the closure of [[Tower Gateway DLR station]] and the branch serving it, with a replacement interchange being provided via new platforms at Tower Hill Underground station. This would increase train frequencies to Bank by approximately 30%, thereby unlocking more capacity on the Bank branch.&lt;ref name=tsp&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Transport%20Supporting%20Paper_3.pdf |title=London Infrastructure Plan 2050: Transport Supporting Paper |publisher=London City Hall |page=143 |accessdate=6 February 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206103556/https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Transport%20Supporting%20Paper_3.pdf |archivedate=6 February 2018 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|It has been proven that almost all DLR passengers heading to the city get on DLR services to [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]] instead of Tower Gateway, but only 75 per cent of services head to the former.&lt;ref name=tsp/&gt;|group=note}}

==Accidents and incidents==

===Overrun of station buffers===
[[File:Island Gardens DLR station in 1992.jpg|thumb|right|The original Island Gardens DLR station at the end of a viaduct]]
On 10 March 1987, before the system opened, a test train crashed through [[buffer stop]]s at the original high-level {{DLR stations |station=Island Gardens}} terminus and was left hanging from the end of the elevated track. The accident was caused by unauthorised tests being run before the correct installation of the wayside safety system had been verified; an omission in the wayside system allowed the train to travel too fast on the approach to the terminus. The train was being driven manually at the time.&lt;ref name=Risks1&gt;[http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/5.29.html#subj3 London Docklands Light Railway; Northern Line's Dot-Matrix Indicators] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824045251/http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/5.29.html |date=24 August 2007 }} [[RISKS Digest]] Volume 5 Issue 29 Article 3, 13 August 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ModernRailways1&gt;Report on the Docklands Light Railway Accident Which Occurred at Island Gardens Station on 10 March 1987, ''Modern Railways'' (London), May 1987.{{page needed|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ModernRailways2&gt;&quot;'Unauthorised Tests' Caused DLR Crash&quot;, ''Modern Railways'' (London), June 1987.{{page needed|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant disruption was caused and a train was stranded at Island Gardens, unable to move until the track was rebuilt.

==Management==
DLR was a wholly owned subsidiary of [[London Regional Transport]] until 1992 when it was transferred to the [[London Docklands Development Corporation]].

The infrastructure is owned by Docklands Light Railway Ltd,&lt;ref name=&quot;data.companieshouse.gov.uk&quot;/&gt; part of the [[London Rail]] division of [[Transport for London]], which also manages [[London Overground]], [[London Trams]], [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|Emirates Air Line]] and [[Crossrail]].

A two-year extension was granted in 2002.
