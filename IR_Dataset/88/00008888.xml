Some research has looked into [[genetics]] when considering ''déjà vu''. Although there is not currently a gene associated with ''déjà vu'', the LGII gene on [[chromosome 10]] is being studied for a possible link. Certain forms of the gene are associated with a mild form of epilepsy, and, though by no means a certainty, ''déjà vu'', along with [[jamais vu]], occurs often enough during seizures (such as [[simple partial seizure]]s) that researchers have reason to suspect a link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brynie|first=Faith|title=Brain Sense: The Science of the Senses and How We Process the World Around Us|year=2009|publisher=Amacom|pages=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacology==
Certain drugs increase the chances of ''déjà vu'' occurring in the user, resulting in a strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past. Some pharmaceutical drugs, when taken together, have also been implicated in the cause of ''déjà vu''. Taiminen and Jääskeläinen (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

He found the experience so interesting that he completed the full course of his treatment and reported it to the psychologists to write up as a case study. Because of the [[dopaminergic]] action of the drugs and previous findings from electrode stimulation of the brain (e.g. Bancaud, Brunet-Bourgin, Chauvel, &amp; Halgren, 1994),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Explanations==

=== Split perception explanation ===
Déjà vu may happen if a person experienced the current sensory twice successively. The first input experience is brief, degraded, occluded, or distracted. Immediately followed by that, the second perception might be familiar because the person naturally related it to the first input. One possibility behind this mechanism is that the first input experience involves shallow processing, which means that only some superficial physical attributes are extracted from the stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The psychology of learning and motivation. Vol. 53|date=2010|publisher=Academic|author=Ross, Brian H.|isbn=9780123809063|location=London|oclc=668193814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memory-based explanation ===
'''Implicit memory'''

Research has associated ''déjà vu'' experiences with good memory functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adachi | first1 = N. | last2 = Adachi | first2 = T. | last3 = Kimura | first3 = M. | last4 = Akanuma | first4 = N. | last5 = Takekawa | first5 = Y. | last6 = Kato | first6 = M. | year = 2003 | title = Demographic and psychological features of déjà vu experiences in a nonclinical Japanese population | url = | journal = Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease | volume = 191 | issue = 4| pages = 242–247 | doi=10.1097/01.nmd.0000061149.26296.dc| pmid = 12695735 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognition memory enables people to realize the event or activity that they are experiencing has happened before. When people experience ''déjà vu'', they may have their [[recognition memory]] triggered by certain situations which they have never encountered.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The similarity between a ''déjà-vu''-eliciting stimulus and an existing, or non-existing but different, memory trace may lead to the sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown20042&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cleary2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Cleary AM|year=2008|title=Recognition memory, familiarity and déjà vu experiences |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=17 |issue=5|pages=353–357 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00605.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, encountering something that evokes the implicit associations of an experience or sensation that ''cannot be remembered'' may lead to ''déjà vu''. In an effort to reproduce the sensation experimentally, Banister and [[Oliver Zangwill|Zangwill]] (1941)&lt;ref name=&quot;Banister1941a&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Banister H, Zangwill, O |year=1941 |title=Experimentally induced olfactory paramnesia |journal=[[British Journal of Psychology]]|volume=32|issue=2 |pages=155–175 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1941.tb01018.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Banister1941b&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Banister H, Zangwill, O |year=1941 |title=Experimentally induced visual paramnesias |journal=British Journal of Psychology|volume=32|pages=30–51 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1941.tb01008.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; used [[hypnosis]] to give participants posthypnotic amnesia for material they had already seen. When this was later re-encountered, the restricted activation caused thereafter by the posthypnotic amnesia resulted in 3 of the 10 participants reporting what the authors termed &quot;paramnesias&quot;.

Two approaches are used by researchers to study feelings of previous experience, with the process of recollection and familiarity. Recollection-based recognition refers to the realization of the current situation has occurred before. Familiarity-based recognition refers to the feeling of familiarity with the current situation without identifying anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cleary|first=Anne M.|date=2008|title=Recognition Memory, Familiarity, and Déjà vu Experiences|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|language=en|volume=17|issue=5|pages=353–357|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00605.x|issn=0963-7214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, O’Connor, Moulin, and Conway developed another laboratory analog of déjà vu based on two contrast groups of carefully selected participants, a group under posthypnotic amnesia condition (PHA) and a group under posthypnotic familiarity condition (PHT). The idea of PHA group was based on the work done by Banister and [[Oliver Zangwill|Zangwill]] (1941), and the PHT group was built on the research results of O’Connor, Moulin, and Conway (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O’Connor|first=Akira R.|last2=Moulin|first2=Chris J. A.|date=2013|title=Déjà vu experiences in healthy subjects are unrelated to laboratory tests of recollection and familiarity for word stimuli|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=4|pages=881|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00881|pmid=24409159|issn=1664-1078|pmc=3842028}}&lt;/ref&gt; They applied the same puzzle game for both groups, “Railroad Rush Hour”, which is a game aims for sliding the red car through the exit by rearranging and shifting other blocking trucks and cars on the road. After completing the puzzle, each participant in the PHA group received a posthypnotic amnesia suggestion to forget the game in the hypnosis. On the other hand, each participant in the PHT group was not given the puzzle but received a posthypnotic familiarity suggestion that they would feel familiar with this game during the hypnosis. After the hypnosis, all participants were asked to play the puzzle (the second time for PHA group) and reported the feelings of playing.

In the PHA condition, if a participant reported no memory of completing the puzzle game during hypnosis, researchers scored the participant as passing the suggestion. In the PHF condition, if participants reported that the puzzle game felt familiar, researchers would score the participant as passing the suggestion. It turns out that, both in the PHA and PHF conditions, 5 participants passed the suggestion and 1 did not, which is 83.33% of the total sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Connor|first=Akira R.|last2=Barnier|first2=Amanda J.|last3=Cox|first3=Rochelle E.|date=2008-09-02|title=Déjà Vu in the Laboratory: A Behavioral and Experiential Comparison of Posthypnotic Amnesia and Posthypnotic Familiarity|journal=International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis|volume=56|issue=4|pages=425–450|doi=10.1080/00207140802255450|issn=0020-7144|pmid=18726806|hdl=10023/1647}}&lt;/ref&gt; More participants in PHF group felt strong sense of familiarity, for instance, commenting like “I think I have done this several years ago”. Furthermore, more participants in PHF group experienced a strong déjà vu, for example, describing like “I think I have done the exact puzzle before.” Only 3 out of 6 participants in PHA group felt a sense of déjà vu, and none of them experienced a strong sense of déjà vu. These figures are consistent with Banister and Zangwill’s findings. Some participants in PHA group related the familiarity when completing the puzzle with an exact event that happened before, which is more likely to be a phenomenon of source amnesia. Other participants started to realize that they may have completed the puzzle game during hypnosis, which is more akin to the phenomenon of breaching. In contrast, participants in PHF group reported that they felt confused about the strong familiarity of this puzzle but the feeling of play it just sliding across their mind. Overall, the experiences of participants in PHF group is more likely to be the déjà vu in life, while the experiences of participants in PHA group is unlike to be the real déjà vu. 

A 2012 study in the journal ''[[Consciousness and Cognition]]'', that used virtual reality technology to study reported ''déjà vu'' experiences, supported this idea. This virtual reality investigation suggested that similarity between a new scene's spatial layout and the layout of a previously experienced scene in memory (but which fails to be recalled) may contribute to the ''déjà vu'' experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cleary et al., 2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cleary et al., 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cleary |title = Familiarity from the configuration of objects in 3-dimensional space and its relation to déjà vu: A virtual reality investigation | journal = [[Consciousness and Cognition]] | year = 2012 | volume = 21 | pages = 969–975 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2011.12.010 | pmid = 22322010 | last2 = Brown | first2 = AS | last3 = Sawyer | first3 = BD | last4 = Nomi | first4 = JS | last5 = Ajoku | first5 = AC | last6 = Ryals | first6 = AJ|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the previously experienced scene fails to come to mind in response to viewing the new scene, that previously experienced scene in memory can still exert an effect—that effect may be a feeling of familiarity with the new scene that is subjectively experienced as a feeling that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past, or of having been there before despite knowing otherwise.

'''Cryptomnesia: Reconstruction of a memory'''

Another possible explanation for the phenomenon of ''déjà vu'' is the occurrence of &quot;[[cryptomnesia]]&quot;, which is where information learned is forgotten but nevertheless stored in the brain, and similar occurrences invoke the contained knowledge, leading to a feeling of familiarity because the event or experience being experienced has already been experienced in the past, known as &quot;''déjà vu''&quot;. Some experts suggest that memory is a process of reconstruction, rather than a recall of fixed, established events. This reconstruction comes from stored components, involving elaborations, distortions, and omissions. Each successive recall of an event is merely a recall of the last reconstruction. The proposed sense of recognition (''déjà vu'') involves achieving a good &quot;match&quot; between the present experience and our stored data. This reconstruction, however, may now differ so much from the original event that we &quot;know&quot; we have never experienced it before, even though it seems similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Youngson|first=R.|title=Deja Vu|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/rsmhealth/deja_vu|encyclopedia=The Royal Society of Medicine Health Encyclopedia|publisher=Dr R.M. Youngson|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dual neurological processing'''

In 1964, Robert Efron of Boston's Veterans Hospital proposed that ''déjà vu'' is caused by dual neurological processing caused by delayed signals. Efron found that the brain's sorting of incoming signals is done in the temporal lobe of the brain's left hemisphere. However, signals enter the temporal lobe ''twice'' before processing, once from each hemisphere of the brain, normally with a slight delay of milliseconds between them. Efron proposed that if the two signals were occasionally not synchronized properly, then they would be processed as two separate experiences, with the second seeming to be a re-living of the first.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Efron R|date=September 1963|title=Temporal perception, aphasia and déjà vu|journal=Brain: A Journal of Neurology|volume=86|issue=3|pages=403–424|issn=0006-8950|pmid=14063892|doi=10.1093/brain/86.3.403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/deja-vu4.htm|title=How Déjà Vu Works|date=11 April 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dream-based explanation===
Dreams can also be used to explain the experience of déjà vu, and they are related in three different aspects. Firstly, some déjà vu experiences duplicate the situation in dreams instead of waking conditions, according to the survey done by Brown (2004). 20% of the respondents reported their déjà vu experiences were from dreams and 40% of the respondents reported that from both reality and dreams. Secondly, people may experience déjà vu because some elements in their remembered dreams were shown.  Research done by Zuger (1966) supported this idea by investigating the relationship between remembered dreams and déjà vu experiences, and suggested that there is a strong correlation. Thirdly, people may experience déjà vu during a dream state, which links déjà vu with dream frequency.

===''Jamais vu''===
{{Main|Jamais vu }}

''Jamais vu'' (from French, meaning &quot;never seen&quot;) is any familiar situation which is not recognized by the observer.

Often described as the opposite of ''déjà vu'', ''jamais vu'' involves a sense of eeriness and the observer's impression of seeing the situation for the first time, despite rationally knowing that he or she has been in the situation before. ''Jamais vu'' is more commonly explained as when a person momentarily does not recognize a word, person, or place that they already know. ''Jamais vu'' is sometimes associated with certain types of [[aphasia]], [[amnesia]], and [[epilepsy]].

Theoretically, a ''jamais vu'' feeling in a sufferer of a [[delirium|delirious]] disorder or intoxication could result in a delirious explanation of it, such as in the [[Capgras delusion]], in which the patient takes a known person for a false [[Body double|double]] or impostor.&lt;ref name=&quot;moulin&quot;/&gt; If the impostor is himself, the clinical setting would be the same as the one described as [[depersonalization]], hence ''jamais vus'' of oneself or of the very &quot;reality of reality&quot;, are termed depersonalization (or [[surreality]]) feelings.

The feeling has been evoked through [[semantic satiation]]. [[Chris Moulin]] of the [[University of Leeds]] asked 95 volunteers to write the word &quot;door&quot; 30 times in 60 seconds. 68 percent of the subjects reported symptoms of ''jamais vu'', with some beginning to doubt that &quot;door&quot; was a real word.&lt;ref name=&quot;moulin&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,6-2282789,00.html |title=Doctor, I've got this little lump on my arm . . .

=== ''Déjà vécu'' ===
'''''Déjà vécu''''' is a feeling of “already living through”; however, it has been considered as a pathological form of déjà vu recently. Déjà vécu has behavioral consequences, unlike from déjà vu. Patients of déjà vécu would withdraw from their current events or activities since they believed that they have participated in them before because of the familiarity. Patients justify their feelings of familiarity with beliefs bordering on delusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Connor|first=Akira R.|last2=Barnier|first2=Amanda J.|last3=Cox|first3=Rochelle E.|date=2008-09-02|title=Déjà Vu in the Laboratory: A Behavioral and Experiential Comparison of Posthypnotic Amnesia and Posthypnotic Familiarity|journal=International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis|volume=56|issue=4|pages=427|doi=10.1080/00207140802255450|issn=0020-7144|pmid=18726806|hdl=10023/1647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Presque vu''===
'''''Presque vu''''' ({{IPA-fr|pʁɛsk vy}}, from French, meaning &quot;almost seen&quot;) is the intense feeling of being on the very brink of a powerful [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], insight, or revelation, without actually achieving the revelation. The feeling is often therefore associated with a frustrating, tantalizing sense of incompleteness or near-completeness.&lt;ref&gt;Blom, Jan Dirk (2009).

===''Déjà  rêvé''===
'''''Déjà rêvé''''' (from French, meaning &quot;already dreamed&quot;) is the feeling of having already dreamed something that you are now experiencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/imp/jcs/2017/00000024/F0020007/art00008?crawler=true|title=Frequency of Deja Reve: Effects of Age, Gender, Dream Recall, and Personality|first1=Schredl|last1=M.|first2=Goritz|last2=A.|first3=Funkhouser|last3=A.|website=www.ingentaconnect.com|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Déjà entendu''===
'''''Déjà entendu''''' (literally &quot;already heard&quot;) is the experience of feeling sure about having already heard something, even though the exact details are uncertain or were perhaps imagined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===''Déjà vous''===
'''''[[Deja vous (disambiguation)|Deja vous]]''''' is a pun on the English pronunciation of déjà vu. The French pronunciation of the vowel U in vu, {{IPA-fr|y|}} {{audio|fr-déjà vu.ogg|audio|lang=fr}}, does not exist in English. Therefore déjà vu is pronounced with a {{IPAc-en|uː}} in English. When pronounced this way, {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-deja vu.ogg|ˌ|d|eɪ|ʒ|ɑː|_|ˈ|v|uː}}, it means &quot;already you&quot; in French, rather than &quot;already seen&quot; and is written &quot;déjà vous&quot;.
