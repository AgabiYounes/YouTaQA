{{Multiple unit}}

A '''diesel multiple unit''' or '''DMU''' is a [[multiple-unit]] train powered by on-board [[diesel engine]]s. A DMU requires no separate [[locomotive]], as the engines are incorporated into one or more of the carriages. Diesel-powered single-unit [[railcar]]s are also generally classed as DMUs. Diesel-powered units may be further classified by their transmission type:  diesel–mechanical ''DMMU'', diesel–hydraulic ''DHMU'', or diesel–electric ''DEMU''.

==Design==
The diesel engine may be located above the frame in an engine bay or under the floor. Driving controls can be at both ends, on one end, or in a separate car.

==Types by transmission==
DMUs are usually classified by the method of transmitting motive power to their wheels.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===Diesel–mechanical {{Anchor|DMMU}}===
In a diesel–mechanical multiple unit (DMMU), the rotating energy of the engine is transmitted via a [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]] and driveshaft directly to the wheels of the train, like a [[automobile|car]]. The transmissions can be shifted manually by the driver, as in the great majority of first-generation [[British Rail]] DMUs, but in most applications, gears are changed automatically.

===Diesel–hydraulic===
In a diesel–hydraulic multiple unit (DHMU), a hydraulic [[torque converter]], a type of fluid coupling, acts as the transmission medium for the motive power of the diesel engine to turn the wheels. Some units feature a hybrid mix of hydraulic and mechanical transmissions, usually reverting to the latter at higher operating speeds as this decreases engine RPM and noise.

===Diesel–electric {{Anchor|DEMU}}===
In a diesel–electric multiple unit (DEMU), a [[diesel engine]] drives an [[electrical generator]] or an [[Alternator#Diesel electric locomotive alternators|alternator]] which produces [[electrical energy]]. The generated current is then fed to electric [[traction motor]]s on the [[wheel]]s or [[bogie]]s in the same way as a conventional [[diesel–electric locomotive]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gaz-voyager&quot; /&gt;

On some DEMUs, such as the [[Bombardier Voyager family]], each car is entirely self-contained and has its own engine, generator and electric motors.&lt;ref name=&quot;gaz-voyager&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view//cutting-noise-and-smoothing-the-ride.html|title=Cutting noise and smoothing the ride|publisher=Railway Gazette|date=1 August 2000|quote=In the Voyager application, every car has a Cummins underfloor engine and alternator supplying power to a pair of body-mounted traction motors. Each drives one inner axle through a cardan shaft and axle-mounted final drive gearbox.|accessdate=20 January 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604022558/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/cutting-noise-and-smoothing-the-ride.html|archivedate=4 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other designs, such as the [[British Rail Class 207#Technical details|British Rail Class 207]] or the [[Stadler GTW]] and [[Stadler Flirt|Stadler Flirt DMU]],&lt;ref&gt;Stadler Firt DMU/DEMU example: [[commons:Category:Elektriraudtee_Classes_2200,_2300_and_2400|Elron Elektriraudtee Classes 2200, 2300 and 2400]], [[commons:File:TEXRail Stadler FLIRT DFW Airport Nov 2019.jpg|TEXRail Stadler FLIRT]]&lt;/ref&gt; some cars within the [[consist]] may be entirely unpowered or only feature electric motors, obtaining electric current from other cars in the consist which have a generator and engine.

With diesel–electric transmission, some DMU can be no other than an [[Electric_multiple_unit|EMU]] without [[Pantograph_(transport)|pantograph]], which &quot;is substituted&quot; by one or more on-board [[diesel generator|diesel generators]]; this kind of DEMU can be potentially upgraded to [[electro-diesel multiple unit|electro-diesel multiple unit ''EDMU'']], becoming a bi-mode multiple units train (BMU), just adding one or two pantographs (with opportune converters, if necessary) and related modifications on the electric system.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}
A train composed of DMU cars scales well, as it allows extra passenger capacity to be added at the same time as motive power. It also permits passenger capacity to be matched to demand, and for trains to be split and joined en route. It is not necessary to match the power available to the size and weight of the train, as each unit is capable of moving itself. As units are added, the power available to move the train increases by the necessary amount. DMUs may have better acceleration capabilities, with more power-driven axles, making them more suitable for routes with frequent closely spaced stops, as compared with conventional locomotive and unpowered carriage setups.

Distribution of the propulsion among the cars also results in a system that is less vulnerable to single-point-of-failure outages. Many classes of DMU are capable of operating with faulty units still in the consist. Because of the self-contained nature of diesel engines, there is no need to run [[Railway electrification|overhead electric lines]] or [[Third rail|electrified track]], which can result in lower system construction costs.

Such advantages must be weighed against the underfloor noise and vibration that may be an issue with this type of train.

Generally diesel traction has several downsides compared to electric traction, namely higher fuel costs, more noise and exhaust as well as worse acceleration and top speed performance. The power to weight ratio also tends to be worse.

DMUs have further disadvantages compared to diesel locomotives in that they cannot be swapped out when approaching or passing onto an electrified line, necessitating either passengers to change trains or Diesel operation on electrified lines. Similarly the lost investment once electrification reduces the demand for diesel rolling stock is higher than with locomotive hauled trains where only the locomotive has to be replaced.  Finally, incremental maintenance costs for DMUs are significantly higher than with electric (EMUs), because of the added fueling, lubrication, replacement and maintenance of engine parts and systems in every car.

==Around the world==

===Europe===

==== Belgium ====
NMBS/SNCB uses its [[NMBS/SNCB Class 41]] DMU's on the few remaining unelectrified lines. As electrification progresses, the DMU's become less and less important.

==== Croatia ====
[[File:DMU_7023_at_Zagreb_Central_Station,_January_2020.jpg|thumb|DMU 7023 at Zagreb Central Station]]
Diesel multiple units cover large number of passenger lines in [[Croatia]] which are operated by the national operator [[Croatian Railways]]. On Croatian Railways, DMU's have important role since they cover local, regional and distant lines all across the country. Country's two largest towns, [[Zagreb]] and [[Split, Croatia|Split]], are connected with an Inter City service that is provided by DMU [[Tilting train|tilting]] trains &quot;[[RegioSwinger]]&quot; (Croatian series 7123) since 2004. Those trains may also cover other lines in the country depending on need and availability.

Luxury DMU series [[HŽ series 7021|7021]], built in [[France]], started to operate for [[Yugoslav Railways]] in 1972 and after 1991 stil remained in service of Croatian Railways until 2005. Units [[HŽ series 7121|7121]] and [[Y1 (railcar)|7122]] (which came as a replacement for [[HŽ series 7221|7221]] units), together with the newest series [[HŽ series 7022|7022]] and 7023 built in 2010's Croatia, cover many of the country's local and regional services on unelectrified or partly electrified lines.

====Estonia====
[[Elron_(rail_transit)|Elron]] has since 2015 a [[Stadler Flirt]] fleet, with 20 trains DEMU version. 

====Ireland====

In the Republic of Ireland the [[Córas Iompair Éireann]] (CIÉ), which controlled the republic's railways between 1945 and 1986, introduced DMUs in the mid-1950s and they were the first diesel trains on many main lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gApAhy8QvoEC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=ireland+diesel+multiple+unit+1950&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ge35Y5tY7v&amp;sig=zsAIE9Brs1J9GETmaU3ELRwkIMo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiUmcTOn4XZAhXN11MKHdeVAPA4ChDoAQgrMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=ireland%20diesel%20multiple%20unit%201950&amp;f=false|title=An A-Z of Famous Express Trains: An Illustrated Trip Down Memory Lane|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

====Romania====
[[File:Motor coach CFR 77-0906-6.jpg|thumb|Romanian Class 77 [[Nicolae Malaxa|Malaxa]] DMU in [[Campulung Est]] in 2006]]
DMUs are used mostly on shorter and less frequently travelled routes in remote and often poorer areas like [[Banat]] and [[Bukovina]]. The national railway company [[Căile Ferate Române|CFR]] uses [[Nicolae Malaxa|Malaxa]] class 77 and 78 DMUs locally built between the 1920s and 50s and refurbished in the 70s. It also uses a smaller number of other newer DMUs. Main DMU in use is the Class 96 [[Siemens Desiro]] aka Săgeata Albastră (Blue Arrow).

The first significant use of DMUs in the United Kingdom was by the [[Great Western Railway]], which introduced its small but successful series of diesel–mechanical [[GWR railcars]] in 1934. The [[London and North Eastern Railway]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lner.info/locos/IC/aw_railcar.php|title=LNER Encyclopedia: The LNER Armstrong-Whitworth Diesel–Electric Railcars|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] also experimented with DMUs in the 1930s, the LMS both on [[LMS railcars|its own system]], and on that of its [[Northern Counties Committee#Railcars|Northern Irish subsidiary]], but development was curtailed by [[World War II]].

After nationalisation, [[British Rail]]ways (BR) revived the concept in the early 1950s. At that time there was an urgent need to move away from expensive steam traction which led to many experimental designs using diesel propulsion and [[multiple unit]]s. The early DMUs proved successful, and under BR's [[History of rail transport in Great Britain 1948–1994#The Modernisation Plan|1955 Modernisation Plan]] the building of a large fleet was authorised. These BR &quot;First Generation&quot; DMUs were built between 1956 and 1963.

BR required that contracts for the design and manufacture of new locomotives and rolling stock be split between numerous private firms as well as BR's own workshops, while different BR Regions laid down different specifications. The result was a multitude of different types, one of which was:
* 'Intercity' units, which were more substantially constructed, and shared many features with contemporary hauled coaching stock. They were built for express services on important secondary routes on the [[Scottish Region of British Railways|Scottish]], [[North Eastern Region of British Railways|North Eastern]] and [[Western Region of British Railways|Western]] regions.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In 1960, British Railways introduced its [[British Rail Classes 251 and 261|Blue Pullman]] high-speed DEMUs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heaps, BR Diary: 1968–1977&quot; &gt;{{cite book |title=BR Diary: 1968–1977 |chapter=End of the Blue Pullmans |last=Heaps |first=Chris |isbn=978-0-7110-1611-8 |year=1988 |publisher=[[Ian Allan Publishing|Ian Allan]] |location=London |pages=66–67 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These were few in number and relatively short-lived,&lt;ref name=&quot;Heaps, BR Diary: 1968–1977&quot; /&gt; but they paved the way for the very successful [[InterCity 125]] or High Speed Train (HST) units, which were built between 1975 and 1982 to take over most principal express services on non-electrified routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/4/newsid_2486000/2486817.stm |title=1976: New train speeds into service |work =BBC News Online |accessdate=15 February 2011 | date=4 October 1976 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NewOps&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/DoT_WP001.pdf |title=New opportunities for the railways: the privatisation of British Rail |publisher=Railway Archive | page=8 |accessdate=15 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These {{convert|125|mph|0|abbr=on}} trains run with a streamlined power car at each end and (typically) 7 to 9 intermediate trailer cars.&lt;ref name=blue253 /&gt;&lt;ref name=blue254 /&gt; Although originally classified as DEMUs, the trailer cars are very similar to loco-hauled stock, and the power cars were later reclassified as locomotives under [[British Rail Class 43 (HST)|Class 43]].&lt;ref name=blue253 /&gt;&lt;ref name=blue254 /&gt; They remain in widespread use.&lt;ref name=blue253&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.railblue.com/Class%20Headers%20v2.0/class_253V.2.htm| title=Class 253 High Speed Train| publisher=Railblue.co.uk| accessdate=15 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=blue254&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.railblue.com/Class%20Headers%20v2.0/class_254V.2.htm| title=Class 254 High Speed Train| publisher=Railblue.co.uk| accessdate=15 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1980s, many of the surviving First Generation units were reaching the end of their design life, leading to spiralling maintenance costs, poor reliability and a poor public image for the railway. A stopgap solution was to convert some services back to locomotive haulage, as spare locomotives and hauled coaching stock were available, but this also increased operating costs. Commencing in the mid '80s, British Rail embarked upon its so called &quot;Sprinterisation&quot; programme, to replace most of the first generation DMUs and many locomotive-hauled trains with three new families of DMU:
*[[Pacer (train)|Class 140–144]] ''Pacer'' [[railbus]]es, ultra-low-cost diesel–mechanical units utilising 4-wheeled chassis and lightweight bus bodywork, designed for provincial branch line and stopping services.
*[[Sprinter (train)|Sprinter]] a family of diesel–hydraulic DMUs. These fall into three sub-groups; [[British Rail Class 150|Class 150]] ''Sprinters'' (for branch line/commuter service), [[British Rail Class 153|Class 153]] / [[British Rail Class 155|155]] / [[British Rail Class 156|156]] ''Super Sprinters'' (for longer cross country services), and [[British Rail Class 158|Class 158]] / [[British Rail Class 159|159]] ''Express'' units (for secondary express services);
*Networker diesel–hydraulic units, of [[British Rail Class 165|Class 165]] ''Network Turbo'' (standard commuter version) and [[British Rail Class 166|Class 166]] ''Network Express'' (for longer distance commuter services). These took over the remaining non-electric commuter services into London.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Following the [[impact of the privatisation of British Rail]] in the late 1990s, several other diesel–hydraulic DMU families have been introduced:{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
* [[British Rail Class 168|Class 168]] ''Clubman'' and [[British Rail Class 170|Class 170]]/[[British Rail Class 171|171]]/[[British Rail Class 172|172]] ''[[Turbostar]]s'', a development of the earlier ''Networkers''. These are built by [[Adtranz]] and later [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]] at [[Derby Litchurch Lane Works]] and are the most numerous and widespread of the post-privatisation designs. Purchased by [[Anglia Railways]], [[Central Trains]], [[Chiltern Railways]], [[London Midland]], [[London Overground Rail Operations]], [[Midland Mainline]] and [[ScotRail (National Express)|ScotRail]].
*[[British Rail Class 175|Class 175]] ''[[Alstom Coradia]]s'' were designed by [[Alstom]] as a rival to the 170 Turbostar, but bought only by [[First North Western]]
*[[British Rail class 180|Class 180]] ''Adelantes'' were an Alstom design for express services built only for [[First Great Western]]
*[[British Rail Class 185|Class 185]] ''[[Siemens Desiro]]s'', built by [[Siemens Mobility|Siemes]] introduced in 2006 by [[First TransPennine Express]]
*[[British Rail Class 195|Class 195]]/[[British Rail Class 196|196]] ''[[CAF Civity]]s'', being built by [[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles|CAF]] for [[Arriva Rail North]] and [[West Midlands Trains]]
*[[British Rail Class 220|Class 220]]/[[British Rail Class 221|221]]/[[British Rail Class 222|222]] ''[[Bombardier Voyager family|Voyagers/Meridians]]'' built by Bombardier in [[Bruges]] for [[Hull Trains]], Midland Mainline and [[Virgin CrossCountry]]

In 2018 the first [[Electro-diesel locomotive|bi and tri-mode electro-diesel multiple units]] were introduced:
*[[British Rail Class 800|Class 800]]/[[British Rail Class 802|802s]] are being built by [[Hitachi]] for [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]], Hull Trains, [[London North Eastern Railway]] and [[TransPennine Express]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/traction-rolling-stock/single-view/view/gwr-unveils-hitachi-iep-trainset.html GWR unveils Hitachi iep trainset] ''[[Railway Gazette International]]'' 30 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
[[File:otrain.jpg|thumb|Two [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]] [[Talent (train)|Talent]] low-floor DMUs on the [[O-Train]] [[Trillium Line]] in [[Ottawa]], Canada]]

Canada generally follows similar buffer strength requirements to the US,&lt;ref name=&quot;rsaa&quot;&gt;Such as the [[Railroad Safety Appliance Act]] of 1893.&lt;/ref&gt; but new services are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. As a result, several types of lightweight DMUs have been used:

* The [[O-Train]] [[Trillium Line]] in [[Ottawa, Ontario]] uses European-standard [[Alstom Coradia LINT]] (previously [[Bombardier Talent]]) DMUs on conventional railway tracks under a specific safety agreement with [[Transport Canada]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

====Costa Rica====
[[File:Tren urbano de Costa Rica.jpg|thumb|Apollo 2400 DMU in service in Costa Rica]]
Costa Rica has purchased several Apolo 2400 series DMU railcars from the former narrow gauge operator in Spain, which are run in commuter service.

====United States====
[[File:Budd RDC.png|thumb|[[Budd Rail Diesel Car]] RDC-1 #407 of the [[Cape May Seashore Lines]], New Jersey]]
A type of diesel multiple units in the U.S. was the [[Budd Rail Diesel Car]] (RDC). The RDC was a single passenger car with two diesel engines and two sets of controls.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In the United States only FRA-compliant DMU systems are permitted on freight rail corridors. This is due to the [[Federal Railway Administration]] setting higher [[Coupler (railway)|coupling strength]] requirements than European regulators, effectively prohibiting the use of lighter weight European-style [[inter-city rail]] DMUs on U.S. main line railways without [[timesharing]] with freight operations or special waivers from the FRA. This has greatly restricted the development of DMUs within the U.S. as no other country requires the much heavier FRA compliant vehicles, and no export market for them exists.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Operations using FRA-compliant vehicles:
*The [[South Florida Regional Transportation Authority]] has used a [[Colorado Railcar]] [[Bilevel rail car|bi-Level]] DMU and Coach consist since October 2006 as a technology demonstrator on the 87-mile long [[Tri-Rail]] commuter rail line between [[Miami]] and [[West Palm Beach]], [[Florida]]. In early 2007, three more bi-level DMUs and an additional bi-level non-powered coach were acquired.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* Since February 2009, [[TriMet]] is using FRA-compliant [[Colorado Railcar]] DMUs for its rush-hour [[WES Commuter Rail]] service, a suburb-to-suburb line between [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]] and [[Wilsonville, Oregon]]. The opening of the line was delayed from fall 2008 to early 2009 due to delays in getting the vehicles. TriMet also has 4 refurbished former [[Alaska Railroad|Alaska RR]] and [[Trinity Railway Express]] RDCs as backup trainsets for when one or more Colorado Railcar DMUs is out of service.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
* Also in [[Oregon]], former [[BC Rail]] RDCs were used on the Lewis and Clark Explorer excursion train from [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] to [[Astoria, Oregon|Astoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lcbo.net/traingo.html|title=LCBO – Lewis &amp; Clark Explorer Train|website=www.lcbo.net|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sonoma–Marin Area Rail Transit]], also referred to as SMART, operates [[Nippon Sharyo DMU]]s (the same as those in Toronto) on its route between San Rafael and Santa Rosa, California. Service commenced in 2017.

Operations using non FRA-compliant vehicles:
* [[Capital Metro]] uses [[Stadler GTW]] cars to operate [[Capital MetroRail]], a commuter rail line serving the [[Greater Austin]], [[Texas]] area.
* In [[Denton County]], [[Texas]], [[DCTA]] also uses [[Stadler GTW]] cars to operate its [[A-train (Denton County Transportation Authority)|A-train]] service.

The vehicles are FRA Alternate Compliant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=TEX Rail commuter line opens|accessdate=1 April 2019|newspaper=Railway Gazette|date=10 January 2019|url=https://www.railwaygazette.com/news/passenger/single-view/view/tex-rail-commuter-line-opens.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line has 9 stops with termini at [[DFW Airport/Terminal B station|DFW Airport]] and [[T&amp;P Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|title=TEXRail Map|accessdate=1 April 2019|website=Trinity Metro|url=https://ridetrinitymetro.org/texrail/maps/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[NJ Transit]] operates the [[River Line (NJ Transit)|River Line]] from [[Camden, NJ]] to [[Trenton, NJ]], every 15 minutes during peak hours and every 30 minutes at other times. It uses modified [[Stadler GTW]] trains of one or two cars. The line is classified as [[light rail]] because it utilizes imported European made DMUs that do not meet [[Federal Railway Administration|FRA]] crash guidelines. The cars may not operate with the [[freight rail]] service that shares the line, so evening operating hours are restricted to Saturday nights. This line currently carries over 7,500 passengers on a typical weekday, exceeding expectations.
* [[North County Transit District|NCTD]] operates the [[Sprinter (passenger rail)|Sprinter]] line using [[Siemens Desiro|Desiro Classic]] DMUs built by [[Siemens AG]]. Opened March, 2008, The line operates every half-hour daily, except limitations in the morning and at night on Saturday, Sunday and on holidays. The line runs from [[Oceanside, CA]], where transfer is possible with [[Coaster (San Diego)|Coaster]] [[commuter rail]] service to [[San Diego]], to [[Escondido, CA]]. Like the NJT River Line, it is classified as light rail due to the use of European made DMUs, but does not run at a more typical light rail frequency.
* The [[eBART]] expansion of the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit System]] implements [[Stadler GTW]] diesel multiple unit train service from Pittsburg/Bay Point station east along the Highway 4 corridor to the town of Antioch. Future expansions in this direction could also connect the eBART service to Oakley, Brentwood, Byron, and beyond to Tracy and Stockton. The DMU system was chosen as a less-expensive alternative to the existing third-rail BART design.&lt;ref name=&quot;bart&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bart.gov/news/articles/2009/news20090427.aspx|title=BART moves forward with $1 billion in extension projects - bart.gov|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Service began on May 25, 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebart&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bart.gov/about/projects/ecc|title=BART to Antioch: East Contra Costa BART Extension|accessdate=27 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposed operations:
* The [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] approved an allocation of $250,000 for a feasibility study of DMUs for &quot;future transportation options for the region&quot; on 5 July 2006 (Ara Najarian, Metro Board Member).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ebb.metro.net/news_info/2006/metro_116.htm|title=July 2006 Metro to Fund Implementation Study on a Regional Connector Through Glendale and Burbank|website=ebb.metro.net|access-date=2017-02-01}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=Redalert2fan |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Chicago]]'s commuter rail line, [[Metra]], is studying the use of DMUs on its newly proposed lines ([[Suburban Transit Access Route (Metra)|STAR line]], [[SouthEast Service (Metra)|SES)]]. They claim these DMUs will have better acceleration, be more fuel efficient, and seat more customers than the current diesel locomotive and double decker rail cars that are currently in use.&lt;ref name=&quot;metra&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metraconnects.metrarail.com|title=Coming Soon page|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Seattle area – The Central Puget Sound's regional transit agency [[Sound Transit]], along with the [[Puget Sound Regional Council]] evaluated the feasibility of both DMU and diesel locomotive technology for operation in the Eastside BNSF Corridor in response to a state legislative request. The Eastside BNSF corridor runs from the City of Snohomish in the north to Renton in the south of the metro area. Sound Transit has no plans to operate passenger rail service in the eastside BNSF corridor, but has committed limited funds to provide capital improvements in the event another public or private operator proposes to operate the service.&lt;ref name=&quot;psrc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psrc.org/about/pubs/bnsf/fullreport/bnsf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211035302/http://www.psrc.org/about/pubs/bnsf/fullreport/bnsf/ |archivedate=11 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anchorage Mat-Su area – As part of a joint U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and ARRC Chugach Forest Whistle Stop project, a self-propelled rail car was purchased and delivered spring 2009. The diesel multiple unit (DMU) may be available for flexible demonstration service during winter months.&lt;ref name=&quot;akrail&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alaskarailroad.com/Portals/6/pdf/projects/2010%20Commuter%20Partnership%20&amp;%20Opportunities.pdf |title=Alaska Railroad – Alaskan Tours &amp; Vacations – Train Packages |accessdate=19 June 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306045204/http://www.alaskarailroad.com/Portals/6/pdf/projects/2010%20Commuter%20Partnership%20%26%20Opportunities.pdf |archivedate=6 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Long Island Rail Road]], the busiest commuter railroad in the United States, is exploring the possibility of operating DMUs on some of its lesser traveled routes in non-electrified territory (on the [[Montauk Branch|Montauk]], [[Greenport Branch|Greenport]], [[Port Jefferson Branch|Port Jefferson]], and [[Oyster Bay Branch|Oyster Bay]] branches), where operation of its current fleet of [[C3 (railcar)|C3]] bilevel railcars pulled by [[DE30AC]]/[[DM30AC]] locomotives is uneconomical and inefficient.
* [[Arrow (commuter rail)|Arrow]] will utilize [[Stadler FLIRT]] trainsets along its service route in [[Redlands, California]].
* A proposal to use DMUs on Boston's [[Fairmount Line]] was initially approved, but was canceled in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.baystatebanner.com/2016/02/10/fairmount-line-setback-no-dmus-says-mbta/|title=Fairmount line setback: No DMUs says MBTA|first=Jule |last=Pattison-Gordon|date=February 10, 2016|publisher=Bay State Banner|accessdate=November 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia/Australasia===

====Australia====
[[File:AdelaideRail 2.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Adelaide Metro]] [[3000 class railcar]]s operating in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]]]

DMUs were first introduced to Australia in the late mid-20th century for use on quiet branch lines that could not justify a locomotive hauled service. Today, DMUs are widely used throughout Australia's southern states:

* [[Adelaide Metro]] use [[3000 class railcar|3000 class DMUs]] on their suburban network.
* [[NSW TrainLink]] use [[New South Wales Xplorer|Xplorer DMUs]] on services from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney]] to [[Canberra railway station|Canberra]] ([[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]]), [[Griffith railway station|Griffith]], [[Broken Hill railway station|Broken Hill]], [[Armidale railway station|Armidale]] and [[Moree railway station|Moree]]. [[New South Wales Endeavour railcar|Endeavour DMUs]] are used on services to [[Bathurst railway station, New South Wales|Bathurst]], [[Moss Vale railway station|Moss Vale]] and [[Goulburn railway station|Goulburn]] on the [[Southern Highlands Line|Southern Highlands line]], [[Kiama railway station|Kiama]] to [[Bomaderry railway station|Bomaderry]] and on the [[Hunter railway line|Hunter line]]. [[New South Wales Hunter railcar|Hunter DMUs]] are also used on the [[Hunter railway line|Hunter line]].
* Victoria's [[V/Line]] uses [[V/Line Sprinter|Sprinter]] and [[V/Line VLocity|V/Locity]] DMUs on all medium distance services.
* Western Australia's [[Transwa]] operates the [[Transwa Prospector|Prospector]], [[AvonLink]] and [[Transwa Australind|Australind]] on medium and long distance country services.

In Queensland, heritage DMUs are used on the [[Savannahlander]] and [[Gulflander]] tourist trains.

====Bangladesh====
Chinese manufactured (CNR Tangshan) DEMU was introduced in Bangladesh from May 25, 2013. DEMU is the country's first-ever commuter train service starting its journey on the Chittagong–Fouzdarhat line. These DEMUs also operate on the [[Chittagong Circular Railway]] and  on the [[Bangladesh Railway]]'s service between [[Dhaka]] and [[Narayanganj]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2013/05/25/demu-trains-begin-debut-run-in-ctg | title=DEMU trains begin debut run in Ctg | publisher=[[Bdnews24.com]] | accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====

DMUs (DEMUs) are widely used in India. DEMUs in India are used in both the 8 coach format and the 4 coach format. These trains replaced many (up to 10 car) trains with a WDM-2 or WDM-3A locomotive in the middle. These old trains had the loco controls duplicated in the Driving Trailer coach and all the actuation information reaching the locomotive through thin communication lines. This was called 'push-pull train'. The longest running such push-pull service operated between Diva - Bhiwandi Road and Vasai Road and was recently converted into an MEMU train service in 2018.




First generation DMU:
Rated power was 700 HP and had 3 or 6 coaches, made first by ICF. 
Transmission was Voith-hydraulic. 
Max speed 100 kmph.

The Southrail or the South Main Line of the [[Philippine National Railways]] which travels South of the Luzon island is one of the oldest rail lines in Asia and in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visitmyphilippines.com/index.php/index.php?title=Brief%20Description&amp;func=single&amp;pid=794&amp;Page=1&amp;tbl=0|title=Department of Tourism –  The Philippines Ultimate Travel Guide for Tourist|last=Visitmyphilippines.com|website=www.visitmyphilippines.com|access-date=2017-12-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227123708/http://www.visitmyphilippines.com/index.php/index.php?title=Brief%20Description&amp;func=single&amp;pid=794&amp;Page=1&amp;tbl=0|archive-date=27 December 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}
The Southrail of Philippine National Railways uses [[Hyundai Rotem]] DMUs together with second-hand DMUs from [[East Japan Railway Company]] or JR East and [[Kanto Railway]]. These are [[KiHa 52|Kiha 52]], [[KiHa 59 series|Kiha 59]] which is also known as the &quot;Kogane&quot; and Kiha 350. Trains such as the Hyundai Rotem DMUs Kiha 350 and Kiha 52 are often used for [[Philippine National Railways Metro Commuter Line|Metro Commuter Line]] services, while Kiha 59 is mostly used for Bicol interprovincial services and sometimes also for the Metro Commuter services.

====South Korea====
[[File:PP-DHC.jpg|thumb|Korail DHC-PP with new CI colour]]

[[Korail]] operates many DMUs. The DHC (Diesel Hydraulic Car), which made its debut for the 1988 Seoul Olympics, can reach speeds up to {{convert|170|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and serves [[Saemaul-ho]] trains.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

====Sri Lanka====
DMUs were first introduced to [[Sri Lanka Railways|Sri Lanka]] in 1940. The aim of this was connecting minor railway stations and stops on the main line where most express trains don't have a halt.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

====Taiwan====
The DMUs are now usually used on the [[Taiwan Railway Administration]] [[Hualien–Taitung Line]], [[North-Link Line]], [[South-Link Line]]. DMUs in Taiwan are classified as Class DR.
