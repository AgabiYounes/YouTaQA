'''Dan Simmons''' (born April 4, 1948) is an American [[science fiction]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]] writer. He is the author of the  [[Hyperion Cantos]] and the  [[Ilium/Olympos]] cycles, among other works which span the science fiction, horror, and fantasy [[genres]], sometimes within a single novel. Simmons' genre-intermingling'' [[Song of Kali]]'' (1985) won the [[World Fantasy Award]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WWE-1986&quot;/&gt; He also writes mysteries and [[thriller (genre)|thriller]]s, some of which feature the continuing character Joe Kurtz.

==Biography==
Born in [[Peoria, Illinois]], Simmons received a [[B.A.]] in English from [[Wabash College]] in 1970 and, in 1971, a [[Masters in Education]] from [[Washington University in St. Louis]].&lt;ref name=biog&gt;{{cite web| url=http://dansimmons.com/about/bio.htm | title= About Dan: Biographic Sketch | website=dansimmons.com | accessdate=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He soon started writing short stories, although his career did not take off until 1982, when, through [[Harlan Ellison]]'s help, his short story &quot;[[Prayers to Broken Stones#&quot;The River Styx Runs Upstream&quot;|The River Styx Runs Upstream]]&quot; was published and awarded first prize in a ''[[Twilight Zone Magazine]]'' story competition, and he was taken on as a client by Ellison's agent, Richard Curtis. Simmons' first novel, ''Song of Kali'', was released in 1985.&lt;ref name=biog/&gt;

He worked in elementary education until 1989.&lt;ref name=biog/&gt;

==Horror fiction==
''[[Summer of Night]]'' (1991) recounts the childhood of a group of pre-teens who band together in the 1960s, to defeat a centuries-old evil that terrorizes their hometown of Elm Haven, [[Illinois]]. The novel, which was praised by [[Stephen King]] in a cover blurb, is similar to King's ''[[It (novel)|It]]'' (1986) in its focus on small town life, the corruption of innocence, the return of an ancient evil, and the responsibility for others that emerges with the transition from youth to adulthood.

In the sequel to ''Summer of Night'', ''[[A Winter Haunting]]'' (2002), Dale Stewart (one of the first book's protagonists and now an adult), revisits his boyhood home to come to grips with mysteries that have disrupted his adult life.

Between the publication of ''Summer of Night'' (1991) and ''A Winter Haunting'' (2002), several additional characters from ''Summer of Night'' appeared in: ''[[Children of the Night (Simmons novel)|Children of the Night]]'' (1992), a loose sequel to ''Summer of Night'', which features Mike O'Rourke, now much older and a Roman Catholic priest, who is sent on a mission to investigate bizarre events in a European city; ''[[Fires of Eden]]'' (1994), in which the adult Cordie Cooke appears; and ''Darwin's Blade'' (2000), a thriller in which Dale's younger brother, Lawrence Stewart, appears as a minor character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Publisher's Weekly|title=Review: ''Darwin's Blade''|date=October 30, 2000 |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-380-97369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Simmons, Dan|title=Darwin's Blade|publisher=William Morrow|date=2000|isbn=978-0-380-97369-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/darwinsblade00simm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''[[Summer of Night]]'', Simmons focused on writing science fiction until the 2007 work of [[historical fiction]] and horror, ''[[The Terror (novel)|The Terror]]''. His 2009 book ''[[Drood (novel)|Drood]]'' is based on the last years of [[Charles Dickens]]' life leading up to the writing of ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'', which Dickens had partially completed at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;st090215&quot;/&gt;

==Historical fiction==
''[[The Terror (novel)|The Terror]]'' (2007) crosses the bridge between horror and historical fiction. It is a fictionalized account of Sir [[John Franklin]] and [[Franklin's lost expedition|his expedition]] to find the [[Northwest Passage]]. The two ships, {{HMS|Erebus|1826|6}} and {{HMS|Terror|1813|6}}, become icebound the first winter, and the captains and crew struggle to survive while being stalked across an Arctic landscape by a monster.

''The Abominable'' (2013) recounts a mid-1920s attempt on [[Mount Everest]] by five climbers—two English, one French, one Sherpa, and one American (the narrator)—to recover the body of one of the English characters' cousin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Review: 'The Abominable' by Dan Simmons|date=October 20, 2013|work=Chicago Tribune|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/books/ct-prj-1020-abominable-dan-simmons-20131020-story.html|author=Robbins, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;
