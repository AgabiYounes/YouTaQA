'''Deicide''' is an American [[death metal]] band formed in 1987 by drummer [[Steve Asheim]] and guitarist brothers Eric and Brian Hoffman as &quot;Carnage&quot;, then hiring bassist/vocalist [[Glen Benton]] and becoming &quot;Amon&quot;. They would later change the band name to Deicide in 1989. The band rose to mainstream success in 1992 with their second album ''[[Legion (album)|Legion]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/deicide-mn0000194008/awards | title=Deicide - Awards | website=[[AllMusic|Allmusic.com]]|accessdate =2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is credited as the second best-selling death metal band of the [[Soundscan Era]], after [[Cannibal Corpse]].&lt;ref name=&quot;death metal sales&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/it-s-official-cannibal-corpse-are-the-top-selling-death-metal-band-of-the-soundscan-era/ | title=It's Official: CANNIBAL CORPSE Are The Top-Selling Death Metal Band Of The SoundScan Era | work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date= November 2003 | accessdate =2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since their debut album in 1990, Deicide has released twelve studio albums, one live album, two compilation albums and two live DVDs. In November 2003, their first two albums, ''[[Deicide (album)|Deicide]]'' and ''Legion'', were ranked second and third place respectively in best-selling death metal albums of the [[SoundScan]] era.&lt;ref name=&quot;death metal sales&quot;/&gt; Deicide is known for their lyrics, which cover topics such as [[Satanism]], [[anti-Christianity]] and [[blasphemy]]. Their lyrics have resulted in bans, lawsuits and criticism from religious groups and the public.

==History==
===Early days as Amon/Carnage (1987–1989)===
[[File:Deicide band 017.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Bassist and vocalist [[Glen Benton]] is one of the two constant members of Deicide.]] Deicide was formed in [[Tampa, Florida]] on July 21, 1987, after guitarist [[Brian Hoffman (musician)|Brian Hoffman]] called [[Glen Benton]], replying to an advertisement the latter had placed in a local music magazine. Hoffman and his brother, along with drummer [[Steve Asheim]], had previously played together as the band &quot;Carnage&quot;, which was in need of a bassist and vocalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bushmado.com/deicideinterview.html |title=DEICIDE Interview with Eric Hoffman |publisher=Bushmado.com |accessdate=2011-10-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116032947/http://www.bushmado.com/deicideinterview.html |archivedate=16 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnage played cover songs by [[Slayer]], [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]], [[Celtic Frost]] and [[Dark Angel (band)|Dark Angel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sickdrummermagazine.com/index.php/the-drummers/hall-of-fame/786-steve-asheim |title=Interview with Steve Asheim |publisher=sickdrummermagazine.com |date=2008-02-18 |accessdate=2014-08-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101072429/http://www.sickdrummermagazine.com/index.php/the-drummers/hall-of-fame/786-steve-asheim |archivedate=2015-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new band, called Amon, consisted of Benton (bass and vocals), Hoffman, Hoffman's brother [[Eric Hoffman (guitarist)|Eric]] (guitars) and [[Steve Asheim]] (drums).&lt;ref&gt;Mudrian, Albert (2004). ''Choosing Death: The Improbable History of Death Metal and Grindcore''. Feral House. {{ISBN|1-932595-04-X}}. pp. 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a month, they had recorded the ''Feasting the Beast'' [[8-track (multitrack)|8-track]] demo in Benton's garage and had started playing the occasional gig in the Tampa area. &lt;ref&gt;Mudrian (2004), as above.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Amon recorded their second demo, ''Sacrificial'', at [[Morrisound Recording|Morrisound]] with producer [[Scott Burns (producer)|Scott Burns]].

[[Malevolent Creation]] guitarist Phil Fasciana recalls an early Carnage show: &quot;It was like Slayer intensified a thousand times.&quot; &quot;I guess Carnage had hollowed out a mannequin and filled it with fuckin' blood and guts from a butcher shop... and then they threw the fuckin' thing on the floor. [[Morbid Angel]] had these pit bulls with them back then and they were just tearing the meat up. It was a really weird scene, man. There was blood and meat everywhere.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Behind the Crooked Cross.&quot; Decibel: 72-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As Deicide (1989–2004)===
[[File:Deicide band 016.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Drummer [[Steve Asheim]] is one of the two constant members of Deicide.]]
Benton reportedly stormed into [[Roadrunner Records]]' [[A&amp;R]] man [[Monte Conner]]'s office and presented him with the demo, saying, &quot;Sign us, you fucking asshole!&quot; The next day contracts were issued to the band.&lt;ref&gt;Mudrian (2004), as above, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 the band's name was changed to Deicide at the request of Roadrunner Records.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Deicide then released their [[Deicide (album)|self-titled debut album]], also produced by Scott Burns at Morrisound, in 1990. Their debut featured re-recorded versions of all six of the ''Sacrificial'' tunes that had secured them their record deal.
 
Both the Hoffman brothers tended to play technical solos at fast speeds and with overlapping riffs, which gave Deicide the definitive heavy sound and complex song structures. This lineup remained intact until November 25, 2004, in the wake of increasing animosity between Glen Benton and the Hoffmans allegedly in regards to royalties and publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rini|first=Frank|title=Interview with Amon guitarist, Eric Hoffman|url=http://allabouttherock.co.uk/interview-amon-guitarist-eric-hoffman//|work=All About the Rock|date=November 22, 2013|accessdate=March 13, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314005105/http://allabouttherock.co.uk/interview-amon-guitarist-eric-hoffman/|archive-date=March 14, 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hoffman brothers later went on to reform Amon.

===Post-Hoffman brothers period (2004–present)===
[[File:Deicide band 010.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Guitarist [[Jack Owen]] joined Deicide in 2004, replacing the Hoffman brothers, and remained as a member of the band until 2016.]]
Shortly after, the guitar roles were then filled by ex-[[Cannibal Corpse]] guitarist [[Jack Owen]], and [[Vital Remains]] guitarist [[Dave Suzuki]]. Following the tour, Suzuki was replaced by [[Ralph Santolla]], formerly of [[Death (metal band)|Death]], [[Iced Earth]] and [[Sebastian Bach]]. Santolla stated he is a Catholic and this has received a small amount of shock and ridicule from some metal fans. In spite of this, Deicide's eighth studio album ''[[The Stench of Redemption]]'' album received rave reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Bowar, Chad.

In January 2007, Benton left the European tour and returned home to the United States as a result of legal issues at home. Asheim announced that Seth van Loo, from opening act Severe Torture, and Garbaty &quot;Yaha&quot;, from the Polish death metal band Dissenter, would be replacing Glen Benton starting on January 9 in the Netherlands, until Benton could rejoin the tour. Benton rejoined in Paris on January 13.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/deicide-soldier-on-without-glen/ Deicide soldier on without Glen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722191940/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/deicide-soldier-on-without-glen/ |date=2013-07-22 }}.

On May 24, 2007, it was announced [[Ralph Santolla]] had left Deicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=73199 | title=DEICIDE Parts Ways With Guitarist RALPH SANTOLLA | work=Blabbermouth.net | date=May 24, 2007 | accessdate=2008-05-17 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009131449/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=73199 | archivedate=October 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he joined Florida's [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]] and appears on their album ''[[Xecutioner's Return]]'' as well as the tour. Then on July 20, 2007, guitarist [[Jack Owen]] (ex-[[Cannibal Corpse]]) announced that Deicide is &quot;on hiatus&quot; and he has joined Ohio based death/thrash combo Estuary for touring purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=77203 |title=DEICIDE Guitarist JACK OWEN To Tour With ESTUARY |work=Blabbermouth.net |date=July 20, 2007 |accessdate=2008-05-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119183851/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=77203 |archivedate=2008-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The band did a Balkan tour, dubbed &quot;Balkans AssassiNation Tour&quot;, in October 2007 alongside [[Krisiun]], [[Incantation (band)|Incantation]] and Inactive Messiah.

By November 2007, Deicide began work on its ninth studio album at Florida's [[Morrisound Recording|Morrisound Studios]]. Entitled ''[[Till Death Do Us Part (Deicide album)|Till Death Do Us Part]]'', the follow-up to 2006's ''[[The Stench of Redemption]]'' promised to be Deicide's &quot;most savage and aggressive [offering] to date,&quot; according to a press release. Drummer [[Steve Asheim]] recorded drum tracks and Benton started recording vocals in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=86599 |title=DEICIDE's GLEN BENTON Recording Vocals For 'Till Death Do Us Part' |work=Blabbermouth.net |date=December 12, 2007 |accessdate=2008-05-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422015431/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=86599 |archivedate=2008-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 2008 two songs off this album were posted online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=95111 |title=DEICIDE: Another New Song Posted Online |work=Blabbermouth.net |date=April 17, 2008 |accessdate=2008-05-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420221309/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=95111 |archivedate=2008-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was finally released on April 28, 2008. As the record was coming out, Benton considered retiring from music, in the midst of personal matters including a custody battle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metalsucks.net/2012/04/06/i-was-worried-i-might-rip-my-fucking-ass-taint-metalsucks-interviews-deicides-glen-benton-for-easter/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610003621/http://www.metalsucks.net/2012/04/06/i-was-worried-i-might-rip-my-fucking-ass-taint-metalsucks-interviews-deicides-glen-benton-for-easter/ |date=June 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 6, 2009, Deicide posted a blog on their official Myspace page saying they had signed a worldwide record deal with [[Century Media]], with Ralph Santolla returning to the band for a European tour. They were said to be working on material for a summer 2010 release. In early 2009 they toured with Vital Remains and Order of Ennead. Guitarist Kevin Quirion of Order of Ennead joined the band in the summer of 2009.

In June 2010, Glen Benton revealed that the next Deicide album was to be titled ''[[To Hell with God]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metalpaths.com/interviews/deicide-glen-benton,4129|title=Deicide (Glen Benton) interview|publisher=MetalPaths|date=June 6, 2010|first=K|last=Panagiotis|accessdate=June 7, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609082103/http://www.metalpaths.com/interviews/deicide-glen-benton%2C4129|archivedate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced by Mark Lewis at Audiohammer Studios in Sanford, Florida, and was released on February 15, 2011.

Deicide released their eleventh studio album, ''[[In the Minds of Evil]]'', on November 26, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/deicide-in-the-minds-of-evil-release-date-announced/ | title=DEICIDE: 'In The Minds Of Evil' Release Date Announced | work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date= September 2, 2013 | accessdate =September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, it was apparent that guitarist Jack Owen had been replaced by [[Monstrosity (band)|Monstrosity]] guitarist Mark English without an official announcement made by the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/deicide-quietly-replaces-guitarist-jack-owen-with-monstrositys-guitarist|title=DEICIDE Quietly Replaces Guitarist Jack Owen With MONSTROSITY's Guitarist|work=Metal Injection|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/deicide-drummer-on-jack-owens-departure-he-kind-of-left-one-day-and-just-never-came-back/|title=DEICIDE Drummer On JACK OWEN's Departure: 'He Kind Of Left One Day And Just Never Came Back'|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|accessdate=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owen went on to join [[Six Feet Under (band)|Six Feet Under]] in February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://loudwire.com/guitarist-jack-owen-joins-former-cannibal-corpse-bandmate-six-feet-under/|title=Guitarist Jack Owen Joins Former Cannibal Corpse Bandmate in Six Feet Under|magazine=[[Loudwire]]|accessdate=February 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 9, 2014, [[The Village Voice]] reported that Deicide had started working on new material for their twelfth studio album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogsw.villagevoice.com/music/2014/10/deicide.php |title=Proudly Satanic Deicide's Secret to Success? &quot;Surrounding Yourself With Positive People&quot; |newspaper=[[The Village Voice|blogs.villagevoice.com]] |date=October 9, 2014 |first=Katherine |last=Turman |accessdate=November 4, 2014 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 10, 2017, Deicide announced a short U.S. tour which would begin in May and also issued an update on then-upcoming twelfth studio album: &quot;the new record is almost completed, right now its down to scheduling, this run of shows were setting up is to introduce and work in our new guitarist Mark English, that and I need a break from this thing called Florida…&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/community_feed/deicide_announce_spring_tour.html|title=Deicide Announce Spring Tour|publisher=[[Ultimate Guitar Archive]]|accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album, titled ''[[Overtures of Blasphemy]]'', was released on September 14, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/deicide-to-release-overtures-of-blasphemy-album-in-september/|title=DEICIDE To Release 'Overtures Of Blasphemy' Album In September|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|accessdate=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 6, 2018, former guitarist Ralph Santolla died due to complications following a heart attack and was taken off life support since being in a coma for a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2018/06/06/ralph-santolla-1969-2018/|title=Ralph Santolla: 1969-2018|author=Bellino, Vince|publisher=[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]]|accessdate=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
[[File:Kevin Quirion.jpg|down right|thumb|260px|Guitarist Kevin Quirion has occasionally been a member of Deicide since 2008.]]
Deicide has received considerable controversy relating to their albums and lyrics, which include vehement [[anti-Christian]] themes, such as &quot;Death to Jesus&quot;, &quot;Fuck Your God&quot;, &quot;Kill the Christian&quot;, &quot;Behead the Prophet&quot; and &quot;Scars of the Crucifix&quot;, among others. Drummer Asheim said, &quot;The whole point of Satanic music is to blaspheme against the [[Christian Church|Church]]&quot;, &quot;I don't believe in or worship a devil. Life is short enough without having to waste it doing this whole organised praying, hoping, wishing-type thing on some superior being&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/gig-reviews/what-the-devil/2006/11/30/1164777708385.html | title=Death-metal gods Deicide are the yin to Barry Manilow's yang. | newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date= December 1, 2006 | accessdate =2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the controversy surrounded frontman Benton for a rash of shocking interviews and wild statements. Benton has repeatedly branded an [[Cross of St. Peter|inverted cross]] into his [[forehead]] on at least 12 different occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzpBxFsZAjI |title=Glen Benton answers crowd questions at Deicide show |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2011-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an interview with ''[[NME]]'' magazine, he shot and killed a squirrel with a [[Air gun|pellet gun]] to prevent any further damage to his electrical system in the attic at the location the interview was held. This act garnered negative attention from critics and some animal rights activists. Benton had professed beliefs in [[theistic Satanism]] during Deicide's early years, claimed to slaughter rodents for fun, and that he held beliefs in demonic possession and that he was possessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mXmn4cx_2I |title=Glen Benton Interview 1990 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2011-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such statements had eventually been concluded as [[tongue-in-cheek]] and little more than sensationalism by band members questioned alternatively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blabbermouth.net&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=57924 | title=DEICIDE Frontman On JON NÖDVEIDT's Suicide: 'Only Cowards And Losers Choose That Option' | work=Blabbermouth.net | date=September 7, 2006 | accessdate=2008-05-17 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303074158/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=57924 | archivedate=March 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Benton claimed in the early 1990s that he would commit suicide at the age of 33 to &quot;mirror&quot; a lifespan opposite that of Jesus Christ. However, he passed that age in 2000 and did not commit suicide, rebutting in 2006 that these statements had been &quot;asinine remarks&quot; and that &quot;only cowards and losers&quot; choose to kill themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blabbermouth.net&quot;/&gt;

Deicide has been banned from playing in several venues (such as [[Valparaiso]], [[Chile]] over a promotional poster featuring [[Jesus Christ]] with a bullet hole in his forehead&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/article/?id=43407 |title=Deicide banned in Chile |magazine=[[Metal Hammer]] |date=2006-02-23 |accessdate=2008-05-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927183756/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/article/?id=43407 |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and with various festivals such as [[Hellfest (punk festival)|Hellfest]], after several graves had been spray-painted with &quot;When Satan Rules His World&quot;, a reference to a song from Deicide's 1995 album ''Once Upon the Cross''. In addition, their music video for &quot;Homage for Satan&quot;, which features blood-splattered zombies on a rampaging mission to capture a priest, was banned from UK music TV channel [[Scuzz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/article/?id=45283 |title='Homage For Satan' off the air |magazine=[[Metal Hammer]] |date=2006-08-23 |accessdate=2008-05-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329150326/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/article/?id=45283 |archivedate=2008-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Deicide was on tour in Europe with [[Atrocity (band)|Atrocity]] from Germany and [[Gorefest]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] death metal band. In [[Stockholm]], during the Gorefest set, a [[bomb]] was discovered on-stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/deicide/artist.jhtml#bio | title=Deicide Biography | publisher=MTV | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-05-17 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424093313/http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/deicide/artist.jhtml#bio | archivedate=2008-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It exploded in the club in which they were playing. The bomb was located to the rear of the stage, behind a heavy, fireproof door. The explosion was big enough to deform the door and blow it off its hinges. Deicide managed to play three songs before the police decided to stop the concert and evacuate the club. At first, Benton blamed that attack on the Norwegian [[black metal]] scene, where Deicide's brand of death metal was despised. Many people blamed [[animal rights]] [[activists]] who were angered at Deicide's lyrical themes of animal sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Ekeroth, Daniel (2006).
