'''Dionysius Thrax''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Διονύσιος ὁ Θρᾷξ}}, 170–90 BCE) was a [[Hellenization|Hellenistic]] [[Philologist|grammarian]] and a pupil of [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]]. He was long considered to be the author of the earliest grammatical text on the Greek language, one that was used as a standard manual for perhaps some 1,500 years,{{sfn|Škiljan|2000|p=91}} and which was until recently regarded as the groundwork of the entire Western grammatical tradition.{{efn|&quot;Elle a été considérée comme le texte d'ancrage de toute la tradition grammaticale occidentale.&quot;{{sfn|Ildefonse|1997|p=447}}}}

==Life==
His place of origin was not [[Thrace]] as the epithet &quot;Thrax&quot; denotes, but probably [[Alexandria]]. His Thracian background was inferred from the name, considered to be Thracian, of his father Tērēs (Τήρης). One of his co-students during his studies in Alexandria under Aristarchus was [[Apollodorus of Athens]], who also became a distinguished grammarian.{{sfn|Robertson|2008|p=4, n. 10}}{{sfn|De Jonge|2008|p=101}} [[Rudolf Pfeiffer]] dates his shift to the isle of [[Rhodes]] to around 144/3&amp;nbsp;BCE, when political upheavals associated with the policies of [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon|Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II]] are thought to have led to his exile. According to a report in [[Athenaeus]]' [[Deipnosophistae]] (11,489a, b), his Rhodian pupils, grateful for his learning,{{sfn|Pfeiffer|1968|p=266}} gathered enough silver to enable him to fashion a cup whose shape aspired to recreate [[Nestor's Cup (mythology)|that]] of [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] mentioned in the [[Iliad]] ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Il.+11.632&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0133 Book 11, lines 632–637]).{{sfn|Athenaeus|1933|pp=174–175}}{{sfn|Robins|1998|p=15}}

Dionysius was primarily an [[Homeric scholarship|Homeric scholar]], which was integral to his training under Aristarchus in Alexandria. His work shows some influence of earlier [[Stoic logic|Stoic grammatical theory]], particular on word classes.{{sfn|De Jonge|2008|pp=100, 137}} He is also reported by [[Varro]] to have been an erudite analyst of Greek lyric poetry, perhaps referring to his linguistic and [[Prosody (Greek)|prosodic]] use of that material.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|1968|p=267}} He wrote prolifically in three genres: philological questions (γραμματικά); running commentaries (ὑπομνήματα) and treatises (συνταγματικά). Of the last genre, he wrote a polemical monograph criticizing the Homeric interpretations of [[Crates of Mallus|Krates]]. Another work he is said to have written was the Περὶ ποσοτήτων ([[Metre (poetry)|On quantities]]). From the [[scholia]]{{efn|There are extensive scholia to the ''Techne'', which have been edited by A. Hilgard in 1901: ''Scholia in Dionysii Thracis Artem Grammaticam, recensuit et apparatum criticum indicesque adiecit Alfredus Hilgard, Lipsiae: in aedibus B.G. Teubneri'' 1901. The collections of scholia are the following: ''Prolegomena Vossiana'' (p. 1); ''Commentarius Melampodis seu Diomedis'' (p. 10); ''Commentarius Heliodori'' (p. 67); ''Scholiorum collectio Vaticana'' (p. 106); ''Scholiorum collectio Marciana'' (p. 292); ''Scholiorum collectio Londinensis'' (p. 442); ''Commentariolus Byzantinus'' (pp. 565–586).}} preserved from the critical works of [[Aristonicus of Alexandria|Aristonicus]] and [[Didymus Chalcenterus|Didymus]] who excerpted Dionysius' work it is clear that he was decidedly independent in his textual judgements on the Homeric corpus, since he frequently contradicts his master's known readings.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|1968|p=267}} His teaching may have exercised a formative impact on the rise of Roman grammatical studies, if as an entry in the [[Suda]] suggests, the elder [[Tyrannion of Amisus|Tyrannion]] was one of his pupils. The founder of classical scholarship in Rome, [[Lucius Aelius Stilo Praeconinus|L. Aelius Stilo]] may have profited from Dionysius' instruction, since he accompanied to Rhodes [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus|Q. Metellus Numidicus]] when the latter went into voluntary exile, and while Dionysius was still teaching there.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|1968|p=266}}

==Tékhnē grammatikē==
Dionysius Thrax was credited traditionally as the author of the first extant grammar of [[Greek language|Greek]], ''[[Art of Grammar]]'' ({{lang|grc|Τέχνη γραμματική}}, ''Tékhnē grammatikē''). The Greek text, in [[August Immanuel Bekker]]'s edition, runs to fifty pages.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|1968|pp=267–268}}{{efn|Immanuel Bekker, ''Anecdota Graeca'', Volume 2 Berlin 1816 pp 627–643}} Its importance in Byzantine scholarship is attested by the fact that commentaries on it by Byzantine scholiasts run to some 600 pages.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|1968|p=268}}{{sfn|Ildefonse|1997|p=447}} The text itself was thought to be the unique extant example of a work by [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic scholars]].{{sfn|Pfeiffer|1968|p=266}} This general consensus began to break down when examinations of grammatical texts datable to a later period emerged among the finds of the [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]] which, until relatively late, showed no awareness of key elements in the text attributed to Dionysius Thrax.  It concerns itself primarily with a [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] description of Greek, lacking any treatment of [[syntax]]. The work was translated into [[Armenian language|Armenian]] sometime around the 5th to 6th centuries CE,{{sfn|Clackson|1998|pp=121–133}} and into [[Syriac language|Syriac]] around that same period.{{sfn|Sandys|2010|p=138}}{{sfn|Ildefonse|1997|p=447}}

Thrax defines grammar at the beginning of the ''Tékhnē'' as &quot;the empirical knowledge of what is for the most part being said by poets and prose writers.&quot;{{sfn|Pfeiffer|1968|p=268}} He states that ''grammatikē'', what we might nowadays call &quot;literary criticism&quot;,{{efn|Strictly speaking, &quot;literary criticism&quot; is more or less what the sixth section of the treatise, ''krísis poiēmάtōn'', deals with. That phrase was translated by Di Benedetto as &quot;textual criticism&quot; which however in classical Greek was called '''διόρθωσις''' (''diórthōsis'').{{sfn|Pfeiffer|1968|p=269,n.2}}}} comprises six parts:

''Grammatikḗ''
* (a) '''ἀνάγνωσις''' (''anágnōsis''): reading aloud with correct pronunciation, accent and punctuation (προσῳδία).
* (b) '''ἐξήγησις''' (''exḗgēsis''): exposition of the [[Trope (philosophy)|tropes/τρόποι]], the figurative language of texts.
* (c) '''γλῶσσαι''' (''glōssai''): exposition of obsolete words and subject matter (ἱστορίαι).
* (d) '''ἐτυμολογία''' (''etumología''): finding the correct meaning of words, by etymology.
* (e) '''ἀνάλογίας ἐκλογισμός''' (''análogías eklogismós''): setting forth or considering analogies.
* (f) '''κρίσις ποιημάτων''' (''krísis poiēmάtōn''): critical judgement of the works examined.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|1968|pp=268–269}}{{efn|''Diorthosis''(διόρθωσις), literally &quot;correction&quot;, indicates the scholarly work of &quot;recension&quot; of a text, that is, the establishment of the correct text by critical analysis and choice of specific readings. The ''ekdosis'' ('''ἐκδοσις''') is the final result of such an operation.'{{sfn|Schironi|2018|p=20, n.64}}}}{{sfn|Berglund|2018|p=226}}

Paragraph 6 outlines the στοιχεῖα (''stoikheia'') or letters of the alphabet, together with the divisions into vowels, diphthongs and consonants.

Paragraphs 7-10 deal with syllables, long (μακραὶ συλλαβαί), short (βραχεῖαι συλλαβαί) and [[anceps]] (κοιναὶ συλλαβαί).

Paragraph 11 treats the [[Part of speech|eight word classes]], though strong doubts exist as to whether or not this division goes back to Dionysius Thrax, since ancient testimonies assert that he conflated proper nouns and appellatives, and classified [[Article (grammar)|the article]] together with [[pronoun]]s.{{sfn|De Jonge|2008|p=92}} In the text attributed to Dionysius, the eight classes. which Di Benedetto and others argue was probably developed by [[Tryphon]] several decades after Dionysius, are as follows:

* (a) the proper noun ('''ὄνομα''') and its three genders: masculine ('''ἀρσενικόν'''), feminine ('''θηλυκόν''') and neutral ('''οὺδέτερον''') are distinguished, together with the five case endings.{{efn|Classification according to gender was, ''fide'' Aristotle, the invention of [[Protagoras]]. He designated the neuter category by the word σκεῦας (inanimate thing), which Aristotle replaced by '''μεταξύ''' (in between), meaning neither male nor female, a terminology which was adopted in Stoic approaches, which however established οὺδέτερον as the default term.{{sfn|Michael|2010|pp=110–111}}}} He also notes however that two other terms are also in use: '''κοινόν''' (common) designating those words whose gender varies depending on the sex of the creature, such as ἳππος (''hippos''/horse))  and '''ἐπίκοινον''' (epicene)  used to define words whose gender is stable, but which can refer to either sex, instancing χελίδων (''khelídōn''/swallow).{{sfn|Michael|2010|p=111}}
** The appellative (προσηγορία),{{sfn|De Jonge|2008|p=100}} which he considers a species ([[Theory of forms|εἶδος]]) of the proper noun, not a distinct part of speech.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|1968|p=269}}
* (b) the verb ('''ῥῆμα''') with its tenses.
* (c) participles ('''μετοχή''')
* (d) the article ('''ἄρθρον''')
* (e) pronouns ('''ἀντωνυμία''')
* (f) preposition ('''πρόθεσις''')
* (g) adverb ('''ἐπίρρημα''')
* (h) conjunction ('''σύνδεσμος'''){{sfn|De Jonge|2008|p=91}}

Paragraphs 12-20 then elaborates successively on the parts of speech.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|1968|p=269}}

==Authorship==
Modern scepticism over the attribution is associated with the pioneering work of [[Vincenzo Di Benedetto]] in particular, though as early as 1822 [[Karl Wilhelm Göttling]], by analyzing the scholia on the text that had recently been collected and publisher by A. I. Bekker, concluded that the text as we have it was to be dated, not to the Hellinistic period but rather to [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]].{{sfn|Pfeiffer|1968|p=272}} Göttling's thesis convinced neither [[:de:Moritz Schmidt|Moritz Schmidt]] nor [[Gustav Uhlig]], and disappeared from view. In 1958/1959, Di Benedetto revived doubts by comparing the received text with ancient grammatical papyri that had since come to light.{{sfn|Di Benedetto|2007|pp=381–461}} He argued that before the 3rd to 4th centuries CE, no papyri on Greek grammar reveal material structured in a way similar to the exposition we have in Dionysius's treatise, that the surviving witnesses for the period before that late date, namely authors such as [[Sextus Empiricus]], [[Aelius Herodianus]], [[Apollonius Dyscolus]] and [[Quintilian]], fail to cite him, and that Dionysius's work only begins to receive explicit mention in the works written from the 5th century onwards by such scholars as [[Timotheus of Gaza]], [[Ammonius Hermiae]] and [[Priscian]].{{sfn|Pagani|2014|pp=206–207}} Di Benedetto concluded that only the first five paragraphs of the treatise came from Dionysius' hand.{{sfn|De Jonge|2008|p=92}}

Though initially rebuffed by scholars of the caliber of Pfeiffer and [[Hartmut Erbse]], De Benedetto's argument today has found general acceptance among specialists.{{sfn|De Jonge|2008|p=92}}
