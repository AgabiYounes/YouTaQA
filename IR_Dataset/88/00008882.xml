'''Domnall mac Ailpín''' ([[Scottish Gaelic language|Modern Gaelic]]: ''Dòmhnall mac Ailpein''&lt;ref&gt;''Domnall mac Ailpín'' is the Mediaeval Gaelic form.&lt;/ref&gt;), anglicised sometimes as '''Donald MacAlpin''' and known in most modern regnal lists as '''Donald I''' (812 &amp;ndash; 13 April 862), was [[King of the Picts]] from 858 to 862. He followed his brother [[Kenneth I]] to the [[Picts|Pictish]] throne.

==Reign==
The [[Chronicle of the Kings of Alba]] says that Domnall reigned for four years, matching the notices in the [[Annals of Ulster]] of his brother's death in February 858 and his own in April 862.&lt;ref&gt;Annals of Ulster, s.a. 858 &amp; 862.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chronicle notes:
{{quote|In his time the Gaels with their king made the rights and laws of the kingdom, [that are called the laws] of [[Áed Find|Aed, Eochaid's son]], in [[Forteviot]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''ESSH'', p. 291, citing [[William Forbes Skene|Skene]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The laws of Áed Find are entirely lost, but it has been assumed that, like the laws attributed to [[Giric of Scotland|Giric]] and [[Constantine II of Scotland|Constantine II]] (Causantín mac Áeda), these related to the church and in particular to granting the privileges and immunities common elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of Forteviot as the site of this law-making, along with Kenneth's death there and Constantine's later gathering at nearby [[Scone, Perth and Kinross|Scone]], may point to this as being the heartland of the sons of Alpín's support.

The [[Chronicle of Melrose]] says of Domnall, &quot;in war he was a vigorous soldier ... he is said to have been assassinated at Scone.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''ESSH'', p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; No other source reports Domnall's death by violence.

The [[Prophecy of Berchán]] may refer to Domnall in stanzas 123&amp;ndash;124:

{{quote|Evil will be Scotland's lot because of [the death of Kenneth MacAlpin]; long will it be till his like will come. A long while till the king takes [sovereignty], the wanton son of the foreign wife (?). He will be three years in the kingdom, and three months (although thou countest them). His tomb-stone will be above [[Loch Awe]]. He dies of disease.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''ESSH'', p. 292, citing Skene.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although Domnall is generally supposed to have been childless, it has been suggested that [[Giric of Scotland|Giric]] was a son of Domnall, reading his patronym as ''mac Domnaill'' rather than the commonly supposed ''mac Dúngail''.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, is not widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Compare Duncan, p. 11ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Domnall died, either at the palace of Cinnbelachoir (location unknown), or at ''Rathinveralmond'' (also unknown, and may be the same place, presumed to be near the junction of the [[River Almond, Perthshire|Almond]] and the [[River Tay|Tay]], near Scone).&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''ESSH'', p. 291; Duncan, pp. 10&amp;ndash;11.&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried on [[Iona]].
