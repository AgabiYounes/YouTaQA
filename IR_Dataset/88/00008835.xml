'''''Digimon''''' ({{Nihongo2|デジモン}} ''Dejimon'', branded as '''''Digimon: Digital Monsters''''', stylized as '''''DIGIMON'''''), short for &quot;Digital Monsters&quot; ({{Nihongo2|デジタルモンスター}} ''Dejitaru Monsutā''), is a [[Japan]]ese [[media franchise]] encompassing [[digital pet|virtual pet]] toys, [[anime]], [[manga]], [[video game]]s, [[film]]s and a [[trading card game]]. The franchise focuses on the eponymous creatures, who inhabit a &quot;[[Virtual world|Digital World]]&quot;, a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] that originated from Earth's various communication networks.

The franchise was created in 1997 as a [[Digital Monster (virtual pet)|series of virtual pets]], akin to—and influenced in style by—the contemporary [[Tamagotchi]] or nano [[Giga Pet]] toys. The creatures were first designed to look cute and iconic even on the devices' small screens; later developments had them created with a harder-edged style influenced by American [[comics]]. The franchise gained momentum with its first anime incarnation, ''[[Digimon Adventure]]'', and an early video game, ''[[Digimon World]]'', both released in 1999. Several anime series and films based on them have been released, and [[List of Digimon video games|the video game series]] has expanded into genres such as [[role-playing video game|role-playing]], [[racing game|racing]], [[fighting game|fighting]], and [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPGs]].

==Eponymous creatures==
{{multiple issues

{{overly detailed|date=May 2019}}
}}
Digimon hatch from types of eggs which are called {{nihongo|Digi-Eggs|デジタマ|Dejitama}}. In the English iterations of the franchise there is another type of [[Digi-Eggs|Digi-Egg]] that can be used to digivolve, or transform, Digimon. This second type of Digi-Egg is called a {{nihongo|Digimental|デジメンタル|Dejimentaru}} in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. They age via a process called &quot;Digivolution&quot; which changes their appearance and increases their powers. The effect of Digivolution, however, is not permanent in the partner Digimon of the main characters in the anime, and Digimon who have digivolved will most of the time revert to their previous form after a battle or if they are too weak to continue. Some Digimon act feral. Most, however, are capable of [[intelligence]] and human speech. They are able to digivolve by the use of Digivices that their human partners have. There are currently over 1400 Digimon.

===Television series===
The ''Digimon'' anime series was produced by [[Toei Animation]] and Bandai of Japan. Beginning in 1999, an anime series was green-lit as the first of the ''Digimon'' films aired in theaters. Originally, ''[[Digimon Adventure]]'' was supposed to be a short film, but after the storyboard was finished, a request for the film to become a children's television series was made.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} Several anime series have since been produced, with the first six series [[Dub localization|localized]] into English for release in Western markets.

===Distribution and localization===

In the United States, ''Digimon Adventure'' premiered in August 1999 on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. An English-language [[dub localization|adaptation]] of the series produced by [[Saban Entertainment]] (later [[Sensation Animation]]), the series was broadcast on [[Fox Kids]]. Saban would dub the first four anime series in the franchise, which were collectively retitled ''Digimon: Digital Monsters''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxkids.com/tvshows/digimon/episode1.html|title=Digimon: Digital Monsters Episode Guide|work=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Family Properties]]|accessdate=2018-11-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010615125822/http://www.foxkids.com/tvshows/digimon/episode1.html|archivedate=2001-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scenes from the original version were modified or omitted in order to comply with Fox's [[standards and practices]]. The show also featured more jokes and added dialogue, along with a completely different musical score. As a cross-promotional stunt, 2001 and 2002 saw ''Digi-Bowl'' specials co-produced with [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]; ''NFL on Fox'' commentator [[Terry Bradshaw]] provided interstitial segments in-between episodes as if the episodes were actually a football game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxkids.com/tvshows/digimon/digibowl/|title=Digimon: Digital Monsters: Digibowl 2002|work=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Family Properties]]|accessdate=2018-11-05|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020123021428/http://www.foxkids.com/tvshows/digimon/digibowl/|archivedate=2002-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yuen Wong Yu manhua===
A Chinese [[manhua]] was written and drawn by [[Yuen Wong Yu]] (余 遠鍠 ''Yu Yuen-wong''), who based its storyline on the television series. This adaptation covers ''Digimon Adventure'' in five volumes, ''Digimon Adventure 02'' in two, ''Digimon Tamers'' in four, and ''Digimon Frontier'' in three. The original stories are heavily abridged, though on rare occasions events play out differently from the anime. The Chinese language version was published by [[Rightman Publishing|Rightman Publishing Ltd.]] in Hong Kong. Yu also wrote ''[[D-Cyber]]''.

Two English versions were also released. The first one was published by [[Chuang Yi]] in Singapore. The second one, which was adapted by [[Lianne Sentar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liannesentar.com/works/ |title=Lianne Sentar's Other Published Works/Works List |publisher=Liannesentar.com |date=2011-10-23 |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released by [[TOKYOPOP]] in [[North America]].&lt;br&gt;The three volumes for ''Digimon Frontier'' have been released by Chuang Yi in English. These have not been released by TOKYOPOP in North America or Europe. However, the Chuang Yi releases of ''Digimon Frontier'' were distributed by [[Madman Entertainment]] in Australia.

===Dark Horse===
{{main|Digimon: Digital Monsters (comics)}}
[[Dark Horse Comics]] published American-style Digimon [[comic book]]s, adapting the first thirteen episodes of the English [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] of ''Digimon Adventure'' in 2001. The story was written by Daniel Horn and Ryan Hill, and illustrated by Daniel Horn and Cara L. Niece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Horn | first = Daniel |author2=Ryan Hill | others = illustrated by Daniel Horn, Cara L.

===Panini===
The Italian publishing company, [[Panini Comics|Panini]], approached Digimon in different ways in different countries. While Germany created their own adaptations of episodes, the United Kingdom (UK) reprinted the Dark Horse titles, then translated some of the German adaptations of ''Adventure 02'' episodes. Eventually the UK comics were given their own original stories, which appeared in both the UK's official ''Digimon Magazine'' and the official UK Fox Kids companion magazine, ''Wickid''. These original stories only roughly followed the [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] of ''Adventure 02''. When the comic switched to the ''Tamers'' series the storylines adhered to continuity more strictly; sometimes it would expand on subject matter not covered by the original Japanese anime (such as [[Mitsuo Yamaki]]'s past) or the English adaptations of the television shows and movies (such as Ryo's story or the movies that remained undubbed until 2005). In a money saving venture, the original stories were later removed from ''Digimon Magazine'', which returned to printing translated German adaptations of ''Tamers'' episodes. Eventually, both magazines were cancelled.
