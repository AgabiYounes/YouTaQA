===As an androgen===
DHEA and other adrenal androgens such as [[androstenedione]], although relatively weak androgens, are responsible for the androgenic effects of [[adrenarche]], such as early [[pubic hair|pubic]] and [[axillary hair]] growth, adult-type [[body odor]], increased oiliness of hair and skin, and mild [[acne]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PescovitzEugster2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book| first1 = Ora Hirsch | last1 = Pescovitz | first2  =Erica A. | last2 = Eugster | name-list-format = vanc | title=Pediatric Endocrinology: Mechanisms, Manifestations, and Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9gvBlktAT6YC&amp;pg=PA362|year=2004|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-4059-3|pages=362–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lifshitz2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Fima Lifshitz|title=Pediatric Endocrinology: Growth, Adrenal, Sexual, Thyroid, Calcium, and Fluid Balance Disorders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CTNBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA289|date=26 December 2006|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-4272-6|pages=289–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Salhan2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first = Sudha | last = Salhan | name-list-format = vanc |title=Textbook of Gynecology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YUYx1neUEIoC&amp;pg=PA94|date=1 August 2011|publisher=JP Medical Ltd|isbn=978-93-5025-369-4|pages=94–}}&lt;/ref&gt; DHEA is potentiated locally via conversion into [[testosterone]] and [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) in the [[skin]] and [[hair follicle]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16293766&quot; /&gt; Women with [[complete androgen insensitivity syndrome]] (CAIS), who have a non-functional [[androgen receptor]] (AR) and are immune to the androgenic effects of DHEA and other androgens, have absent or only sparse/scanty pubic and axillary hair and [[body hair]] in general, demonstrating the role of DHEA and other androgens in body hair development at both adrenarche and [[pubarche]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LaverySanfilippo2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Lavery JP, Sanfilippo JS |title=Pediatric and Adolescent Obstetrics and Gynecology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l9XTBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4612-5064-7|pages=45–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NussbaumMcInnes2015&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Robert L. | last1 = Nussbaum | first2 = Roderick R. | last2 = McInnes  | first3 = Huntington F | last3 = Willard | name-list-format = vanc |title=Thompson &amp; Thompson Genetics in Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4yV1CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102|date=28 April 2015|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-323-39206-8|pages=102–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SetchellHudson2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Marcus E | last1 = Setchell | first2 = C.

==Biological activity==

===Hormonal activity===

====Androgen receptor====
Although it functions as an endogenous [[precursor (biochemistry)|precursor]] to more [[potency (pharmacology)|potent]] androgens such as testosterone and DHT, DHEA has been found to possess some degree of [[androgen]]ic activity in its own right, acting as a low [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] (K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 μM), weak [[partial agonist]] of the [[androgen receptor]] (AR). However, its [[intrinsic activity]] at the receptor is quite weak, and on account of that, due to [[competitive inhibition|competition]] for [[molecular binding|binding]] with [[full agonist]]s like testosterone, it can actually behave more like an antagonist depending on circulating testosterone and [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) levels, and hence, like an [[antiandrogen]]. However, its affinity for the receptor is very low, and for that reason, is unlikely to be of much significance under normal circumstances.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15994348&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen F, Knecht K, Birzin E, Fisher J, Wilkinson H, Mojena M, Moreno CT, Schmidt A, Harada S, Freedman LP, Reszka AA | title = Direct agonist/antagonist functions of dehydroepiandrosterone | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 146 | issue = 11 | pages = 4568–76 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 15994348 | doi = 10.1210/en.2005-0368 | url = https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/146/11/4568/2499713 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16159155&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gao W, Bohl CE, Dalton JT | title = Chemistry and structural biology of androgen receptor | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 105 | issue = 9 | pages = 3352–70 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16159155 | pmc = 2096617 | doi = 10.1021/cr020456u }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Estrogen receptors====
In addition to its affinity for the androgen receptor, DHEA has also been found to bind to and activate the [[Estrogen receptor alpha|ERα]] and [[Estrogen receptor beta|ERβ]] [[estrogen receptor]]s with K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; values of 1.1 μM and 0.5 μM, respectively, and [[EC50|EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] values of &gt;1 μM and 200 nM, respectively. Though it was found to be a partial agonist of the ERα with a maximal efficacy of 30–70%, the concentrations required for this degree of activation make it unlikely that the activity of DHEA at this receptor is physiologically meaningful. Remarkably however, DHEA acts as a full agonist of the ERβ with a maximal response similar to or actually slightly greater than that of [[estradiol]], and its levels in circulation and local tissues in the human body are high enough to activate the receptor to the same degree as that seen with circulating estradiol levels at somewhat higher than their maximal, non-[[ovulation|ovulatory]] concentrations; indeed, when combined with estradiol with both at levels equivalent to those of their physiological concentrations, overall activation of the ERβ was doubled.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16684650&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15994348&quot; /&gt;

====Other nuclear receptors====
DHEA does not bind to or activate the [[progesterone receptor|progesterone]], [[glucocorticoid receptor|glucocorticoid]], or [[mineralocorticoid receptor]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15994348&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21747041&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lindschau C, Kirsch T, Klinge U, Kolkhof P, Peters I, Fiebeler A | title = Dehydroepiandrosterone-induced phosphorylation and translocation of FoxO1 depend on the mineralocorticoid receptor | journal = Hypertension | volume = 58 | issue = 3 | pages = 471–8 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21747041 | doi = 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.171280 | url = http://hyper.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=21747041 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[nuclear receptor]] targets of DHEA besides the androgen and estrogen receptors include the [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor|PPARα]], [[pregnane X receptor|PXR]], and [[constitutive androstane receptor|CAR]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid26908835&quot; /&gt; However, whereas DHEA is a [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] of the PPARα and PXR in rodents, it is not in humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book| first = Ronald Ross | last = Watson | name-list-format = vanc |title=DHEA in Human Health and Aging|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pKXMBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA208|date=22 July 2011|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-3884-6|pages=208–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to direct interactions, DHEA is thought to regulate a handful of other [[protein]]s via indirect, genomic mechanisms, including the [[enzyme]]s [[CYP2C11]] and [[11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1|11β-HSD1]] – the latter of which is essential for the biosynthesis of the [[glucocorticoid]]s such as [[cortisol]] and has been suggested to be involved in the [[antiglucocorticoid]] effects of DHEA – and the [[carrier protein]] [[Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1|IGFBP1]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15994348&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8035785&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kalimi M, Shafagoj Y, Loria R, Padgett D, Regelson W | title = Anti-glucocorticoid effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 131 | issue = 2 | pages = 99–104 | date = February 1994 | pmid = 8035785 | doi = 10.1007/BF00925945 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurosteroid activity===

====Neurotransmitter receptors====
DHEA has been found to directly act on several [[neurotransmitter receptor]]s, including acting as a [[positive allosteric modulator]] of the [[NMDA receptor]], as a [[negative allosteric modulator]] of the [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]], and as an [[agonist]] of the [[sigma-1 receptor|σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;King2012&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid26908835&quot; /&gt;

====Neurotrophin receptors====
In 2011, the surprising discovery was made that DHEA, as well as its sulfate ester, [[dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate|DHEA-S]], directly bind to and activate [[TrkA]] and [[p75NTR|p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt;]], receptors of [[neurotrophin]]s like [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF) and [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] (BDNF), with high affinity.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid26908835&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prough RA, Clark BJ, Klinge CM | title = Novel mechanisms for DHEA action | journal = Journal of Molecular Endocrinology | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = R139–55 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 26908835 | doi = 10.1530/JME-16-0013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21541365&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lazaridis I, Charalampopoulos I, Alexaki VI, Avlonitis N, Pediaditakis I, Efstathopoulos P, Calogeropoulou T, Castanas E, Gravanis A | title = Neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone interacts with nerve growth factor (NGF) receptors, preventing neuronal apoptosis | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = e1001051 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21541365 | pmc = 3082517 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001051 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DHEA was subsequently also found to bind to [[TrkB]] and [[TrkC]] with high affinity, though it only activated TrkC not TrkB.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid26908835&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid25330101&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pediaditakis I, Iliopoulos I, Theologidis I, Delivanoglou N, Margioris AN, Charalampopoulos I, Gravanis A | title = Dehydroepiandrosterone: an ancestral ligand of neurotrophin receptors | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 156 | issue = 1 | pages = 16–23 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25330101 | doi = 10.1210/en.2014-1596 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/894291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DHEA and DHEA-S bound to these receptors with affinities in the low [[nanomolar]] range (around 5&amp;nbsp;nM), which were nonetheless approximately two orders of magnitude lower relative to highly potent [[polypeptide]] neurotrophins like NGF (0.01–0.1&amp;nbsp;nM).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid26908835&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21541365&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid25330101&quot; /&gt; In any case, DHEA and DHEA-S both circulate at requisite concentrations to activate these receptors and were thus identified as important endogenous [[neurotrophic factor]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid26908835&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21541365&quot; /&gt; They have since been labeled &quot;steroidal [[microneurotrophin]]s&quot;, due to their [[small-molecule]] and steroidal nature relative to their polypeptide neurotrophin counterparts.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid23074265&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gravanis A, Calogeropoulou T, Panoutsakopoulou V, Thermos K, Neophytou C, Charalampopoulos I | title = Neurosteroids and microneurotrophins signal through NGF receptors to induce prosurvival signaling in neuronal cells | journal = Science Signaling | volume = 5 | issue = 246 | pages = pt8 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 23074265 | doi = 10.1126/scisignal.2003387 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research has suggested that DHEA and/or DHEA-S may in fact be phylogenetically ancient &quot;ancestral&quot; ligands of the neurotrophin receptors from early on in the [[evolution]] of the [[nervous system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid26908835&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid25330101&quot; /&gt; The findings that DHEA binds to and potently activates [[neurotrophin receptor]]s may explain the positive association between decreased circulating DHEA levels with age and age-related [[neurodegenerative disease]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid26908835&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21541365&quot; /&gt;

====Microtubule-associated protein 2====
Similarly to [[pregnenolone]], its synthetic derivative [[3β-methoxypregnenolone]] (MAP-4343), and [[progesterone]], DHEA has been found to bind to [[microtubule-associated protein 2]] (MAP2), specifically the MAP2C subtype (K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = 27&amp;nbsp;μM).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid26908835&quot;/&gt; However, it is unclear whether DHEA increases binding of MAP2 to [[tubulin]] like pregnenolone.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid26908835&quot; /&gt;

===Biosynthesis===
DHEA is produced in the [[zona reticularis]] of the [[adrenal cortex]] under the control of [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH) and by the [[gonad]]s under the control of [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH).&lt;ref name=&quot;Erkkola2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first = Risto | last = Erkkola | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Menopause|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AU_NI__fpUC&amp;pg=PA5|year=2006|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-51830-9|pages=5–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KleineRossmanith2016&quot;&gt;{{cite book| first1 = Bernhard | last1 = Kleine | first2 = Winfried G. | last2 = Rossmanith | name-list-format = vanc | title=Hormones and the Endocrine System: Textbook of Endocrinology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=boqRCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA264|date=11 February 2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-15060-4|pages=264–265}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also produced in the [[brain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pizzorno2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first = Joseph E. | last = Pizzorno | name-list-format = vanc |title=Textbook of Natural Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6cjgo1IixvEC&amp;pg=PA711|year=2013|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-1-4377-2333-5|pages=711–}}&lt;/ref&gt; DHEA is synthesized from [[cholesterol]] via the [[enzyme]]s [[cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme]] (CYP11A1; P450scc) and [[17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase]] (CYP17A1), with [[pregnenolone]] and [[17α-hydroxypregnenolone]] as [[metabolic intermediate|intermediate]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17945481&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rainey WE, Nakamura Y | title = Regulation of the adrenal androgen biosynthesis | journal = The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | volume = 108 | issue = 3–5 | pages = 281–6 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 17945481 | pmc = 2699571 | doi = 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2007.09.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived mostly from the [[adrenal cortex]], with only about 10% being secreted from the [[gonad]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adler2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first = Robert A. | last = Adler | name-list-format = vanc |title=Osteoporosis: Pathophysiology and Clinical Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eShjlIWB7gEC&amp;pg=PA387|date=14 December 2009|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-934115-19-0|pages=387–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SchillComhaire2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first1=  Wolf-Bernhard | last1 = Schill | first2 = Frank H. | last2 = Comhaire | first3 = Timothy B. | last3 = Hargreave | name-list-format = vanc |title=Andrology for the Clinician|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Ts_AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA243|date=26 August 2006|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-33713-3|pages=243–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LinosHeerden2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Dimitrios A. | last1 = Linos | first2 = Jon A. | last2 = van Heerden | name-list-format = vanc |title=Adrenal Glands: Diagnostic Aspects and Surgical Therapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r8OLj1LLw3IC&amp;pg=PA161|date=5 December 2005|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-26861-1|pages=161–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 50 to 70% of circulating DHEA originates from desulfation of DHEA-S in peripheral tissues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adler2009&quot; /&gt; DHEA-S itself originates almost exclusively from the adrenal cortex, with 95 to 100% being secreted from the adrenal cortex in women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erkkola2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LinosHeerden2005&quot; /&gt;

====Increasing endogenous production====
Regular [[exercise]] is known to increase DHEA production in the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Filaire E, Duché P, Lac G | title = Effects of amount of training on the saliva concentrations of cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone and on the dehydroepiandrosterone: cortisol concentration ratio in women over 16 weeks of training | journal = European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology | volume = 78 | issue = 5 | pages = 466–71 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 9809849 | doi = 10.1007/s004210050447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Copeland JL, Consitt LA, Tremblay MS | title = Hormonal responses to endurance and resistance exercise in females aged 19-69 years | journal = The Journals of Gerontology.

[[Catalpol]] and a combination of acetyl-carnitine and propionyl-carnitine on 1:1 ratio also improves endogenous DHEA production and release due to direct cholinergic stimulation of CRH release and an increase of IGF-1 expression respectively.

===Distribution===
In the [[circulatory system|circulation]], DHEA is mainly bound to [[human serum albumin|albumin]], with a small amount bound to [[sex hormone-binding globulin]] (SHBG).&lt;ref name=&quot;CoatesPaul2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Salvatore | last1 = Alesci | first2 = Irini | last2 = Manoli | first3 = Marc R. | last3 = Blackman | editor-first1 = Paul M. | editor-last1 = Coates | editor-first2 = Marc R. | editor-last2 = Blackman | editor-first3 =  Gordon M. | editor-last3 = Cragg | editor-first4 = Mark | editor-last4 = Levine | editor-first5 = Joel | editor-last5 = Moss | editor-first6 = Jeffry D. | editor-last6 = White | name-list-format = vanc |title= Encyclopedia of Dietary Supplements (Print) | chapter = Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Sfmc-fRCj10C&amp;pg=PA169|date=29 December 2004|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8247-5504-1|pages=169–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Becker2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first = Kenneth L. | last = Becker | name-list-format = vanc |title=Principles and Practice of Endocrinology and Metabolism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FVfzRvaucq8C&amp;pg=PA712|year=2001|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-1750-2|pages=712–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small remainder of DHEA not associated with albumin or SHBG is unbound and free in the circulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;CoatesPaul2004&quot; /&gt;

DHEA easily crosses the [[blood–brain barrier]] into the [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pizzorno2013&quot; /&gt;

===Metabolism===
DHEA is transformed into DHEA-S by [[sulfation]] at the C3β position via the [[sulfotransferase]] [[enzyme]]s [[SULT2A1]] and to a lesser extent [[SULT1E1]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17945481&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid26213785&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mueller JW, Gilligan LC, Idkowiak J, Arlt W, Foster PA | title = The Regulation of Steroid Action by Sulfation and Desulfation | journal = Endocr Rev | volume = 36 | issue = 5 | pages = 526–63 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26213785 | pmc = 4591525 | doi = 10.1210/er.2015-1036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lash2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first = Lawrence H | last = Lash | name-list-format = vanc |title=Drug Metabolism and Transport: Molecular Methods and Mechanisms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-sK8NM_9UVsC&amp;pg=PA353|year=2005|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-59259-832-8|pages=353–}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs naturally in the adrenal cortex and during [[first-pass metabolism]] in the [[liver]] and [[intestines]] when [[exogenous]] DHEA is administered orally.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid26213785&quot; /&gt; Levels of DHEA-S in circulation are approximately 250 to 300 times those of DHEA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weizman2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first = Abraham | last = Weizman | name-list-format = vanc |title=Neuroactive Steroids in Brain Function, Behavior and Neuropsychiatric Disorders: Novel Strategies for Research and Treatment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uABKkFdPjhkC&amp;pg=PA229|date=1 February 2008|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-6854-6|pages=229–}}&lt;/ref&gt; DHEA-S in turn can be converted back into DHEA in peripheral tissues via [[steroid sulfatase]] (STS).&lt;ref name=&quot;Morfin2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first = Robert | last = Morfin | name-list-format = vanc |title=DHEA and the Brain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uZp62ctguF0C&amp;pg=PA28|date=2 September 2003|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-203-30121-0|pages=28–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Karasek2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first = Michał | last = Karasek | name-list-format = vanc |title=Aging and Age-related Diseases: The Basics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A_PN9oxKpP0C&amp;pg=PA66|year=2006|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=978-1-59454-426-2|pages=66–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pregnancy====
During [[pregnancy]], DHEA-S is [[metabolism|metabolized]] into the sulfates of [[16α-hydroxy-DHEA]] and [[15α-hydroxy-DHEA]] in the [[fetus|fetal]] [[liver]] as [[metabolic intermediate|intermediate]]s in the production of the estrogens [[estriol]] and [[estetrol]], respectively.

===Levels===

===Measurement===
As almost all DHEA is derived from the adrenal glands, blood measurements of DHEA-S/DHEA are useful to detect excess adrenal activity as seen in adrenal cancer or hyperplasia, including certain forms of [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]]. Women with [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] tend to have elevated levels of DHEA-S.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14737959&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Banaszewska B, Spaczyński RZ, Pelesz M, Pawelczyk L | title = Incidence of elevated LH/FSH ratio in polycystic ovary syndrome women with normo- and hyperinsulinemia | journal = Roczniki Akademii Medycznej W Bialymstoku | volume = 48 | pages = 131–4 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14737959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DHEA, also known as androst-5-en-3β-ol-17-one, is a [[natural product|naturally occurring]] [[androstane]] [[steroid]] and a [[17-ketosteroid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Elks2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Elks J |title=The Dictionary of Drugs: Chemical Data: Chemical Data, Structures and Bibliographies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0vXTBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA641|date=14 November 2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4757-2085-3|pages=641–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related structurally to [[androstenediol]] (androst-5-ene-3β,17β-diol), [[androstenedione]] (androst-4-ene-3,17-dione), and [[testosterone]] (androst-4-en-17β-ol-3-one).&lt;ref name=&quot;Elks2014&quot; /&gt; DHEA is the 5-[[dehydrogenation|dehydro]] [[structural analog|analogue]] of [[epiandrosterone]] (5α-androstan-3β-ol-17-one) and is also known as 5-dehydroepiandrosterone or as δ&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-epiandrosterone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elks2014&quot; /&gt;

===Isomers===
The term &quot;dehydroepiandrosterone&quot; is ambiguous chemically because it does not include the specific positions within epiandrosterone at which hydrogen atoms are missing. DHEA itself is 5,6-didehydroepiandrosterone or 5-dehydroepiandrosterone. A number of naturally occurring isomers also exist and may have similar activities. Some isomers of DHEA are [[1-dehydroepiandrosterone]] (1-androsterone) and [[4-dehydroepiandrosterone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JosephyRadt2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edith Josephy|author2=F. Radt|title=Elsevier's Encyclopaedia of Organic Chemistry: Series III: Carboisocyclic Condensed Compounds|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HqHzCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2608|date=1 December 2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-662-25863-7|pages=2608–}}&lt;/ref&gt; These isomers are also technically &quot;DHEA&quot;, since they are dehydroepiandrosterones in which hydrogens are removed from the [[epiandrosterone]] skeleton.

[[Dehydroandrosterone]] (DHA) is the 3α-[[epimer]] of DHEA and is also an endogenous androgen.
