'''''Datura''''' is a [[genus]] of nine species of poisonous [[Vespertine (biology)|Vespertine]] [[flowering plant]]s belonging to the family [[Solanaceae]]. They are commonly known as daturas, but also known as '''devil's trumpets'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''Datura metel''|url = https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/all/datura-metel/|website = plants.ces.ncsu.edu|access-date = 2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; (not to be confused with angel's trumpets, which are contained in the closely related genus ''[[Brugmansia]]''). Other English common names include '''moonflower''', '''jimsonweed''', '''devil's weed''', '''hell's bells''' and '''thorn-apple'''. The Mexican common names '''Toloache''' and '''Tolguacha''' derive from the [[Nahuatl]] name '''Tolohuaxihuitl''' meaning &quot;the plant with the nodding head&quot; (in reference to the nodding seed capsules of ''Datura'' species belonging to section ''Dutra'' of the genus). ''Datura'' species are native to dry, temperate, and subtropical regions of the Americas and are distributed mostly in Mexico, which is considered the center of its origin. Although ''Datura ferox'' occurs in Argentina, ''Datura metel'' in Asia, and ''Datura leichardthii'' in Australia, these species were probably introduced from Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Karinho-Betancourt |first1=Eunice |last2=Agrawal |first2=Anurag A. |last3=Halitschke |first3=Rayko |last4=Nunez-Farf ~ an |first4=Juan |title=Phylogenetic correlations among chemical and physical plant defenses change with ontogeny |journal=New Phytologist |date=2015 |volume=206 |issue=2 |pages=796–806 |doi=10.1111/nph.13300 |pmid=25652325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its distribution within the [[Americas]] and [[North Africa]], however, is most likely restricted to the United States, Mexico and Southern Canada in North America, and [[Tunisia]] in Africa where the highest species diversity occurs.

All species of ''Datura'' are poisonous, especially their seeds and flowers which can cause [[respiratory depression]], [[arrhythmias]], [[hallucinations]], [[psychosis]], as well as death if taken internally.

A group of [[South America]]n species formerly placed in the genus ''Datura'' are now placed in the distinct genus ''[[Brugmansia]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor = Hawkes, J. G. |author1=Lester, R. N. |author2=Nee, M. |author3=Estrada, N. | title = Solanaceae III – Taxonomy, Chemistry, Evolution (Proceedings of Third International Conference on Solanaceae) | publisher = Royal Botanic Gardens | year = 1991 | location = Kew | pages = 197–210 | isbn = 0-947643-31-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Brugmansia'' differs from ''Datura'' in that it is woody, making [[shrub]]s or small [[tree]]s, and it has pendulous flowers, rather than erect ones). Other related taxa include 
''[[Hyoscyamus niger]]'', ''[[Atropa belladonna]]'', ''[[Mandragora officinarum]]'', [[Physalis]], and many more.

==Etymology==
The name ''Datura'' is taken from [[Sanskrit]] धतूरा ''{{transl|hi|dhatūra}}'' 'thorn-apple',&lt;ref&gt;American Heritage Dictionary: ''datura''&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately from [[Sanskrit]] धत्तूर ''{{IAST|dhattūra}}'' 'white thorn-apple' (referring to ''[[Datura metel]]'' of Asia).&lt;ref name=&quot;MWSD&quot;&gt;{{MWSD}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] text ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]'' different species of ''Datura'' are also referred to as ''{{IAST|kanaka}}'' and ''{{IAST|unmatta}}''.&lt;ref name=&quot;MWSD&quot;/&gt; Dhatura is offered to [[Shiva]] in [[Hinduism]]. Record of this name in English dates back to 1662.&lt;ref&gt;the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' or [[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] refers to one type in ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' as ''apple-Peru''. In Mexico, its common name is ''toloache''.

==Description==
''Datura'' species are [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]], leafy [[annual plant|annuals]] and short-lived [[perennial plant|perennials]] which can reach up to 2&amp;nbsp;m in height. The [[leaf|leaves]] are alternate, 10–20&amp;nbsp;cm long and 5–18&amp;nbsp;cm broad, with a lobed or toothed margin. The [[flower]]s are erect or spreading (not pendulous like those of ''Brugmansia''), trumpet-shaped, 5–20&amp;nbsp;cm long and 4–12&amp;nbsp;cm broad at the mouth; colors vary from white to yellow, pink, and pale purple. The [[fruit]] is a spiny [[capsule (fruit)|capsule]] 4–10&amp;nbsp;cm long and 2–6&amp;nbsp;cm broad, splitting open when ripe to release the numerous [[seed]]s. The seeds disperse freely over pastures, fields and even wasteland locations.

''Datura'' belongs to the classic &quot;witches' weeds&quot;, along with [[deadly nightshade]], [[henbane]], and [[Mandragora officinarum|mandrake]]. All parts of the plants are toxic, and datura has a long history of use for causing delirious states and death. It was well known as an essential ingredient of [[potions]] and witches' brews, most notably ''[[Datura stramonium]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Preissel&quot;/&gt;

In India it has been referred to as &quot;poisonous&quot; and as an [[aphrodisiac]]. In little measures it was used in [[Ayurveda]] as a medicine from the ancient times. It is used in rituals and prayers to [[Shiva]]. It is also used in [[Ganesh Chaturthi]].

The [[Caterpillar|larvae]] of some [[Lepidoptera]] ([[butterfly]] and [[moth]]) species, including ''[[Hypercompe indecisa]]'', eat some ''Datura'' species.

==Species and cultivars==
[[File:Datura FR 2012.jpg|thumb|''Datura metel'']]
It is difficult to classify ''Datura'' as to its species, and it often happens that the descriptions of new species are accepted prematurely. Later, these &quot;new species&quot; are found to be simply varieties that have evolved due to conditions at a specific location. They usually disappear in a few years. Contributing to the confusion is the fact that various species, such as ''D. wrightii'' and ''D. inoxia'', are very similar in appearance, and the variation within a species can be extreme. For example, ''Datura'' species can change size of plant, leaf, and flowers, all depending on location. The same species, when growing in a half-shady, damp location can develop into a flowering bush half as tall as an adult human of average height, but when growing in a very dry location, will only grow into a thin plant not much more than ankle-high, with tiny flowers and a few miniature leaves.&lt;ref name='Preissel'&gt;{{cite book |author1=Preissel, U. |author2=Preissel, H.-G. | title = ''Brugmansia'' and ''Datura'': Angel's Trumpets and Thorn Apples | publisher = Firefly Books | year = 2002 | location = Buffalo, NY | pages = 106–129 |  isbn = 1-55209-598-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

American Brugmansia and Datura Society, Inc. (ABADS) is designated in the 2004 edition of the [[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]] as the official [[International Cultivar Registration Authority]] for ''Datura''. This role was delegated to ABADS by the [[International Society for Horticultural Science]] in 2002.

==Cultivation==
[[File:Datura fruit.jpg|thumb|200px|Fruit]]
[[File:Datura innoxia fruit split open.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''D. inoxia'' with ripe, split-open fruit]]
''Datura'' species are usually sown annually from the seed produced in the spiny [[capsule (fruit)|capsules]], but, with care, the tuberous-rooted perennial species may be overwintered. Most species are suited to being planted outside or in containers. As a rule, they need warm, sunny places and soil that will keep their roots dry. When grown outdoors in good locations, the plants tend to reseed themselves and may become invasive. In containers, they should have porous, aerated potting soil with adequate drainage. The plants are susceptible to fungi in the root area, so anaerobic organic enrichment such as anaerobically composted organic matter or manure, should be avoided.&lt;ref name=&quot;Preissel&quot;/&gt;

==Toxicity==
All ''Datura'' plants contain [[tropane alkaloids]] such as [[scopolamine]] and [[atropine]], primarily in their seeds and flowers as well as the roots of certain species such as ''[[Datura wrightii|D. wrightii]]''. Because of the presence of these substances, ''Datura'' has been used for centuries in some cultures as a [[poison]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Preissel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Adams, J. D. Jr. | author2 = Garcia, C. | title = Spirit, Mind and Body in Chumash Healing | journal = Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine | year = 2005 | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 459–463 | doi = 10.1093/ecam/neh130 | pmid = 16322802 | pmc = 1297503 | url = http://ecam.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/2/4/459 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012085820/http://ecam.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/2/4/459 | archivedate = 12 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A given plant's toxicity depends on its age, where it is growing, and the local weather conditions. These variations make ''Datura'' exceptionally hazardous as a drug.

In traditional cultures, a great deal of experience with and detailed knowledge of ''Datura'' was critical to minimize harm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Preissel&quot;/&gt; Many tragic incidents result from modern users ingesting ''Datura''. For example, in the 1990s and 2000s, the United States media contained stories of [[adolescent]]s and young adults dying or becoming seriously ill from intentionally ingesting ''Datura''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5233a2.htm |author1=Goetz, R. |author2=Siegel, E. |author3=Scaglione, J. |author4=Belson, M. |author5=Patel, M. | title = Suspected Moonflower Intoxication – Ohio, 2002 | journal = MMWR.

In some parts of [[Europe]] and [[India]], ''Datura'' has been a popular [[poison]] for [[suicide]] and [[murder]]. From 1950 to 1965, the State Chemical Laboratories in [[Agra]], India, investigated 2,778 deaths caused by ingesting ''Datura.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Preissel&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SS1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last=Andrews|first=Dale |title=Daturas| url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2012/02/daturas.html |work=Crime Poisons| publisher=SleuthSayers |accessdate=4 March 2013| location=Washington |date=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thuggee|Thugs]] ''(practicers of thuggee)'' were devotees of an Indian religious cult made up of robbers and assassins who strangled and/or poisoned their victims in [[ritual]]s devoted to the Hindu goddess [[Kali]]. They were known to employ ''Datura'' in many such poisonings, using it also to induce drowsiness or stupefaction, making strangulation easier.&lt;ref name=&quot;mikedash&quot;&gt;[[Mike Dash|Dash, Mike]] ''Thug: the true story of India's murderous cult'' {{ISBN|1-86207-604-9}}, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

''Datura'' toxins may be ingested accidentally by consumption of [[honey]] produced by several wasp species, including ''[[Brachygastra lecheguana]]'', during the ''Datura'' blooming season. It appears that these semi-domesticated [[honey wasp]]s collect ''Datura'' nectar for honey production which can lead to poisoning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bequaert&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bequaert, J.Q. |year=1932|title=The Nearctic social wasps of the subfamily polybiinae (Hymenoptera; Vespidae)|journal= Entomologica Americana|volume= 13|issue=3|pages=87–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported accidental poisoning resulting in hospitalization for a family of six who inadvertently ingested ''Datura'' used as an ingredient in stew.&lt;ref name='CDCStew'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Jimsonweed Poisoning Associated with a Homemade Stew – Maryland, 2008 | journal = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report | date = 2010-02-05 | first = W. | last = Bontoyan | volume = 59 | issue = 4 | pages = 102–103 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm5904.pdf | accessdate = 2010-02-11 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some places, it is prohibited to buy, sell, or cultivate ''Datura'' plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Preissel&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SS1&quot; /&gt;

===Effects of ingestion===
Due to the potent combination of [[anticholinergic]] substances it contains, ''Datura'' [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]] typically produces effects similar to that of an [[anticholinergic]] [[delirium]] (usually involving a complete inability to differentiate [[reality]] from [[fantasy]]); [[hyperthermia]]; [[tachycardia]]; bizarre, and possibly violent behavior; and severe [[mydriasis]] (dilated pupils) with resultant painful [[photophobia]] that can last several days. Muscle stiffness, [[urinary retention]], temporary paralysis, and [[confusion]] is often reported and pronounced [[amnesia]] is another commonly reported effect.&lt;ref name='Freye'&gt;{{cite book | last = Freye | first = E. | title = Pharmacology and Abuse of Cocaine, Amphetamines, Ecstasy and Related Designer Drugs | chapter = Toxicity of ''Datura stramonium'' | publisher = Springer | year = 2010 | location = Netherlands | pages = 217–218 | isbn = 978-90-481-2447-3 | doi = 10.1007/978-90-481-2448-0_34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychoactive use ===
Datura is considered a [[deliriant]]. [[Christian Rätsch]] has said &quot;A mild dosage produces medicinal and healing effects, a moderate dosage produces aphrodisiac effects, and high dosages are used for shamanic purposes&quot;. [[Wade Davis (anthropologist)]], an [[ethnobotanist]], lists it as a possible ingredient of [[zombie potion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Dictionary of Hallucations |location=Oradell, NJ. |publisher=Springer |year=2010|pages=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Pharmacology and Abuse of Cocaine, Amphetamines, Ecstasy and Related Designer Drugs'', Freye asserts:
Few substances have received as many severely negative recreational experience reports as has ''Datura''. The overwhelming majority of those who describe their use of ''Datura'' find their experiences extremely unpleasant both mentally and often physically dangerous.&lt;ref name = &quot;Freye&quot;/&gt;  However, anthropologists have found that indigenous groups, with a great deal of experience with and detailed knowledge of ''Datura'', have been known to use ''Datura'' spiritually (including the [[Navajo]] and especially the [[Havasupai]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3736/jintegrmed2013016|pmid=23506688|title=A review on the pharmacological and toxicological aspects of ''Datura stramonium'' L|journal=Journal of Integrative Medicine|volume=11|issue=2|pages=73–9|year=2013|last1=Gaire|first1=Bhakta Prasad|last2=Subedi|first2=Lalita}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Stairways to Heaven: Drugs in American Religious History| first=Robert C| last=Fuller| year=2000| page=[https://archive.org/details/stairwaystoheave00full/page/32 32]| isbn=0813366127| publisher=Basic Books| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/stairwaystoheave00full/page/32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, knowledge of ''Datura''{{'s}} properties is necessary to facilitate a healthy experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Preissel&quot;/&gt;
The [[Southern Paiute]] believe ''Datura'' can help locate missing objects.&lt;ref&gt;Southern Paiute Shamanism by Isabel T. Kelly (1939) http://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/anthpubs/ucb/text/ucar002-005.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Mexico, ''Datura'' also played an important role in the [[Aztec religion|religion of the Aztecs]] and the practices of their [[medicine men]] and [[necromancer]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Economic Botanist&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Safford |first1=William |title=Narcotic Plants and Stimulants of the Ancient Americans |date=1916 |publisher=Economic Botanist |location=United States |pages=405–406 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BJXdX3IEtycC&amp;pg=PA405&amp;lpg=PA405&amp;dq=datura+necromancy#v=onepage&amp;q=datura%20necromancy&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernardino de Sahagún]], in around 1569, called attention to ''Datura'' in the following words: 
“It is administered in potions in order to cause harm to those who are objects of hatred. Those who eat it have visions of fearful things. Magicians or those who wish to harm someone administer it in food or drink. This herb is medicinal and its seed is used as a remedy for gout, ground up and applied to the part affected.” &lt;ref name=&quot;Economic Botanist&quot;/&gt;

===Treatment===
Due to their agitated behavior and confused mental state, victims of ''Datura'' poisoning are typically hospitalized. [[Gastric lavage]] and the administration of [[activated charcoal]] can be used to reduce the stomach's absorption of the ingested material and the drug [[physostigmine]] is used to reverse the effect of the poisons. [[Benzodiazepines]] can be given to curb the patient's agitation, and supportive care with oxygen, hydration, and symptomatic treatment is often provided. Observation of the patient is indicated until the symptoms resolve, usually from 24–36 hours after ingestion of the ''Datura''.&lt;ref name=&quot;SS1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bliss | first = M. | title = Datura Plant Poisoning | journal = Clinical Toxicology Review | year = 2001 | volume = 23 | issue = 6 | url = http://www.maripoisoncenter.com/assets/images/pdfs/ctrs/CTR%20Datura%20Plant%20Poisoning.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
