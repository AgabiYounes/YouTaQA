==Career==
Leary began working as a comedian at the Boston underground club Play It Again Sam's. However, his first real gig was at the Rascals Comedy Club as part of the TV show ''The Rascals Comedy Hour'', on October 18, 1990. He wrote and appeared on a local comedy series, ''[[The Late, Late Show]]'', hosted by his friend [[Lenny Clarke]] and written by [[Martin Olson]]. Leary and Clarke both spoke about their early affiliations and influences in the Boston comedy scene in the documentary film ''[[When Standup Stood Out]]'' (2006). During Leary's time as a Boston-area stand-up comic, he developed his stage persona.

Leary appeared in sketches on the [[MTV]] game show ''[[Remote Control (game show)|Remote Control]]'', playing characters such as [[Keith Richards]], co-host [[Colin Quinn]]'s brother and artist [[Andy Warhol]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}} He earned fame when he ranted about [[R.E.M.]] in an early 1990s MTV sketch. Several other commercials for MTV quickly followed, in which Leary would rant at high speeds about a variety of topics, playing off the then-popular and growing [[Alternative rock|alternative scene]]. One of these rants served as an introduction to the video for &quot;Shamrocks and Shenanigans (Boom Shalock Lock Boom)&quot; by [[House of Pain]]. Leary released two [[album (Music)|records]] of his [[stand-up comedy]]: ''[[No Cure for Cancer]]'' (1993) and ''[[Lock 'n Load (album)|Lock 'n Load]]'' (1997). In late 2004, he released the [[extended play|EP]] ''[[Merry F %$in' Christmas|Merry F#%$in' Christmas]]'', which included a mix of new music, previously unreleased recordings and some tracks from ''Lock 'n Load''. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In 1993, Leary's [[sarcasm|sardonic]] song about the stereotypical American male, &quot;[[Asshole (song)|Asshole]]&quot;, achieved much notoriety. However, this bit was allegedly stolen from [[Louis C.K.]], as was discussed by C.K. during an interview on the [[Opie and Anthony Show]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhxqnCyoGo YouTube: Louis CK on 'Asshole'] (On a later episode of the same show, Leary challenged Louis CK's assertion by claiming that he (Leary) co-wrote the song with Chris Phillips.)&lt;/ref&gt; The song was voted No. 1 in an [[Australia]]n youth radio poll&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hottest100_08/history/1993.htm|title=TripleJ Hottest 100-1993|publisher=ABC Radio|location=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was used in [[Holsten Brewery|Holsten Pils]] ads in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], with Leary's participation, and with adapted lyrics criticizing a drunk driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkz12OslGhU|title=Denis Leary: 'He's An Asshole' – Anti-Drink Driving Campaign|via=YouTube|date=January 18, 2008|accessdate=August 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single was a minor hit there, peaking at No. 58 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in January 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Roberts|year=2006|title=[[British Hit Singles &amp; Albums]]|edition=19th|publisher=Guinness World Records Ltd|location=London, UK|isbn=1-904994-10-5|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Leary was asked by [[Boston Bruins]] legend [[Cam Neely]] to help orchestrate a Boston-based comedy benefit show for Neely's cancer charity; this became [[Comics Come Home]], which Leary has hosted annually ever since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/inside_track/2018/08/sidetrack_comics_come_home_lineup_announced SideTrack: Comics Come Home lineup announced].

He had a role in [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'' that was eventually cut. He held the lead role in two television series, ''[[The Job (2001 TV series)|The Job]]'' and ''[[Rescue Me (U.S. TV series)|Rescue Me]]'', and he co-created the latter, in which he played [[Tommy Gavin]], a [[New York City]] firefighter dealing with [[alcoholism]], family dysfunction and other issues in post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] New York City.

Leary received [[Emmy Award]] nominations in 2006 and 2007 for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for ''Rescue Me'', and in 2008 for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for the HBO movie ''[[Recount (film)|Recount]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/denis-leary|title=Denis Leary|publisher=Emmys.com|accessdate=December 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leary was offered the role of Dignam in ''[[The Departed]]'' (2006) but turned it down because of scheduling conflicts with ''Rescue Me''. He provided voices for characters in animated films, such as a fire-breathing dragon named Flame in the series ''The Agents'', a pugnacious ladybug named [[List of A Bug's Life characters#Francis|Francis]] in ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' and a prehistoric saber-toothed tiger named [[List of Ice Age characters#Diego|Diego]] in the ''[[Ice Age (franchise)|Ice Age]]'' film series.

On December 3, 1999, six [[firefighter]]s from Leary's hometown of Worcester were killed in the [[Worcester Cold Storage Warehouse fire]]. Among the dead were Leary's cousin Jerry Lucey and his close childhood friend, Lt. Tommy Spencer.&lt;ref name=&quot;smokeinterview&quot;/&gt; In response, the comedian founded the [[Leary Firefighters Foundation]]. Since its creation in the year 2000, the foundation has distributed over $2.5&amp;nbsp;million ([[United States dollar|USD]]) to fire departments in the Worcester, Boston and New York City areas for equipment, training materials, new vehicles and new facilities. Leary won $125,000 for the foundation on the game show ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (US game show)#Special editions|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]''. He had close ties with [[WBZU|WAAF]], which in 2000 released the station album ''Survive This!''. Part of the proceeds from this album were donated to the Leary Firefighters Foundation. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

A separate fund run by Leary's foundation, the Fund for New York's Bravest, has distributed over $2&amp;nbsp;million to the families of the 343 firemen killed in the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, in addition to providing funding for necessities such as a new mobile command center, [[First responder|first-responder]] training, and a high-rise simulator for the [[New York City Fire Department]]'s training campus. As the foundation's president, Leary has been active in all of the fundraising. In the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in New Orleans, Leary donated over a dozen boats to the [[New Orleans Fire Department]] to aid in rescue efforts in future disasters. The foundation also rebuilt entire NOLA firehouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rebirth: The New Orleans Firehouse Restoration Project |url=https://www.learyfirefighters.org/news/videos/rebirth-the-new-orleans-firehouse-restoration-project/ |website=The Leary Firefighters Foundation |accessdate=June 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Plagiarism===
For many years, Leary had been friends with fellow comedian [[Bill Hicks]]. But when Leary's comedy album ''No Cure for Cancer'' was released, Leary was accused of stealing Hicks' act and material, and the friendship ended abruptly.&lt;ref name=&quot;evolutionBook&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Bill Hicks: Agent of Evolution|last1=Booth|first1=Kevin|last2=Bertin|first2=Michael|year=2005|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=0-00-719829-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1993, the ''Austin Comedy News'' remarked on the similarities of Leary's performance: &quot;Watching Leary is like seeing Hicks from two years ago. He [[Tobacco smoking|smokes]] with the same mannerisms. (Hicks recently quit.) He sports the same attitude, the same clothes. He touches on almost all of the same themes. Leary even invokes [[Jim Fixx]].&quot; When asked about this, Hicks told the magazine, &quot;I have a scoop for you. I stole his [Leary's] act. I camouflaged it with punchlines, and to really throw people off, I did it before he did&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gavinsblog.com/probill.htm|title=Profile: Bill Hicks|first=Doug|last=Stern|date=April 1993|work=Austin Comedy News|accessdate=October 22, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019105912/http://www.gavinsblog.com/probill.htm|archive-date=October 19, 2006|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole Hicks' material, comedic persona and attitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;evolutionBook&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.joerogan.net/archives/92|title=Carlos Mencia is a weak minded joke thief|first=Joe|last=Rogan|publisher=JoeRogan.net|date=September 27, 2005|accessdate=December 21, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607224107/http://blog.joerogan.net/archives/92|archivedate=June 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hicksfaq&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320081614/http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html|title=Dark Times: Bill Hicks: Frequently Asked Questions|first=Tim|last=McIntire|year=1998|publisher=BillHicks.com|archivedate=March 20, 2006|accessdate=October 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; One similar routine was about the so-called [[Judas Priest]] &quot;suicide trial,&quot; during which Hicks says, &quot;I don't think we lost a cancer cure.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Hicks, Bill|year=1989|title=Sane Man|medium=Stand-up comedy|location=USA|publisher=Roadrunner Records}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Leary's 2003 [[Comedy Central Roast]], comedian Lenny Clarke, a friend of Leary's, said there was a carton of [[cigarette]]s backstage from Bill Hicks with the message, &quot;Wish I had gotten these to you sooner.&quot; This joke was cut from the final broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ziano III|first=Nick A.|title=Roasting a comic, they turn up the flames, gently|work=Boston Globe|url=http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/222/living/Roasting_a_comic_they_turn_up_the_flames_gently+.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030811054820/http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/222/living/Roasting_a_comic_they_turn_up_the_flames_gently+.shtml|archivedate=August 11, 2003|date=August 10, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feud is also mentioned in [[Cynthia True]]'s biography ''American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story'':
{{quote|text=Leary was in [[Montreal]] to host the &quot;Nasty Show,&quot; at [[Club Soda (Montreal)|Club Soda]], and Colleen was coordinating the talent so she was standing backstage when she heard Leary doing material that sounded incredibly similar to old Hicks riffs, including his perennial Jim Fixx joke: (&quot;[[Keith Richards]] outlived Jim Fixx, the runner and health nut dude. The plot thickens.&quot;). When Leary came offstage, Colleen, more stunned than angry, said, &quot;Hey, you know that's Bill Hicks' material! Do you know that's his material?&quot; Leary stood there, stared at her without saying a word and briskly left the dressing room.&lt;ref name=&quot;oouuos&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story|first=Cynthia|last=True|year=2002|publisher=Harper Paperbacks|isbn=0-380-80377-1|url=https://archive.org/details/americanscreambi00true}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

According to the book, True said that upon hearing a tape of Leary's album ''No Cure for Cancer'', &quot;Bill was furious. All these years, aside from the occasional jibe, he had pretty much shrugged off Leary's lifting. Comedians borrowed, stole stuff and even bought bits from one another. [[Milton Berle]] and [[Robin Williams]] were famous for it. This was different. Leary had, practically line for line, taken huge chunks of Bill's act and ''recorded'' it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;oouuos&quot;/&gt;

In a 2008 appearance on ''The Opie and Anthony Show'', comedian Louis CK claimed that Leary stole his &quot;I'm an asshole&quot; routine, which was then expanded upon and turned into a hit song by Leary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhxqnCyoGo|title=Denis Leary ripped off &quot;I'm An Asshole&quot; from Louis CK|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a later episode of the same show, Leary challenged this assertion by claiming to have co-written the song with [[Chris Phillips (voice actor)|Chris Phillips]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g81LCwrU-7k|title=Denis Leary responds to Louis CK claiming he stole &quot;I'm An Asshole&quot; from him|work=Opie &amp; Anthony Show|date=November 18, 2008|accessdate=December 1, 2012|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autism===
In his 2008 book ''[[Why We Suck|Why We Suck: A Feel Good Guide to Staying Fat, Loud, Lazy and Stupid]]'', Leary wrote:{{quote|There is a huge boom in [[Autism spectrum disorder|autism]] right now because inattentive mothers and competitive dads want an explanation for why their dumb-ass kids can't compete academically, so they throw money into the happy laps of [[Psychiatrist|shrinks]]... to get back diagnoses that help explain away the deficiencies of their junior morons. I don't [care] what these crackerjack whack jobs tell you – your kid is not autistic. He's just stupid. Or lazy. Or both.}}

In response to the controversy, Leary stated that the quote was taken out of context and that in that paragraph he had been talking about the trend of unwarranted over-diagnosis of autism, which he attributed to American parents seeking an excuse for behavioral problems and under-performance. Later, he apologized to parents with autistic children whom he had offended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/news/denis-leary-says-autism-Criticism-taken-out-of-context|title=Denis Leary Says Autism Criticism Taken 'Out of Context'|date=October 16, 2008|work=Us Weekly|accessdate=May 22, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018134220/http://www.usmagazine.com/news/denis-leary-says-autism-Criticism-taken-out-of-context|archivedate=October 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bostonherald.com/news/regional/view/2008_10_28_Denis_Leary_Tells_Parents:_I_m_Sorry:_%E2%80%98Raising_Children_With_Autism__Deserves_Admiration__Comic_Says/srvc=home&amp;position=0|title=Denis Leary Tells Parents: I'm Sorry|first=Laurel J.|last=Sweet|date=October 28, 2008|work=Boston Herald|accessdate=May 22, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203105558/http://news.bostonherald.com/news/regional/view/2008_10_28_Denis_Leary_Tells_Parents%3A_I_m_Sorry%3A_%E2%80%98Raising_Children_With_Autism__Deserves_Admiration__Comic_Says/srvc%3Dhome%26position%3D0|archivedate=February 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
