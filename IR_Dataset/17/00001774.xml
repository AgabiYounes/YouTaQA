'''Apollo 9''' was a March 1969 [[human spaceflight]], the third in [[NASA]]'s [[Apollo program]]. Flown in [[low Earth orbit]], it was the second crewed Apollo mission that the United States launched via a [[Saturn V]] rocket, and was the first flight of the full Apollo spacecraft: the [[command and service module]] (CSM) with the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM). The mission was flown to [[flight qualify|qualify]] the LM for lunar orbit operations in preparation for the first Moon landing by demonstrating its [[descent propulsion system|descent]] and [[ascent propulsion system]]s, showing that its crew could fly it independently, then [[space rendezvous|rendezvous]] and [[docking and berthing of spacecraft|dock]] with the CSM again, as would be required for [[Apollo 11|the first crewed lunar landing]]. Other objectives of the flight included firing the LM descent engine to propel the spacecraft stack as a backup mode (as would be required on the [[Apollo 13]] mission), and use of the [[Portable Life Support System]] backpack outside of the LM cabin.

The three-person crew consisted of Commander [[James McDivitt]], Command Module Pilot [[David Scott]], and Lunar Module Pilot [[Rusty Schweickart]]. During the ten-day mission, they tested systems and procedures critical to landing on the Moon, including the LM engines, backpack life support systems, navigation systems and docking maneuvers.

After launching on March 3, 1969, the crew performed the first crewed flight of a lunar module, the first docking and extraction of the same, one two-person [[Extra-vehicular activity|spacewalk]] (EVA), and the second docking of two crewed [[spacecraft]]—two months after the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] performed a spacewalk crew transfer between {{nowrap|[[Soyuz 4]]}} and {{nowrap|[[Soyuz 5]]}}. The mission concluded on March 13 and was a complete success. It proved the LM worthy of crewed spaceflight, setting the stage for the dress rehearsal for the lunar landing, [[Apollo 10]], before the ultimate goal, landing on the Moon.

In April 1966, McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart were selected by Director of Flight Crew Operations [[Deke Slayton]] as the second Apollo crew. Their initial job was as backup to the first Apollo crew to be chosen, [[Gus Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], and [[Roger Chaffee]], for the first crewed Earth orbital test flight of the [[Apollo command and service module#Development history|block I command and service module]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Open End' Orbit Planned for Apollo |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ReojAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UU8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=apollo-1&amp;pg=7152%2C998301 |agency=United Press International |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Press|The Pittsburgh Press]] |location=Pittsburgh, PA |date=August 4, 1966 |page=20 |accessdate=July 11, 2019|via=Google News}}&lt;/ref&gt; designated [[Apollo 1|AS-204]]. Delays in the block I CSM development pushed AS-204 into 1967. The revised plan had the McDivitt crew scheduled for the second crewed CSM, which was to rendezvous in Earth orbit with an uncrewed LM, launched separately. The third crewed mission, to be commanded by [[Frank Borman]], was to be the first launch of a Saturn{{nbsp}}V with a crew.&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots_preparation&quot;&gt;[[#Brooks, et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 8.7: [https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch8-7.html &quot;Preparations for the first manned Apollo mission&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2010-06-11 CSM&amp;LM.jpg|thumb|left|alt=labeled drawing of two docked spacecraft|Apollo spacecraft configuration with CSM (right) and LM docked]]
On January 27, 1967, Grissom's crew was conducting a launch-pad test for their planned February 21 mission, which they named [[Apollo 1]], when a fire broke out in the cabin, killing all three men.{{sfn|Chaikin|pp=12–18}} A complete safety review of the Apollo program followed.{{sfn|Scott &amp; Leonov|pp=193–195}} During this time [[Apollo 5]] took place, an uncrewed launch to test the first lunar module (LM-1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Apollo 5 (AS-204)|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1968-007A|work=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=April 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the new schedule, the first Apollo crewed mission to go into space would be [[Apollo 7]], planned for October 1968. This mission, which was to test the block II [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]], did not include a lunar module.&lt;ref name = &quot;Apollo 7&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title =Apollo 7 (AS-205)|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/explore-and-learn/topics/apollo/apollo-program/orbital-missions/apollo7.cfm|publisher=[[National Air and Space Museum]]|accessdate=April 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, NASA had adopted a series of lettered missions leading up to the crewed lunar landing, the &quot;G mission&quot;, completion of one being a prerequisite to the next.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot;&gt;[[#chronology|Ertel, Roland, &amp; Brooks 1975]], Part 2(D): [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4009/v4p2d.htm &quot;Recovery, Spacecraft Redefinition, and First Manned Apollo Flight&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo{{nbsp}}7 would be the &quot;C{{nbsp}}mission&quot;, but the &quot;D{{nbsp}}mission&quot; required testing of the crewed lunar module, which was running well behind schedule and endangering [[John F. Kennedy]]'s goal of Americans walking on the Moon and returning safely to Earth by the end of the 1960s.{{sfn|Chaikin|pp=56–57}}&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots_proposal&quot;&gt;[[#Brooks, et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 11.2: [https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch11-2.html &quot;Proposal for a lunar orbit mission&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; McDivitt's crew had been announced by NASA in November 1967 as prime crew for the D{{nbsp}}mission, lengthy testing of the command and lunar modules in Earth orbit.&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots_training&quot;&gt;[[#Brooks, et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 11.3: [https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch11-3.html &quot;Selecting and training crews&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeking to keep Kennedy's goal on schedule, in August 1968, Apollo Program Manager [[George M. Low]] proposed that if Apollo{{nbsp}}7 in October went well, Apollo{{nbsp}}8 would go to lunar orbit without a LM.{{refn|group=nb|The Lunar Module was originally named the Lunar Excursion Module, abbreviated and pronounced as &quot;LEM&quot;. Once the name was shortened to LM, NASA personnel continued to pronounce LM as &quot;lem&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-350/ch-4-2.html|title=Apollo Expeditions to the Moon|id=SP-350|chapter=4.2|year=1975|last1=Cortright|first1=E. M.|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Until then, Apollo{{nbsp}}8 was the D{{nbsp}}mission with Apollo{{nbsp}}9 the &quot;E mission&quot;, testing in [[medium Earth orbit]].&lt;ref name='chronology' /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots_proposal&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|French &amp; Burgess|pp=298–299}} After NASA approved sending Apollo{{nbsp}}8 to the Moon, while making Apollo{{nbsp}}9 the D{{nbsp}}mission, Slayton offered McDivitt the opportunity to stay with Apollo{{nbsp}}8 and thus go to lunar orbit. McDivitt turned it down on behalf of his crew, preferring to stay with the D{{nbsp}}mission, now Apollo{{nbsp}}9.{{sfn|French &amp; Burgess|pp=328–329}}{{sfn|Chaikin|pp=62, 141}}

Apollo{{nbsp}}7 went well, and the crews were switched.{{sfn|Chaikin|pp=76–77}} The crew swap also affected who would be the first astronauts to land on the Moon, for when the crews for Apollo{{nbsp}}8 and{{nbsp}}9 were swapped, so were the backup crews. Since the rule of thumb was for backup crews to fly as prime crew three missions later, this put [[Neil Armstrong]]'s crew (Borman's backup) in position to make the first landing attempt on [[Apollo 11]] instead of [[Pete Conrad]]'s crew,{{sfn|Chaikin|pp=136–137}} who made the second landing on [[Apollo 12]].{{sfn|Chaikin|p=597}}

McDivitt was in the Air Force; selected as a member of [[NASA Astronaut Group 2|the second group of astronauts]] in 1962, he was command pilot of [[Gemini 4]] (1965).{{sfn|Press Kit|pp=94–95}} Scott, also Air Force, was selected in [[NASA Astronaut Group 3|the third astronaut group]] in 1963 and flew alongside Neil Armstrong in [[Gemini 8]], on which the first [[docking and berthing of spacecraft|spacecraft docking]] was performed.{{sfn|Press Kit|pp=96–97}} Schweickart, a civilian who had served in the Air Force and [[Massachusetts Air National Guard]], was selected as a Group{{nbsp}}3 astronaut but was not assigned to a Gemini mission and had no spaceflight experience.{{sfn|Press Kit|p=98}}

The backup crew consisted of [[Pete Conrad]] as commander, Command Module Pilot [[Richard F. Gordon Jr.]] and Lunar Module Pilot [[Alan Bean|Alan L. Bean]]. This crew flew as prime on [[Apollo 12]] in November 1969. The support crew for Apollo{{nbsp}}9 consisted of [[Stuart Roosa|Stuart A. Roosa]], [[Jack R. Lousma]], [[Edgar Mitchell|Edgar D.

Apollo 9's main purpose was to qualify the LM for crewed lunar flight, demonstrating, among other things, that it could perform the maneuvers in space that would be needed for a lunar landing, including docking with the CSM.{{sfn|Mission Report|p=3-2}} [[Colin Burgess (author)|Colin Burgess]] and [[Francis French]], in their book about the Apollo Program, deemed McDivitt's crew among the best trained ever—they had worked together since January 1966, at first as backups for Apollo 1, and they always had the assignment of being the first to fly the LM. Flight Director Gene Kranz deemed the Apollo{{nbsp}}9 crew the best prepared for their mission, and felt Scott was an extremely knowledgeable CMP.{{sfn|French &amp; Burgess|p=330}} Crew members underwent some 1,800 hours of mission-specific training, about seven hours for every hour they would spend in flight. Their training even started on the day before the Apollo{{nbsp}}1 fire, in the very first Block II spacecraft in which they were originally intended to fly. They took part in the vehicle checkouts for the CSM at [[North American Rockwell]]'s facility in [[Downey, California]] and for the LM at [[Grumman]]'s plant in [[Bethpage, New York]]. They also participated in testing of the modules at the launch site.{{sfn|Press Kit|p=83}}

Among the types of the training which the crew underwent were simulations of zero-G, both underwater and in the [[Vomit Comet]]. During these exercises, they practiced for the planned extravehicular activities (EVAs). They traveled to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], for training on the [[Apollo Guidance Computer]] (AGC) at [[MIT]]. The crew studied the sky at the [[Morehead Planetarium]] and at the [[Griffith Planetarium]], especially focusing on the 37 stars used by the AGC. They each spent more than 300 hours in the CM and LM simulators at [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) and at Houston, some involving live participation by Mission Control. Additional time was spent in simulators in other locations.{{sfn|Press Kit|pp=83–84}}

The first mission to use the CSM, the LM and a Saturn{{nbsp}}V, Apollo{{nbsp}}9 allowed the launch preparations team at KSC its first opportunity to simulate the launch of a lunar landing mission. The LM arrived from Grumman in June 1968 and was subjected to extensive testing including in the altitude chamber, simulating space conditions. As this occurred, other technicians assembled the Saturn{{nbsp}}V inside the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]]. The CM and SM arrived in October, but even the experienced KSC team from North American had trouble joining them together. When the lander was done with the altitude chamber, the CSM took its place, letting the LM be available for installation of equipment such as rendezvous radar and antennas. There were no lengthy delays, and on January 3, 1969, the launch vehicle was taken out of the VAB and moved to [[Launch Complex 39]]A by crawler. Flight readiness reviews for the CM, the LM, and the Saturn{{nbsp}}V were held and passed in the following weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots_double&quot;&gt;[[#Brooks, et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 12.3: [https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch12-3.html &quot;A double workload&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hardware ==

=== Launch vehicle ===
The [[Saturn V]] (AS-504) used on Apollo{{nbsp}}9 was the fourth to be flown, the second to carry astronauts to space,{{sfn|Press Kit|p=8}} and the first to bear a lunar module. Although similar in configuration to the Saturn{{nbsp}}V used on Apollo 8, several changes were made. The inner core of the F-1 engine chamber in the first (S-IC) stage was removed, thus saving weight and allowing for a slight increase in [[specific impulse]]. Weight was also saved by replacing the skins of the liquid oxygen tanks with lighter ones, and by providing lighter versions of other components. Efficiency was increased in the S-II second stage with uprated J-2 engines, and through a closed-loop propellant utilization system rather than Apollo 8's open-loop system.{{sfn|Mission Report|pp=A-59, inside back cover}} Of the {{convert|3250|lb}} weight reduction in the second stage, about half came from a 16 percent reduction in the thickness of the tank side walls.{{sfn|''Science News'' 1969-03-22b|p=283}}

Apollo{{nbsp}}9 used CSM-104, the third block II CSM to be flown with astronauts aboard. Apollo 8, lacking a lunar module, did not have docking equipment; Apollo{{nbsp}}9 flew the probe-and-drogue assembly used for docking along with other equipment added near the forward hatch of the CM; this allowed for rigid docking of the two craft, and for internal transfer between CM and LM.{{sfn|Mission Report|pp=A-1, inside back cover}} Had the switch in missions between Apollo{{nbsp}}8 and{{nbsp}}9 not occurred, the Earth-orbit mission would have flown CSM-103, which flew on Apollo 8.{{sfn|French &amp; Burgess|pp=338–339}}

The Earth-orbit mission was originally supposed to use LM-2 as its lunar module, but the crew found numerous flaws in it, many associated with it being the first flight-ready lunar module off Grumman's production line. The delay occasioned by the switch in missions allowed LM-3 to be available, a machine the crew found far superior.{{sfn|French &amp; Burgess|p=339}} Neither LM-2 nor LM-3 could have been sent to the Moon as both were too heavy; Grumman's weight reduction program for the LMs only became fully effective with LM-5, designated for Apollo 11.{{sfn|''Science News'' 1969-03-01|p=218}} Small cracks in LM-3's aluminum alloy structure due to stresses such as the insertion of a rivet proved an ongoing issue; Grumman's engineers continued working to fix them until the LM had to be mounted on the Saturn{{nbsp}}V in December 1968.{{sfn|''Science News'' 1969-03-01|p=219}} LM-2 never flew in space and is in the [[National Air and Space Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/lunar-module-2-apollo|publisher=[[National Air and Space Museum]]|title=Lunar Module LM-2|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apollo astronauts were provided with early versions of the [[Sony Walkman]], portable [[cassette recorder]]s intended to allow them to make observations during the mission. The Apollo{{nbsp}}9 crew was the first to be allowed to bring music [[mixtape]]s, one each, that could be played in that device.

After the [[Gemini 3]] craft was dubbed ''[[Molly Brown]]'' by Grissom, NASA forbade naming spacecraft.{{sfn|Shepard, Slayton, &amp; Barbree|pp=227–228}} The fact that during the Apollo{{nbsp}}9 mission, the CSM and LM would separate and need different [[call sign]]s caused the Apollo{{nbsp}}9 astronauts to push for a change.

The Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) backpack flew for the first time on Apollo{{nbsp}}9, used by Schweickart during his EVA.&lt;ref name=&quot;sp368ch6&quot;&gt;[[#sp368|Carson et al 1975]]&lt;/ref&gt; This included the [[Portable Life Support System]] (PLSS), providing oxygen to the astronaut and water for the [[Liquid Cooling Garment]] (LCG), which helped prevent overheating during extravehicular activity.{{sfn|Press Kit|pp=84–85}} Also present was the [[Oxygen Purge System]] (OPS), the &quot;bedroll&quot; atop the backpack, which could provide oxygen for up to roughly an hour if the PLSS failed.{{sfn|Thomas|p=22}} A more advanced version of the EMU was used for the lunar landing on Apollo 11.{{sfn|Thomas|p=22}}

[[File:Apollo-9-Lancering.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A rocket blasts off|Apollo{{nbsp}}9 launches from [[Kennedy Space Center]], March 3, 1969]]

Originally scheduled to launch on February 28, 1969, the liftoff of Apollo{{nbsp}}9 was postponed because all three astronauts had colds, and NASA did not want to risk that the mission might be affected. Around-the-clock labor shifts were required to keep the spacecraft in readiness; the delay cost $500,000.{{sfn|''Science News'' 1969-03-15|p=255}} The rocket launched from KSC at 11:00:00 EST (16:00:00 GMT) on March 3.{{sfn|Mission Report|p=1-1}} This was well within the launch window, which would have remained open for another three and a quarter hours.{{sfn|Orloff &amp; Harland|p=224}} Present in the firing control room was Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]] on behalf of the new [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots_apollonine&quot;&gt;[[#Brooks, et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 12.5: [https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch12-5.html &quot;Apollo 9: Earth orbital trials&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

McDivitt reported a smooth ride during the launch, although there was some vibration and the astronauts were surprised to be pushed forward when the Saturn V's first stage stopped firing, before its second stage took over, when they were pushed back into their couches.&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots_apollonine&quot; /&gt; Each of the first two stages slightly underperformed; a deficiency made up, more or less, by the [[S-IVB]] third stage.{{sfn|Mission Report|p=7-1}} Once the third stage cut out at 00:11:04.7 into the mission,{{sfn|Mission Report|p=3-4}} Apollo{{nbsp}}9 had entered a parking orbit of 102.3 by 103.9 miles.{{sfn|Mission Report|p=1-1}}

The crew began their first major orbital task with the separation of the CSM from the S-IVB at 02:41:16 into the mission, seeking to turn around and then dock with the LM, which was on the end of the S-IVB, after which the combined spacecraft would separate from the rocket. If it was not possible to make such a docking, the lunar landing could not take place. It was Scott's responsibility to fly the CSM, which he did to a successful docking, as the probe and drogue docking assembly worked properly. After McDivitt and Schweickart inspected the tunnel connecting the CM and LM, the assembled spacecraft separated from the S-IVB. The next task was to demonstrate that two docked spacecraft could be maneuvered by one engine. The five-second burn took place at 05:59.01.1 into the mission, accomplished with the SM's [[Service Propulsion System]] (SPS), after which Scott excitedly reported the LM was still in place. Thereafter, the S-IVB was fired again, and the stage was sent into solar orbit.&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots_apollonine&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Mission Report|p=3-4}}

From 09:00:00 to 19:30:00, a sleep period was scheduled.{{sfn|Mission Report|pp=3-6–3-7}} The astronauts slept well, but complained of being woken by non-English transmissions. Scott theorized that they were possibly in Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov/JSCHistoryPortal/history/mission_trans/AS09_TEC.PDF|title=Apollo 9 Technical Air-to-Ground Voice Transcription|date=March 1969|location=Houston, Texas|page=76|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highlight of the second day in orbit (March 4) was three SPS burns.&lt;ref name = &quot;NYT March 5&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/03/05/archives/apollo-9-proves-its-linkup-is-firm-combined-craft-and-lunar-module.html|url-access=subscription|last=Wilford|first=John Noble|authorlink=John Noble Wilford|title=Apollo 9 proves its linkup is firm|date=March 5, 1969|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|pages=1, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial burn, at 22:12:04.1,{{sfn|Mission Report|p=3-4}} lasted 110 seconds,&lt;ref name = &quot;NYT March 5&quot; /&gt; and including swiveling or &quot;gimbaling&quot; the engine to test whether the autopilot could dampen the induced oscillations, which it did within five seconds. Two more SPS burns followed, lightening the SM's fuel load.&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots_apollonine&quot; /&gt; The spacecraft and engine passed every test, sometimes proving more robust than expected.{{sfn|French &amp; Burgess|p=343}} The performance of the CSM in remaining stable while the engine was being gimbaled would in 1972 help cause McDivitt, by then manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program, to approve the continuation of [[Apollo 16]] when its CSM was experiencing an unstable gimbal after separation from its LM in lunar orbit.{{sfn|Chaikin|pp=461–462}}

The flight plan for the third day in space was to have the commander and lunar module pilot enter the LM to check out its systems and use its [[descent propulsion system|descent engine]] to move the entire spacecraft.{{sfn|Press Kit|pp=3–4}} The descent engine was the backup to the SPS; the ability to use it in this manner would prove critical on [[Apollo 13]].{{sfn|Chaikin|pp=298–301}} The flight plan was thrown into question when Schweickart, suffering from [[space adaptation sickness]], vomited, while McDivitt felt queasy as well. They had been avoiding sudden physical motions, but the contortion-like maneuvers to don their space suits for the LM checkout caused them to feel ill. The experience would teach the doctors enough about the sickness to have the astronauts avoid it on the lunar landings, but at the time Schweickart feared his vomiting might endanger Kennedy's goal. They were well enough to continue with the day's plan, and entered the LM, thus transferring between vehicles for the first time in the US space program, and making the first ever transfer without needing to spacewalk, as Soviet cosmonauts had. The hatches were then closed, though the modules remained docked, showing that ''Spider'''s communications and life support systems would work in isolation from those of ''Gumdrop''. On command, the landing legs sprang into the position they would assume for landing on the Moon.{{sfn|French &amp; Burgess|pp=344–345}}

[[File:Schweickart Apollo 9 EVA (AS09-19-2982).jpg|thumb|right|alt=Spacesuited man in orbit by spacecraft|Schweickart during his EVA, photographed by Scott standing up in the command module hatch]]
In the LM, Schweickart vomited again, causing McDivitt to request a private channel to the doctors in Houston. The first episode had not been reported to the ground because of its brief nature, and when the media learned what had happened to Schweickart, there were &quot;repercussions and a spate of unfriendly stories&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots_apollonine&quot; /&gt; They finished the LM checkout, including the successful firing of the descent engine, and returned to Scott in ''Gumdrop''.&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots_apollonine&quot; /&gt; The burn lasted 367 seconds and simulated the throttle pattern to be used during the landing on the Moon.&lt;ref name = &quot;nasa nine&quot; /&gt; After they returned, a fifth firing of the SPS was made, designed to circularize Apollo{{nbsp}}9's orbit in preparation for the rendezvous.{{sfn|Mission Report|p=3-1}} This took place at 54:26:12.3,{{sfn|Mission Report|p=3-4}} raising the craft's orbit to 142 by 149 miles.&lt;ref name = &quot;nasa nine&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Apollo 9|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo9.html|publisher=[[NASA]]|date=July 8, 2009|accessdate=April 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth day's program (March 6) was for Schweickart to exit the hatch on the LM and make his way along the outside of the spacecraft to the CM's hatch, where Scott would stand by to assist, demonstrating that this could be done in the event of an emergency. Schweickart was to wear the life support backpack, or [[Primary Life Support System|PLSS]], to be worn on the lunar surface EVAs.{{sfn|Press Kit|pp=4–5}} This was the only EVA scheduled before the lunar landing, and thus the only opportunity to test the PLSS in space. McDivitt initially cancelled the EVA due to Schweickart's condition, but with the lunar module pilot feeling better, decided to allow him to exit the LM, and once he was there, to move around the LM's exterior using handholds. Scott stood in the CM's hatch; both men photographed each other and retrieved experiments from the exterior of their vehicles. Schweickart found moving around easier than it had been in simulations; both he and Scott were confident that Schweickart could have completed the exterior transfer if called upon to do so, but considered it unnecessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots_apollonine&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots_overview&quot;&gt;[[#Brooks, et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 12.4: [https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch12-4.html &quot;The mission and the men&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; During the EVA, Schweickart used the call sign &quot;Red Rover&quot;, a nod to the color of his hair.&lt;ref name = &quot;rover&quot; /&gt;

On March 7, the fifth day, came &quot;the key event of the entire mission: the separation and rendezvous of the lunar module and the command module&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots_apollonine&quot; /&gt; The lunar module lacked the capability to return the astronauts to Earth;{{sfn|''Science News'' 1969-03-01|p=218}} this was the first time space travelers had flown in a vehicle that could not take them home.&lt;ref name = &quot;rover&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=50 years ago: ''Spider'', ''Gumdrop'', and Red Rover in space|publisher=[[NASA]]|date=March 6, 2019|accessdate=May 3, 2019|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/50-years-ago-spider-gumdrop-and-red-rover-in-space}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDivitt and Schweickart entered the LM early, having obtained permission to do so without wearing their helmets and gloves, making it easier to set up the LM.&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots_apollonine&quot; /&gt; When Scott in ''Gumdrop'' pushed the button to release the LM, it initially hung on the latches at the end of the docking probe, but he hit the button again and ''Spider'' was released.{{sfn|French &amp; Burgess|pp=349–350}} After spending about 45 minutes near ''Gumdrop'', ''Spider'' went into a slightly higher orbit, meaning that over time, the two craft would separate, with ''Gumdrop'' ahead.&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots_apollonine&quot; /&gt; Over the next hours, McDivitt fired the LM's descent engine at several throttle settings; by the end of the day the LM was thoroughly test-flown.{{sfn|French &amp; Burgess|pp=350–351}} At a distance of {{convert|185|km|sp=us|order=flip}}, ''Spider'' fired to lower its orbit and thus begin to catch up with ''Gumdrop'', a process that would take over two hours, and the descent stage was jettisoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots_apollonine&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Interior of Gumdrop (AS09-20-3104).jpg|thumb|right|alt=Inside view of CM|The interior of ''Gumdrop'']]
The approach and rendezvous were conducted as near as possible to what was planned for the lunar missions. To demonstrate that rendezvous could be performed by either craft, ''Spider'' was the active party during the maneuver.{{sfn|French &amp; Burgess|pp=351–352}} McDivitt brought ''Spider'' close to ''Gumdrop'', then maneuvered the LM to show each side to Scott, allowing him to inspect for any damage. Then, McDivitt docked the craft.&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots_apollonine&quot; /&gt; Due to glare from the Sun, he had trouble doing this and Scott guided him in. During the later missions, the job of docking the two spacecraft in lunar orbit would fall to the command module pilot.{{sfn|French &amp; Burgess|p=352}} After McDivitt and Schweickart returned to ''Gumdrop'', ''Spider'' was jettisoned, its engine fired to fuel depletion remotely by Mission Control as part of further testing of the engine,&lt;ref name = &quot;nasa nine&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots_apollonine&quot; /&gt; simulating an ascent stage's climb from the lunar surface.

=== Sixth through eleventh days (March 8–13) ===

Apollo 9 was to remain in space for about ten days to check how the CSM would perform over the period of time required for a lunar mission.{{sfn|French &amp; Burgess|p=352}} Most major events had been scheduled for the first days so that they would be accomplished if the flight needed to be ended early.{{sfn|Orloff &amp; Harland|p=223}} The remaining days in orbit were to be conducted at a more leisurely pace.{{sfn|Press Kit|pp=2, 6}} With the main goals of the mission accomplished, the hatch window was used for special photography of Earth, using four identical [[Hasselblad]] cameras, coupled together and using film sensitive to different parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].&lt;ref name=nasa&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Nicks|editor-first=Oran W.|title=This Island Earth|publisher=[[NASA]]|year=1970|pp=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such photography allowed different features of the Earth's surface to appear, for example, tracking of water pollution as it exits mouths of rivers into the sea,{{sfn|''Science News'' 1969-03-15|p=255}} and the highlighting of agricultural areas using [[infrared]].&lt;ref name=nasa/&gt; The camera system was a prototype, and would pave the way for the [[Earth Resources Technology Satellite]], predecessor to the [[Landsat]] series.{{sfn|Harland|p=335}} The photography was successful, as the ample time in orbit meant the crew could wait to allow cloud cover to pass, and would inform [[Skylab]]'s mission planning.{{sfn|Orloff &amp; Harland|p=230}}

The SPS burn lowered the perigee of Apollo{{nbsp}}9's orbit,{{sfn|Mission Report|p=3-2}} allowing for improved RCS thruster deorbit capability as a backup to the SPS.{{sfn|Press Kit|pp=6, 22}}

[[File:The Apollo 9 Command Module (CM).jpg|thumb|right|alt=A spacecraft is lifted in the air onto a ship|''Gumdrop'' is hoisted aboard the USS ''Guadalcanal'']]
Considerable testing of the CSM took place, but this was principally Scott's responsibility, allowing McDivitt and Schweickart leisure to observe the Earth; they alerted Scott if anything particularly noteworthy was upcoming, letting him leave his work for a moment to look at Earth too.{{sfn|French &amp; Burgess|pp=352–353}} The seventh burn of the SPS system took place on the eighth day, March 10, its purpose was again to aid RCS deorbit capability, as well as extending ''Gumdrop'''s orbital lifetime. It shifted the apogee of the orbit to the Southern Hemisphere, allowing for a longer free-fall time to entry when Apollo{{nbsp}}9 returned to Earth. The burn was extended to allow for testing of the propellent gaging system, which had been behaving anomalously during earlier SPS burns.{{sfn|Mission Report|p=3-2}}{{sfn|Press Kit|p=22}} Once it was accomplished, Apollo{{nbsp}}9's RCS thrusters could have returned it to Earth and still allowed it to land in the primary recovery zone had the SPS engine failed. The eighth and final SPS burn, to return the vehicle to Earth, was accomplished on March 13, less than an hour after the ten-day mark of the mission, after which the service module was jettisoned.

== Appraisal and aftermath ==
As NASA Associate Administrator [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]] put it, &quot;Apollo{{nbsp}}9 was as successful a flight as any of us could ever wish for, as well as being as successful as any of us have ever seen.&quot;{{sfn|French &amp; Burgess|p=353}} Gene Kranz called Apollo{{nbsp}}9 &quot;sheer exhilaration&quot;.{{sfn|French &amp; Burgess|p=353}} Apollo Program Director [[Samuel C. Phillips]] stated, &quot;in every way, it has exceeded even our most optimistic expectations.&quot;{{sfn|''Science News'' 1969-03-22a|p=277}} Apollo{{nbsp}}11 astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]] stood in Mission Control as ''Spider'' and ''Gumdrop'' docked after their separate flights, and with the docking, according to [[Andrew Chaikin]], &quot;Apollo{{nbsp}}9 had fulfilled all its major objectives. At that moment, Aldrin knew Apollo{{nbsp}}10 would also succeed, and that he and [[Neil Armstrong|Armstrong]] would attempt to land on the Moon. On March 24, NASA made it official.&quot;{{sfn|Chaikin|pp=140, 144–145}}

[[File:AS09-23-3500 (22038477212).jpg|thumb|left|alt=The Moon in partial phase|Image of the Moon taken from Apollo{{nbsp}}9]]
Although he might have been offered command of an Apollo lunar landing mission, McDivitt chose to leave the Astronaut Corps after Apollo{{nbsp}}9, becoming manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program later in 1969. Scott was soon given another spaceflight assignment as backup commander of Apollo 12, and then was made mission commander of [[Apollo 15]], landing on the Moon in 1971. Schweickart volunteered for medical investigation of his spacesickness, but was unable to shake its stigma, and was never again assigned to a prime crew. He took a leave of absence from NASA in 1977 that eventually became permanent.{{sfn|French &amp; Burgess|pp=354–362}} [[Eugene Cernan]], commander of [[Apollo 17]], stated that when it came to understanding spacesickness, Schweickart &quot;paid the price for them all&quot;.{{sfn|French &amp; Burgess|p=357}}

In the giddiness following the success of Apollo 9, NASA did not conduct the &quot;E mission&quot; (further testing in medium Earth orbit), and even considered skipping the &quot;F mission&quot;, the dress rehearsal for the lunar landing, going straight to the landing attempt. As the spacecraft designated for the first landing attempt were still being assembled, this was not done.{{sfn|French &amp; Burgess|p=354}} NASA officials also felt that given the past difficulties with the LM, there was a need for a further test flight before the actual landing attempt, and that orbiting the Moon would give them the opportunity to study [[Mass concentration (astronomy)|mass concentrations]] there, which had affected Apollo{{nbsp}}8's orbit.{{sfn|''Science News'' 1969-03-22a|p=278}} According to French and Burgess in their study of the Apollo Program, &quot;In any event,{{nbsp}}... Apollo{{nbsp}}9's success had ensured that the next Apollo mission would go back to the moon.&quot;{{sfn|French &amp; Burgess|p=354}}
