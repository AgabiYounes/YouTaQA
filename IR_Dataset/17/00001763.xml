'''Andronicus of Cyrrhus''' or '''Andronicus Cyrrhestes''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀνδρόνικος Κυρρήστου}}, ''Andrónikos Kyrrhēstou''), son of Hermias, was a [[Ancient Macedonia|Macedonian]] [[astronomer]] who flourished about 100 BC.

==Life==
He built a ''[[horologion]]'' at [[Athens]], the so-called [[Tower of the Winds]], a considerable portion of which still exists. It is octagonal, with figures carved on each side, representing the eight principal winds.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph V. Noble; Derek J. de Solla Price: The Water Clock in the Tower of the Winds, American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 72, No. 4 (1968), p353.&lt;/ref&gt; In antiquity a bronze figure of [[Triton (god)|Triton]] on the summit, with a rod in his hand, turned round by the wind, pointed to the quarter from which it blew. From this model is derived the custom of placing weather cockorolls  on steeples.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=23}}
