'''Arabic numerals''' are the ten [[numerical digit|digits]]: 0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;5,&amp;nbsp;6,&amp;nbsp;7,&amp;nbsp;8 and&amp;nbsp;9. The term often implies a [[decimal]] [[number]] written using these digits, which is the most common system for the symbolic representation of numbers in the world today, and is also called '''Hindu–Arabic numerals'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;HA2&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last1=Schipp|first1=Bernhard|title=Statistical Inference, Econometric Analysis and Matrix Algebra: Festschrift in Honour of Götz Trenkler|url=https://books.google.com/?id=t6XfLJzqO_kC&amp;pg=PA387|page=387|year=2008|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|isbn=9783790821208|last2=Krämer|first2=Walter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lumpkin2&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last1=Lumpkin|first1=Beatrice|title=Multicultural science and math connections: middle school projects and activities|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2LgG8lsJQmAC&amp;pg=PA118|page=118|year=1995|publisher=Walch Publishing|isbn=9780825126598|last2=Strong|first2=Dorothy}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the term can mean the digits themselves, such as in the statement &quot;[[octal]] numbers are written using Arabic numerals.&quot;

Although the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] (i.e. decimal) was developed by [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematicians]] around AD 500,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cengage Learning&quot;&gt;{{cite book| first1=Richard |last1= Bulliet|first2= Pamela |last2=Crossley|first3= Daniel |last3=Headrick|first4= Steven |last4= Hirsch|first5= Lyman |last5= Johnson| title = The Earth and Its Peoples: A Global History, Volume 1 |page = 192 |quote = Indian mathematicians invented the concept of zero and developed the &quot;Arabic&quot; numerals and system of place-value notation used in most parts of the world today |publisher = Cengage Learning |year = 2010|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dOxl71w-jHEC&amp;pg=PA192|isbn = 1439084742}}{{better source|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; they were modified into Arabic numerals later in North Africa. It was in the North African city of [[Bejaia]] that the [[Italian people|Italian]] scholar [[Fibonacci]] first encountered the numerals; his work was crucial in making them known throughout Europe.  European trade, books, and [[colonialism]] helped popularize the adoption of Arabic numerals around the world. The numerals have found worldwide use significantly beyond the contemporary [[spread of the Latin alphabet]], intruding into the writing systems in regions where other variants of the Hindu–Arabic numerals had been in use, such as [[Chinese numerals|Chinese]] and [[Japanese numerals|Japanese]] writing.

The term ''Arabic numerals'' may be intended to mean the numerals used by [[Arabs]], such as the [[Eastern Arabic numerals]]. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' uses lowercase ''Arabic numerals'' to refer to these digits, and capitalized ''Arabic Numerals'' to refer to the Eastern digits.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Arabic&quot;, ''Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd edition&lt;/ref&gt;.

Other alternative names are ''Western Arabic numerals'', ''Western numerals'', ''Hindu numerals'', and [[Unicode]] calls them ''digits''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf Official Unicode Consortium code chart]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===

{{Main|History of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system}}
[[File:Gwalior zeros.jpg|thumb|The numeral &quot;zero&quot; as it appears in two numbers (50 and 270) in an inscription in [[Gwalior|Gwalior, India]]. Dated to the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=David Eugene |last2=Karpinski |first2=Louis Charles |title=The Hindu-Arabic numerals |date=1911 |publisher=Boston, London, Ginn and Company |page=52 |url=https://archive.org/stream/hinduarabicnumer00smitrich#page/52/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/cristic/8727810760/ For a modern image]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The decimal Hindu–Arabic numeral system with zero was developed in India by around 700.&lt;ref name=oconnor&gt;O'Connor, J. J. and E. F. Robertson. 2000.  [http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Indian_numerals.html Indian Numerals], ''MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive'', School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St. Andrews, Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt; The development was gradual, spanning several centuries, but the decisive step was probably provided by [[Brahmagupta]]'s formulation of [[zero]] as a number in 628. Prior to Brahmagupta, zero was in use various forms but was regarded as a 'blank spot' (''sunya sthana'') in a positional number. It was only used by mathematicians (''ganakas''—people doing calculations) while the general populace used the traditional [[Brahmi numerals]]. After 700, the decimal numbers with zero replaced the Brahmi numerals. The system was revolutionary by limiting the number of individual digits to ten. It is considered an important milestone in the development of mathematics.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} 

[[File:Bakhshali numerals 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|The numerals used in the [[Bakhshali manuscript]], dated to sometime between the 3rd and 7th century AD.]]

The [[numeral system]] came to be known to the [[Abbasid Caliphate|court of Baghdad]], where mathematicians such as the [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|Al-Khwarizmi]], whose book ''On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals'' ({{Lang-ar|الجمع والتفريق بحساب الهندي}}) was written about 825 in [[Arabic]], and then the Arab mathematician [[Al-Kindi]], who wrote four volumes, ''On the Use of the Indian Numerals'' (''Ketab fi Isti'mal al-'Adad al-Hindi'') about 830, propagated it in the Arab world. Their work was principally responsible for the diffusion of the Indian system of numeration in the Middle East and the West.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/HistTopics/Indian_numerals.html The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 10th century, [[Middle-East]]ern mathematicians extended the decimal numeral system to include [[fractions]], as recorded in a treatise by [[Syrian]] mathematician [[Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi]] in 952–953. The [[decimal point]] notation was introduced by [[Sind ibn Ali]], who also wrote the earliest treatise on Arabic numerals.

===Origin of the Arabic numeral symbols===
According to [[Al-Beruni]], there were multiple forms of numerals in use in India, and &quot;Arabs chose among them what appeared to them most useful&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}. Al-Nasawi wrote in the early eleventh century that the mathematicians had not agreed on the form of numerals, but most of them had agreed to train themselves with the forms now known as [[Eastern Arabic numerals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunitzsch, The Transmission of Hindu-Arabic Numerals Reconsidered|2003|p=7}}: &quot;Les personnes qui se sont occupées de la science du calcul n'ont pas été d'accord sur une partie des formes de ces neuf signes; mais la plupart d'entre elles sont convenues de les former comme il suit.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest specimens of the written numerals available from Egypt in 873–874 show three forms of the numeral &quot;2&quot; and two forms of the numeral &quot;3&quot;, and these variations indicate the divergence between what later became known as the Eastern Arabic numerals and the (Western) Arabic numerals.{{sfn|Kunitzsch, The Transmission of Hindu-Arabic Numerals Reconsidered|2003|p=5}}

Calculations were originally performed using a dust board (''takht'', Latin: ''tabula'') which involved writing symbols with a stylus and erasing them as part of calculations. [[Al-Uqlidisi]] then invented a system of calculations with ink and paper &quot;without board and erasing&quot; (''bi-ghayr takht wa-lā maḥw bal bi-dawāt wa-qirṭās'').{{sfn|Kunitzsch, The Transmission of Hindu-Arabic Numerals Reconsidered|2003|pp=7–8}} The use of the dust board appears to have introduced a divergence in terminology as well: whereas the Hindu reckoning was called ''ḥisāb al-hindī'' in the east, it was called ''ḥisāb al-ghubār'' in the west (literally, &quot;calculation with dust&quot;).{{sfn|Kunitzsch, The Transmission of Hindu-Arabic Numerals Reconsidered|2003|p=8}} The numerals themselves were referred to in the west as ''ashkāl al‐ghubār'' (dust figures, in Ibn al-Yāsamin) or ''qalam al-ghubår'' (dust letters).{{sfn|Kunitzsch, The Transmission of Hindu-Arabic Numerals Reconsidered|2003|p=10}}

The western Arabic variants of the symbols came to be used in [[Maghreb]] and [[Al-Andalus]], which are the direct ancestor of the modern &quot;Arabic numerals&quot; used throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Kunitzsch, The Transmission of Hindu-Arabic Numerals Reconsidered|2003|pp=12–13}}: &quot;While specimens of Western Arabic numerals from the early period—the tenth to thirteenth centuries—are still not available, we know at least that Hindu reckoning (called ''ḥisāb al-ghubār'') was known in the West from the tenth century onward...&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;
The divergence in the terminology has led some scholars to propose that the Western Arabic numerals had a separate origin in the so-called &quot;''ghubār'' numerals&quot; but the available evidence indicates no separate origin.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Kunitzsch, The Transmission of Hindu-Arabic Numerals Reconsidered|2003|p=10}}: 'I should think that, therefore, it is no longer justified for us to call the Western Arabic forms of the Hindu-Arabic numerals &quot;ghubār numerals.&quot; Rather we should speak of the Eastern and the Western Arabic forms of the nine numerals.'&lt;/ref&gt;
Woepecke has also proposed that the Western Arabic numerals were already in use in Spain before the arrival of the Moors, purportedly received via Alexandria, but this theory is not accepted by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Kunitzsch, The Transmission of Hindu-Arabic Numerals Reconsidered|2003|pp=12–13}}: &quot;Since edition of and research on the Pseudo-Boethius[41] we now know that the texts running under his name and carrying Arabic numerals date from the eleventh century. Thus the assumed way of transmission from Alexandria to Spain is impossible and this theory can no longer be taken as serious.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Smith |first1=D.

Some popular myths have argued that the original forms of these symbols indicated their numeric value through the number of angles they contained, but no evidence exists of any such origin.&lt;ref name=ifrah&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ifrah|first1=Georges|title=The universal history of numbers: from prehistory to the invention of the computer; translated from the French by David Bellos|date=1998|publisher=Harvill Press|location=London|isbn=9781860463242|pages=356–357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoption in Europe===

[[File:Ms.Thott.290.2º 150v.jpg|thumb|A German manuscript page teaching use of Arabic numerals ([[Hans Talhoffer|Talhoffer]] Thott, 1459). At this time, knowledge of the numerals was still widely seen as esoteric, and Talhoffer presents them with the [[Hebrew alphabet]] and [[astrology]].]]
[[File:Clock-french-republic.jpg|thumb|right|Late 18th-century French revolutionary &quot;decimal&quot; clockface.]]

The reason the digits are more commonly known as &quot;Arabic numerals&quot; in Europe and the Americas is that they were introduced to Europe in the 10th century by Arabic-speakers of North Africa, who were then using the digits from Libya to Morocco. Arabs were also using the [[Eastern Arabic numerals]] (٠١٢٣٤٥٦٧٨٩) in other areas.

In 825 [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|Al-Khwārizmī]] wrote a treatise in Arabic, ''On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DuyMjOwWWnUC&amp;pg=PA38 Philosophy Of Mathematics] Francis, John – 2008 – Page 38&lt;/ref&gt; which survives only as the 12th-century Latin translation, ''Algoritmi de numero Indorum''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=twWkDe1Y9YQC&amp;pg=PT99 The Ellipse: A Historical and Mathematical Journey] Arthur Mazer – 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/317171/al-Khwarizmi|title=al-Khwarizmi - Muslim mathematician|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Algoritmi'', the translator's rendition of the author's name, gave rise to the word ''[[algorithm]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FPFsnzzebhQC&amp;pg=PA1 Models of Computation: An Introduction to Computability Theory – Page 1] Maribel Fernández – 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mentions of the numerals in the West are found in the ''[[Codex Vigilanus]]'' of 976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathorigins.com/V.htm|title=MATHORIGINS.COM_V|website=www.mathorigins.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 980s, Gerbert of [[Aurillac]] (later, [[Pope Sylvester II]]) used his position to spread knowledge of the numerals in Europe. Gerbert studied in [[Barcelona]] in his youth. He was known to have requested mathematical treatises concerning the [[astrolabe]] from [[Lupitus of Barcelona]] after he had returned to France.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}

[[Leonardo Fibonacci]] ([[Leonardo of Pisa]]), a mathematician born in the [[Republic of Pisa]] who had studied in [[Béjaïa]] (Bougie), [[Algeria]], promoted the Indian numeral system in Europe with his 1202 book ''[[Liber Abaci]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;When my father, who had been appointed by his country as public notary in the customs at [[Béjaïa|Bugia]] acting for the [[Pisa]]n merchants going there, was in charge, he summoned me to him while I was still a child, and having an eye to usefulness and future convenience, desired me to stay there and receive instruction in the school of accounting. There, when I had been introduced to the art of the Indians' nine symbols through remarkable teaching, knowledge of the art very soon pleased me above all else and I came to understand it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The European acceptance of the numerals was accelerated by the invention of the [[printing press]], and they became widely known during the 15th century. Early evidence of their use in [[Great Britain in the Middle Ages|Britain]] includes: an equal hour horary [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] from 1396,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=14th century timepiece unearthed in Qld farm shed |publisher=ABC News |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-11-09/one-man27s-trash-is-another27s-centuries-old-treasure/3654974}}&lt;/ref&gt; in England, a 1445 inscription on the tower of [[Heathfield and Waldron|Heathfield]] Church, [[Sussex]]; a 1448 inscription on a wooden lych-gate of [[Bray, Berkshire|Bray]] Church, [[Berkshire]]; and a 1487 inscription on the belfry door at [[Piddletrenthide]] church, [[Dorset]]; and in [[Scotland]] a 1470 inscription on the tomb of the first Earl of Huntly in [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]] Cathedral. (See G.F. Hill, ''The Development of Arabic Numerals in Europe'' for more examples.) In central Europe, the [[King of Hungary]] [[Ladislaus the Posthumous]], started the use of Arabic numerals, which appear for the first time in a royal document of 1456.&lt;ref&gt;Erdélyi: Magyar művelődéstörténet 1-2. kötet. Kolozsvár, 1913, 1918&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-16th century, they were in common use in most of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/52545.html Mathforum.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Roman numerals]] remained in use mostly for the notation of [[anno Domini]] years, and for numbers on clockfaces.

The evolution of the numerals in early Europe is shown here in a table created by the French scholar [[Jean-Étienne Montucla]] in his ''Histoire de la Mathematique'', which was published in 1757:

[[File:EuropeanFormOfArabianDigits.png|frameless|upright=2.25|Table of numerals]]

Today, Roman numerals are still used for enumeration of lists (as an alternative to alphabetical enumeration), for sequential volumes, to differentiate monarchs or family members with the same first names, and (in lower case) to number pages in prefatory material in books.

===Adoption in Russia===
[[Cyrillic numerals]] were a numbering system derived from the [[Early Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic alphabet]], used by [[South Slavs|South]] and [[East Slavs|East]] [[Slavic peoples]]. The system was used in Russia as late as the early 18th century when [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] replaced it with Arabic numerals.

===Adoption in China===
[[File:Yuan dynasty iron magic square.jpg|thumb|right|Iron plate with an order 6 [[magic square]] in Persian/ Arabic numbers from China, dating to the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1271–1368).]]

Positional notation was introduced to China during the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan Dynasty]] (1271–1368) by the Muslim [[Hui people]]. In the early 17th century, European-style Arabic numerals were introduced by Spanish and Portuguese [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Helaine Selin|editor-link=Helaine Selin|title=Encyclopaedia of the history of science, technology, and medicine in non-western cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raKRY3KQspsC&amp;pg=PA198|accessdate=3 March 2012|date=31 July 1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-4066-9|pages=198–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meuleman|first=Johan H.|title=Islam in the era of globalization: Muslim attitudes towards modernity and identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YNArhqy4emwC&amp;pg=PA272|accessdate=3 March 2012|date=23 August 2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7007-1691-3|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peng Yoke Ho|title=Li, Qi and Shu: An Introduction to Science and Civilization in China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_P6C4JO4JCUC&amp;pg=PA106|accessdate=3 March 2012|date=16 October 2000|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-41445-4|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Encoding==

The ten Arabic numerals are encoded in virtually every character set designed for electric, radio, and digital communication, such as [[Morse code]].

They are encoded in [[ASCII]] at positions 0x30 to 0x39. [[Mask (computing)|Masking]] to the lower 4 binary bits (or taking the last [[hexadecimal]] digit) gives the value of the digit, a great help in converting text to numbers on early computers. These positions were inherited in [[Unicode]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. [[EBCDIC]] used different values, but also had the lower 4 bits equal to the digit value.
