'''Andriscus''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀνδρίσκος}}, ''Andrískos''), also often referenced as '''Pseudo-Philip''', was the last [[King of Macedon]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}}&amp;nbsp;149–148&amp;nbsp;BC). A pretender, who claimed to be the son of [[Perseus of Macedon]], he was a [[fulling|fuller]] from [[Edremit (District), Balıkesir|Adramyttium]] in [[Aeolis]] in western [[Anatolia]]. His reign lasted just one year and was toppled by the [[Roman Republic]] during the [[Fourth Macedonian War]].

In 168 BC, the Romans invaded [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] and overthrew king [[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]] in the [[Battle of Pydna|First Battle of Pydna]].

In 149 BC, Andriscus, claiming to be Perseus' son, announced his intention to retake Macedonia from the Romans.

Andriscus travelled to [[Syria]] to request military help.  Instead he was handed over to the Romans, but Andriscus managed to escape from Roman captivity and raised a [[Thracians|Thracian]] army. With this army, he invaded Macedonia and defeated the Roman praetor Publius Juventius. Andriscus then declared himself King Philip VI of Macedonia.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 148 BC, Andriscus conquered [[Thessaly]] and made an alliance with [[Carthage]], which angered the Romans who declared war ([[Fourth Macedonian War]]) on Macedonia.  He was defeated by the Roman praetor [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus]] in the [[Battle of Pydna (148 BC)|Battle of Pydna]]. Following the battle, he fled to [[Thrace]], whose prince gave him up to [[Rome]], thus marking the end to Andriscus' reign of Macedonia.  Macedonia was then formally reduced to a Roman province.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

It was said that Andriscus' brief reign over Macedonia was marked by cruelty and extortion.
