'''Anah''' or '''Ana''' ({{lang-ar|عانة}}, ''ʾĀna''), formerly also known as '''Anna''',{{sfnp|EB|1878}} is an [[Iraq]]i town on the [[Euphrates]] river, approximately midway between the [[Gulf of Alexandretta]] and the [[Persian Gulf]]. Anah lies from west to east on the right bank along a bend of the river just before it turns south towards [[Hīt|Hit]].

{{anchor|Etymology}}

==Name==
The town was called '''&lt;sup&gt;(d)&lt;/sup&gt;Ha-na-at{{sup|KI}}''' in cuneiform texts from the [[Old Babylonian period]],&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Excavations at ʻĀna, Qalʻa island|last=Northedge, Alastair.|date=1988|publisher=Published for the British School of Archaeology in Iraq and the Directorate of Antiquities by Aris &amp; Phillips Ltd|others=Northedge, Alastair., Bamber, Andrina., Roaf, Michael.|isbn=978-0856684258|location=Warminster, England|oclc=24430256}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''A-na-at''' by the scribes of [[Tukulti-Ninurta II|Tukulti-Ninurta]] {{c.|lk=no|885}}&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}},{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} and '''An-at''' by the scribes of [[Assur-nasir-pal II]] in 879&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}.{{sfnp|Hogg|1911}} The name has been connected with the widely worshipped war goddess [[Anat]].{{sfnp|Hogg|1911}} It was known as ''Anathō'' ({{lang-grc-gre|Άναθω}}) to [[Isidore Charax]] and ''{{lang|la|Anatha}}'' to [[Ammianus Marcellinus]]; early Arabic writers described it variously as ''ʾĀna'' or (as if plural) ''ʾĀnāt''.{{sfnp|Hogg|1911}}

==History==

===Ancient===
The earliest references to Anah are probably found in letters of the period of [[Zimri-Lim]] of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]]. Under [[Hammurabi|Hammurapi]] of [[Babylon]] the town must have fallen under [[Babylonia]]n control, being included in the governorate of [[Sūḫu]]. Later, the town was under [[Assyria]]n rule. At the beginning of the 8th century BC, Šamaš-rēša-uṣur and his son Ninurta-kudurrī-uṣur succeeded in creating an independent political entity, and called themselves &quot;governors of Sūḫu and Mari&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cavigneaux, A., and B.K. Ismail, 'Die Statthalter von Suḫu und Mari im 8. Jh. v. Chr. anhand neuer Texte aus den irakischen Grabungen im Staugebiet des Qadissiya-Damms', ''Baghdader Mitteilungen'' 21 (1990), pp. 321–456 + pls. 35–38.&lt;/ref&gt; The land of [[Suhum|Sūḫu]] occupied a quite extensive region on the Middle Euphrates, approximately from the area near [[Falluja]] in the southeast to the area of Ḫindanu (modern Tell Jabiriyah, near [[Al-Qa'im (town)|Al-Qa'im]]) in the northwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/suhu/introduction/index.html|title='A Short Introduction on the Sūḫu Texts', Suhu: The Inscriptions of Suhu online Project, The Suhu Inscriptions Project|last=Bartelmus|first=Alexa|date=2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=22 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Important evidence for this period was recovered during English and Iraqi salvage excavation campaigns at Sur Jurʿeh and on the island of ʿAna (Anah) in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1983|title=Excavations in Iraq, 1981–82|journal=IRAQ|language=en|volume=45|issue=2|pages=199–224|doi=10.1017/S0021088900002424|issn=0021-0889}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1987|title=Excavations in Iraq 1985-86|journal=Iraq|volume=49|pages=231–251|issn=0021-0889|jstor=4200274|doi=10.1017/S0021088900006653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Xenophon]] recorded that the army of [[Cyrus the Younger]] resupplied during a campaign in 401&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} at &quot;Charmande&quot; near the end of a 90-[[parasang]] march between [[Korsote]] and [[Pylae]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''Anabasis''.&lt;/ref&gt; which likely intends Anah.{{clarify|reason=What does “which likely intends Anah” mean?|date=December 2019}} It was the site where the Roman emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] first met opposition in his {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;363 expedition against the [[Sassanid Empire]]. He got possession of the place and relocated its inhabitants.{{sfnp|Hogg|1911}}

===Medieval===
[[File:Manarat Anah 2.jpg|thumb|[[Minaret of Anah]], Abbasid era heritage site, before its destruction.]]
In 657, during the [[Muslim conquest of Iraq]], [[Ali]]'s lieutenants Ziyad and [[Shureih]] were refused passage across the Euphrates at Anah.&lt;ref&gt;Tabari I. 3261.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1058, Anah was the place of exile of the caliph [[Al-Qa'im (Abbasid caliph at Baghdad)|Qaim]] when [[al-Basasiri]] was in power.{{sfnp|Hogg|1911}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;&gt;Longrigg, p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 14th century, Anah was the seat of the [[catholicos]] who served as [[primate (bishop)|primate]] over the Persian Christians.{{sfnp|Hogg|1911}} Throughout early Islamic rule, it was a prosperous trade town, well known for its date palms and gardens;&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt; in the 14th century, Mustafi wrote of the fame of its palm groves. Medieval [[Arabic poetry|Arab poets]] celebrated Anah's wine;&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yaqut, iii. 593f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 14th and 17th centuries, Anah served as a headquarters for a host of regional [[Arab]] tribes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt; In 1574, [[Leonhart Rauwolff]] found the town divided into two parts, the Turkish &quot;so surrounded by the river that you cannot go into it but by boats&quot; and the larger Arabian section along one of the banks. In 1610, [[Texeira]]&lt;!-- links to dab page, but this particular Texeira seems not to be described in WP --&gt; said Anah lay on both banks of the river, with which [[Pietro Della Valle]] agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Della Valle, i. 671.&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, Della Valle found the Scot George Strachan resident at Anah, working as the physician to the emir and studying Arabic;&lt;ref&gt;Della Valle, i. 671–681.&lt;/ref&gt; he also found some sun worshipers still living there. Della Valle and Texeira called Anah the principal Arab town on the Euphrates, controlling a major route west from [[Baghdad]] and territory reaching [[Palmyra]].{{sfnp|Hogg|1911}}

====Late Ottoman era====
About 1750, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s installed a rudimentary administration to run Anah and its district.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt; After roughly a century, a more organized local government was put in place, whereby Anah became the center of a [[kaza]] belonging to the [[Baghdad Vilayet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt;

At the beginning of the 19th century, [[G.A. Olivier]] found only 25 men in service of the local prince, with residents fleeing daily to escape from [[bedouin]] attacks against which he offered no protection.{{sfnp|Olivier|1807}} He described the city as a single long street of five or six miles along a narrow strip of land between the river and a ridge of rocky hills.{{sfnp|Olivier|1807|p=451}} [[W. F. Ainsworth]], chronicling the [[Francis Rawdon Chesney|British Euphrates expedition]], reported that in 1835 the Arabs inhabited the northwest part of the town, the Christians the center, and the Jews the southeast.{{sfnp|Ainsworth|1888}} The same year, the steamer ''Tigris'' went down in a storm just above Anah, near where Julian's force had suffered from a similar storm.{{sfnp|Hogg|1911}}

By the mid-19th century, the houses were separated from one another by fruit gardens, which also filled the riverine islands near the town.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} The most easterly island contained a ruined castle, while the ruins of ancient Anatho extended a further two miles along the left bank.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} It marked the boundary between the olive (north) and date (south) growing regions in the area.{{sfnp|Hogg|1911}} With the positioning of Turkish troops in the town around 1890, the locals no longer had to pay blackmail (''huwwa'') to the bedouins.&lt;ref&gt;Von Oppenheim, 1893.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the early 20th century, coarse cotton cloth was the only manufacture.{{sfnp|EB|1878}}{{sfnp|Hogg|1911}} In 1909 Anah had an estimated population of 15,000 and 2,000 houses.&lt;ref name=&quot;MesoHandBook&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=A Handbook of Mesopotamia, Volume III: Central Mesopotamia with Southern Kurdistan and the Syrian Desert|date=January 1917|publisher=Admiralty and War Office, Division of Intelligence|pages=351–352|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the inhabitants were [[Sunni Muslim]] Arabs, though a small Jewish community lived on the town's southern edge.&lt;ref name=&quot;MesoHandBook&quot;/&gt;

===Kingdom of Iraq===
In 1918, the town was captured by British forces and by 1921, became incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Iraq]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt; It remained an administrative center of a [[qadaa]], part of the larger [[Ramadi]]-based [[Sanjak|liwa]] of Dulaym. Anah's ''qadaa'' also included the subdistricts of [[Hīt]], [[al-Qa'im (town)|al-Qa'im]] and Jubba.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt; The townspeople's long feud with the inhabitants of [[Rawa, Iraq|Rawa]] was settled diplomatically by 1921.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt; Its territory to the west was dominated by the subtribes of [[Anizzah]], while to the east the Jarba branch of the [[Shammar]] held sway.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt;

Most of Anah's building were located among a dense belt of date palms and was &quot;reckoned as healthy and picturesque&quot;, according to historian S. H. Longrigg.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt; The date palms were irrigated by [[na'ura|water wheel]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt; There were also more scattered dwelling in the mid-stream islands of the Euphrates near the town center.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt; The women of the town were well known for their beauty and the weaving of cotton and wool textiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt; The men, many of whom were compelled to emigrate to lack of living space, were largely engaged as boatmen and transporters of water to Baghdad. The town had relatively high educational standards, with eight schools built there by 1946.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt;

[[F. R. Chesney]] reported about 1800 houses, two [[mosque]]s, and 16 waterwheels. One minaret is particularly old. [[Alastair Northedge|Northedge]] reported the locals commonly attributed it to the 11th century but opined that it was more likely from about a century after that. It rose from one of the islands and belonged to the local mosque. Dr. Muayad Said described it as an octagonal body &quot;enhanced by alcoves, some of which are blind&quot; and noted earlier conservation work undertaken in 1935, 1963 and 1964. When the valley was flooded by the [[Haditha Dam]] in 1984/85, the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities cut it into sections and removed it to the new Anah, where it was re-erected to a height of {{convert|28|m|sp=us}} at the end of the 1980s.

[[Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] captured the town in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alissa J. Rubin]] (22 June 2014). [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/23/world/middleeast/iraq.html Sunni Militants Capture Iraq’s Last Major Border Post With Syria] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; On September 19, 2017, an offensive to retake the town from ISIS control began.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-41319905|title=Iraq 'attacks IS bastion on Syria border'|date=2017-09-19|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two days of fighting the town was recaptured by the Iraqi army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://isis.liveuamap.com/en/2017/21-september-iraq-the-town-of-anah-in-western-anbar-has-been|title=Iraq: the town of Anah in western Anbar has been completely cleared by the ISF, next town is Rawa, after that al-Qaim and then the border - News from war on ISIS in English from Iraq, Syria - Deir ez-Zur operation, Raqqa operation - isis.liveuamap.com|website=News from war on ISIS in English from Iraq, Syria - Deir ez-Zur operation, Raqqa operation - isis.liveuamap.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
