==Classification==
There are several diseases where joint pain is primary, and is considered the main feature. Generally when a person has &quot;arthritis&quot; it means that they have one of these diseases, which include:
* [[Osteoarthritis]]
* [[Rheumatoid arthritis]]
* [[Gout]] and [[Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease|pseudo-gout]]
* [[Septic arthritis]]
* [[Ankylosing spondylitis]]
* [[Juvenile idiopathic arthritis]]
* [[Adult-onset Still's disease|Still's disease]]

Joint pain can also be a symptom of other diseases. In this case, the arthritis is considered to be secondary to the main disease; these include:
* [[Psoriasis]] ([[Psoriatic arthritis]])
* [[Reactive arthritis]]
* [[Ehlers–Danlos syndrome]]
* [[Haemochromatosis]]
* [[Hepatitis]]

Pain, which can vary in severity, is a common symptom in virtually all types of arthritis. Other symptoms include [[swelling (medical)|swelling]], [[joint stiffness]] and aching around the joint(s). Arthritic disorders like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis can affect other organs in the body, leading to a variety of symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/AAG/arthritis.htm Arthritis: The Nation’s Most Common Cause of Disability] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130084326/http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/AAG/arthritis.htm |date=2010-01-30 }} Centers for disease prevention and health promotion. Retrieved on 2010-01-24&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms may include:

* Inability to use the [[hand]] or [[walking|walk]]
* Stiffness, which may be worse in the morning, or after use
* [[Malaise]] and fatigue
* [[Weight loss]]
* Poor [[sleep]]
* [[myalgia|Muscle aches]] and pains
* [[Tenderness (medicine)|Tenderness]]
* Difficulty moving the joint

It is common in advanced arthritis for significant secondary changes to occur. For example, arthritic symptoms might make it difficult for a person to move around and/or exercise, which can lead to secondary effects, such as:
[[File:Gout Signs and Symptoms.jpg|thumb|Illustration of gout affected foot.]]

* Muscle [[weakness]]
* Loss of [[flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]]
* Decreased [[aerobic exercise|aerobic fitness]]
These changes, in addition to the primary symptoms, can have a huge impact on quality of life.

===Disability===

Arthritis is the most common cause of [[disability]] in the United States. More than 20 million individuals with arthritis have severe limitations in function on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/aag/arthritis.htm Arthritis: The Nation's Most Common Cause of Disability] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130084326/http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/AAG/arthritis.htm |date=2010-01-30 }} The Center for Disease Control. Retrieved on 2015-01-04&lt;/ref&gt; [[Absenteeism]] and frequent visits to the [[physician]] are common in individuals who have arthritis. Arthritis can make it very difficult for individuals to be physically active and some become home bound.

It is estimated that the total cost of arthritis cases is close to $100 billion of which almost 50% is from lost earnings. Each year, arthritis results in nearly 1 million hospitalizations and close to 45 million outpatient visits to [[health care]] centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Direct and Indirect Costs of Musculoskeletal Conditions in 1997: Total and Incremental Estimates Revised Final Report (July, 2003)|url=https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/share/Q6rPMaaZgYQ8IvC02imgAeDTx2mfp5FSBZqVNCqLMnq?ref_=cd_ph_share_link_copy|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decreased mobility, in combination with the above symptoms, can make it difficult for an individual to remain physically active, contributing to an increased risk of obesity, high [[cholesterol]] or vulnerability to [[heart disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rheumatoid Arthritis and Heart Disease Risk: Atherosclerosis, Heart Attacks, and More|url = http://www.webmd.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/guide/heart-disease-rheumatoid-arthritis|accessdate = 2015-06-09|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150327151244/http://www.webmd.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/guide/heart-disease-rheumatoid-arthritis|archivedate = 2015-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with arthritis are also at increased risk of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], which may be a response to numerous factors, including fear of worsening symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Coping With Depression and Rheumatoid Arthritis|url = http://www.webmd.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/features/ra-depression|accessdate = 2015-06-09|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150514223122/http://www.webmd.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/features/ra-depression|archivedate = 2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is made by clinical examination from an appropriate health professional, and may be supported by other tests such as radiology and blood tests, depending on the type of suspected arthritis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How is arthritis diagnosed? {{!}} Arthritis Research UK|url = http://www.arthritisresearchuk.org/arthritis-information/conditions/arthritis/diagnosis.aspx|website = www.arthritisresearchuk.org|accessdate = 2015-06-09|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402061641/http://www.arthritisresearchuk.org/arthritis-information/conditions/arthritis/diagnosis.aspx|archivedate = 2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; All arthritides potentially feature [[pain]]. Pain patterns may differ depending on the arthritides and the location. [[Rheumatoid arthritis]] is generally worse in the morning and associated with stiffness lasting over 30 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/rheumatoid-arthritis|title=Rheumatoid Arthritis|last=Nancy Garrick|first=Deputy Director|date=2017-04-20|website=National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases|access-date=2019-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the early stages, patients may have no symptoms after a warm shower. [[Osteoarthritis]], on the other hand, tends to be associated with morning stiffness which eases relatively quickly with movement and exercise. In the aged and children, pain might not be the main presenting feature; the aged patient simply moves less, the infantile patient refuses to use the affected limb.

Elements of the history of the disorder guide diagnosis. Important features are speed and time of onset, pattern of joint involvement, symmetry of symptoms, early morning stiffness, tenderness, gelling or locking with inactivity, aggravating and relieving factors, and other systemic symptoms. Physical examination may confirm the diagnosis, or may indicate systemic disease. Radiographs are often used to follow progression or help assess severity.

[[Blood test]]s and [[X-ray]]s of the affected joints often are performed to make the diagnosis. Screening blood tests are indicated if certain arthritides are suspected. These might include: [[rheumatoid factor]], [[antinuclear factor]] (ANF), [[extractable nuclear antigen]], and specific antibodies.

===Osteoarthritis===
{{main|Osteoarthritis}}
[[Osteoarthritis]] is the most common form of arthritis.&lt;ref name=Van2010&gt;{{cite journal | author = VanItallie TB | title = Gout: epitome of painful arthritis | journal = Metab. Clin. Exp. | volume = 59 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = S32–6 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20837191 | doi = 10.1016/j.metabol.2010.07.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can affect both the larger and the smaller joints of the body, including the hands, [[wrist osteoarthritis|wrists]], feet, back, hip, and knee. The disease is essentially one acquired from daily wear and tear of the joint; however, osteoarthritis can also occur as a result of injury. In recent years,{{when|date=November 2017}} some joint or limb deformities, such as knock-knee or acetabular overcoverage or dysplasia, have also been considered as a predisposing factor for knee or hip osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis begins in the cartilage and eventually causes the two opposing bones to erode into each other. The condition starts with minor pain during physical activity, but soon the pain can be continuous and even occur while in a state of rest. The pain can be debilitating and prevent one from doing some activities. Osteoarthritis typically affects the weight-bearing joints, such as the back, knee and hip. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis is most commonly a disease of the elderly. The strongest predictor of osteoarthritis is increased age, likely due to the declining ability of chondrocytes to maintain the structural integrity of cartilage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pereira|first=Duarte|last2=Ramos|first2=Elisabete|last3=Branco|first3=Jaime|date=January 2015|title=Osteoarthritis|journal=Acta Medica Portuguesa|volume=28|issue=1|pages=99–106|issn=1646-0758|pmid=25817486|doi=10.20344/amp.5477}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 30 percent of women have some degree of osteoarthritis by age 65. Other risk factors for osteoarthritis include prior joint trauma, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang Y, Jordan J |title=Epidemiology of Osteoarthritis |journal=Clin Geriatr Med |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=355–69 |year=2010 |pmid=20699159 |pmc=2920533 |doi=10.1016/j.cger.2010.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rheumatoid arthritis]] (RA) is a disorder in which the body's own immune system starts to attack body [[tissue (biology)|tissues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/rheumatoid-arthritis.html|title=Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) {{!}} Arthritis {{!}} CDC|date=2019-03-05|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2019-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack is not only directed at the joint but to many other parts of the body. In rheumatoid arthritis, most damage occurs to the joint lining and [[cartilage]] which eventually results in erosion of two opposing bones. RA often affects joints in the fingers, wrists, knees and elbows, is symmetrical (appears on both sides of the body), and can lead to severe [[deformity]] in a few years if not treated. RA occurs mostly in people aged 20 and above. In children, the disorder can present with a skin [[rash]], [[fever]], [[pain]], disability, and limitations in daily activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/faqs.htm|title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about Arthritis {{!}} CDC|date=2019-02-21|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2019-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; With earlier diagnosis and aggressive treatment, many individuals can lead a better quality of life than if going undiagnosed for long after RA's onset.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://familydoctor.org/condition/rheumatoid-arthritis/|title=What Is Rheumatoid Arthritis?

Bone erosion is a central feature of rheumatoid arthritis. Bone continuously undergoes remodeling by actions of bone resorbing [[osteoclast]]s and bone forming [[osteoblast]]s. One of the main triggers of bone erosion in the joints in rheumatoid arthritis is inflammation of the [[synovium]], caused in part by the production of pro-inflammatory [[cytokine]]s and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), a cell surface protein present in Th17 cells and osteoblasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chabaud_2000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Chabaud M, Garnero P, Dayer JM, Guerne PA, Fossiez F, Miossec P|year=2000|title=Contribution of interleukin 17 to synovium matrix destruction in rheumatoid arthritis|journal=Cytokine|volume=12|issue=7|pages=1092–9|doi=10.1006/cyto.2000.0681|pmid=10880256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osteoclast activity can be directly induced by osteoblasts through the RANK/RANKL mechanism.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21464945&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Won HY, Lee JA, Park ZS, Song JS, Kim HY, Jang SM, Yoo SE, Rhee Y, Hwang ES, Bae MA | title = Prominent bone loss mediated by RANKL and IL-17 produced by CD4+ T cells in TallyHo/JngJ mice | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = e18168 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21464945 | pmc = 3064589 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0018168 | bibcode = 2011PLoSO...618168W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lupus===
{{main|Lupus erythematosus}}
[[Lupus erythematosus|Lupus]] is a common [[collagen]] [[vascular]] disorder that can be present with severe arthritis. Other features of lupus include a skin rash, extreme [[photosensitivity]], [[baldness|hair loss]], [[kidney]] problems, lung fibrosis and constant joint pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|331715|Rheumatoid Arthritis: Differential Diagnoses &amp; Workup|diagnosis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gout===
{{main|Gout}}
[[Gout]] is caused by deposition of [[uric acid]] crystals in the joint, causing inflammation. There is also an uncommon form of gouty arthritis caused by the formation of rhomboid crystals of calcium pyrophosphate known as [[Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease|pseudogout]]. In the early stages, the gouty arthritis usually occurs in one joint, but with time, it can occur in many joints and be quite crippling. The joints in gout can often become swollen and lose function. Gouty arthritis can become particularly painful and potentially debilitating when gout cannot successfully be treated.&lt;ref name=Becker&gt;{{cite book|last=Becker|first=Michael A.|title=Arthritis and Allied Conditions: A textbook of Rheumatology edition 15|year=2005|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|pages=2303–2339}}&lt;/ref&gt; When uric acid levels and gout symptoms cannot be controlled with standard gout medicines that decrease the production of uric acid (e.g., allopurinol, febuxostat) or increase uric acid elimination from the body through the kidneys (e.g., probenecid), this can be referred to as refractory chronic gout or RCG.&lt;ref name=Ali&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ali S, Lally EV | title = Treatment failure gout | journal = Medicine and Health, Rhode Island | volume = 92 | issue = 11 | pages = 369–71 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19999896 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.608.3812 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
[[Infectious arthritis]] is another severe form of arthritis. It presents with sudden onset of chills, fever and joint pain. The condition is caused by bacteria elsewhere in the body. Infectious arthritis must be rapidly diagnosed and treated promptly to prevent irreversible joint damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthritis.org/ Severe Arthritis Disease Facts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423120449/http://www.arthritis.org/ |date=2007-04-23 }} Retrieved on 2010-02-05&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psoriasis]] can develop into psoriatic arthritis. With psoriatic arthritis, most individuals develop the skin problem first and then the arthritis. The typical features are of continuous joint pains, stiffness and swelling. The disease does recur with periods of [[remission (medicine)|remission]] but there is no cure for the disorder. A small percentage develop a severe painful and destructive form of arthritis which destroys the small joints in the hands and can lead to permanent disability and loss of hand function.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/psoriatic-arthritis/DS00476/DSECTION=symptoms Psoriatic Arthritis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209073725/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/psoriatic-arthritis/DS00476/DSECTION%3Dsymptoms |date=2010-02-09 }} Mayo Clinic. Retrieved on 2010-02-05&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
There is no known cure for either rheumatoid or osteoarthritis. Treatment options vary depending on the type of arthritis and include [[physical therapy]], lifestyle changes (including exercise and weight control), [[Brace (orthopaedic)|orthopedic bracing]], and medications. [[Joint replacement surgery]] may be required in eroding forms of arthritis. Medications can help reduce inflammation in the joint which decreases pain. Moreover, by decreasing inflammation, the joint damage may be slowed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===Physical therapy===
In general, studies have shown that physical exercise of the affected joint can noticeably improve long-term pain relief. Furthermore, exercise of the arthritic joint is encouraged to maintain the health of the particular joint and the overall body of the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ettinger WH, Burns R, Messier SP, Applegate W, Rejeski WJ, Morgan T, Shumaker S, Berry MJ, O'Toole M, Monu J, Craven T | title = A randomized trial comparing aerobic exercise and resistance exercise with a health education program in older adults with knee osteoarthritis. The Fitness Arthritis and Seniors Trial (FAST) | journal = JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 277 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–31 | year = 1997 | pmid = 8980206 | doi = 10.1001/jama.1997.03540250033028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals with arthritis can benefit from both physical and [[occupational therapy]]. In arthritis the joints become stiff and the range of movement can be limited. Physical therapy has been shown to significantly improve function, decrease pain, and delay need for surgical intervention in advanced cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fransen M, Crosbie J, Edmonds J | title = Physical therapy is effective for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee: a randomized controlled clinical trial (2001)| journal = J. Rheumatol. | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 156–64 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 11196518 | url = http://www.jrheum.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11196518 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exercise prescribed by a physical therapist has been shown to be more effective than medications in treating osteoarthritis of the knee. Exercise often focuses on improving muscle strength, endurance and flexibility. In some cases, exercises may be designed to train balance. Occupational therapy can provide assistance with activities. Assistive technology is a tool used to aid a person's disability by reducing their physical barriers by improving the use of their damaged body part, typically after an amputation. Assistive technology devices can be customized to the patient or bought commercially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aota.org/About-Occupational-Therapy/Professionals/RDP/assistive-technology.aspx|title=The Role of Occupational Therapy in Providing Assistive Technology Devices and Services|last=|first=|date=2018|website=www.aota.org|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medications===
There are several types of medications that are used for the treatment of arthritis. Treatment typically begins with medications that have the fewest side effects with further medications being added if insufficiently effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.arthritistoday.org/treatments/drug-guide/index.php|title=Arthritis Drugs|work=arthritistoday.org|accessdate=July 5, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100722013235/http://www.arthritistoday.org/treatments/drug-guide/index.php| archivedate= 22 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the type of arthritis, the medications that are given may be different. For example, the first-line treatment for [[osteoarthritis]] is [[acetaminophen]] (paracetamol) while for [[inflammatory arthritis]] it involves [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs) like [[ibuprofen]]. [[Opioid]]s and NSAIDs may be less well tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reid MC, Shengelia R, Parker SJ | title = Pharmacologic management of osteoarthritis-related pain in older adults | journal = The American Journal of Nursing | volume = 112 | issue = 3 Suppl 1 | pages = S38–43 | date = Mar 2012 | pmid = 22373746 | pmc = 3733545 | doi=10.1097/01.NAJ.0000412650.02926.e3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, topical NSAIDs may have better safety profiles than oral NSAIDs. For more severe cases of osteoarthritis, intra-articular corticosteroid injections may also be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taruc-Uy|first=Rafaelani L.|last2=Lynch|first2=Scott A.|date=December 2013|title=Diagnosis and Treatment of Osteoarthritis|journal=Primary Care: Clinics in Office Practice|volume=40|issue=4|pages=821–836|doi=10.1016/j.pop.2013.08.003|pmid=24209720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drugs to treat [[rheumatoid arthritis]] (RA) range from [[corticosteroid]]s to [[monoclonal antibodies]] given [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]]. Due to the [[autoimmune]] nature of RA, treatments may include not only pain medications and anti-inflammatory drugs, but also another category of drugs called [[disease-modifying antirheumatic drug]]s (DMARDs). Treatment with DMARDs is designed to slow down the progression of RA by initiating an [[adaptive immune system|adaptive immune response]], in part by CD4+ T helper (Th) cells, specifically Th17 cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid23383714&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kurebayashi Y, Nagai S, Ikejiri A, Koyasu S|year=2013|title=Recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of the development and function of Th17 cells|journal=Genes Cells|volume=18|issue=4|pages=247–65|doi=10.1111/gtc.12039|pmc=3657121|pmid=23383714}}&lt;/ref&gt; Th17 cells are present in higher quantities at the site of bone destruction in joints and produce inflammatory cytokines associated with inflammation, such as interleukin-17 (IL-17).&lt;ref name=&quot;Chabaud_2000&quot; /&gt;

===Surgery===
A number of [[Rheumasurgery|rheumasurgical]] interventions have been incorporated in the treatment of arthritis since the 1950s. [[Arthroscopic surgery]] for osteoarthritis of the knee provides no additional benefit to optimized physical and medical therapy.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18784099&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kirkley A, Birmingham TB, Litchfield RB, Giffin JR, Willits KR, Wong CJ, Feagan BG, Donner A, Griffin SH, D'Ascanio LM, Pope JE, Fowler PJ | title = A randomized trial of arthroscopic surgery for osteoarthritis of the knee | journal = N.

===Adaptive aids===
People with hand arthritis can have trouble with simple [[activities of daily living]] tasks (ADLs), such as turning a key in a lock or opening jars, as these activities can be cumbersome and painful. There are [[adaptive aids]] or ([[Assistive technology|assistive devices]] (ADs)) available to help with these tasks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.everydayhealth.com/arthritis-pictures/10-terrific-arthritis-gadgets.aspx|title=10 Terrific Arthritis Gadgets - Arthritis Center - Everyday Health|website=EverydayHealth.com|access-date=2019-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they are generally more costly than conventional products with the same function. It is now possible to [[3-D print]] adaptive aids, which have been released as [[open source hardware]] to reduce patient costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://orthofeed.com/2018/12/15/3-d-printing-offers-helping-hand-to-people-with-arthritis/|title=3-D Printing Offers Helping Hand to People with Arthritis|date=2018-12-15|website=OrthoFeed|access-date=2019-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallup N, Bow JK, Pearce JM | title = Economic Potential for Distributed Manufacturing of Adaptive Aids for Arthritis Patients in the U.S | journal = Geriatrics | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 89 | date = December 2018 | pmid = 31011124 | pmc = 6371113 | doi = 10.3390/geriatrics3040089 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptive aids can significantly help arthritis patients and the vast majority of those with arthritis need and use them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yeung KT, Lin CH, Teng YL, Chen FF, Lou SZ, Chen CL | title = Use of and Self-Perceived Need for Assistive Devices in Individuals with Disabilities in Taiwan | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = e0152707 | date = 2016-03-29 | pmid = 27023276 | pmc = 4811424 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0152707 | bibcode = 2016PLoSO..1152707Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative medicine===
Further research is required to determine if [[transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation]] (TENS) for knee osteoarthritis is effective for controlling pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rutjes AW, Nüesch E, Sterchi R, Kalichman L, Hendriks E, Osiri M, Brosseau L, Reichenbach S, Jüni P | title = Transcutaneous electrostimulation for osteoarthritis of the knee | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 4 | pages = CD002823 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19821296 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD002823.pub2 | url = http://boris.unibe.ch/30337/1/Rutjes%20CochraneLibrary%202009.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthritis is predominantly a disease of the elderly, but children can also be affected by the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000451.htm|title=Juvenile idiopathic arthritis: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|access-date=2019-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthritis is more common in women than men at all ages and affects all races, [[ethnic group]]s and cultures. In the United States a CDC survey based on data from 2013–2015 showed 54.4 million (22.7%) adults had self-reported doctor-diagnosed arthritis, and 23.7 million (43.5% of those with arthritis) had arthritis-attributable activity limitation (AAAL). With an aging population, this number is expected to increase. Adults with co-morbid conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, were seen to have a higher than average prevalence of doctor-diagnosed arthritis (49.3%, 47.1%, and 30.6% respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barbour|first=Kamil E.|last2=Helmick|first2=Charles G.|last3=Boring|first3=Michael|last4=Brady|first4=Teresa J.|date=2017-03-10|title=Vital Signs: Prevalence of Doctor-Diagnosed Arthritis and Arthritis-Attributable Activity Limitation — United States, 2013–2015|journal=MMWR.

In 1715, [[William Musgrave]] published the second edition of his most important medical work, ''De arthritide symptomatica'', which concerned arthritis and its effects.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Alick Cameron, &quot;Musgrave, William (1655–1721)&quot;, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Augustin Jacob Landré-Beauvais, a 28-year-old resident physician at Saltpêtrière Asylum in France was the first person to describe the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Though Landré-Beauvais' classification of rheumatoid arthritis as a relative of gout was inaccurate, his dissertation encouraged others to further study the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Entezami P, Fox DA, Clapham PJ, Chung KC | title = Historical perspective on the etiology of rheumatoid arthritis | journal = Hand Clinics | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–10 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21176794 | pmc = 3119866 | doi = 10.1016/j.hcl.2010.09.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The term is derived from ''[[wikt:arthr-|arthr-]]'' (from {{lang-grc|[[wikt:ἄρθρον|ἄρθρον]]|árthron|joint, limb}}) and ''[[wikt:-itis#English|-itis]]'' (from {{lang|grc|-ῖτις}}, {{transl|grc|-îtis}}, {{Literal translation|'pertaining to'|lk=no}}), the latter [[suffix]] having come to be associated with [[inflammation]].

The word 'arthritides' denotes the collective group of arthritis-like conditions.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}
