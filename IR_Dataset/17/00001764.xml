      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Andronicus of Rhodes''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀνδρόνικος ὁ Ῥόδιος|translit=Andrónikos ho Rhódios}}; {{lang-la|Andronicus Rhodius}}; {{floruit|{{circa|60 BC}}}}) was a [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] from [[Rhodes]] who was also the [[scholarch]] (head) of the [[Peripatetic school]]. He is most famous for publishing a new edition of the works of [[Aristotle]] that forms the basis of the texts that survive today.{{sfn|Falcon|Zalta|2013}}

==Life==
Little is known about Andronicus' life. He is reported to have been the eleventh [[scholarch]] of the Peripatetic school.&lt;ref&gt;Ammonius, ''In de Int.'' 5.24&lt;/ref&gt; He taught in [[Rome]], about 58&amp;nbsp;BC, and was the teacher of [[Boethus of Sidon]], with whom [[Strabo]] studied.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, xiv.; Ammonius, ''in Aristot. Categ.''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works of Aristotle==
Andronicus is of special interest in the history of philosophy, from the statement of [[Plutarch]],&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Sulla'' c. 26&lt;/ref&gt; that he published a new edition of the works of [[Aristotle]] and [[Theophrastus]], which formerly belonged to the library of [[Apellicon]], and were brought to [[Rome]] by [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]] with the rest of Apellicon's library in 84. [[Tyrannion of Amisus|Tyrannion]] commenced this task, but apparently did not do much towards it.&lt;ref&gt;Comp. Porphyry, ''Vit. Plotin.'' c. 24; Boethius, ''ad Aristot. de Interpret.''&lt;/ref&gt; The arrangement which Andronicus made of Aristotle's writings seems to be the one which forms the basis of our present editions and we are probably indebted to him for the preservation of a large number of Aristotle's works.{{sfn|Smith|1870}}

==Writings==
Andronicus wrote a work upon Aristotle, the fifth book of which contained a complete list of the philosopher's writings, and he also wrote commentaries upon the ''Physics'', ''Ethics'', and ''Categories''.  None of these works is extant.  Two treatises are sometimes erroneously attributed to him, one ''On Emotions'', the other a commentary on Aristotle's ''Ethics'' (really by [[Constantine Paleocappa]] in the 16th century, or by [[John Callistus]] of Thessalonica).&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Andronicus of Rhodes|volume=1 |page=976}}&lt;/ref&gt;
