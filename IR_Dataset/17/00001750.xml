The '''Andaman Islands''' form an [[archipelago]] in the [[Bay of Bengal]] between [[India]], to the west, and [[Myanmar]], to the north and east. Most are part of the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] which are a [[Union Territory]] of India, while a small number in the north of the archipelago, including the [[Coco Islands]], belong to Myanmar.

The Andaman Islands are home to the [[Andamanese]], a group of indigenous people that includes a number of tribes, including the Jarawa and Sentinelese tribes.&lt;ref name=&quot;trained_news.au&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Police face-off with Sentinelese tribe as they struggle to recover slain missionary's body |url=https://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/incidents/police-faceoff-with-sentinelese-tribe-as-they-struggle-to-recover-slain-missionarys-body/news-story/a88d3780059939a5e11ebcfb556327ac |accessdate=26 November 2018 |publisher=News.com.au |date=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some of the islands can be visited with permits, entry to others, including North Sentinel Island, is banned by law. The [[Sentinelese]] are generally hostile to visitors and have had little contact with any other people. The government protects their right to privacy.
According to the immigration officials at Port Blair airport, citizens of China, Pakistan and Afghanistan are not allowed into the Andaman Islands including USA passport holders who were born in those three countries.

==History==
[[File:Andamanese comparative distribution.png|thumb|Comparative distributions of Andamanese indigenous peoples, pre-18C vs present-day]]

===Etymology===

The origin of the name Andaman is disputed and not well known.

In the 13th century, the name of Andaman appears in Chinese as ''Yen-to-man'' (晏陀蠻) in the book ''[[Zhu Fan Zhi]]'' by [[Zhao Rugua]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ZhuFanZhi&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Chau Ju-kua: His Work on the Chinese And Arab Trade in the Twelfth And Thirteenth Centuries, Entitled Chu-fan-chï |translator=  Friedrich Hirth |translator2=  William Woodville Rockhill |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924023289345/page/n161 |page=147 | year=1911 | publisher= St. Petersburg, Printing office of the Imperial academy of sciences  | quote=When sailing from lan-wu-li to si-lan, if the wind is not fair, ships maybe driven to a place called Yen-to-man. This is a group of two islands in the middle of the sea, one of them being large, the other small; the latter is quite uninhabited. ... The natives on it are of a colour resmbling black lacquer; they eat men alive, so that sailors dare not anchor on this coast. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter 38 of the book, ''Countries in the Sea'', Zhao Rugua specifies that going from Lambri (Sumatra) to Ceylon, it is an unfavourable wind which makes ships drift towards Andaman Islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZhuFanZhi&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the 15th century, Andaman was recorded as &quot;An-de-man mountain&quot; (安得蛮山) during the [[voyages of Zheng He]] in the [[Mao Kun map]] of the [[Wu Bei Zhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wu Bei Zhi Map 17 |url=https://www.loc.gov/resource/g7821rm.gct00058/?sp=17 |website=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early inhabitants===
The earliest [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence yet documented goes back some 2,200 years; however, the indications from [[genetics|genetic]], [[culture|cultural]] and isolation studies suggest that the islands may have been inhabited as early as the [[Middle Paleolithic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=16439647|quote= Andamanese, Tamil and Malayalam are the major languages spoken here|year= 2006|last1= Palanichamy|first1= M.

P.|doi= 10.1126/science.1120176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The indigenous [[Andamanese people]] appear to have lived on the islands in substantial isolation from that time until the 18th century.[[File:The Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal were said to be inhabited by wolf-headed people.jpg|thumb|left|The Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal were said to be inhabited by wolf-headed people, who were depicted in a &quot;book of wonders&quot; produced in Paris in the early 15th century.]]

===Chola empire===
[[Rajendra Chola I]] (1014 to 1042 AD) took over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/children/happy-in-havelock/article18376630.ece|title=Happy in HAVELOCK|last=Krishnan|first=Madhuvanti S.|date=4 May 2017|work=The Hindu|access-date=4 November 2019|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== British colonisation ===
In 1789, the [[Bengal Presidency]] established a naval base and [[penal colony]] on [[Chatham Island (Andaman)|Chatham Island]] in the southeast bay of [[South Andaman Island|Great Andaman]]. The settlement is now known as [[Port Blair]] (after the [[Bombay Marine]] lieutenant [[Archibald Blair]] who founded it). After two years, the colony was moved to the northeast part of [[North Andaman Island|Great Andaman]] and was named Port Cornwallis after Admiral [[William Cornwallis]]. However, there was much disease and death in the penal colony and the government ceased operating it in May 1796.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=957–958}}&lt;ref name=&quot;olivierblaise&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Andaman Islands, India | author=Blaise, Olivier | publisher=PictureTank | url=http://www.picturetank.com/___/series/ff5d5b4d962b08bc130471b877292c58/en/Andaman_Isl.,_India_(1).html | access-date=16 November 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715083143/http://www.picturetank.com/___/series/ff5d5b4d962b08bc130471b877292c58/en/Andaman_Isl.,_India_(1).html | archive-date=15 July 2011 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1824, Port Cornwallis was the rendezvous of the fleet carrying the army to the [[First Burmese War]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=958}} In the 1830s and 1840s, shipwrecked crews who landed on the Andamans were often attacked and killed by the natives and the islands had a reputation for cannibalism. The loss of the ''Runnymede'' and the ''Briton'' in 1844 during the same storm, while transporting goods and passengers between India and Australia, and the continuous attacks launched by the natives, which the survivors fought off, alarmed the British government.&lt;ref&gt;Kingston, W.H.G. (1873) ''Shipwrecks and Disasters at Sea''.  George Routledge and Sons, London.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, the government proposed another settlement on the islands, including a [[Cellular Jail|convict establishment]], but the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] forced a delay in its construction. However, because the rebellion gave the British so many prisoners, it made the new Andaman settlement and prison urgently necessary. Construction began in November 1857 at Port Blair using inmates' labour, avoiding the vicinity of a salt swamp that seemed to have been the source of many of the earlier problems at Port Cornwallis.

17 May 1859 was another major day for Andaman. The [[Battle of Aberdeen (Andaman Islands)|Battle of Aberdeen]] was fought between the [[Great Andamanese]] tribe and the British. Today, a memorial stands in Andaman water sports complex as a tribute to the people who lost their lives. Fearing foreign invasion and with help from an escaped convict from Cellular Jail, the Great Andamanese stormed the British post, but they were outnumbered and soon suffered heavy loss of life. Later, it was identified that an escaped convict named Doodnath had changed sides and informed the British about the tribe's plans. Today, the tribe has been reduced to some 50 people, with less than 50% of them adults. The government of the Andaman Islands is making efforts to increase the headcount of this tribe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rapidiq&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rapidiq.wordpress.com/2012/04/08/the-rise-and-the-fall-of-the-great-andamanese/|title=The Rise and Fall of the Great Andamanese|work=Confessions of a Linguist!|date=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, the ship ''Nineveh'' wrecked on the reef of North Sentinel Island. The 86 survivors reached the beach in the ship's boats. On the third day, they were attacked with iron-tipped spears by naked islanders. One person from the ship escaped in a boat and the others were later rescued by a British Royal Navy ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodheart&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-28578579_ITM | work=American Scholar | title=The Last Island of the Savages | date=22 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some time, sickness and mortality were high, but [[Land reclamation|swamp reclamation]] and extensive forest clearance continued. The Andaman colony became notorious with the murder of the Viceroy [[Richard Southwell Bourke, 6th Earl of Mayo]], on a visit to the settlement (8 February 1872), by a Muslim convict, a [[Pashtun people|Pathan]] from [[Afghanistan]], [[Sher Ali Afridi]]. In the same year, the two island groups Andaman and [[Nicobar Islands|Nicobar]], were united under a chief commissioner residing at Port Blair.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=958}}

From the time of its development in 1858 under the direction of James Pattison Walker, and in response to the mutiny and rebellion of the previous year, the settlement was first and foremost a repository for [[political prisoner]]s. The [[Cellular Jail]] at Port Blair, when completed in 1910, included 698 cells designed for solitary confinement; each cell measured {{convert|4.5|by|2.7|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} with a single ventilation window {{convert|3|m|ft|0}} above the floor. A notable prisoner there was [[Vinayak Damodar Savarkar]].

The Indians imprisoned here referred to the island and its prison as ''Kala Pani'' (&quot;black water&quot;);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andamancellularjail.org/History.htm |title=History of Andaman Cellular Jail |publisher=Andamancellularjail.org |accessdate=14 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209031136/http://www.andamancellularjail.org/History.htm |archivedate= 9 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a 1996 film set on the island took that term as its title, ''[[Kaalapani (1996 film)|Kaalapani]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0255289/ |title=Kala Pani (1996) |publisher=Imdb.com |accessdate=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of prisoners who died in this camp is estimated to be in the thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andamancellularjail.org/ListOfRevolutionaries.htm |title=Andaman Islands Political Prisoners |publisher=Andamancellularjail.org |accessdate=14 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906201654/http://www.andamancellularjail.org/ListOfRevolutionaries.htm |archivedate= 6 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many more died of harsh treatment and the harsh living and working conditions in this camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/12/21/stories/2005122107881100.htm |title=Opinion / News Analysis: Hundred years of the Andamans Cellular Jail |newspaper=The Hindu |date= 21 December 2005|accessdate=14 May 2010 |location=Chennai, India| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100511175419/http://www.hindu.com/2005/12/21/stories/2005122107881100.htm| archivedate= 11 May 2010 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Viper Chain Gang Jail on [[Viper Island]] was reserved for troublemakers, and was also the site of hangings. In the 20th century, it became a convenient place to house prominent members of India's independence movement.

===Japanese occupation===
[[File:Andaman ross is.jpg|thumb|Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island in 2004]]
[[File:Andaman.jpg|thumb|Andaman Islands]]
The Andaman and Nicobar islands were [[Japanese occupation of the Andaman Islands|occupied by Japan]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Klemen|last=L |url= http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/andaman.html |title= The capture of the Andaman Islands, March 1942 |date=1999–2000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941–1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands were nominally put under the authority of the [[Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind]] (Provisional Government of Free India) headed by [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], who visited the islands during the war, and renamed them as [[Shahid|Shaheed]] (Martyr) &amp; Swaraj (Self-rule). On 30 December 1943, during the Japanese occupation, Bose, who was allied with the Japanese, first raised the flag of Indian independence. General [[A. D. Loganathan|Loganathan]], of the [[Indian National Army]], was Governor of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which had been annexed to the Provisional Government. According to Werner Gruhl: &quot;Before leaving the islands, the Japanese rounded up and [[Japanese war crimes|executed 750 innocents]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gruhl, Werner (2007) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ow5Wlmu9MPQC&amp;pg=PA102 Imperial Japan's World War Two, 1931–1945]'', Transaction Publishers. {{ISBN|978-0-7658-0352-8}}. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since World War II===

At the close of World War II, the British government announced its intention to abolish the penal settlement. The government proposed to employ former inmates in an initiative to develop the island's fisheries, timber, and agricultural resources. In exchange, inmates would be granted return passage to the Indian mainland, or the right to settle on the islands. [[James Howard Williams|J H Williams]], one of the Bombay Burma Company's senior officials, was dispatched to perform a timber survey of the islands using convict labor. He recorded his findings in 'The Spotted Dear' (1957).

The penal colony was eventually closed on 15 August 1947 when India gained independence. It has since served as a museum to the independence movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/cellular-jail-india-integral-country-fight-freedom-independence-british-colony-andaman-and-nicobar-a7883691.html|title=How India's Cellular Jail was integral in the country's fight for freedom|date=11 August 2017|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=10 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1998, American photographer John S Callahan organised the first surfing project in the Andamans, starting from [[Phuket Province|Phuket]] in Thailand with the assistance of Southeast Asia Liveaboards (SEAL), a UK owned dive charter company.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} With a crew of international professional surfers, they crossed the Andaman Sea on the yacht ''Crescent'' and cleared formalities in Port Blair. The group proceeded to Little Andaman Island, where they spent ten days surfing several spots for the first time, including Jarawa Point near Hut Bay and the long right reef point at the southwest tip of the island, named Kumari Point. The resulting article in ''Surfer Magazine'', &quot;Quest for Fire&quot; by journalist Sam George, put the Andaman Islands on the surfing map for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surfermag.com/magazine/archivedissues/quest-for-fire |title=Surfer Explores The Andaman Islands |publisher=Surfer Magazine |website=Surfermag.com |date=22 July 2010 |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Footage of the waves of the Andaman Islands also appeared in the film ''Thicker than Water'', shot by [[documentary film]]maker [[Jack Johnson (musician)|Jack Johnson]], who later achieved worldwide fame as a popular musician.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Callahan went on to make several more surfing projects in the Andamans, including a trip to the Nicobar Islands in 1999.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

On 26 December 2004, the coast of the Andaman Islands was devastated by a {{convert|10|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-high}} tsunami following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], which is the longest recorded earthquake, lasting for between 500 and 600 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guinness Book of World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=The Jim Pattison Group|year=2013|isbn=978-1-908843-15-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/015 015]|via=|url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strong oral traditions in the area warned of the importance of moving inland after a quake and is credited with saving many lives.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} In the aftermath, more than 2,000 people were confirmed dead and more than 4,000 children were orphaned or had lost one parent.

In November 2018, [[John Allen Chau]], an American [[missionary]], traveled illegally with the help of local fishermen to the [[North Sentinel Island]] of the Andaman Islands chain group on several occasions, despite a travel ban to the island.

The Andaman Archipelago is an oceanic continuation of the Burmese [[Chin Hills|Arakan Yoma range]] in the North and of the [[List of islands of Indonesia|Indonesian Archipelago]] in the South. It has 325 islands which cover an area of {{convert|6408|km2|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=&quot;Planning Commission Report&quot;/&gt; with the [[Andaman Sea]] to the east between the islands and the coast of Burma.&lt;ref name=&quot;olivierblaise&quot; /&gt; [[North Andaman Island]] is {{convert|285|km}} south of Burma, although a few smaller Burmese islands are closer, including the three Coco Islands.

The [[Ten Degree Channel]] separates the Andamans from the [[Nicobar Islands]] to the south. The highest point is located in North Andaman Island ([[Saddle Peak (Andaman Islands)|Saddle Peak]] at {{convert|732|m|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;Planning Commission Report&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Andaman and Nicobar Islands Development Report|series=State Development Report series|author =Planning Commission of India|edition=illustrated|publisher=Academic Foundation|year=2008|isbn= 978-81-7188-652-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ujf2N5O4iKgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33}}

The subsoil of the Andaman islands consists essentially of [[Late Jurassic]] to [[Early Eocene]] [[ophiolite]]s and [[sedimentary rock]]s ([[argillite|argillaceous]] and [[algal limestone]]s), deformed by numerous deep [[fault (geology)|faults]] and [[thrust fault|thrust]]s with [[ultramafic]] igneous [[intrusion (geology)|intrusion]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;tsu&quot;/&gt; There are at least 11 [[mud volcano]]es on the islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;tsu&quot;&gt;Chakrabarti, P.; Nag, A.; Dutta, S. B.; Dasgupta, S. and Gupta, N. (2006) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5gEBfvCBclUC&amp;pg=PA42 S &amp; T Input: Earthquake and Tsunami Effects...]'', page 43. Chapter 5 in S. M. Ramasamy et al. (eds.), ''Geomatics in Tsunami'', New India Publishing. {{ISBN|81-89422-31-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate is typical of tropical islands of similar latitude. It is always warm, but with sea-breezes. Rainfall is irregular, usually dry during the north-east monsoons, and very wet during the south-west monsoons.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=956}}

==Flora==
The Middle Andamans harbour mostly moist [[deciduous forests]]. North Andamans is characterised by the wet evergreen type, with plenty of woody climbers.

The natural vegetation of the Andamans is tropical forest, with [[mangrove]]s on the coast. The rainforests are similar in composition to those of the west coast of Burma. Most of the forests are evergreen, but there are areas of deciduous forest on North Andaman, [[Middle Andaman Island|Middle Andaman]], [[Baratang]] and parts of [[South Andaman Island]]. The South Andaman forests have a profuse growth of [[epiphytic]] vegetation, mostly ferns and orchids.

The Andaman forests are largely unspoiled, despite logging and the demands of the fast-growing population driven by immigration from the Indian mainland. There are protected areas on [[Little Andaman Island|Little Andaman]], [[Narcondam Island|Narcondam]], North Andaman and South Andaman, but these are mainly aimed at preserving the coast and the marine wildlife rather than the rainforests.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=im0101 |name=Andaman Islands rain forests|accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Threats to wildlife come from introduced species including rats, dogs, cats and the elephants of [[Interview Island]] and North Andaman.

===Timber===
[[File:Timber.JPG|thumb|upright=1|right|Stilt houses in an Andamanese timber operation]]
Andaman forests contain 200 or more timber producing species of trees, out of which about 30 varieties are considered to be commercial. Major commercial timber species are Gurjan (''[[Dipterocarpus]]'' spp.) and [[Padauk]] (''[[Pterocarpus dalbergioides]]''). The following ornamental woods are noted for their pronounced grain formation:

* Marble wood (''[[Diospyros|Diospyros marmorata]]'')
* Padauk (''[[Pterocarpus dalbergioides]]'')
* Silver grey (a special formation of wood in white [[utkarsh]])
* Chooi (''[[Sageraea|Sageraea elliptica]]'')
* Kokko (''[[Albizzia lebbeck]]'')

Padauk wood is sturdier than teak and is widely used for furniture making.

There are [[burr wood]] and [[buttress root]] formations in Andaman Padauk. The largest piece of buttress known from Andaman was a dining table of {{convert|13|x|7|ft|abbr=on}}. The largest piece of burr wood was again a dining table for eight.

The [[Rudraksha]] (''Elaeocarps sphaericus'') and aromatic Dhoop-resin trees also are found here.

==Fauna==
[[File:The Coral Reef at the Andaman Islands.jpg|thumb|The coral reef at Havelock in Andaman]]

The Andaman Islands are home to a number of animals, many of them endemic. Andaman &amp; Nicobar islands are home to 10% of fauna species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singh&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/andaman-nicobar-islands-home-to-a-tenth-of-indias-fauna-species/article25592134.ece|title=Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands: home to a tenth of India's fauna species|last=Singh|first=Shiv Sahay|date=25 November 2018|work=The Hindu|access-date=10 November 2019|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands by ratio is only 0.25% of country's geographical area, has 11,009 species, according to a publication by the [[Zoological Survey of India]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Singh&quot;/&gt;

===Mammals===
The island's endemic mammals include
* [[Andaman spiny shrew]] (''Crocidura hispida'')
* [[Andaman shrew]] (''Crocidura andamanensis'')
* [[Jenkins's shrew]] (''Crocidura jenkinsi'')
* [[Andaman horseshoe bat]] (''Rhinolophus cognatus'')
* [[Andaman rat]] (''Rattus stoicus'')

The [[banded pig]] (''Sus scrofa vittatus''), also known as the Andaman wild boar and once thought to be an endemic subspecies,&lt;ref name=&quot;SrinivasuluSrinivasulu2012&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | title = South Asian Mammals: Their Diversity, Distribution, and Status | last1 = Srinivasulu | first1 = C. | last2 = Srinivasulu | first2 = B. | publisher = Springer | year = 2012 | page = 353 | isbn = 9781461434498}}&lt;/ref&gt; is protected by the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 (Sch I). The [[spotted deer]] (''Axis axis''), the [[Indian muntjac]] (''Muntiacus muntjak'') and the [[sambar deer|sambar]] (''Rusa unicolor'') were all introduced to the Andaman islands, though the sambar did not survive.

[[Interview Island]] (the largest wildlife sanctuary in the territory) in Middle Andaman holds a population of feral [[elephant]]s, which were brought in for forest work by a timber company and released when the company went bankrupt. This population has been subject to research studies.

===Birds===
Endemic or near endemic birds include
* ''[[Spilornis elgini]]'', a serpent-eagle
* ''[[Rallina canningi]]'', a crake (endemic; data-deficient per IUCN 2000)
* ''[[Columba palumboides]]'', a wood-pigeon
* ''[[Macropygia rufipennis]]'', a cuckoo dove
* ''[[Centropus andamanensis]]'', a subspecies of brown coucal (endemic)
* ''[[Otus balli]]'', the scops owl
* ''[[Ninox affinis]]'', a hawk-owl
* ''[[Rhyticeros narcondami]]'', the Narcondam hornbill
* ''[[Dryocopus hodgei]]'', a woodpecker
* ''[[Dicrurus andamanensis]]'', a drongo
* ''[[Dendrocitta bayleyii]]'', a treepie
* ''[[Sturnus erythropygius]]'', the white-headed starling
* ''[[Collocalia affinis]]'', the plume-toed swiftlet
* ''[[Aerodramus fuciphagus]]'', the edible-nest swiftlet
The islands' many [[cave]]s, such as those at [[Chalis Ek Caves|Chalis Ek]] are nesting grounds for the edible-nest [[swiftlet]], whose nests are prized in China for [[bird's nest soup]].&lt;ref name=&quot;soup&quot;&gt;Sankaran, R. (1998), ''[http://www.traffic.org/species-reports/traffic_species_birds8.pdf The impact of nest collection on the Edible-nest Swiftlet in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands]''. Sálim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History, Coimbatore, India.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reptiles and amphibians===
The islands also have a number of endemic [[reptile]]s, [[toad]]s and [[frog]]s, such as the [[Andaman cobra]] (''Naja sagittifera''), South Andaman krait (''[[Bungarus andamanensis]]'') and Andaman water monitor (''[[Varanus salvator andamanensis]]'').

There is a sanctuary {{convert|45|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from [[Havelock Island]] for [[saltwater crocodile]]s. Over the past 25 years there have been 24 crocodile attacks with four fatalities, including the death of American tourist Lauren Failla. The government has been criticised for failing to inform tourists of the crocodile sanctuary and danger, while simultaneously promoting tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author =Sacks, Ethan |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/nj-woman-killed-crocodile-attack-snorkeling-indian-coast-article-1.445025|title=NJ woman killed by crocodile attack while snorkeling off Indian coast|newspaper=NY Daily News |date= 6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crocodiles are not only found within the sanctuary, but throughout the island chain in varying densities. They are habitat restricted, so the population is stable but not large. Populations occur throughout available mangrove habitat on all major islands, including a few creeks on Havelock. The species uses the ocean as a means of travel between different rivers and estuaries, thus they are not as commonly observed in open ocean. It is best to avoid swimming near mangrove areas or the mouths of creeks; swimming in the open ocean should be safe, but it is best to have a spotter around.

==Religion==
Most of the tribal people in Andaman and Nicobar Islands believe in a religion that can be described as a form of [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[Animism]]. The tribal people of these islands believe that Paluga is the only deity and is responsible for everything happening on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Radcliffe-Brown, A. R. |title=The Andaman Islanders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iRJaAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA161|date=14 November 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-62556-3|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohanty, P.

People try to avoid any action that might displease Paluga. People belonging to this religion believe in the presence of souls, ghosts, and spirits. People of this religion put a lot of emphasis on dreams. They let dreams decide different courses of action in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = People of Andaman and Nicobar Islands|url = http://www.webindia123.com/territories/andaman/people/intro.htm|website = Webindia123.com|access-date = 31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other religions practiced in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are, in order of size, [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Sikhism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Baha'i Faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_data_finder/C_Series/Population_by_religious_communities.htm|title=Population by religious communities|publisher=censusindia.gov.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bahai.org/national-communities/andaman-and-nicobar-islands|title=Baha'i Community of Andaman and Nicobar Islands|last=Baha'i|website=Baha'i Community|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
[[File:A young Onge mother with her baby.jpg|thumb|200px|A young Onge mother with her child]]
{{As of|2011}}, the population of the Andaman was 343,125,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://india.gov.in/knowindia/ut_andaman.php |accessdate=3 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619045535/http://www.india.gov.in/knowindia/ut_andaman.php|publisher=india.gov.in|title=Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands |archivedate=19 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; having grown from 50,000 in 1960. The bulk of the population originates from immigrants who came to the island since the colonial times, mainly of [[Bengali people|Bengali]], [[Hindustani people|Hindustani]] and [[Tamil people|Tamil]] backgrounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;distadmin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andamandt.nic.in/profile.htm |title=Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands at a glance |publisher=Andamandt.nic.in |accessdate=14 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213201339/http://andamandt.nic.in/profile.htm |archivedate=13 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small minority of the population are the [[Andamanese people|Andamanese]] — the [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal inhabitants]] ([[adivasi]]) of the islands. When they first came into sustained contact with outside groups in the 1850s, there were an estimated 7,000 Andamanese, divided into the [[Great Andamanese]], [[Jarawa (Andaman Islands)|Jarawa]], [[Jangil]] (or ''Rutland Jarawa''), [[Onge people|Onge]], [[Sentinelese people|Sentinelese]], and the [[Shompen people|Shompen]] of Great Nicobar Island. The Great Andamanese formed 10 tribes of 5,000 people total.

As the numbers of settlers from the mainland increased (at first mostly prisoners and involuntary [[indentured labour]]ers, later purposely recruited farmers), these indigenous people lost territory and numbers in the face of punitive expeditions by British troops, land encroachment and various epidemic diseases.

Presently, there remain only approximately 400–450 indigenous Andamanese. The Jangil are extinct. Most of the Great Andamanese tribes are extinct, and the survivors, now just 52, speak mostly [[Bengali language|Bengali]].&lt;ref&gt;Malekar, Anosh (1 August 2011) [http://infochangeindia.org/Media/Languages-of-India/The-case-for-a-linguistic-survey.html &quot;The case for a linguisitic survey,&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927215058/http://infochangeindia.org/Media/Languages-of-India/The-case-for-a-linguistic-survey.html |date=27 September 2011 }} ''Infochange Media''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Onge are reduced to less than 100 people. Only the Jarawa and Sentinelese still maintain a steadfast independence and refuse most attempts at contact; their numbers are uncertain but estimated to be in the low hundreds.

==Government==
[[Port Blair]] is the chief community on the islands, and the administrative centre of the Union Territory. The Andaman Islands form a single administrative district within the Union Territory, the [[Andaman district]] (the Nicobar Islands were separated and established as the new [[Nicobar district]] in 1974).

==Cultural references==
The islands are prominently featured in [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s [[Sherlock Holmes]] 1890 mystery ''[[The Sign of the Four]].'' The magistrate in [[Lady Gregory]]'s play ''[[Spreading the News]]'' had formerly served in the islands.

[[M. M. Kaye]]'s 1985 novel ''Death in the Andamans'' and [[Marianne Wiggins]]' 1989 novel ''John Dollar'' are set in the islands. The latter begins with an expedition from Burma to celebrate King George's birthday, but turns into a grim survival story after an earthquake and tsunami. [[Priyadarshan]]'s 1996 film ''[[Kaalapani (1996 film)|Kaalapani]]'' (Malayalam; ''[[Sirai Chaalai]]'' in Tamil) depicts the Indian freedom struggle and the lives of prisoners in the [[Cellular Jail]] in Port Blair. ''Island's End'' is a 2011 novel by [[Padma Venkatraman]] about the training of an indigenous shaman. A principal character in the novel ''[[Six Suspects (novel)|Six Suspects]]'' by [[Vikas Swarup]] is from the Andaman Islands.

Brodie Moncur, the main protagonist of [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd's]] 2018 novel ''Love is Blind'', spends time in the Andaman Islands in the early years of the 20th century.

==Transportation==
The only commercial airport in the islands is [[Veer Savarkar International Airport]] in [[Port Blair]], which has scheduled services to [[Kolkata]], [[Chennai]], [[New Delhi]], [[Bengaluru]], [[Visakhapatnam]] and [[Bhubaneswar]]. The airport is under the control of the [[Indian Navy]]. Prior to 2016 only daylight operations were allowed; however, since 2016 night flights have also operated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|editor1=Roy, Sanjib Kumar|editor2=Sheekha, Andaman |title=Maiden night flight arrives in Isles|url=http://www.andamansheekha.com/2016/01/21/maiden-night-flight-arrives-in-isles-goair-flight-with-155-tourists-lands-at-vsi-airport-to-operate-chartered-flight-between-bengaluru-port-blair/|accessdate=21 January 2016|work= Andaman Sheekha|date=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small airstrip, about {{convert|1000|m|ft}} long, is located near the eastern shore of North Andaman near [[Diglipur]].

Due to the length of the routes and the small number of airlines flying to the islands, fares have historically been relatively expensive, although cheaper for locals than visitors. Fares are high during the peak seasons of spring and winter, although fares have decreased over time due to the expansion of the civil aviation industry in India.

There is also a ship service from Chennai, Visakhapatnam and Kolkata. The journey requires three days and two nights, and depends on weather.
