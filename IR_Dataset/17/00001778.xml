'''Acetylene''' ([[Chemical nomenclature|systematic name]]: '''ethyne''') is the [[chemical compound]] with the formula C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a [[hydrocarbon]] and the simplest [[alkyne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=R. H. Petrucci |author2=W. S. Harwood |author3=F. G. Herring | title = General Chemistry | edition = 8th | publisher = Prentice-Hall | date = 2002 | page = 1072}}&lt;/ref&gt; This colorless gas is widely used as a fuel and a chemical building block. It is unstable in its pure form and thus is usually handled as a solution.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; Pure acetylene is odorless, but commercial grades usually have a marked odor due to impurities.&lt;ref name=msds&gt;Compressed Gas Association (1995) [http://www.stoodyind.com/Safety/MSDS/Acetylene.pdf Material Safety and Data Sheet – Acetylene] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711030340/http://www.stoodyind.com/safety/msds/Acetylene.pdf |date=11 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alkyne, acetylene is [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|unsaturated]] because its two carbon atoms are [[Chemical bond|bonded]] together in a [[triple bond]]. The carbon–carbon triple bond places all four atoms in the same straight line, with CCH bond angles of 180°.&lt;ref&gt;Whitten K. W., Gailey K. D. and Davis R. E.

==Discovery==
Acetylene was discovered in 1836 by [[Edmund Davy]], who identified it as a &quot;new carburet of hydrogen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Davy (August 1836) [https://books.google.com/books?id=grtZAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA62#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false &quot;Notice of a new gaseous bicarburet of hydrogen&quot;], ''Report of the Sixth Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science …'', '''5''' :  62–63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an accidental discovery while attempting to isolate [[potassium]] metal. By heating potassium carbonate with carbon at very high temperatures, he produced a residue of what is now known as potassium carbide, (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which reacted with water to release the new gas. It was rediscovered in 1860 by French chemist [[Marcellin Berthelot]], who coined the name ''acétylène''.&lt;ref&gt;Bertholet (1860) [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3007r/f817.image &quot;Note sur une nouvelle série de composés organiques, le quadricarbure d'hydrogène et ses dérivés&quot;] (Note on a new series of organic compounds, tetra-carbon hydride and its derivatives), ''Comptes rendus'', series 3, '''50''' :  805–808.&lt;/ref&gt;
Berthelot's empirical formula for acetylene (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), as well as the alternative name &quot;quadricarbure d'hydrogène&quot; (''hydrogen quadricarbide''), were incorrect because chemists at that time used the wrong atomic mass for carbon (6 instead of 12).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
Berthelot was able to prepare this gas by passing vapours of organic compounds (methanol, ethanol, etc.) through a red-hot tube and collecting the [[effluent]]. He also found that acetylene was formed by sparking electricity through mixed [[cyanogen]] and [[hydrogen]] gases. Berthelot later obtained acetylene directly by passing hydrogen between the poles of a [[arc lamp|carbon arc]].&lt;ref&gt;Berthelot (1862) [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k30115/f640.image.langEN &quot;Synthèse de l'acétylène par la combinaison directe du carbone avec l'hydrogène&quot;] (Synthesis of acetylene by the direct combination of carbon with hydrogen), ''Comptes rendus'', series 3, '''54''' :  640–644.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chestofbooks.com/crafts/metal/Welding-Cutting/Acetylene.html Acetylene].&lt;/ref&gt; Commercially available acetylene gas could smell foul due to the impurities [[divinyl sulfide]] and [[phosphine]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

==Preparation==
Since the 1950s, acetylene has mainly been manufactured by the partial [[combustion]] of [[methane]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Habil|first1=Phil|last2=Sachsse|first2=Hans|title=Herstellung von Acetylen durch unvollständige Verbrennung von Kohlenwasserstoffen mit Sauerstoff [Production of acetylene by incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons with oxygen]|journal=Chemie Ingenieur Technik|date=1954|volume=26|issue=5|pages=245–253|doi=10.1002/cite.330260502}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Habil|first1=Phil|last2=Bartholoméa|first2=E.|title=Probleme großtechnischer Anlagen zur Erzeugung von Acetylen nach dem Sauerstoff-Verfahren [Problems of large-scale plants for the production of acetylene by the oxygen method]|journal=Chemie Ingenieur Technik|date=1954|volume=26|issue=5|pages=253–258|doi=10.1002/cite.330260503}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a recovered side product in production of [[ethylene]] by [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] of [[hydrocarbon]]s. Approximately 400,000 tonnes were produced by this method in 1983.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{Ullmann|doi=10.1002/14356007.a01_097.pub3|year=2008|last1=Pässler|first1=Peter|last2=Hefner|title=Acetylene Chemistry|first2=Werner|last3=Buckl|first3=Klaus|last4=Meinass|first4=Helmut|last5=Meiswinkel|first5=Andreas|last6=Wernicke|first6=Hans-Jürgen|last7=Ebersberg|first7=Günter|last8=Müller|first8=Richard|last9=Bässler|first9=Jürgen|last10=Behringer|first10=Hartmut|last11=Mayer|first11=Dieter|isbn=978-3527306732}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its presence in ethylene is usually undesirable because of its explosive character and its ability to poison [[Ziegler–Natta catalyst]]s. It is selectively hydrogenated into [[ethylene]], usually using Pd–Ag catalysts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.enotes.com/how-products-encyclopedia/acetylene Acetylene: How Products are Made] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070120055804/http://science.enotes.com/how-products-encyclopedia/acetylene |date=20 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1950s, when [[petroleum|oil]] supplanted [[coal]] as the chief source of [[redox|reduced]] carbon, acetylene (and the aromatic fraction from [[coal tar]]) was the main source of organic chemicals in the chemical industry. It was prepared by the [[hydrolysis]] of [[calcium carbide]], a reaction discovered by [[Friedrich Wöhler]] in 1862&lt;ref&gt;Wohler (1862) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6zIzAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA220#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false &quot;Bildung des Acetylens durch Kohlenstoffcalcium&quot;] (Formation of actylene by calcium carbide), ''Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie'', '''124''' :  220.&lt;/ref&gt; and still familiar to students:
: CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Calcium carbide production requires extremely high temperatures, ~2000&amp;nbsp;°C, necessitating the use of an [[electric arc furnace]]. In the US, this process was an important part of the late-19th century revolution in chemistry enabled by the massive [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] project at [[Niagara Falls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freeman|first=Horace|title=Manufacture of Cyanamide|journal=The Chemical News and the Journal of Physical Science|year=1919|volume=117|page=232|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5SAzAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=calcium+carbide#v=onepage&amp;q=calcium%20carbide&amp;f=false|accessdate=2013-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bonding==
In terms of [[valence bond theory]], in each carbon atom the 2s [[Atomic orbital|orbital]] [[Orbital hybridisation|hybridizes]] with one 2p orbital thus forming an sp hybrid. The other two 2p orbitals remain unhybridized. The two ends of the two sp hybrid [[orbital overlap]] to form a strong [[Sigma bond|σ valence bond]] between the carbons, while on each of the other two ends hydrogen atoms attach also by σ bonds. The two unchanged 2p orbitals form a pair of weaker [[pi bond|π bonds]].&lt;ref&gt;Organic Chemistry 7th ed. by J. McMurry, Thomson 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Since acetylene is a linear [[molecular symmetry|symmetrical molecule]], it possesses the D&lt;sub&gt;∞h&lt;/sub&gt; [[Molecular symmetry#Point group|point group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Housecroft3rd|pages=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical properties==

===Changes of state===
At atmospheric pressure, acetylene cannot exist as a liquid and does not have a melting point. The [[triple point]] on the [[phase diagram]] corresponds to the melting point (−80.8&amp;nbsp;°C) at the minimal pressure at which liquid acetylene can exist (1.27 atm). At temperatures below the triple point, solid acetylene can change directly to the [[vapour]] (gas) by [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]. The sublimation point at atmospheric pressure is −84.0&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Chemistry and Physics (60th ed., CRC Press 1979–80), p. C-303 in Table ''Physical Constants of Organic Compounds'' (listed as ''ethyne'').&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
At room temperature, the solubility of acetylene in [[acetone]] is 27.9 g per kg.  For the same amount of [[dimethylformamide]] (DMF), the solubility is 51 g.  At
20.26 bar, the solubility increases to 689.0 and 628.0 g for acetone and DMF, respectively.  These solvents are used in pressurized gas cylinders.&lt;ref name=Ull/&gt;

==Applications==

===Welding===
Approximately 20% of acetylene is supplied by the [[Industrial gas|industrial gases industry]] for [[oxyacetylene]] [[gas welding]] and [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|cutting]] due to the high temperature of the flame. Combustion of acetylene with oxygen produces a flame of over {{convert|3600|K|C F}}, releasing 11.8&amp;nbsp;[[Kilojoule|kJ]]/g. Oxyacetylene is the hottest burning common fuel gas.&lt;ref name=Linde2013&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linde-gas.com/en/products_and_supply/gases_fuel/acetylene.html |title=Acetylene |accessdate=2013-11-30 |publisher=Linde |website=Products and Supply &gt; Fuel Gases }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Acetylene is the third-hottest natural chemical flame after [[dicyanoacetylene]]'s {{convert|5260|K|C F}} and [[cyanogen]] at {{convert|4798|K|C F}}. [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|Oxy-acetylene welding]] was a popular welding process in previous decades. The development and advantages of [[arc welding|arc-based welding processes]] have made oxy-fuel welding nearly extinct for many applications. Acetylene usage for welding has dropped significantly. On the other hand, oxy-acetylene welding ''equipment'' is quite versatile – not only because the torch is preferred for some sorts of iron or steel welding (as in certain artistic applications), but also because it lends itself easily to brazing, braze-welding, metal heating (for annealing or tempering, bending or forming), the loosening of corroded nuts and bolts, and other applications. [[Bell Canada]] cable-repair technicians still use portable acetylene-fuelled torch kits as a [[soldering]] tool for sealing lead sleeve splices in [[manhole]]s and in some aerial locations. Oxyacetylene welding may also be used in areas where electricity is not readily accessible. As well, oxy-fuel cutting is still popular, and oxy-acetylene cutting is used in many metal fabrication shops. For use in welding and cutting, the working pressures must be controlled by a regulator, since above {{convert|15|psi|abbr=on}}, if subjected to a shockwave (caused, for example, by a [[flashback (welding)|flashback]]), acetylene [[decompose]]s explosively into [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esabna.com/euweb/oxy_handbook/589oxy3_3.htm ESAB Oxy-acetylene welding handbook – Acetylene properties].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portable lighting===
[[Calcium carbide]] was used to generate acetylene used in the lamps for portable or remote applications. It was used for miners and cavers before the widespread use of [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent lighting]]; or many years later low-power/high-lumen LED lighting; and is still used by mining industries in some nations without workplace safety laws. Carbide lamps were also used extensively as headlights in early motor vehicles and as an early light source for lighthouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uslhs.org/lighthouse-lamps-through-time|title=Lighthouse Lamps Through Time by Thomas Tag {{!}} US Lighthouse Society|website=uslhs.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plastics and acrylic acid derivatives===
Except in China, use of acetylene as a chemical feedstock has declined by 70% from 1965 to 2007 owing to cost and environmental considerations.
Acetylene can be [[semihydrogenation|semihydrogenated]] to [[ethylene]], providing a feedstock for a variety of [[polyethylene]] plastics. Another major application of acetylene, especially in China is its conversion to [[acrylic acid]] [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; These derivatives form products such as [[acrylic fiber]]s, [[Acrylic glass|glass]]es, [[Acrylic paint|paint]]s, [[Acrylic resin|resin]]s, and [[Acrylate polymer|polymer]]s.&lt;ref name=Takashi /&gt;

===Niche applications===
In 1881, the Russian chemist Mikhail Kucherov&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/cber.188101401320|title=Ueber eine neue Methode direkter Addition von Wasser (Hydratation) an die Kohlenwasserstoffe der Acetylenreihe|year=1881|last1=Kutscheroff|first1=M.|journal=Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft|volume=14|pages=1540–1542|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1425226/files/article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; described the [[Hydration reaction|hydration]] of acetylene to [[acetaldehyde]] using catalysts such as [[mercury(II) bromide]]. Before the advent of the [[Wacker process]], this reaction was conducted on an industrial scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Hydration of Acetylene: A 125th Anniversary |author1=Dmitry A. Ponomarev |author2=Sergey M. Shevchenko | journal = [[J. Chem. Educ.]] | volume = 84 | issue = 10 | year = 2007 | page = 1725 | url = http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/HS/Journal/Issues/2007/OctACS/ACSSub/p1725.pdf | doi = 10.1021/ed084p1725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[polymerization]] of acetylene with [[Ziegler–Natta catalyst]]s produces [[polyacetylene]] films. Polyacetylene, a chain of CH centres with alternating single and double bonds, was one of the first discovered [[organic semiconductor]]s. Its reaction with [[iodine]] produces a highly electrically conducting material. Although such materials are not useful, these discoveries led to the developments of [[organic semiconductor]]s, as recognized by the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 2000 to [[Alan J. Heeger]], [[Alan G MacDiarmid]], and [[Hideki Shirakawa]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

In the early 20th century acetylene was widely used for illumination, including street lighting in some towns.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0AnJU-hralEC The 100 most important chemical compounds: a reference guide].&lt;/ref&gt; Most early automobiles used [[carbide lamp]]s before the adoption of electric headlights.&lt;ref&gt;Grainger, D., (2001). By cars' early light: A short history of the headlamp: 1900s lights bore port and starboard red and green lenses. National Post. [Toronto Edition] DT7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Acetylene is sometimes used for [[carburization]] (that is, hardening) of steel when the object is too large to fit into a furnace.&lt;ref name=BOC2006&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boc.com/products_and_services/by_product/acetylene/index.asp |title=Acetylene |publisher=BOC |website=Products and Services |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517074022/http://boc.com/products_and_services/by_product/acetylene/index.asp |archivedate=2006-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acetylene is used to volatilize carbon in [[radiocarbon dating]]. The carbonaceous material in an archeological sample is treated with [[lithium]] metal in a small specialized research furnace to form [[lithium carbide]] (also known as lithium acetylide). The carbide can then be reacted with water, as usual, to form acetylene gas to feed into a [[mass spectrometer]] to measure the isotopic ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geyh, Mebus|title=Radiocarbon dating problems using acetylene as counting gas|journal=Radiocarbon|year=1990|volume=32|issue=3|pages=321–324|doi=10.2458/azu_js_rc.32.1278|url=https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/1278/1283|accessdate=2013-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural occurrence==
The energy richness of the C≡C triple bond and the rather high solubility of acetylene in water make it a suitable substrate for bacteria, provided an adequate source is available. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} A number of bacteria living on acetylene have been identified. The [[enzyme]] [[acetylene hydratase]] catalyzes the hydration of acetylene to give [[acetaldehyde]]:&lt;ref&gt;

Since such temperatures are highly unlikely on such a small distant body, this discovery is potentially suggestive of catalytic reactions within that moon, making it a promising site to search for prebiotic chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[The Planetary Society]] |author =Emily Lakdawalla |title=LPSC: Wednesday afternoon: Cassini at Enceladus |date=17 March 2006 |url=http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000498/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220053655/http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000498/ |archivedate=2012-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=445 | pages=376–377| date= 25 January 2007| doi = 10.1038/445376b| title= Planetary science: Inside Enceladus|author1=John Spencer |author2=David Grinspoon |pmid=17251967|issue=7126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
===Vinylation: hydration, hydrohalogenation, and related reactions===
In '''vinylation''' reactions, H-X compounds add across the triple bond. Alcohols and phenols add to acetylene to give [[enol ether|vinyl ether]]s.  Thiols give vinyl thioethers. Similarly, [[vinylpyrrolidone]] and [[vinylcarbazole]] are produced industrially by vinylation of [[2-Pyrrolidone|2-pyrrolidone]] and [[carbazole]].&lt;ref name=Ull&gt;{{Ullmann|first1=Albrecht Ludwig|last1=Harreus|first2=R.|last2=Backes|first3=J.-O.|last3=Eichler|first4=R.|last4=Feuerhake|first5=C. |last5=Jäkel|first6=U.|last6=Mahn|first7=R.|last7=Pinkos|first8=R.|last8=Vogelsang&quot;2-Pyrrolidone|year=2011|doi=10.1002/14356007.a22_457.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

The hydration of acetylene is a vinylation reaction, but the resulting vinyl alcohol isomerizes to [[acetaldehyde]]. The reaction is catalyzed by mercury salts.  This reaction once was the dominant technology for acetaldehyde production, but it has been displaced by the [[Wacker process]], which affords acetaldehyde by oxidation of [[ethylene]], a cheaper feedstock.  A similar situation applies to the conversion of acetylene to the valuable [[vinyl chloride]] by [[hydrochlorination]] vs the [[oxychlorination]] of ethylene.

===Addition to formaldehyde===
Acetylene adds to ketones and aldehydes in the presence of base catalysts.  With [[carbonyl group]]s to give [[Alpha and beta carbon|α]]-[[ethynyl]] alcohols in [[Alkynylation|ethynylation]] reactions:&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; [[Formaldehyde]] gives sequentially [[propargyl alcohol]] and [[butynediol]].
[[1,4-Butynediol]] is produced industrially in this way from [[formaldehyde]] and acetylene.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

===Organometallic chemistry===
Acetylene and its derivatives (2-butyne, diphenylacetylene, etc.) form [[Transition metal alkyne complex|complexes with transition metals]].  Its bonding to the metal is somewhat similar to that of ethylene complexes.  These complexes are intermediates in many catalytic reactions such as [[alkyne trimerisation]] to benzene, tetramerization to [[cyclooctatetraene]],&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; and carbonylation to [[hydroquinone]]:&lt;ref name=Cyclization /&gt;

In the presence of certain transition metals, alkynes undergo [[alkyne metathesis]].

Metal [[acetylide]]s, species of the formula L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;M-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R, are also common.  [[Copper(I) acetylide]] and [[silver acetylide]] can be formed in [[aqueous]] solutions with ease due to a poor [[solubility equilibrium]].&lt;ref name=Viehe /&gt;

===Acid-base reactions===

==Safety and handling==
Acetylene is not especially toxic, but when generated from [[calcium carbide]], it can contain toxic impurities such as traces of [[phosphine]] and [[arsine]], which give it a distinct [[garlic]]-like smell. It is also highly flammable, as are most light hydrocarbons, hence its use in welding. Its most singular hazard is associated with its intrinsic instability, especially when it is pressurized: under certain conditions acetylene can react in an [[exothermic]] addition-type reaction to form a number of products, typically [[benzene]] and/or [[vinylacetylene]], possibly in addition to [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Consequently, acetylene, if initiated by intense heat or a shockwave, can decompose explosively if the absolute pressure of the gas exceeds about {{convert|200|kPa|psi}}. Most regulators and pressure gauges on equipment report [[gauge pressure]], and the safe limit for acetylene therefore is 101&amp;nbsp;kPa&lt;sub&gt;gage&lt;/sub&gt;, or 15&amp;nbsp;psig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.c-f-c.com/specgas_products/acetylene.htm | title = Acetylene Specification | accessdate = 2012-05-02 | publisher = CFC StarTec LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://law.resource.org/pub/us/cfr/ibr/003/cga.g-1.2009.pdf|title=law.resource.org CGA g-1 2009 (incorporated by reference)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore supplied and stored dissolved in [[acetone]] or [[dimethylformamide]] (DMF),&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Industrial Gases&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Downie | first1 = N.
