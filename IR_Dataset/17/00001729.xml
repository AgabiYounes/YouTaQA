'''Amyntas I''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Ἀμύντας Aʹ; {{circa|540}}{{snd}}498 BC) was king of the ancient Macedonian kingdom of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]] (540 – 512 / 511 BC) and then a [[vassal]] of [[Darius I]] from 512/511 to his death 498 BC, at the time of [[Achaemenid Macedonia]]. He was a son of [[Alcetas I of Macedon]]. He married Eurydice and they had a son [[Alexander I of Macedon|Alexander]].

Amyntas was a [[vassal]] of [[Darius I]], king of the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]], since 512/511 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Roisman,Ian Worthington.

The history of Macedonia may be said to begin with Amyntas' reign. He was the first of its rulers to have diplomatic relations with other states.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}  
In particular, he entered into an alliance with [[Hippias (tyrant)|Hippias]] of [[Athens]], and when Hippias was driven out of Athens he offered him the territory of [[Anthemous|Anthemus]] on the [[Thermaic Gulf]] with the object of taking advantage of the feuds between the Greeks.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} 
Hippias refused the offer and also rejected the offer of [[Iolcos]], as Amyntas probably did not control Anthemous at that time, but was merely suggesting a plan of joint occupation to Hippias.&lt;ref&gt;Miltiades V.
