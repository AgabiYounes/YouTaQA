      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autpert Ambrose (Ambroise)''' ({{lang-la|'''Ambrosius Autpertus'''}}) (ca. 730 â€“ 784) was a [[Franks|Frankish]] [[Benedictine]] monk.

He became abbot of [[San Vincenzo al Volturno]] in South Italy in the time of [[Desiderius]], king of the [[Lombards]].  Autpert's election as [[abbot]] caused internal dissent at St. Vicenzo, and both [[Pope Stephen III]] and [[Charlemagne]] intervened.  The disagreement was based both on objections to Autpert's personality and to his Frankish origin.

He wrote a considerable number of works on the Bible and religious subjects generally. Among these are commentaries on the [[Apocalypse]], on the [[Psalms]], and on the [[Song of Solomon]]; ''Lives of Saints Paldo, Tuto and Vaso''; ''[[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]] of the Virgin''; and a ''Combat between the Virtues and the Vices''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Ambrose, Autpert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Pope [[Benedict XVI]] gave a homily about him in Saint Peter's square. In this homily, Autpert's death date is given as 784 (older scholarship had given a date between 778 and 779).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/article-25689?l=english On Ambrose Autpert, &quot;1st Mariologist of the West&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427023703/http://www.zenit.org/article-25689?l=english |date=April 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
