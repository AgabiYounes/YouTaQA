'''Amyl nitrite''' is a [[chemical compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;ONO. A variety of isomers are known, but they all feature an [[Pentyl|amyl]] group attached to the [[nitrite]] functional group. The alkyl group is unreactive and the chemical and biological properties are mainly due to the nitrite group. Like other [[alkyl nitrite]]s, amyl nitrite is bioactive in mammals, being a [[vasodilator]], which is the basis of its use as a prescription medicine. As an inhalant, it also has a [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] effect, which has led to its recreational use with its smell being described as that of old socks or dirty feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urban75.com/Drugs/drugamyl.html|title=Drugs - Amyl, Butyl or Isobutyl Nitrite, Nitrates, Poppers|work=urban75.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also referred to as banapple gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nordegren|first1=Thomas | name-list-format = vanc |title=The A-Z Encyclopedia of Alcohol and Drug Abuse|date=2002|publisher=Brown Walker Press|isbn=158112404X|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4yaGePenGKgC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=%22A-Z+Encyclopedia+of+Alcohol+and+Drug+Abuse%22|access-date=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
* Amyl nitrite is employed medically to treat [[ischaemic heart disease|heart disease]]s as well as [[Angina pectoris|angina]].
* Amyl nitrite is sometimes used as an antidote for [[cyanide poisoning]].&lt;ref name=&quot;detoxification48&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mason DT, Braunwald E | title = The effects of nitroglycerin and amyl nitrite on arteriolar and venous tone in the human forearm | journal = Circulation | volume = 32 | issue = 5 | pages = 755–66 | date = November 1965 | pmid = 4954412 | doi = 10.1161/01.cir.32.5.755 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can act as an [[oxidant]], to induce the formation of [[methemoglobin]]. [[Methemoglobin]] in turn can sequester [[cyanide]] as cyanomethemoglobin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Cyanide Antidotes: from Amyl Nitrite to Hydroxocobalamin – Which Antidote is Best?| author = Vale, J. A.| journal = [[Toxicology (journal)|Toxicology]]| year = 2001| volume = 168| issue = 1| pages = 37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Amyl nitrite is used as a [[cleaning agent]] and [[solvent]] in industrial and household applications. It replaced [[dichlorodifluoromethane]], an industrial chemical universally banned in 1996 due to damage to the [[ozone layer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/wiki/Substance:Dichlorodifluoromethane | title=Dichlorodifluoromethane at LearnChemistry (Royal Society of Chemistry)}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[printed circuit board]] cleaner.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} A very small amount is added to some [[perfumes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amylnitrite.org/amyl|title=Generic Amyl Nitrite for Purchase|work=amylnitrite.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is also used recreationally as an [[inhalant]] drug that induces a brief euphoric state, and when combined with other intoxicant stimulant drugs such as [[cocaine]] or [[MDMA]], the euphoric state intensifies and is prolonged. Once some stimulative drugs wear off, a common side effect is a period of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], colloquially called a &quot;come down&quot;; amyl nitrite is sometimes used to combat these negative after-effects.  This effect, combined with its dissociative effects, has led to its use as a recreational drug (see  [[poppers]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;detoxification48&quot;&gt;AJ Giannini, AE Slaby, MC Giannini.

==Nomenclature==
The term &quot;amyl nitrite&quot; encompasses several [[isomer]]s.  For example, a common form of amyl nitrite with the formula (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ONO may be more specifically referred to as isoamyl nitrite.   When the amyl group is a [[Alkane#Linear alkanes|linear or normal (n)]] [[alkyl]] group, the resulting amyl nitrite would have the structural formula CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;ONO.

The similarly-named [[amyl nitrate]] has very different properties. At the same time, [[isopropyl nitrite]] has a similar structure and similar uses (also called 'poppers') but with worse side-effects.

==Synthesis and reactions==
Alkyl nitrites are prepared by the reaction of [[alcohol]]s with [[nitrous acid]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | vauthors = Noyes WA |author-link=William A. Noyes |year=1943 |title=n-Butyl Nitrite |volume= |pages= |collvol=2 |collvolpages=108 |prep=CV2P0108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:ROH  +  HONO  →  RONO  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, where R = alkyl group

The reaction is called [[esterification]]. Synthesis of alkyl nitrites is, in general, straightforward and can be accomplished in home laboratories. A common procedure includes the dropwise addition of concentrated sulfuric acid to a cooled mixture of an aqueous sodium nitrite solution and an alcohol. The intermediately-formed stoichiometric mixture of nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide then converts the alcohol to the alkyl nitrite, which, due to its low density, will form an upper layer that can be easily [[Decantation|decanted]] from the reaction mixture.

Isoamyl nitrite decomposes in the presence of base to give nitrite salts and the [[Amyl alcohol|isoamyl alcohol]]:
:C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;ONO  +  NaOH  → C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;OH  +  [[sodium nitrite|NaNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

Amyl nitrite, like other alkyl nitrites, reacts with [[carbanion]]s to give [[oxime]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | vauthors = Chen YK, Jeon SJ, Walsh PJ, Nugent WA | title = (2S)-(−)-3-exo-(Morpholino)isoborneol ((−)-MIB) | volume = 82 | pages = 87 | year = 2005 | prep = v82p0087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amyl nitrites are also useful as reagents in a modification of the [[Sandmeyer reaction]].  The reaction of the alkyl nitrite with an aromatic [[amine]] in a halogenated solvent produces a [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] aromatic species, this then frees a [[halogen]] atom from the solvent.  For the synthesis of [[Organoiodine compound|aryl iodide]]s [[diiodomethane]] is used,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = William B. | last2 = Ho | first2 = Oliver Chenpu | name-list-format = vanc | title = Application of the isoamyl nitrite-diiodomethane route to aryl iodides | journal = The Journal of Organic Chemistry | volume = 55 | pages = 2543–2545 | year = 1990 | doi = 10.1021/jo00295a056 | issue = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cornforth | first1 = John | last2 = Kumar | first2 = Ashok | last3 = Stuart | first3 = Alan S. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Synthesis of substituted dibenzophospholes.

==Physiological effects==

Amyl nitrite, in common with other [[alkyl nitrites]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Nickerson M, Parker JO, Lowry TP, Swenson EW | title = Isobutyl Nitrite and Related Compounds. | location = San Francisco California | publisher = PHARMEX | date = 1979 | url = http://www.virusmythpoppersmyth.org/isobutyl_nitrite_and_rela/files/IBNtextnpttypepad.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927023207/http://www.virusmythpoppersmyth.org/isobutyl_nitrite_and_rela/files/IBNtextnpttypepad.pdf | archive-date=2007-09-27 | edition = 1st }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a potent [[vasodilator]]; it expands [[blood vessel]]s, resulting in lowering of the [[blood pressure]]. Amyl nitrite may be used during cardiovascular stress testing in patients with suspected hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to cause vasodilation and thereby reduce afterload and worsen an otherwise occult left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Alkyl nitrites are a source of [[nitric oxide]], which signals for relaxation of the [[Cardiac muscle|involuntary muscles]]. Physical effects include decrease in blood pressure, headache, flushing of the face, increased heart rate, dizziness, and relaxation of involuntary muscles, especially the [[blood vessel]] walls and the [[internal anal sphincter|internal]] and [[external anal sphincter]]. There are no [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms. [[Overdose]] symptoms include [[nausea]], [[emesis|vomiting]], [[hypotension]], [[hypoventilation]], [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], and [[fainting]]. The effects set in very quickly, typically within a few seconds and disappear within a few minutes.  Amyl nitrite may also intensify the experience of [[synesthesia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Cytowic]], ''[[The Man Who Tasted Shapes]]'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
