'''Albert Brooks''' (born '''Albert Lawrence Einstein'''; July 22, 1947) is an American actor, comedian, writer and director. He received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for 1987's ''[[Broadcast News (film)|Broadcast News]]'' and was widely praised for his performance in the 2011 film ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmsite.org/aa87.html &quot;Academy Awards 1987&quot;]. filmsite.org.&lt;/ref&gt; His voice acting credits include Marlin in ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' (2003) and ''[[Finding Dory]]'' (2016), Tiberius in ''[[The Secret Life of Pets]]'' (2016) and recurring guest voices for ''[[The Simpsons]]'', including Russ Cargill in ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'' (2007) and Hank Scorpio.

He has written, directed, and starred in several comedy films, such as ''[[Modern Romance (film)|Modern Romance]]'' (1981), ''[[Lost in America]]'' (1985), and ''[[Defending Your Life]]'' (1991). He is also the author of ''[[2030 (novel)|2030: The Real Story of What Happens to America]]'' (2011).

==Early life==
Brooks was born Albert Lawrence Einstein into a [[Jewish]] show business family in [[Beverly Hills]], California,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egothemag.com/archives/2006/01/comedy_in_the_m.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210221819/http://www.egothemag.com/archives/2006/01/comedy_in_the_m.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 10, 2006 |title=Comedy in The Muslim World |work=EGO Magazine |date=January 2006 |first=Rachel |last=Astarte Piccione }}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Thelma Leeds]] (née Goodman), a singer and actress, and [[Harry Einstein]], a radio comedian who performed on [[Eddie Cantor]]'s radio program and was known as &quot;Parkyakarkus&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/60/Albert-Brooks.html Albert Brooks Biography (1947–)]. filmreference.com&lt;/ref&gt; His brothers are the late comedic actor [[Bob Einstein]], better known as a character he created named &quot;[[Super Dave Osborne]]&quot;, and for a recurring role in ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''; and Cliff Einstein, a partner and longtime chief creative officer at Los Angeles advertising agency Dailey &amp; Associates. His half-brother was [[Charles Einstein]], a writer for such television programs as ''[[Playhouse 90]]'' and ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]''. His grandparents emigrated from Austria and Russia. He grew up among show business families in southern California, attending [[Beverly Hills High School]] with [[Richard Dreyfuss]] and [[Rob Reiner]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Peter (January 22, 2006). [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BN&amp;p_theme=bn&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=10F58714871BD6E8&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM &quot;The background on Albert Brooks&quot;]. ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Buffalo News]]''. Accessed April 24, 2008. &quot;Albert Brooks, who grew up in a showbiz family and attended Beverly Hills High School, has never been interested in being an outsider.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
Brooks attended [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh]], but dropped out after one year to focus on his comedy career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://people.com/archive/mother-lode-vol-47-no-3/|title=Mother Lode|last=Lambert|first=Pam|date=January 27, 1997|work=People Magazine|access-date=March 4, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of 19, he had changed his professional name to Albert Brooks, joking that &quot;the real [[Albert Einstein]] changed his name to sound more intelligent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCall|first1=Cheryl|title=Psst! Albert Brooks Isn't Kin to Mel Except in Comedy|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20073410,00.html|website=people.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He began a comedy career and quickly became a regular on variety and talk shows during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Brooks led a new generation of self-reflective baby-boomer comics appearing on NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. His onstage persona, that of an [[egotistical]], [[narcissistic]], nervous comic, an ironic showbiz insider who punctured himself before an audience by disassembling his mastery of comedic stagecraft, influenced other '70s [[post-modern]] comedians, including [[Steve Martin]], [[Martin Mull]], and [[Andy Kaufman]].

After two successful comedy albums, ''Comedy Minus One'' (1973) and the [[Grammy Award]]–nominated ''A Star Is Bought'' (1975), Brooks left the stand-up circuit to try his hand as a filmmaker. He had already made his first short film, ''The Famous Comedians School'', a satiric short and an early example of the [[mockumentary]] subgenre that was aired in 1972 on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] show ''[[The Great American Dream Machine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey Ess, [http://splitsider.com/2013/01/the-short-films-of-albert-brooks/ &quot;The Short Films of Albert Brooks&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214022718/http://splitsider.com/2013/01/the-short-films-of-albert-brooks |date=February 14, 2015 }}, January 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Brooks directed six short films for the first season of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'':
* October 11, 1975, episode (host: [[George Carlin]]): &quot;The Impossible Truth&quot;
* October 18, 1975, episode (host: [[Paul Simon]]): failed ''[[Candid Camera]]'' stunts and home movies
* October 25, 1975, episode (host: [[Rob Reiner]]): heart surgery
* November 8, 1975, episode (host: [[Candice Bergen]]): upcoming season
* December 13, 1975, episode (host: [[Richard Pryor]]): sick
* January 10, 1976, episode (host: [[Elliott Gould]]): audience test screening

In 1976, he appeared in his first mainstream film role, in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s landmark ''[[Taxi Driver]]''; Scorsese allowed Brooks to improvise much of his dialogue. Brooks had landed the role after moving to Los Angeles to enter the film business. In an interview, Brooks mentioned a conversation he had had with ''Taxi Driver'' screenwriter [[Paul Schrader]], in which Schrader said that Brooks's character was the only one in the movie that he could not &quot;understand&quot; – a remark that Brooks found amusing, as the movie's antihero was a psychotic loner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2003/05/30/albert-brooks-takes-look-back-his-career/|title=Albert Brooks takes a look back on his career|website=EW.com|language=en|access-date=December 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks directed his first feature film, ''[[Real Life (1979 film)|Real Life]]'', in 1979. The film, in which Brooks (playing a version of himself) films a typical suburban family in an effort to win both an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] and a Nobel Prize, was a sendup of [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]'s ''[[An American Family]]'' documentary. It has also been viewed as foretelling the future emergence of [[reality television]].&lt;ref&gt;Montoya, Maria (February 28, 2009). [http://blog.nola.com/davewalker/2009/02/albert_brooks_real_life_film_i.html &quot;Albert Brooks 'Real Life' film is an unexpected classic&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709130050/http://blog.nola.com/davewalker/2009/02/albert_brooks_real_life_film_i.html |date=July 9, 2011 }}. ''[[The Times-Picayune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks also made a cameo appearance in the film ''[[Private Benjamin (1980 film)|Private Benjamin]]'' (1980), starring [[Goldie Hawn]]. (He got starring credits in the film, although his character dies within roughly the first half-hour of the film.)

===1981–1999===
Through the 1980s and 1990s, Brooks co-wrote (with longtime collaborator [[Monica Johnson]]), directed and starred in a series of well-received comedies, playing variants on his standard neurotic and self-obsessed character. These include [[1981 in film|1981's]] ''[[Modern Romance (film)|Modern Romance]]'', where Brooks played a film editor desperate to win back his ex-girlfriend ([[Kathryn Harrold]]). The film received a limited release and ultimately grossed under $3&amp;nbsp;million domestically.&lt;ref name=&quot;modgross&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= Modern Romance box office |publisher=boxofficemojo.com| url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=modernromance.htm | accessdate=March 12, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060319105856/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=modernromance.htm| archivedate= March 19, 2006 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was well received by critics, with one reviewer commenting that the film was &quot;not Brooks at his best, but still amusing&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;modreviews&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Modern Romance (1981) |publisher=rottentomatoes.com | work=| url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/modern_romance/ | accessdate=March 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; His best-received film, ''[[Lost in America]]'' (1985), featured Brooks and [[Julie Hagerty]] as a couple who leave their [[yuppie]] lifestyle and drop out of society to live in a motor home as they have always dreamed of doing, meeting disappointment.

Brooks's ''[[Defending Your Life]]'' (1991) placed his lead character in the [[afterlife]], put on trial to justify his human fears and determine his cosmic fate. Critics responded to the offbeat premise and the chemistry between Brooks and [[Meryl Streep]], as his post-death love interest. His later efforts did not find large audiences, but still retained Brooks's touch as a filmmaker. He garnered positive reviews for ''[[Mother (1996 film)|Mother]]'' (1996), which starred Brooks as a middle-aged writer moving back home to resolve tensions between himself and his mother ([[Debbie Reynolds]]). [[1999 in film|1999's]] ''[[The Muse (1999 film)|The Muse]]'' featured Brooks as a Hollywood screenwriter who has &quot;lost his edge&quot;, using the services of an authentic [[muse]] ([[Sharon Stone]]) for inspiration. In an interview with Brooks with regards to ''The Muse'', Gavin Smith wrote, &quot;Brooks's distinctive film making style is remarkably discreet and unemphatic; he has a light, deft touch, with a classical precision and economy, shooting and cutting his scenes in smooth, seamless successions of medium shots, with clean, high-key lighting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Film Comment'', Jan/Feb 1999, [http://www.filmcomment.com/article/all-the-choices-albert-brooks-interview All The Choices: Albert Brooks Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks has appeared as a guest voice on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' seven times during its run (always under the name ''A. Brooks''). He is described as the best guest star in the show's history by [[IGN]], particularly for his role as supervillain [[Hank Scorpio]] in the episode &quot;[[You Only Move Twice]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/730/730566p5.html|title=Top 25 Simpsons Guest Appearances|accessdate=March 25, 2007|author1=Goldman, Eric |author2=Iverson, Dan |author3=Zoromski, Brian |website=IGN| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070308101151/http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/730/730566p5.html| archivedate= March 8, 2007 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks also acted in other writers' and directors' films during the 1980s and 1990s. He had a cameo in the opening scene of ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'', playing a driver whose passenger ([[Dan Aykroyd]]) has a shocking secret. In [[James L. Brooks]]'s hit ''[[Broadcast News (film)|Broadcast News]]'' (1987), Albert Brooks was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for playing an insecure, supremely ethical [[television network|network TV]] [[reporter]], who offers the rhetorical question, &quot;Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?&quot; He also won positive notices for his role in [[1998 in film|1998's]] ''[[Out of Sight (1998 film)|Out of Sight]]'', playing an untrustworthy banker and ex-convict.

===2000–present===
Brooks received positive reviews for his portrayal of a dying retail store owner who befriends disillusioned teen [[Leelee Sobieski]] in ''[[My First Mister]]'' (2001). Brooks continued his voiceover work in [[Pixar]]'s ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' (2003), as the voice of Marlin, one of the film's protagonists.

In 2005, his film ''[[Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World]]'' was dropped by [[Sony Pictures]] due to their desire to change the title. [[Warner Independent Pictures]] purchased the film and gave it a limited release in January 2006; the film received mixed reviews and a low box office gross. As with ''[[Real Life (1979 film)|Real Life]]'', Brooks plays a fictionalized &quot;Albert Brooks&quot;, a filmmaker ostensibly commissioned by the U.S. government to see what makes the Muslim people laugh, and sending him on a tour of India and Pakistan.

In 2006 he appeared in the documentary film ''[[Wanderlust (2006 film)|Wanderlust]]'' as David Howard from ''Lost in America''. The documentary included many other well-known people. In 2007, he continued his long-term collaboration with ''The Simpsons'' by voicing Russ Cargill, the central antagonist of ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''.

He has played Lenny Botwin, [[Nancy Botwin]]'s estranged father-in-law, on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime's]] television series ''[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ausiello, Michael (April 14, 2008). [http://www.tvguide.com/news/Weeds-Scoop-Albert-8084.aspx &quot;Weeds Scoop: Albert Brooks Is Nancy's 'Dad'&quot;]. ''[[TV Guide]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Martin's Press]] published his first novel, ''[[2030 (novel)|2030: The Real Story of What Happens to America]]'', on May 10, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maslin|first=Janet|title=A Wry Eye on Problems of the Future|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/books/albert-brookss-2030-his-first-novel-review.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Brooks co-starred as the vicious gangster Bernie Rose, the main antagonist in the film ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'', alongside [[Ryan Gosling]] and [[Carey Mulligan]]. His performance received much critical praise and positive reviews, with several critics proclaiming Brooks' performance as one of the film's best aspects. After receiving awards and nominations from several film festivals and critic groups, but not an Academy Award nomination, Brooks responded humorously on [[Twitter]], &quot;And to the Academy: ‘You don't like me. You really don't like me’.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=January 24, 2012 |title=Albert Brooks not nominated for Oscar: ‘I got ROBBED ... I mean literally.

In 2016, Brooks voiced Tiberius, a curmudgeonly red-tailed hawk in ''[[The Secret Life of Pets]]'', and reprised the role of Marlin from ''Finding Nemo'' in the 2016 sequel ''[[Finding Dory]]''. ''Dory'' is Brooks's largest grossing film to date.

==Personal life==
In 1997, Brooks married artist [[Kimberly Brooks (artist)|Kimberly Shlain]], daughter of surgeon and writer [[Leonard Shlain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/22/movies/film-a-funnyman-whose-muse-is-in-the-mirror.html |work=The New York Times |date=August 22, 1999 |title=A Funnyman Whose Muse is in the Mirror |first=Margy |last=Rochlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have two children, Jacob and Claire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/01/albert-brooks-this-is-40 | last=Apatow | first=Judd | title=Our Mr. Brooks | website=Vanity Fair | date=January 2013 | access-date=June 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
