The '''Muslim conquests of [[Afghanistan]]''' began during the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] as the [[Arab Muslims]] migrated eastwards to [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], [[Sistan]] and [[Transoxiana]]. 15 years after the [[Battle of Nahāvand]], they controlled all [[Sassanid Empire|Sasanian]] domains except parts of Afghanistan and [[Makran]].&lt;ref name=Hind/&gt; Fuller [[Islamization]] wasn't achieved until the period between 10th and 12th centuries under [[Ghaznavid]] and [[Ghurid dynasty]]'s rule who patronized Muslim religious institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6swDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjfy8OZrorZAhWIOY8KHTMnAtA4ChDoAQg6MAU#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Afghanistan's Islam: From Conversion to the Taliban|author=Nile Green|pages=39|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geographer [[Ya'qubi]] states that the rulers of [[Bamiyan]], called the ''Sher'', converted in the late 8th century.

The [[Afghan (ethnonym)|Afghan]] habitat during their conquest by Mahmud was located in the [[Sulaiman Mountains]] in the South of Afghanistan. They were enlisted by both [[Sabuktigin]] and Mahmud according to ''[[Tarikh Yamini|Tarikh-i-Yamini]]''.&lt;ref name=Ninhar/&gt; Prior to Pashtun migration to the Kabul River valley, Tajiks formed the dominant population of [[Kabul]], [[Nangarhar]], [[Logar province|Logar valley]] and [[Laghman Province|Laghman]] in east Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Harlan 1939:127&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pashtuns]] later began migrating westward from Sulaiman mountains in the South, and displaced or subjugated the indigenous populations such as [[Tajiks]], [[Hazaras]], the [[Farsiwan]]is, before or during 16th and 17th centuries. The successive wave of Pashtun immigration displaced the original ''[[Nuristanis|Kafir]]'' and [[Pashayi people|Pashayi]] people from [[Kunar Valley]] and Laghman valley, the two eastern provinces near [[Jalalabad]], to the less fertile mountains.&lt;ref name=DostMuhammad/&gt;

Before their conversion, the ''Kafir'' people of [[Kafiristan]] practiced a form of [[ancient Hinduism]] infused with locally developed accretions.&lt;ref name=&quot;nuristan.info&quot;/&gt; Previously the region from [[Nooristan]] to [[Kashmir]] was called ''Peristan'' and was host to a vast number of &quot;Kafir&quot; cultures.&lt;ref name=academia/&gt; They were called Kafirs due to their enduring paganism, remaining politically independent until being conquered and forcibly converted by Afghan Amir [[Abdul Rahman Khan]] in 1895–1896&lt;ref name=Pellat/&gt; while others also converted to avoid paying ''[[jizya]]''.&lt;ref name=Katib/&gt;

During the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], the [[Arab people|Arabs]] were drawn eastwards from the Iraqi plains to central and eastern Persia, then to [[Media (region)|Media]], into [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], [[Sistan]] and [[Transoxania]]. 15 years after the [[Battle of Nahāvand]], the Arabs controlled all Sasanian domain except the parts of Afghanistan and [[Makran]].&lt;ref name=Hind&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2m7_R5P2oAC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiD8_OOoYrZAhVFOo8KHSCICQ4Q6AEIOTAE#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Al- Hind: The slave kings and the Islamic conquest. 2|author=André Wink|page=120|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nancy Dupree]] states that advancing Arabs carrying the religion of Islam easily took over Herat and Sistan, but the other areas often revolted and converted back to their old faiths whenever the Arab armies withdrew. The harshness of the Arab rule caused the native dynasties to revolt after the Arab power weakened like the Saffarids founded by the zealous [[Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar|Yaqub]] who conquered many cities of the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dupree&quot;&gt;[[Nancy Dupree|Dupree, Nancy]] (1971) &quot;Sites in Perspective (Chapter 3)&quot; ''An Historical Guide To Afghanistan'' Afghan Tourist Organization, Kabul, [http://worldcat.org/oclc/241390 OCLC 241390]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mediaeval Islamic scholars divided modern-day Afghanistan into two regions - the provinces of Khorasan and [[Sistan]]. Khorasan was the eastern [[satrapy]] of [[Sasanian Empire]], containing Balkh and Herat. Sistan included a number of Afghan cities and regions including [[Ghazna]], [[Zarang]], [[Lashkargah|Bost]], [[Qandahar]] (also called [[Arachosia|al-Rukhkhaj]] or [[Zamindawar]]), [[Kabul]], [[Kabulistan]] and [[Zabulistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6swDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjfy8OZrorZAhWIOY8KHTMnAtA4ChDoAQg6MAU#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Afghanistan's Islam: From Conversion to the Taliban|author=Nile Green|pages=43, 44|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Muslim rule, the regions of [[Balkh]] ([[Bactria]] or ''Tokharistan''), [[Herat]] and [[Sistan]] were under Sasanian rule. Further south in Balkh region, in [[Bamiyan]], indication of Sasanian authority diminishes, with a local dynasty seeming ruling from the [[late antiquity]], probably [[Hepthalite]]s subject to the [[Yabgu]] of [[Western Turkic Khaganate|Western Turks]]. While Herat was controlled by Sasanians, its hinterlands were controlled by northern Hepthalites who continued to rule the [[Ghur]]id mountains and river valleys well into the Islamic era. Sistan was under Arabs but Qandahar remained out of Arab rule. Kabul and Zabulistan, housed Indic religions with the [[Zunbils]] and [[Kabul Shahis]] offering stiff resistance to Muslim rule for two centuries until [[Saffarid]] and [[Ghaznavid]] conquests.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6swDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjfy8OZrorZAhWIOY8KHTMnAtA4ChDoAQg6MAU#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Afghanistan's Islam: From Conversion to the Taliban|author=Nile Green|pages= 44, 46–47|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Afghanistan, the frontier of the Islamic conquest had become more or less stationary by the end of the first century of Hijri calendar. One reason was the relative importance of [[Sistan]] and [[Baluchistan]] had begun to diminish by the time of [[Mu'awiyah I]], when the conquests of [[Bactria]] and [[Transoxania]] were undertaken. In addition, the conquest in the eastern direction were extended to [[Makran]] and [[Sind]], with Muslim colonies becoming established there in 711-12.&lt;ref name=André&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bCVyhH5VDjAC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj75ZmSqIrYAhUHLo8KHdpJD44Q6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Al- Hind: The slave kings and the Islamic conquest. 2|author=André Wink|page=120|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sistan===

The earlier Arabs called [[Sistan]] as ''Sijistan'', from the [[Middle Persian|Persian]] ''Sagestan''. It is a lowland region, lying round and eastwards from the Zarah lake, which includes deltas of [[Helmand River|Helmand]] and other rivers which drain into it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UJqxGH_QuXcC&amp;pg=PA334&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJh9rm1YrYAhXMnZQKHQ_JBSkQ6AEIKDAB#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The Lands of the Eastern Caliphate|author=[[Guy Le Strange]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim conquest of Sistan began in 23 [[Hijri year|A.H.]] (643-644 A.D.) when [[Asim ibn 'Amr al-Tamimi|Asim bin Amr]] and [[Abdallah ibn Amir]] invaded the region and besieged Zaranj. The Sistanis concluded a treaty with Muslims, mandating them to pay the [[kharaj]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress|volume= 59|title=Sistan's transition to Islam in historical perspective|page=914|publisher=[[Indian History Congress]]|first=Hamiddulah|last=Marazi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cash-strapped [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] king [[Yazdegerd III]] who had a large retinue, had fled to [[Carmania (region)|Kerman]] in 650. He had to flee from Kerman to Sistan after his arrogance angered the [[marzban]] of the place, eluding an Arab force from [[Basra]] which defeated and killed the marzban. Yazdegerd lost the support of governor of Sistan after demanding taxes from him and had to leave for [[Merv]].&lt;ref name=Daryaee/&gt; It is not known whether this governor was a Sasanian prince or a local ruler at that time. The Arabs had campaigned in Sistan a few years earlier and Abdallah b. Amir had now gone in pursuit of Yazdegerd. He arrived in Kirman in 651 and sent a force under [[Rabi ibn Ziyad al-Harithi]] to Sistan.&lt;ref name=Frye&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hvx9jq_2L3EC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjkyb-osYrYAhWHNo8KHffpCU0Q6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 4|author=[[Richard N. Frye]]|page=24|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabi crossed the desert between Kirman and Sistan, reaching the fortress of Zilaq which was within five [[Parasang|farsangs]] of the Sistan frontier. The fort was surrendered by its [[dihqan]].&lt;ref name=Frye/&gt; The fortress of Karkuya, whose [[fire temple]] is mentioned in the anonymously authored ''[[Tarikh-i Sistan|Tarikh-e-Sistan]]'', along with Haysun and Nashrudh, surrendered to Rabi.&lt;ref name=Daryaee&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jxd2Zr9Ilw8C&amp;pg=PA214&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq6KbksIrYAhUBuY8KHa8QC7oQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The Oxford Handbook of Iranian History|author=[[Touraj Daryaee]]|page=214|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frye/&gt; Rabi then encamped in Zaliq and projected the seizure of Zarang, which though had earlier submitted to Arabs, needed to be subdued again. Although its marzaban [[Aparviz of Sakastan|Aparviz]] put up a strong resistance, he was forced to surrender.&lt;ref name=Frye/&gt;

The Zaranj forces had received heavy casualties during the battle with Arab forces and were driven back to the city.&lt;ref name=Daryaee/&gt; According to sources, when Aparviz appeared before Rabi to discuss the terms, he found the Arab general was sitting on a chair made out of two dead soldiers and his entourage had been instructed to make seats and bolsters in the same fashion. Aparviz was terrified into submission and wished to spare his people of this fate. A peace treaty was concluded with payments of heavy dues.&lt;ref name=Frye/&gt; The treaty mandated one million [[dirhams]] as annual tribute, in addition to a 1,000 slave boys bearing 1,000 gold vessels. The city was garrisoned by Rabi.&lt;ref name=Daryaee/&gt;

Rabi thus succeeded in gaining Zarang with considerable difficulty and remained at the place for several years. Two years later, the people of Zarang rebelled and expelled Rabi's lieutenant and garrison. Abdallah b. Amir sent 'Abd ar-Rahman b. Samura to take back the city, who also added [[Lashkar Gah|Bust]] and [[Zabul]] to Arab gains.&lt;ref name=Frye/&gt; 'Abd ar-Rahman besieged Zaranj and after the marzban surrendered, the tribute was doubled.&lt;ref name=Doryajee1&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jxd2Zr9Ilw8C&amp;pg=PA216&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq6KbksIrYAhUBuY8KHa8QC7oQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The Oxford Handbook of Iranian History|author=[[Touraj Daryaee]]|pages=216|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tribute imposed on Zarang was 2 million dirhams and 2,000 slaves.&lt;ref name=Shaban28&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_03AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjf69jJiIzYAhXEsI8KHdKCDlcQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The Abbasid Revolution|author=M.A. Shaban|pages=28|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period of the [[First Fitna|first civil war]] in the Arab caliphate (656-661), rebels in Zarang imprisoned their governor while Arab bandits started raiding remote towns in Sistan to enslave people.&lt;ref name=Doryajee1/&gt; They gave in to the new governor Rib'i, who took control of the city and restored law and order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Central Asia|publisher=Area Study Centre (Central Asia), [[University of Peshawar]]|page=87|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Abdallah b.

He sent his kinsman Ubaydallah b. Abi Bakra to destroy the Zoroastrian [[fire temples]] in [[Fars Province|Fars]] and Sistan, confiscate their property and kill their priests.

There is general agreement among Arabic sources that Khorasan's conquest began in the reign of [[Uthman]] under Abdallah b. Amir who had been appointed the governor of Basra (r. 649-655). [[Sayf ibn Umar|Sayf]]'s tradition however disagrees with this, dating it to 639 under the reign of [[Umar]] with [[Ahnaf ibn Qais]] leading the expedition. [[Al-Tabari]] meanwhile relates that Ahnaf's conquests occurred in 643. This could be because of confusion of Ahnaf's later activities under Ibn Amir and an attempt to magnify his role in Khorasan's conquest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_03AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjToNH3p6HYAhVFLY8KHabxBKwQ6AEISTAH#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The 'Abbāsid Revolution|page=16|publisher=Cambridge University Press|author=M. A. Shaban}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conquest of southern Persia was completed by 23 A.H. with Khorasan remaining the only region remaining unconquered. Since the Muslims didn't want any Persian land to remain under Persian rule, Umar ordered Ahnaf b. Qais to march upon it. After capturing towns of [[Tabas]] and [[Ferdows|Tun]], he attacked the region's easternmost city [[Herat]]. The Persians put up stiff resistance but were defeated and surrendered. A garrison was deployed in the city, while a column was detached which subjugated [[Nishapur]] and [[Tus, Iran|Tus]].&lt;ref name=AIAkram&gt;{{cite book|title=The Muslim Conquest of Persia|publisher=Maktabah Booksellers and Distributors|author=[[Agha Ibrahim Akram]]|pages=280, 281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Umar had despatched Ahnaf with 12,000 men from Kufa and Basra after Yazdegerd who had fled to Merv. After the Arabs arrived there, Yazdegerd fled to [[Marw al-Rudh]] from where he sent ambassadors to the [[Khakan]] of the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], the ruler of [[Soghd]] and the Chinese emperor, asking for their assistance. Yazdegerd later fled to Balkh, where he was defeated by the Arabs and fled across [[Oxus River]].&lt;ref name=Bombay/&gt;

Umar forbade Ahnaf from crossing the river as the land beyond it was unknown to Arabs and was very far for them.&lt;ref name=AIAkram/&gt; Yazdegerd proceeded to Soghd whose ruler supplied him a large army. The Khaqan of Turks after assembling the troops from [[Ferghana]], crossed the Oxus along with Yazdegerd and marched to Balkh. Ribi' b. Amir meanwhile retired with Kufan troops to Marw al-Rudh where he joined al-Ahnaf.&lt;ref name=Bombay/&gt; The Sasanian king and the Khakan leading an army of 50,000 cavalry composed of men from Soghd, [[Turkestan]], Balkh and [[Tokharistan]], arrived at Marw al-Rudh. Ahnaf had an army of 20,000 men. The two sides fought each other from morning till evening for two months at a place called Deir al-Ahnaf.&lt;ref name=Bombay/&gt;

The fighting at Deir al-Ahnaf went on until Ahnaf, after being informed of a Turkic chief inspecting the outposts, went there during a particular night and successively killed three Turkic chiefs during their inspection. After learning of their deaths, the Khakan became afflicted by it and withdrew to Balkh, then he withdrew across the river to Turkestan. Yazdegerd meanwhile left from Marw al-Rudh to Merv, from where he took his empire's wealth and proceeded to Balkh to join the Khakan. He told his officials he wanted to hand himself to the protection of the Turks, but they advised him against it and asked him to seek protection from the Arabs which he refused. He left for Turkestan while his officials took away his treasures and gave them to Ahnaf, submitting to the Arabs and were allowed to go back to their respective homes.&lt;ref name=Bombay&gt;{{cite book|title=The Journal, Volume 11|pages=213, 214|publisher=[[The Asiatic Society of Mumbai|Asiatic Society of Bombay]]|year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdullah b. Amir went to Khorasan from Kerman in 650 and sent out along with a vanguard of [[Banu Tamim|Tamimi Arabs]] and 1,000 [[asawira]] via Quhistan. The people of [[Tabas]]ayn had broken their peace treaty and had allied with the [[Hepthalites]] of Herat. al-Ahnaf reconquered Quhistan and defeated Herat's Hepthalites at [[Nishapur]]. The [[kanarang]] or marzaban of [[Tus, Iran|Tus]] asked the Arabs for assistance against the raiding Hepthalites of [[Herat Province|Herat]] and [[Badghis]]. He agreed to a peace agreement for 600,000 dinars.&lt;ref name=Doryajee2&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jxd2Zr9Ilw8C&amp;pg=PA215&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq6KbksIrYAhUBuY8KHa8QC7oQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The Oxford Handbook of Iranian History|author=[[Touraj Daryaee]]|page=215|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hepthalite action prompted the Muslims undertaking military operation to secure their positions in Khorasan. After fall of Tus, Ibn Amir sent out an army against Herat. The ruler (marzaban or ''azim'') of the place agreed to a peace treaty for Herat, Badghis and [[Pushang]] for a tribute of 1 million dirhams.&lt;ref name=Doryajee2/&gt; The ruler who was known as ''azim'' or the &quot;mighty one&quot; in [[Futuh al-Buldan]], may have been a Hepthalite chief.&lt;ref name=Gibb&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cJQ3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA56&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiawcXH-YzYAhXLrI8KHeaqDp4Q6AEIPDAF#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Volume V|author=[[Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb]]|page=56|publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Rashidun Caliphate|Rightly Guided Caliphs]]'' followed the earlier rule of [[Muhammad]] of imposing ''[[jizya]]'' on several bodies jointly and in some cases also imposed the condition they host Muslims. This rule was followed in most Iranian towns, with the jizya not specified on per capita basis, but was left to the local rulers though some Muslim commanders stressed the amount on the ability of the ruler to pay. The same wording can be seen in Ibn Amir's treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVYT4Kraym0C&amp;pg=PA199&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjvhczu2rfYAhUFs48KHXDqCPIQ6AEILjAC#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The Spread of Islam Throughout the World|author=Idris El Hareir, Ravane Mbaye|page=199|publisher=[[UNESCO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 652, Ibn Amir sent al-Ahnaf to invade [[Tokharistan]] with 4,000 Arabs and 1,000 Iranian Muslims (evidently the Tamimis and asawira), probably because of assistance of its ruler to Yazdegerd's son [[Peroz III|Peroz]]. While Marw al-Rudh's garrison agreed to a peace term for the entire district under 300,000 dirhams, the town itself remained besieged.&lt;ref name=Doryajee2/&gt; The last major stronghold of Sasanians, Marw al-Rudh, fell to him after a fierce battle.&lt;ref name=Gibb/&gt; After bloody fighting, its marzaban agreed to a peace treaty for 60,000 or 600,000 dirhams as well as a mutual defence pact. He was also allowed to keep his ancestral lands, for the office of marzaban to be hereditary in his family and to be exempt from taxes along with his whole family.&lt;ref name=Doryajee2/&gt; Baladhuri quotes [[Abu Ubaidah (scholar)|Abu Ubayda]] as stating that the Turks were supporting the inhabitants of the town. These Turks were Hepthalites, probably from [[Guzgan]] which may explain the reason behind Arabs next attacking Guzgan, [[Faryab]] and [[Taloqan|Talqan]].&lt;ref name=Shaban22/&gt;

[[Al-Mada'ini]] specifically states that Ahnaf while leading the next expedition, didn't want to ask for assistance from the non-Muslims of Marw al-Rudh, probably as he didn't trust them.&lt;ref name=Shaban22/&gt; The Arabs camped at Qasr al-Ahnaf, a day's march to north of Marw al-Rudh. The 30,000-strong army comprising troops of Guzgan, Faryab and Talqan, supported by the [[Chaghaniyan|Chaghanian]] troops, advanced to meet them. The battle was inconclusive, but the opposing side dispersed with some remaining at Guzgan while Arabs withdrew to Marw al-Rudh. Ahnaf sent an expedition, led by al-Aqra' b. Habis and apparently consisting exclusively of Tamims, to Guzgan. The Arabs defeated Guzgan and entered it by force. Ahnaf meanwhile advanced towards Balkh, making peace treaties with Faryab and Taloqan along the way.&lt;ref name=Shaban22&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_03AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjToNH3p6HYAhVFLY8KHabxBKwQ6AEISTAH#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The 'Abbāsid Revolution|page=22|publisher=Cambridge University Press|author=M. A. Shaban}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The permanent pacification of Khorasan was a protracted affair with the local potentates often rebelling and appealing to outside powers like the Hepthalites, [[Western Turks]] or [[Turgesh]], [[Sogdians]] and the imperial Chinese who claimed a degree of suzerainty over Central Asia, for help.&lt;ref name=Gibb/&gt; Within a year after Yazdegerd's death, a local Iranian notable named Qarin started a revolt against the Arabs in Quhistan. He gathered his supporters from Tabasayn, Herat and Badghis, assembling a reported army of 40,000 insurgents against Arabs in Khorasan. The Arabs made a surprise attack however, killing him and many of his people while many others were taken captive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hvx9jq_2L3EC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXn7qcjY3YAhXJO48KHVogC6gQ6AEIOjAE#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 4|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=26|author=Richard Nelson Frye}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was expected that the recently subjugated people would revolt. However, in Khorasan, no all-out effort seems to have been undertaken to the expel the Arabs after Qarin's rebellion. Chinese sources state that there was an attempt to restore Peroz by Tokharistan's army, however this episode is not confirmed by Arab sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_03AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXn7qcjY3YAhXJO48KHVogC6gQ6AEILzAC#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The Abbasid Revolution|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=27|author=M.A. Shaban}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peroz had settled among the Turks, took a local wife and had received troops from king of Tokharistan. In 661, he established himself as king of Po-szu (Persia) with Chinese help in a place the Chinese called Ja-ling (Chi-ling), which is assumed to be Zarang. His campaigns are reflected in Muslim sources, which mention revolts in Zarang, Balkh, Badghis, Herat, [[Bushanj]] and also in Khorasan during the [[First Fitna]] period in reigns of [[Ali]] and [[Muawiyah I|Muawiyah]]. Though they don't mention Peroz, they do state that Ali's newly appointed governor of Khorasan had heard in Nishapur that governors of the Sasanian king had come back from Kabul and Khorasan had rebelled. However, the region was reconquered under Muawiyah. Piroz went back to [[Tang Empire]]'s capital and was given a grandiose title as well as permission to build a fire temple in 677.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7k0hAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJlaS1iI3YAhUKuY8KHZs6BsgQ6AEISzAH#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Nativist Prophets of Early Islamic Iran: Rural Revolt and Local Zoroastrianism|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=5, 6|author=[[Patricia Crone]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yazid ibn al-Muhallab]] succeeded his father as governor of Khorasan in 702 and campaigned in Central Asia, but achieved little success apart from Nezak Tarkhan's submission at Badghis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jxd2Zr9Ilw8C&amp;pg=PA219&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq6KbksIrYAhUBuY8KHa8QC7oQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The Oxford Handbook of Iranian History|author=[[Touraj Daryaee]]|page=219|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tokharistan===

[[Tokharistan]], roughly ancient [[Bactria]], is today divided between Afghanistan, [[Tajikistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]. According to the most general usage of the name, Tokharistan is the wide valley around the upper Oxus river surrounded by mountains on three sides before the river moves into open plains. The major city was [[Balkh]], one of the greatest urban centers of northeastern Iran. It was located upon [[Silk Road|crossroads and conduits of trade]] in many directions, enabling control of these routes if it was conquered. During the governorship of [[Abdallah ibn Tahir al-Khurasani|Abu 'l Abbas 'Abdallah b. Tahir]] (r. 828–845), a list of districts (''kuwar'') of the region exists, including as far as [[Principality of Chaghaniyan|Saghaniyan]] in the north and Kabul in the south. Other places listed are [[Tirmidh]], [[Juzjan]], [[Bamiyan]], Rūb and Samanjan. Some Arab geographers used the name only for southern part of Oxus valley.&lt;ref name=Musk&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZfWXIfbynwYC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwin2KfiwKzYAhUI3Y8KHXiUCXgQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Islam and Tibet - Interactions along the Musk Route|publisher=Routlegde|pages=46–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balkh was also a part of Khorasan along with other areas through varying extensions of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CvpeCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixg8Sl26rYAhUbSY8KHfsuA4YQ6AEIJzAB#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Greater Khorasan: History, Geography, Archaeology and Material Culture|author=Rocco Rante|publisher=Routlegde|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Per al-Tabari, Yazdegerd fled from Marw-al Rudh to Balkh during Ahnaf's conquest of Khorasan in 643. He fortified himself but was defeated by the Arabs and fled across the [[Oxus River]].&lt;ref name=Bombay/&gt; Yazdegerd proceeded to Soghd whose ruler supplied him a large army. The Khaqan of Turks after assembling the troops from [[Ferghana]], crossed the Oxus along with Yazdegerd and marched to Balkh.&lt;ref name=Bombay/&gt;

In 652, Ibn Amir sent al-Ahnaf to invade [[Tokharistan]] with 4,000 Arabs and 1,000 Iranian Muslims (evidently the Tamimis and asawira), probably because of assistance of its ruler to Yazdegerd's son [[Peroz III|Peroz]]. He approached Balkh after conquering Marw al-Rudh and fighting an inconclusive battle with a 30,000-strong force from Guzgan, Faryab and Talqan. After arriving at Balkh, he besieged the city, with its inhabitants offering a tribute of 400,000 or 700,000 dirhams. He deputed his cousin to collect the tribute and advanced to [[Khwarezm]] but returned to Balkh as winter approached.&lt;ref name=Shaban22/&gt; It was in Balkh in fall of 652 when the local people introduced his cousin Asid to gifting gold and silver to their governor during [[Mehregan|Mihrijan]].&lt;ref name=Doryajee1/&gt;

[[Ziyad ibn Abih|Ziyad b. Abi Sufyan]] reorganised Basra and Kufa, excluding many from the ''[[divan|diwan]]'' and inspiring him to settle 50,000 families in Khorasan. Both Baladhuri and Mad'aini agree upon the number, though the latter states each half were from Basra and Kufa. Al-'Ali disagrees, stating the Kufans were 10,000. Ghalib had been unsuccessful in his expedition, and Rabi b. Ziyad al-Harithi who was appointed governor of Khorasan in 671 led the settlement expedition. He advanced to Balkh and made a peace treaty with the locals who had revolted after al-Ahnaf's earlier treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_03AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidlNK4gKvYAhXKsI8KHWSpAvQ4ChDoAQgoMAE#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The 'Abbāsid Revolution|pages=31, 32|publisher=Cambridge University Press|author=M. A. Shaban}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Qutayba ibn Muslim]] led the final conquest of Balkh. He was tasked with subduing the revolt in Lower Tokharistan. His army was assembled in spring of 705 and marched through Marw al-Rudh and Talqan to Balkh. Per one version in [[Tarikh al-Tabari]], the city was surrendered peacefully. Another version, probably to promote a [[Bahila|Bahilite]] claim on the [[Barmakids]], speaks of a revolt among the residents. The latter may be the correct version as Tabari describes the city as ruined four years later.&lt;ref name=Gibb32&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6TN8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT32&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTppagj6vYAhVERY8KHRsLAtsQ6AEISDAH#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The Arab Conquests in Central Asia|publisher=Read Books Ltd.|author=[[H.A.R. Gibb]]|year=2013|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wife of Barmak, a physician of Balkh, was taken captive during the war and given to 'Abdullah, Qutayba's brother. She was later restored to her lawful husband after spending a period in 'Abdullah's [[harem]]. [[Khalid ibn Barmak|Khalid]] was thus born in 706 and Abdallah accepted the implications of paternity without disturbing Barmak's conventional responsibilities or affecting Khalid's upbringing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Harun Al Rashid|publisher=[[D.

In 708-709, the Ispahbadh who was a local ruler, received a letter from the Hepthalite rebel Nizak [[Tarkhan]] who was trying to unite the aristocracy of Tokharistan against Qutayba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6swDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRppLkjqvYAhXLLo8KHfP0B0sQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Afghanistan's Islam: From Conversion to the Taliban|author=Nile Green|publisher=University of California Press|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabs built a new military encampment called ''Baruqan'' two farsangs away from the city. In 725, the governor [[Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri]] had the city restored after a feud among Arab troops with Barmak being employed as his agent for the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopaedia Iranica Volume 3 Issues 5–8|page=558|publisher=Routlegde &amp; Kegan Paul|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Arabs tended to treat Iran as a single cultural unit, however it was a land of many countries with distinct populations and cultures. From historical evidence, it appears Tokharistan was the only area heavily colonized by Arabs where [[Buddhism]] flourished and the only area incorporated into the Arab empire where Sanskrit studies were pursued up to the conquest. The grandson of Barmak was the ''[[vizier]]'' of the empire and took personal interest in Sanskrit works and Indian religions.&lt;ref name=Musk/&gt; The eighth-century Korean traveller [[Hyecho|Hui'Chao]] records [[Hinayana|Hinayanists]] in Balkh under Arab rule.&lt;ref name=Hinya&gt;{{cite book|url=

He also describes all the inhabitants of the regions as Buddhists under Arab rule. Other sources indicate however that the Bactrians practiced many different religions.&lt;ref name=MuskHui&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZfWXIfbynwYC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwin2KfiwKzYAhUI3Y8KHXiUCXgQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Islam and Tibet - Interactions along the Musk Route|publisher=Routlegde|pages=51, 53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Balkh's Buddhist monasteries, the largest was ''[[Nava Vihara]]'', later Persianized to ''Naw Bahara'' after the Islamic conquest of Balkh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6swDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiiod6Zq6zYAhXFrI8KHTASDasQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Afghanistan's Islam: From Conversion to the Taliban|author=Nile Green|publisher=University of California Press|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known how long it continued to serve as a place of worship after the conquest. Accounts of early Arabs offer contradictory narratives. Per al-Baladhuri, its stupa-vihara complex was destroyed under Muawiyah in 650s. Tabari while reporting about the expedition in 650s, does not mention any tension around the temple, stating Balkh was conquered by Rabi peacefully. He also states that Nizak went to pray at the site during his revolt against Qutayba in 709, implying it may not have been destroyed. Also the tenth-century geographical treatise ''[[Hudud al-'Alam]]'' describes remaining royal buildings and Naw Bahara's decorations including painted image and wonderful works, probably [[Fresco-secco|secco]] or [[fresco]] [[murals]] and carvings on the temple's walls that survived into the author's time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5rZGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOv9W8rKzYAhWJuY8KHXEvDEoQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Sacred Landscape in Medieval Afghanistan: Revisiting the Faḍā'il-i Balkh|author=Arezou Azad|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanskrit, Greek, Latin and Chinese sources from the 2nd century BCE to the 7th century CE, identify a people called &quot;[[Tushara Kingdom|Tukharas]]&quot;, in the country later called Tukharistan.

Taking advantage of the factional fighting among the Arabs, Transoxania started rebelling and Asad b. 'Abdallah in response attacked [[Principality of Khuttal|Khuttal]] in 737. Armed forces of Soghd, [[Tashkent|Chach]] and many Turks, led by the Turkish Khagan [[Suluk (Turgesh khagan)|Sulu]], arrived to assist them.

===The Zunbils===

The [[Zunbils]] in the pre-[[Saffarid]] period ruled in [[Zabulistan]] and [[Zamindawar]], stretching between [[Ghazna]] and Bost, and had acted as a barrier against Muslim expansion for a long time. Zamindawar is known to have a shrine dedicated to the god Zun. It has been linked with the [[Hindu god]] [[Surya|Aditya]] at [[Multan]], [[Bon|pre-Buddhist religious]] and [[Imperial cult|kingship practices]] of [[Tibet]] as well as [[Shaivism]]. The followers of the Zunbils were called Turks by the Arabic sources, however they applied the name to all their enemies in eastern fringes of Iran.&lt;ref name=Wink/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Medieval History of Iran, Afghanistan, and Central Asia|pages= 344, 357|publisher=Variorum Reprints|year=1977|author=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are described as having Turkish troops in their service by sources like Tabari and ''Tarikh-e-Sistan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Islam in Asia: South Asia|page= 15|publisher=Magnes Press|year=1984|author=[[Raphael Israeli]], Anthony Hearle Johns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After appearing at Zarang, 'Abd ar-Rahman b. Samura and his force of 6,000 Arabs penetrated to the shrine of Zun in 653-654. He broke off a hand from the idol of Zun and plucked out the rubies used as its eyes to demonstrate to the marzban of Sistan that the idol could neither hurt nor benefit anyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sīstān Under the Arabs: From the Islamic Conquest to the Rise of the Ṣaffārids (30-250/651-864|publisher=Indiana University|author=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]]|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also took [[Zabul]] by treaty by 656.&lt;ref name=Doryajee2/&gt; Per Baldhuri, after being reappointed to Sistan under Muawiyah, Samura defeated Zabulistan whose people had broken the earlier agreement.&lt;ref name=Majumdar/&gt;

Samura was replaced by Rabi b. Ziyad and died in 50 A.H. (670 A.D.), after which the king of Zabul rebelled and conquered Zabulistan and Rukhkhaj. Ar-Rabi, the Arab governor, attacked him at Bust and made him flee. He then pursued him to Rukhkhaj where he attacked him and then subdued the city of ad-Dawar.&lt;ref name=Majumdar&gt;{{cite book|title=Readings in political history of India, ancient, mediaeval, and modern|author=[[R.C.

Abi Sufyan was appointed governor of Basra in 665, with Khorasan and Sistan coming under his mandate as well. He had first appointed Rabi to Sistan but replaced him later with 'Ubaydallah b. Abi Bakra. During this period, Zunbil's fierce resistance continued until he finally agreed to pay one million dirhams per Baladhuri and ''Tarikh-e-Sistan''.&lt;ref name=Shaban41&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_03AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA41&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidlNK4gKvYAhXKsI8KHWSpAvQ4ChDoAQgoMAE#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The 'Abbāsid Revolution|pages=40–41|publisher=Cambridge University Press|author=M.

Al-Baladhuri records that under Muawiyah, Sistan's governor [[Abbad ibn Ziyad|'Abbad b. Ziyad b. Abihi]] raided and captured the city of [[Qandahar]] after bitter fighting. He also mentions the characteristic high caps of the people of the city. Though his text is somewhat ambiguous, it seems that 'Abbad had renamed the town as '''Abbadiya'' after himself. The Muslim rule was probably toppled and the name is never heard after his governorship ended in 680-1, by 698 there was no Muslim-controlled region east of Bost.&lt;ref name=Cities&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CgawCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA269&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjVrubXgLDYAhWBvI8KHSwmAQcQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Historic Cities of the Islamic World|page=269|publisher=Brill|year=2007|author=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was ruled by Arab Muslims and Zunbils, and then later Saffarids and Ghaznavids.

In 681, [[Salm ibn Ziyad|Salm b Ziyad]] was appointed the governor of Khorasan and Sistan by [[Yazid I]]. He appointed his brother [[Yazid ibn Ziyad|Yazid b. Ziyad]], apparently to lead a military expedition against the Zunbil of Zabulistan. The expedition however was disastrous, with Yazid being killed, his brother Abu-'Ubayda captured, while Arabs received heavy casualties. Salm sent an expedition by Talha b. 'Abdillah al-Khuzai to rescue his brother and pacify the region. The Arab captives were ransomed for half million dirhams and the region was pacified more through diplomacy than force.&lt;ref name=Shaban41/&gt;&lt;ref name=Daryaee218&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jxd2Zr9Ilw8C&amp;pg=PA218&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq6KbksIrYAhUBuY8KHa8QC7oQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The Oxford Handbook of Iranian History|author=[[Touraj Daryaee]]|page=218|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Talha's death in 683–684, a virtual anarchy was unleashed amongst Sistan's Arabs. His army refused allegiance to Yazid or [[Muawiyah II]] and his son 'Abadallah had to abandon Zarang, which was left without any incharge. Many Arabs took over various quarters of Zarang and areas of Sistan. This prompted Zunbil and his allies who had already inflicted a humiliating defeat on the Arabs earlier, to intervene in the Arab affairs at Sistan and Bust.&lt;ref name=Bosworth50&gt;{{cite book|title=Sīstān Under the Arabs: From the Islamic Conquest to the Rise of the Ṣaffārids (30-250/651-864)|author=Clifford Edmund Bosworth|publisher= Indiana University|page=50|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baladhuri says of this period:

[[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abdalmalik]] appointed Umayya b. 'Abdillah b. Khalid b. Asid as governor of Khorasan in 74 A.H. (693-4 A.D.), with Sistan included under his governorship. Umayya sent his son Abdullah as head of the expedition in Sistan. Though initially successful, the new Zunbil was able to defeat them. Per some accounts, Abdullah himself was killed. Umayya was dismissed and Sistan added to governorship of [[al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_03AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP9pPshYjYAhUbSo8KHQxhCTQQ6AEINzAE#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The 'Abbāsid Revolution|page=50|publisher=Cambridge University Press|author=M.

====Under Al-Hajjaj====

Al-Hajjaj, who had become governor of Iraq and the East in 78 A.H. (697–98), had appointed Ubaidallah, who was a ''[[mawla]]'' of mixed [[Abyssinian people|Abyssinian]] and Iraqi-Persian origins, as his deputy in Sistan. The Zunbils who had been left unchecked had completely stopped paying the tribute. This provided a pretext to terminate the peace between the both sides. Ubaidallah was appointed for an expedition against them in 698 and was ordered by Al-Hajjaj to &quot;attack until he laid waste to Zunbil's territories, destroyed his strongholds, killed all his fighting men and enslaved his progeny&quot;. The ensuing campaign was called the &quot;Army of Destruction&quot; (''Jaish al-Fana'''). However, it ended disastrously for the Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2m7_R5P2oAC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP2JiR6LTYAhWFuI8KHYMkAcwQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Al-Hind, the Making of the Indo-Islamic World: Early Medieval India and the Expansion of Islam 7th-11th Centuries|publisher=Brill|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Baladhuri's account on the authority of Al-Mada'ini in ''Futuh al-Buldan'' and ''[[Genealogies of the Nobles|Ansab al-Ashraf]]'', is the fullest documentation of the campaign. Tabari's account runs parallel but is based on [[Abu Mikhnaf]] and does not include the poem of A'sha Hamdan included in ''Ansab al-Ashraf''. [[Ibn Qutaybah]]'s ''Kitab al-Ma'arif'' only makes a bare mention. ''[[History of the Caliphs|Ta'rikh al-khulafa']]'' has a more detailed account and epitomises accounts of Tabari and Baladhuri. ''Tarikh-e-Sistan'' confuses the campaign with another one against the [[Khwarij]] of Zarang. The army consisted of Iraqis from Basra and Kufa, though Baladhuri mentions presence of some Syrians. Ubaidallah himself led the Basrans while the [[Tabi‘ al-Tabi‘in|Tabi]] Shuraih b. Hani' al-Harithi ad-Dabbi led the Kufans.&lt;ref name=Fanaa&gt;{{cite book|title=The Medieval History of Iran, Afghanistan, and Central Asia|pages= 362–366|publisher=Variorum Reprints|year=1977|author=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They marched to [[Zamindawar]] or al-Rukhkhaj (the classical [[Arachosia]]) but found it was barren and foodless. Their advance probably happened in summer of 698 as A'sha Hamdan's poem refers to the scorching heat they had to endure. In [[Zabulistan]]'s regions of [[Ghazna]] and [[Gardiz]], they plundered a significant amount of cattle and other animals in addition to destroying various strongholds. The Zunbils who were [[scorched earth|devastating the countryside whilst retreating]], were luring the Arabs into a trap to an inhospitable and foodless terrain. ''Futuh al-Buldan'' states that the Muslims almost penetrated Kabul. Tabari meanwhile says that they came within 18 farsakhs of the summer capital of Zunbils in the [[Kandahar Province|Qandahar region]].&lt;ref name=Fanaa/&gt;

The plan of the Zunbils worked and they trapped the Arabs into a valley. Ubaidallah realizing the gravity of the situation, offered 500,000 or 700,000 dirhams as well as his three sons along with some Arab leaders as hostages while promising not to raid again during his tenure as Sistan's governor. Shuraih, who had earlier advised retreat, felt a withdrawal would be dishonorable. He was joined by a group of people into the battle, and all but a handful of them were killed. The remnant of the Arab army withdrew back to Bust and Sistan, suffering from starvation and thirst. Many died in the &quot;Desert of Bust&quot;, presumably the [[Registan Desert]], with only 5,000 making it back to Bust. Many of those who survived died by gorging themselves on the food sent to them according to Tabari. Ubaidallah had arranged food for them after seeing their suffering and himself died, either from grief or an ear affliction.&lt;ref name=Fanaa/&gt;

Al-Hajjaj prepared another expedition in 699, reportedly of 40,000 troops from Kufa and Basra under [[Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath|Abdurrahman b. Muhammad b. al-Ash'ath]]. Though disguised as a military expedition, it was actually a forced migration of the elements from the two Iraqi cities troublesome to Hajjaj. It was equipped to the best standards and was called the &quot;Army of Peacocks&quot; because of the men included in its ranks. It included proudest and most distinguished leaders of Iraq led by Ibn al-Ash'ath, grandson of [[Al-Ash'ath ibn Qays]]. It also included distinguished elders who served in the first armies of conquest as well as those who fought at [[Battle of Siffin]]. This Arab army arrived in Sistan in the spring of 699.&lt;ref name=Peacocks&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TEFMYRxteB4C&amp;pg=PA110&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp1I_u9bTYAhVBOY8KHR8CDIwQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Islamic History: Volume 1, AD 600-750 (AH 132): A New Interpretation|pages= 110–111|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1971|author=M.A. Shabam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arabs advanced east into Zabulistan and won several victories. However the troops didn't want to fight in this inhospitable region and started becoming restive. Al-Hajjaj instructed them to continue the advance into Zabulistan's heart no matter what it took, making it clear to them he wanted them to return to their homes.&lt;ref name=Peacocks/&gt; Ibn al-Ash'ath also made an agreement with the Zunbils, that no tribute would be demanded if he won and in case he lost, he would be sheltered to protect him from Al-Hajjaj.&lt;ref name=Bosworth60&gt;{{cite book|title=Sīstān Under the Arabs: From the Islamic Conquest to the Rise of the Ṣaffārids (30-250/651-864)|author=Clifford Edmund Bosworth|publisher= Indiana University|page=60|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; The troops mutinied against Hajjaj's enforced emigration and returned to Iraq but were crushed by the Syrian troops. They fled back to the east while Ibn al-Ash'ath fled to Sistan where he died in 704 A.D.&lt;ref name=Peacocks/&gt;

When Ibn al-Ash'ath returned to Sistan in 702-703 A.D., he wasn't allowed into Zarang and fled to Bust where he was abducted by Iyad b. Himyan al-Bakri as-Sadusi, who he had appointed as the deputy over Bust, so Iyad could resecure favor of al-Hajjaj. Zunbil however attacked the town and threatened to slaughter or enslave everyone there unless Ibn al-Ash'ath was handed over to him. Iyad set him free and he went to Zunbil's territory along with his army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sīstān Under the Arabs: From the Islamic Conquest to the Rise of the Ṣaffārids (30-250/651-864)|pages= 60–61|publisher=Indiana University|year=1968|author=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zunbil was persuaded by Al-Hajjaj's representative to surrender him. His fate is however unclear. Per some accounts, he committed suicide while according to others he was killed by the Zunbil who sent his head to the Umayyads in Sistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tNiAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjg656Ji7XYAhVMPo8KHSZyCFAQ6AEIPzAF#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The First Dynasty of Islam: The Umayyad Caliphate AD 661-750|page=69|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|author=[[G.

====From 8th century====

Qutayba b. Muslim, the conqueror of Transoxiana, preferred not to fight the Zunbils and accepted an offer of a rather minimal tribute from them, calling Sijistan an &quot;ill-omened front&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNGq6sU-xbgC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFtsOqqbzYAhVCuY8KHdnjA7kQ6AEIQzAG#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The End of the Jihad State: The Reign of Hisham Ibn 'Abd al-Malik and the Collapse of the Umayyads|author=Khalid Yahya Blankinship|year=1994|publisher=SUNY Press|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the reign of [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]], the Sijistan front had ceased to be volatile as the Arabs had given up on conquering the area and no fighting occurred for a long period. This in turn holding led to Zunbils not even paying a token tribute. The policy began to change under Hisham. [[Khalid al-Qasri]] in Iraq appointed Yazid b. al Ghurayf al-Hamdani as Sistan's governor, a Syrian from [[Jund al-Urdunn]], in 725. Yazid resumed the campaign by sending an army under the command of Balal b. Abi Kabsha. They however did not obtain anything from the Zunbils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zjP0i6FSfLwC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0robDm7XYAhXFOY8KHUiVDDcQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=End of the Jihad State, The: The Reign of Hisham Ibn 'Abd al-Malik and the Collapse of the Umayyads|publisher=[[SUNY Press]]|page=130|author=Khalid Yahya Blankinship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new governor of Sistan, al-Asfah b. 'Abd Allah al-Kalbi, a [[Syrian]], embarked on ambitious policy of campaigning against the Zunbils. The first one was carried out in 726. During the second one in late 727-728, he was warned by the Sijistanis who were with him to not campaign in winter especially in mountain defiles. Per [[Ya'qubi]], his army was completely annihilated by the Zunbils. Per ''Tarikh al-Sistani'', al-Asfah managed to get back to Sistan where he died. The next two governors didn't undertake any campaigns. Zunbil was unable to take advantage of the annihilation of al-Asfah's army but the defeat was a heavy one. It would become one in a series of blows for the caliphate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zjP0i6FSfLwC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0robDm7XYAhXFOY8KHUiVDDcQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=End of the Jihad State, The: The Reign of Hisham Ibn 'Abd al-Malik and the Collapse of the Umayyads|publisher=[[SUNY Press]]|page=147|author=Khalid Yahya Blankinship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sistan front remained quiet in latter part of Abd al-Malik's reign except perhaps the Kharjite activity, with long tenures and blank records of 'Abd Allah b. Abi Baruda and Ibrahim b. 'Asim al-'Uqayli suggesting that the instability in the region had been controlled to extent. It appears this was only possible because no more campaigns were undertaken against the Zunbils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zjP0i6FSfLwC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0robDm7XYAhXFOY8KHUiVDDcQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=End of the Jihad State, The: The Reign of Hisham Ibn 'Abd al-Malik and the Collapse of the Umayyads|publisher=[[SUNY Press]]|pages=185–186|author=Khalid Yahya Blankinship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Mansur]] sent Ma'n b. Zaida ash-Shabani sent to Sistan in response to disturbances in Sistan. Ma'n along with his nephew Yazid b. Ziyad undertook an expedition against the Zunbil for making him obedient and restoring the tribute not paid since the time of al-Hajjaj. It is especially well-documented by al-Baladhuri. He ordered the Zunbil to pay the tribute and was offered camels, Turkish tents and slaves, but this did not placate him.&lt;ref name=Bosworth82&gt;{{cite book|title=Sīstān Under the Arabs: From the Islamic Conquest to the Rise of the Ṣaffārids (30-250/651-864|publisher=Indiana University|author=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]]|pages=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Per al-Baldahuri, under the reign of al-Mansur, Hisham b. 'Amr al-Taghlibi after conquering Kandahar, destroyed its idol-temple and built a mosque in its place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Israel Oriental Studies|volume=2|title= A note on early Muslim attitudes to idolatry|publisher=Faculty of Humanities, [[Tel Aviv University]]|author=[[Yohanan Friedmann]]|page=177|year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ma'n and Yazid advanced into Zamindawar but the Zunbil had fled to Zabulistan. They nonetheless pursued and defeated him, taking 30,000 as captives including Faraj al-Rukhkhaji, who would later become a secretary of the department of private estates of the Caliph under [[al-Ma'mun]]. Zunbil's deputy Mawand (Zunbil's son-in-law Mawld in ''Tarikh-e-Sistan'') offered submission which was requested and he was sent with 5,000 of their soldiers to [[Baghdad]] where he was treated kindly and given pensions along with his chieftains per Baladhuri.&lt;ref name=Majumdar1&gt;{{cite book|title=Readings in Political History of India, Ancient, Mediaeval, and Modern|publisher=B.R. Publishing Corporation|author=[[Ramesh Chandra Majumdar]]|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bosworth82/&gt;

The tribute was paid by the Zunbils to ''amils'' of caliphs [[al-Mahdi]] and [[Harun al-Rashid|ar-Rashid]], though rather irregularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress|volume=59|title=Sistan's transition to Islam in historical perspective|page=917|publisher=[[Indian History Congress]]|first=Hamiddulah|last=Marazi}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Caliph [[Al-Ma'mun]] (r. 813–833 A.D.) visited Khorasan, he was paid double the tribute by Rutbil, but was evidently left unmolested and the Arabs later subdued Kabul.&lt;ref name=Majumdar1/&gt;

When Ar-Rabi b. Ziyad reached Helmand, the Zunbils held power as far as Zarang. The ''[[Kabul Shahi|Kabulshah]]'' was a subordinate of the Zunbil. Subsequent to the first Arab clashes with the Zunbils and Kabulshahs, we find the Zunbil negotiating with the representatives of the Caliph &quot;for his own country and the land of Kabul.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2m7_R5P2oAC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4noDbsLrYAhVGNI8KHT82CsgQ6AEIOTAE#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Al-Hind, the Making of the Indo-Islamic World: Early Medieval India and the Expansion of Islam 7th-11th Centuries|author=André Wink|publisher=Brill|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zunbils were linked to the Turki Shahi dynasty of Kabul, which was at the time a cultural and religious outpost of the Indian world.&lt;ref name=Bayne2/&gt;

During the caliphate of Uthman, new popular uprisings had broken out in Persia and continued for five years from 644–649. The revolts were suppressed and Abdullah b.

In about 680-683, the Shah fled from his brother Rutbil and approached Salm b. Ziyad at Amul in Khorasan where he accepted his suzerainty. The reason for the Shah's refuge is not known. After his successes in Zabulistan, the Rutbil may have assumed a threatening position to him, causing him to seek help of Arabs. A treaty was agreed with the Shah though its terms are not known. He was allowed to settle down in Amul (or at least under [[Türkmenabat|Amul]]'s jurisdiction somewhere north of Hindu Kush). Per Tabari, Salm was elated at this and wrote to Mu'awiyah who disapproved of it. When asked the reason, he responded that &quot;there is a lot of ill-will and bad feeling in Zaranj and Amul. The people living in the lands between these two places are disloyal and treacherous. They are likely to take advantage of the moment of our weakness and, then, it would be easier for them to capture the territory up to Amul&quot;. And it precisely happened after Muawiyah's death per Tabari.&lt;ref name=Ancient/&gt;

The Shah captured Amul and became powerful enough to threaten Rutbil who went into hiding.&lt;ref name=Ancient&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Pakistan Book 15|page=40|publisher=University of Peshawar|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zunbil's brother, '''al-Shah'' also besieged Zaranj, but the Turks retreated after reinforcements arrived from Basra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the Pakistan Historical Society|volume=14|title=The Arab Invasions of al-Sind and al-Hind|author=Muhammad H.

Ja'far led an expedition against Kabul sent by his father Ja'far b. Muhamamad in 787–78, which Bosworth claims is the one attributed to Ibrahim b. Jibril by Al-Ya'qubi.&lt;ref name=Jibril&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qjE9DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA125&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimsKC6zrrYAhWBuI8KHZRQAvkQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The 'Abbasid and Carolingian Empires: Comparative Studies in Civilizational Formation|pages=125–129|publisher=Brill|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only record of an event in early Abbasid period obviously related to the area south of the Hindu Kush, is the expedition against Kabul in 792-793 ordered by [[Al-Fadl ibn Yahya]] and led by Ibrahim b. Jibril. It is mentioned by al-Tabari's chronicle, the tenth century ''Kitāb al-Wuzarā'wa al-Kuttāb'' of al-Jahshiyari and by al-Ya'qubi. Per al-Jahshiyari, he conquered Kabul and acquired a lot of wealth. Al-Ya'qubi states that rulers and landlords of Tukharistan, including Bamiyan's king, joined this army, implying it crossed Hindu Kush from the north. It also mentions subjugation of &quot;Ghurwand&quot; (present-day [[Ghorband]]). He also mentions the &quot;Pass of Ghurwand&quot; which judging by the itinerary of the expedition from Tukharistan to Bamiyan to [[Ghorband River|Ghorband]] valley, is identical to [[Shibar Pass]]. They then marched to Shah Bahar where an idol venerated by the locals was destroyed. The inhabitants of various towns then concluded peace treaties with Fadl, one of which was identified by [[Josef Markwart]] as [[Ancient Kapisa|Kapisa]].&lt;ref name=Jibril/&gt;

Al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833 A.D.) while visiting Khorasan, launched an attack on Kabul, whose ruler submitted to taxation.&lt;ref name=Majumdar1/&gt; The king of Kabul was captured and he then converted to Islam.&lt;ref name=&quot;ba1&quot;/&gt; Per sources, when the Shah submitted to al-Ma'mun, he sent his crown and bejeweled throne, later seen by the Meccan historian [[al-Azraqi]] to the Caliph who praised Fadl for &quot;curbing polytheists, breaking idols, killing the refractory&quot; and refers to his successes against Kabul's king and ''ispahabad''. Other near-contemporary sources however refer to the artifacts as a golden jewel-encrusted idol sitting on a silver throne by the [[Hindu Shahi]] ruler or by an unnamed ruler of &quot;Tibet&quot; as a sign of his conversion to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OLNE_li8C10C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFjr_FvbrYAhXGu48KHSb0CwUQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Objects of Translation: Material Culture and Medieval &quot;Hindu-Muslim&quot; Encounter|publisher= Princeton University Press|author=Finbarr B.

===Qutayba's campaigns===

Qutayba b. Muslim was appointed the governor of Khorasan in 705 by al-Hajjaj b. Yusuf, the governor of Iraq and the East. He began his rule with the reconquest of western Tokharistan in the same year.&lt;ref name=Beckwith&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7G61UifCEZMC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif1qy4r63YAhUG3o8KHalLAYgQ6AEIODAE#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The Tibetan Empire in Central Asia: A History of the Struggle for Great Power Among Tibetans, Turks, Arabs, and Chinese During the Early Middle Ages|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=70|author=Christopher I. Beckwith}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qutayba who was tasked with subduing the revolt in Lower Tokharistan, led the final conquest of Balkh. His army was assembled in spring of 705 and marched to Balkh. Per one version of al-Tabari, the city was surrendered peacefully. Another version, speaks of a revolt among the residents.&lt;ref name=Gibb32/&gt; In 706, he received the submission of Nizak, the leader of Badghis.&lt;ref name=Beckwith/&gt; In 707, he marched on [[Bukhara]] oasis along with Nizak in his army but the campaign didn't achieve any major objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The great Arab conquests: how the spread of Islam changed the world we live in|publisher=Hachette UK|page=260|author=[[Hugh N. Kennedy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Baldhuri, when [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]] became the governor of Khorasan and Sistan, he appointed his brother 'Amr to Sistan. 'Amr asked the Zunbil to pay tribute in cash but he refused, prompting Qutayba to march against him. The campaign was also partially encouraged by his desire to eliminate the support of the southern Hepthalites, the Zabulites, for their northern brethren to revolt. Zunbil who was surprised by this unexpected move and scared of his reputation, quickly capitulated. Qutayba, realizing the real strength of the Zunbils, accepted it and returned to [[Merv]], leaving only an Arab representative in Sistan.&lt;ref name=Shaban69/&gt;

Per Al-Mada'ini, Qutayba returned to Merv after conquering Bukhara in 709. The rebellion of the Hepthalite principalities from region of Guzgan including Taloqan and Faryab, led Qutayba to dispatch 12,000 men from Merv to Balkh in winter of 709. The rebellion was led and organized by Nizak [[Tarkhan]] and was supported by Balkh and Marw al-Rudh's dihqan Bādām. Nizak had realised that independence wouldn't be possible if Arab rule was strengthened in Khorasan, and perhaps was also encouraged by Qutayba's attempts to achieve his objectives through diplomacy. The success of Zunbils may also have encouraged him.&lt;ref name=Shaban66&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_03AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWoojJ5KzYAhUHo48KHW-KCCQQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The 'Abbāsid Revolution|page=66|publisher=Cambridge University Press|author=M. A. Shaban}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nizak wrote to the Zunblis asking for help. In addition, he also forced the weak Jābghū of Tokharistan to join his cause to persuade all princes of the Principalities of Tukharistan to do the same. His plan to stage the revolt in spring of 710 was however spoilt by Qutayba. Badham fled when Qutayba advanced on Marw al-Rudh&lt;ref name=Shaban66/&gt; but his two sons were caught and crucified by Qutayba who next marched to Taloqan.&lt;ref name=Kennedy&gt;{{cite book|title=The great Arab conquests: how the spread of Islam changed the world we live in|publisher=Hachette UK|page=264|author=[[Hugh N. Kennedy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taloqan was the only place in his campaign where the inhabitants weren't given a complete amnesty, concerning which [[H.A.R. Gibb]] states the &quot;traditions are hopelessly confused&quot;. Per one account, he executed and crucified a band of bandits there, though it is possible it was selected for this severity as it was the only place where there was an open revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6TN8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT36&amp;dq=qutayba+robbers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwispqqP8KzYAhUV5o8KHd8dC_UQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=qutayba%20robbers&amp;f=false|title=The Arab Conquests in Central Asia|publisher=Read Books Ltd.|author=[[H.A.R. Gibb]]|year=2013|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faryab and Guzgan both submitted and their inhabitants were not harmed. From there he went on to receive the submission of people of Balkh. Almost all of Nizak's princely allies had reconciled themselves with him and there were Arab governors in all towns of Tokharistan, spoiling his plans. He fled south to the [[Hindu Kush]], hoping to reach Kabul&lt;ref name=Kennedy/&gt; and entrenched himself in an inaccessible mountain pass guarded by a fortress. The Arabs succeeded in gaining the fort with help of Ru'b Khan, ruler of Ru'b and Siminjan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Regions of the World|publisher=Luzac|author=[[Vladimir Minorsky]]|page=338|year=1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nizak fled along the modern road that leads from the Oxus valley to [[Salang Pass]] and holed up in an unidentified mountain refuge in a site of [[Baghlan Province]]. Qutayba caught up with him and besieged him for two months.&lt;ref name=Kennedy/&gt;

Sulaym al-Nasih (the counsellor), a ''[[mawla]]'' of Khorasan, helped in obtaining his surrender to Qutayba who promised a pardon. Nonetheless, he was executed along with 700 of his followers after orders from al-Hajjaj. The Jabghu of Tokharistan was sent as a valuable hostage to [[Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_03AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA67&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWoojJ5KzYAhUHo48KHW-KCCQQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The 'Abbāsid Revolution|page=67|publisher=Cambridge University Press|author=M. A. Shaban}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then went in pursuit of Juzjan's king, who requested amnesty and called for exchange of hostages as precautionary measure. This was agreed upon and Habib b. 'Abd Allah, a Bahilite, was sent as prisoner by Qutayba while the king sent some of his family members in return. The peace treaty was agreed but the king died in Taloqan on his return journey. His subjects accused the Muslims of poisoning him and killed Habib, with Qutayba retaliating by executing Juzjan's hostages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Islamic Culture|publisher=Islamic Culture Board|volume=45|title=A Survey of the expansion of Islam into Central Asia during the Umayyad Caliphate|author=Dr. S. A. Hasan|editor1=Marmaduke William Pickthall|editor2=Muhammad Asad|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other regions===

====Ghur====

Tabari records that in 667 A.D., [[Ziyad ibn Abih|Ziyad b. Abihi]] had sent Hakam b. 'Amr al-Ghafri to Khorasan as [[Amir]]. Hakam raided [[Ghur]] and Farawanda, bringing them to submission through force of arms and conquered them. He obtained captives and a large amount of plunder from them. A larger expedition was undertaken under [[Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri]], the governor of Khorasan, who raided Gharchistan in 725, receiving its submission as well as the conversion of its king to Islam. He next attacked Ghur whose residents hid their valuables in an inaccessible cave, but he was able to plunder the wealth by lowering men in crates.&lt;ref name=Variorum&gt;{{cite book|title=The Medieval History of Iran, Afghanistan, and Central Asia|pages= 143–144|publisher=Variorum Reprints|year=1977|author=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asad's success prompted him to undertake a second expedition in 108-109 A.H. against Ghur. The poet Thabit Qutna's eulogical poem of Asad recorded by Tabari called it a campaign against the Turks saying, &quot;Groups of the Turks who live between Kabul and Ghurin came to you, since there was no place in which they might find refuge from you.&quot; Bosworth states that this campaign may have actually taken place in Guzgan or [[Bamiyan]] rather than the purely-[[Persian people|Iranian]] Ghur. He also states that no doubt further sporadic raids continued throughout the Umayyad rule, though not noted by historians. It is known that [[Nasr ibn Sayyar]]'s commander Sulaiman b. Sul had raided Gharchistan and Ghur some time before 739 A.D.&lt;ref name=Variorum/&gt;

The early history of Ghor is unclear. [[Minhaj-i-Siraj]] in [[Tabaqat-i-Nasiri]] states that Shansab, who established the [[Ghurid dynasty]], was converted by the Arab Caliph Ali which [[Mohammad Habib]] and [[K. A. Nizami]] dismissed as unlikely. He further adds that the Ghurid Amir Faulad assisted [[Abu Muslim]] in overthrowing the Umayyads during the [[Abbasid Revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Faulad&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iRJuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=amir+faulad+abu+muslim&amp;dq=amir+faulad+abu+muslim&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi46O3lopjhAhUK7nMBHTfOBVQQ6AEIKDAAA Page 145-6 from &quot;Comprehensive History Of India Vol. 5&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; He also recounts a legend about a dispute between two prominent families of the area. They sought the intercession of the Abbasids and the ancestor of the Shansabi family, Amir Banji, was subsequently confirmed as the ruler by [[Harun al-Rashid]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bCVyhH5VDjAC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=banji+harun+al+rashid&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTuYSwlJjhAhVr6XMBHXk4BLsQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=banji%20harun%20al%20rashid&amp;f=false Page 95 from &quot;Al- Hind: The slave kings and the Islamic conquest.&quot;, André Wink]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nab/&gt;

No permanent control was ever established on Ghur. According to Bosworth, its value was only for its slaves which could best be obtained in occasional temporary raids.&lt;ref name=Variorum/&gt; Arab and Persian geographers never considered it important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Medieval History of Iran, Afghanistan, and Central Asia|page= 139-138|publisher=Variorum Reprints|year=1977|author=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all sources it is cited as supplying slaves to slave markets in Khorasan, indicating it had a mostly &quot;infidel&quot; population. [[Istakhari]] called it a land of infidels (''dar al-kufr'') annexed to Islamic domain because of its Muslim minority. However ''[[Hudud al-'Alam]]'' stated it had a mostly-Muslim population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZifdBLwZisQC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjO7b3jpLLYAhVGro8KHS-PCP4Q6AEIUDAI#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Studies in Arabic and Islam: Proceedings of the 19th Congress : Halle 1998|page= 143|publisher=[[Peeters Publishers]]|year=1977|author=Stefan Leder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ghazna====

The pre-Ghaznavid royal dynasty of [[Ghazna]] were the Lawiks. Afghan historian [[Abdul Hai Habibi|'Abd al-Hayy Habibi Qandahari]] who in 1957 examined a manuscript containing tales about miracles (''[[karamat]]'') of ''[[Sheikh (Sufism)|Shaikh]]'' Sakhi Surur of [[Multan]] who lived in the 12th century, concluded it dated to 1500. He recorded one of its anecdotes which records history of Ghazna by the Indian traditionalist and lexicographer Radi ad-Din Hasan b. Muhammad al-Saghani [died 1252] from Abu Hamid az-Zawuli. According to it, a great mosque at Ghazna was earlier a great idol-temple built in honor of the Rutbils and Kabul-Shahs by Wujwir Lawik. His son Khanan converted to Islam and was sent a poem by the Kabul-Shah saying, &quot;Alas! The idol of Lawik has been interred beneath the earth of Ghazna, and the Lawiyan family have given away [the embodiment of] their kingly power. I am going to send my own army; do not yourself follow the same way of the Arabs [ie., Islam].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Medieval History of Iran, Afghanistan, and Central Asia|pages= 301–302|publisher=Variorum Reprints|year=1977|author=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Habibi continues stating that Khanan later reconverted to the faith of the Hindu-Shahis. His grandson Aflah however upon assuming power demolished the idol-temple and built a mosque in its place. When the saint Surur arrived at the mosque, he is said to have found the idol of Lawik and destroyed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Medieval History of Iran, Afghanistan, and Central Asia|pages= 302–303|publisher=Variorum Reprints|year=1977|author=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Siyasatnama]]'' of [[Nizam al-Mulk]], the ''[[Tabaqat-i Nasiri]]'' of [[Minhaj-i-Siraj|Juzjani]] and the ''Majma' al-ansāb fī't-tawārīkh'' of Muhammad Shabankara'i (14th century) mention Lawik. Juzjani gives the Lawik who was defeated by Alp-tegin the Islamic ''[[Kunya (Arabic)|kunya]]'' of ''Abu Bakr'' though Shabankara'i claims he was a pagan. A variant of his name appears as Anuk in ''Tabaqat-i Nasiri''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Medieval History of Iran, Afghanistan, and Central Asia|pages= 298|publisher=Variorum Reprints|year=1977|author=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bamyan====

[[Ya'qubi]] states that lord of [[Bamyan]] called the ''Shēr'', was converted to Islam under Caliph [[Al-Mansur]] (d.775) by Muzahim b. Bistam who married his son Abu Harb Muhammad to his daughter. However, in his history he changes it to the rule of [[Al-Mahdi]] (r. 775–785). Ya'qubi also states that [[Al-Fadl ibn Yahya]] made Hasn, Abu Harb Muhammad's son, as the new ''Shēr'' after his successful campaign in [[Ghorband]].&lt;ref name=Scarcia&gt;{{cite journal|journal=East and West|volume=14|jstor=29754702 |title=A Preliminary Report on a Persian Legal Document of 470-1078 found at Bāmiyān|author=[[:it:Gianroberto Scarcia|Gianroberto Scarcia]]|publisher=[[Istituto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente]]|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ya'qubi states that the ruler of Bamiyan had accompanied an expedition dispatched by [[Al-Fadl ibn Yahya]] in 792-793 against Kabul Shahi.&lt;ref name=Jibril/&gt;

Later Shers remained Muslim and were influential at the Abbasid court. However, Muslim sources describe the Saffarid ruler [[Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar]] looting Bamiyan's pagan idols. A much later historian Shabankara'i claims that Alp-Tegin obtained conversion of Sher to Islam in 962. It seems there were lapses to Buddhism among some of the rulers as the Muslim influence grew weak. However, there is no evidence about the role of Buddhism during these periods or whether Buddhist monasteries remained the center of religious life and teaching.&lt;ref name=monasteries&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Islam in Asia|volume=1|author=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]]|title=The Coming of Islam in Afghanistan|editor1=Yohanan Friedmann|editor1-link=Yohanan Friedmann|editor2=Raphael Israeli|editor2-link=Raphael Israeli|editor3=Anthony Hearle Johns|publisher=Magnes Press|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tahirids===

[[File:Tahirid Dynasty 821 - 873 (AD).png|thumb|400px|Area controlled by the Tahirids]]

Khurasan was the base for early recruitment of Abbasid armies, especially the Abbasid takeover received support from Arab settlers aiming to undermine the important sections of non-Muslim aristocracy. The Abbasids succeeded in integrating Khorasan and the East into the central Islamic lands. The state was gradually [[Persianized]] through political influence and financial support of the ''[[dihqan]]s''. Al-Ma'mun emerged as the victor in Fourth Fitna with the help of Khorasani forces. But this also ended up turning the province into a virtually independent state under the [[Tahirids]], founded by a Persian ''mawla'' who rose to favour under Al-Ma'mun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2m7_R5P2oAC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP2JiR6LTYAhWFuI8KHYMkAcwQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Al-Hind, the Making of the Indo-Islamic World: Early Medieval India and the Expansion of Islam 7th-11th Centuries|publisher=Brill|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ibn Khordadbeh]], the Shah of Kabul had to send 2,000 [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]] slaves worth 600,000 dirhams as annual tribute to the governor of Khorasan [[Abdallah ibn Tahir]] (828-845).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8c3QAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA174&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjC8vfal9fYAhWOq5QKHcXzAlMQ6AEIQTAG#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Nomadism in Iran: From Antiquity to the Modern Era|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Oghuz slaves, he also had to pay an annual tribute of 1.5 million dirhams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CgawCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA257|title=Historic Cities of the Islamic World|publisher=Brill|page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mid-9th century, one of their tributaries Abu Da'udid or [[Banijurids|Banijurid]] Amir Da'ud b.

====Ya'qub b. al-Layth====

The Tahirid rule was overthrown by [[Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar]] of Sistan, the first independent Iranian ruler in the post-Islamic era and fought the Abbasid Caliphate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qwd5AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA153&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwic5dO8otfYAhWCo5QKHauoAOQ4ChDoAQhTMAk#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Continuity in Iranian Identity: Resilience of a Cultural Heritage|author=Fereshteh Davaran|publisher=Routledge|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Ayyār|'ayyar]] band of Salih b. al-Nadr/Nasr, who was recognised as Bust's amir in 852. al-Nasr aimed at taking over whole of Sistan and drove out the Tahirid governor in 854, with Sistan ceasing to be under direct control of the Caliphate. al-Nasr himself was overthrown by Dirham b. Nasr who was overthrown by Ya'qub in 861.&lt;ref name=Bayne&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hvx9jq_2L3EC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj18u62mtfYAhUMZlAKHfxdDOQQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 4|author=William Bayne Fisher|page=109|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ya'qub and his brother [[Amr ibn al-Layth|Amr]] advanced as far as [[Baghdad]] and to Kabul itself in eastern Afghanistan with their dynamism, advancing along the historic route taken by the modern [[Highway 1 (Afghanistan)|Lashkargah-Qandahar-Ghazni-Kabul road]]. Their eastern campaigns are documented by Arabic sources of [[Al-Masudi]]'s ''[[The Meadows of Gold|Murūj adh-dhahab]]'', [[Ibn al-Athir]]'s ''[[The Complete History|al-Kāmil fi't-tā'rīkh]]'' and ''[[Tarikh-i Sistan|Tarikh-e-Sistan]]''. The Persian historian [[Gardizi]]'s ''Zain al-akhbār'' also mentions the [[Saffarid]] campaigns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clifford Edmund Bosworth 300&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Medieval History of Iran, Afghanistan, and Central Asia|author=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]]|page=300|publisher=Variorum Reprints}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salih fled to ar-Rukhkhaj or Arachosia, where he received the help of the Zunbil. Both Salih and the Zunbil were killed by Ya'qub in 865.&lt;ref name=Bayne/&gt; [[Abu Sa'id Gardezi]] mentions that Ya'qub advanced from Sistan to Bust and occupied the city. From here he advanced to [[Panjwayi|Panjway]] and Tiginabad (two of the chief towns of Arachosia), defeating and killing the Zunbil, though the date isn't given. This account matches with that of ''Tarikh-e-Sistan''.&lt;ref name=IsMEO/&gt; [[Satish Chandra]] states that, &quot;We are told that it was only in 870 AD that Zabulistan was finally conquered by one Yakub who was the virtual ruler of the neighbouring Iranian province of Siestan. The king was killed and his subjects were made Muslims.&quot;&lt;ref name= &quot;Satish1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=L5eFzeyjBTQC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2sJ_-5fvYAhWHq48KHQJtAkMQ6AEIKDAB#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title= Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals-Delhi Sultanat (1206–1526) - Part One|publisher=Har-Anand Publishers|author=[[Satish Chandra]]|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muhammad Aufi]]'s ''[[Jawami ul-Hikayat]]'' meanwhile states that during his invasion of Zabul, he employed a ruse to surrender after being allowed to pay homage to the ruler along with his troops lest they disperse and become dangerous to both sides. Yaqub's troops &quot;carried their lances concealed behind their horses and were wearing coats of mail under their garments. The Almighty made the army of Rusal (probably Rutbil), blind, so that they did not see the lances. When Yaqub drew near Rusal, he bowed his head as if to do homage, but raised a lance and thrust it in the back of Rusal so that he died on the spot. His people also fell like lightning upon the enemy, cutting them down with their swords and staining the earth with the blood of the enemies of the religion. The infidels when they saw the head of Rusal upon the point of a spear took to flight and great bloodshed ensued. This victory, which he achieved, was the result of treachery and deception, such as no one had ever committed.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ashirbadi&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sultanate of Delhi, 711–1526 A.D.: Including the Arab Invasion of Sindh, Hindu Rule in Afghanistan and Causes of the Defeat of the Hindus in Early Medieval Age|author=[[Ashirbadi Lal Srivastava]]|page=33|publisher=Shiva Lal Agarwala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ashirbadi Lal Srivastava]] states that after this victory by Yaqub over Zabul, the position of Lallya alias Kallar, the Brahmin minister who had overthrown the last Kshatriya king of Kabul Lagaturman, seems to have become untenable. He shifted his capital to [[Attock Khurd|Udhaband]] in 870 A.D. Lallya, credited as an able and strong ruler by [[Kalhana]] in ''[[Rajatarangini]]'', was driven out by Ya'qub from Kabul within a year of his usurpation according to Srivastava.&lt;ref name=Ashirbadi/&gt;

Gardezi states that after defeating Zunbil, he then advanced into Zabulistan and then [[Ghazna]], whose citadel he destroyed and forced Abu Mansur Aflah b. Muhammad b. Khaqan, local ruler of nearby [[Gardez]], to tributary status. ''Tarikh-e-Sistan'' however in contrast states that he returned to Zarang after killing Salih. This campaign may be related to Gardizi's account of later expedition in 870 where he advanced as far as Bamiyan and Kabul.&lt;ref name=IsMEO&gt;{{cite book|title=Sīstān Under the Arabs: From the Islamic Conquest to the Rise of the Ṣaffārids (30-250/651-864)|author=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]]|page=120|publisher=IsMEO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salih b. al-Hujr, described as a cousin of the Zunbil, was appointed as the Saffarid governor of ar-Rukhkhaj, but rebelled two years after Zunbil's death and committed suicide to avoid capture.&lt;ref name=IsMEO/&gt;

Ya'qub had captured several relatives of the Zunbil's family after defeating Salih b. al-Nasr. Zunbil's son escaped from captivity in 869 and quickly raised an army in al-Rukhkhaj, later seeking refuge with the Kabul-Shah.&lt;ref name=Bayne2&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hvx9jq_2L3EC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj18u62mtfYAhUMZlAKHfxdDOQQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 4|author=William Bayne Fisher|page=111|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Per Gardizi, Ya'qub undertook another expedition in 870 which advanced as far as Kabul and Bamiyan.&lt;ref name=IsMEO/&gt; According to ''Tarikh-e-Sistan'', Bamiyan was captured in 871.&lt;ref name=Bayne2/&gt; He wrested Bamiyan from its ruler, the ''Sher'', and plundered its idol-temple.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clifford Edmund Bosworth 300&quot;/&gt; He defeated Kabul in 870 and again had to march to there in 872 when Zunbil's son took possession of Zabulistan.

According to Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, Ghor which was ruled by [[Amir Suri]] in the 9th century entered into a war against  him, but escaped conquest due to its difficult and mountainous terrain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nab&quot;/&gt;

====Amr b. al-Layth====

After Ya'qub's death in 879, Al-Mu'tamid recognised his brother and successor 'Amr b. al-Layth (r. 879–902), as governor of Khorasan, [[Isfahan Province|Isfahan]], [[Fars Province|Fars]], Sistan and Sindh.&lt;ref name=Bayne1&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R63ACQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA816&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiD3_DvydrYAhVFl5QKHYizCOMQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 4|author=William Bayne Fisher|page=112|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The caliph however announced divesting him of all his governorships in 885 and reappointed Muhammad b.

Amr led an expedition as far as Sakawand in the [[Logar River|Logar valley]], between Ghazna and Kabul, described as a Hindu pilgrimage-centre. In 896, he sent idols captured from Zamindawar and the Indian frontier, including a female copper idol with four arms and two girdles of silver set with jewels pulled on a trolley by camels, to Baghdad.&lt;ref name=Bayne1/&gt; [[Abu'l-Fadl Bayhaqi|Al-Baihaki]] mentions Sakawand as a pass from Kabul to India. It was situated at or near [[Jalalabad]].&lt;ref name=culture/&gt; The idol taken from somewhere in eastern Afghanistan by Amr was displayed for three days in Basra and then for three days in Baghdad. [[Jamal J. Elias]] states that it may have been of [[Lakshmi]] or Sukhavati at Sakawand. Al-Masudi emphasises the attention it received as a spectacle, with crowds gathering to gawk at it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gPypXUJT5X8C&amp;pg=PA116&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy-9Xo3trYAhVBRZQKHQgfBjkQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Aisha's Cushion: Religious Art, Perception, and Practice in Islam|author=[[Jamal J.

Aufi states that Amr had sent Fardaghan as the prefect over Ghazna and he launched the raid on Sakawand, which was a part of the territory of Kabul Shahi and had a temple frequented by Hindus. The Shah of Kabul at this time was Kamaluka, called &quot;Kamalu&quot; in Persian literature. Fardaghan entered it and succeeded in surprising Sakawand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sraddhānjali, Studies in Ancient Indian History: D.C.

Kamalu counter-attacked Fardaghan who realising his forces were no match for his, resorted to spreading a false rumour that he knew his intentions and had organised a formidable army against him with 'Amr on the way to join him. The rumour had the desired effect and the opposing army slowed its advance knowing that they could be ambushed and slaughtered if they advanced impetuously into the narrow defiles. Meanwhile, Fardaghan received reinforcements from Khorasan according to Aufi.&lt;ref name=Quaid&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Central Asia|volume= 1|issue= 1|pages=97–98|publisher=Centre for the Study of the Civilizations of Central Asia, [[Quaid-i-Azam University]]|year=1978|title=Kamalu's invasion of Ghazna|author=Abdur Rahman}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aufi he cleverly averted the danger.&lt;ref name=Kamalu/&gt;

''Tarikh-e-Sistan'' doesn't mention any attack by Fardaghan on Sakawand however, instead beginning with the attack by Kamalu. Per it, when Amr was in [[Gurgan]], he heard that ''Nasad Hindi'' and ''Alaman Hindi'' had allied and invaded Ghazna. The Saffarid governor 'Fard 'Ali was defeated and fled.&lt;ref name=Quaid/&gt;

===Samanids===

[[File:Iran circa 1000AD.png|thumb|400px|Iran in the 10th century]]

The [[Samanids]] came to rule over areas including Khorasan, Sistan, Tokharistan and [[Kabulistan]] after [[Isma'il ibn Ahmad|Ismail]] (r. 892907) in 900 A.D. had defeated the Saffarids, who had taken over Zabulistan and the Kabul region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of Asian Civilisations, Volumes 21–22|page= 200|publisher=Taxila Institute of Asian Civilisations, [[Quaid-i-Azam University]]|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turks were highly noted for their martial prowess by the Muslim sources and were in high demand as slave-soldiers (''[[Ghilman|ghulam]]'', ''[[mamluk]]'') by the Caliphate in Baghdad and the provincial emirs. The slaves were acquired either in military campaigns or through trade. The Samanids were heavily involved in this trade of Turkish slaves from lands to the north and east of their state. As the enslavement was limited to non-Muslims and with the Turks increasingly adopting Islam beyond Samanid borders, they also entered [[Transoxiana]] as free men due to various causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ML2bBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdtaTi0d_YAhUH4o8KHdMmAf04ChDoAQhGMAY#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The Age of the Seljuqs|author=[[Edmund Herzig]]|page= 1|publisher=I.B.

Nuh]], the commander of forces in Khorasan Alp-Tegin along with the ''[[vizier]]'' [[Muhammad Bal'ami]] attempted to place a ruler of their choice on the throne. The attempt failed however and Alp-Tegin decided to withdraw to the eastern fringes of the empire. Per the sources, he wanted to flee to India to avoid his enemies and earn divine merit by raiding the Hindus. He didn't intend to capture [[Ghazna]], but was forced to take it when denied transit by its ruler.&lt;ref name=BosworthGhaznavid&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ghaznavids: Their empire in Afghanistan and eastern Iran, 994 - 1040|author=[[C.E.

Alp-Tegin proceeded with his small force of ''ghulams'' and ''[[ghazis]]'' (200 ghulams and 800 ghazis according to ''[[Siyasatnama]]'', while ''Majma al-ansab'' of Muhammad b. Ali al-Shabankara'i (d. 1358) states 700 ghulams and 2,500 [[Tajiks]]). En route, he subdued the Iranian ''Sher'' of Bamiyan and the Hindu-Shahi king of Kabul. He then came to Ghazna whose citadel he besieged for four months and wrested the town from its ruler, Abu 'Ali or [[Abu Bakr Lawik]] or Anuk. The origin of this chief was Turkic, though it is not known if he was a Samanid vassal or an independent ruler. [[Josef Markwart]] suggests he was a late representative of the Zunbils.&lt;ref name=BosworthGhaznavid/&gt; The Lawik dynasty of Ghazna was linked to the Hindu-Shahi dynasty through marriage.&lt;ref name=Bayne165/&gt; Alp-Tegin was accompanied by Sabuktigin during the conquest of Ghazna.&lt;ref name=Volume5&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=16yHq5v3QZAC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjarYrb8d_YAhUDv5QKHUmzBsEQ6AEIJzAB#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 5|author=[[John Andrew Boyle]]|page=165|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Minhaj al-Siraj Juzjani]] states that Alp-Tegin had his position regularised by Amir [[Mansur I|Mansur b. Nuh]] through an investiture, however ''Siyasatnama'' mentions an expedition against Alp-Tegin from Bukhara which was defeated outside Ghazna. His ambiguous, semi-rebel status seems to be reflected in his coins, with two of his coins minted at [[Parwan]] mentioning his authority from the Samanids to mint coins only in an indirect way.&lt;ref name=BosworthGhaznavid/&gt; He was succeeded by his son [[Abu Ishaq Ibrahim of Ghazna|Abu Ishaq Ibrahim]], who lost Ghazna to [[Abu Ali Lawik]], the son of its expelled ruler.

Piri was expelled and Sabuktigin became governor in 977 A.D.

====Sabuktigin====

=====First war against Jayapala=====

The Ghaznavid campaigns from the time of Sabuktigin are recorded as ''[[jihad]]'' against the people of ''al-Hind'' to destroy idolatry and replace it by expanding Islam. The Kabul Shahis only retained [[Lamghan]] in the Kabul-Gandhara area by the time of Alp-tegin. According to [[Firishta]], Sabuktigin had already begun raiding Lamghan under Alp-tegin. This precipitated an alliance between the Shahi ruler [[Jayapala]] and the Muslim Amirs of [[Multan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2m7_R5P2oAC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP2JiR6LTYAhWFuI8KHYMkAcwQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Al-Hind, the Making of the Indo-Islamic World: Early Medieval India and the Expansion of Islam 7th-11th Centuries|publisher=Brill|pages=126, 328}}&lt;/ref&gt; He crossed the [[Khyber Pass]] many times and raided the territory of Jaipala.&lt;ref name=Sastri&gt;{{cite book|title=History of India, Volume 2|author=[[K. A. Nilakanta Sastri]]|publisher=Viswanathan|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sabuktigin plundered the forts in the outlying provinces of the Kabul Shahi and captured many cities, acquiring huge booty.&lt;ref name=Strugglemajumdar/&gt; He also established Islam at many places. Jaipal in retaliation marched with a large force into the valley of Lamghan ([[Jalalabad]]) where he clashed with Sabuktigin and his son. The battle stretched on several days until a snow storm affected Jaipala's strategies, forcing him to plead for peace.&lt;ref name=Sastri/&gt; He was inclined to grant peace to Jayapala but his son [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Mahmud]] wanted total victory.&lt;ref name=EralySabuk/&gt;

Jaypala upon hearing Mahmud's plans warned, &quot;You have seen the impetuosity of the Hindus and their indifference to death... If therefore, you refuse to grant peace in the hope of obtaining plunder, tribute, elephants and prisoners, then there is no alternative for us but to mount the horse of stern determination, destroy our property, take out the eyes of our elephants, cast our children into fire, and rush out on each other with sword and spear, so that all that will be left to you to conquer and seize is stones and dirt, dead bodies, and scattered bones.&quot; Knowing he could carry it out, Sabuktigin granted him peace on promise of paying tribute and ceding some of his territory.&lt;ref name=EralySabuk&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vyEoAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT54&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZr6HAsfvYAhUHtY8KHbHDDIEQ6AEIKDAB#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The Age of Wrath: A History of the Delhi Sultanate|author=[[Abraham Eraly]]|publisher=Penguin UK|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Second war against Jayapala=====

After making peace with Sabuktigin, Jayapala returned to Waihind but broke the treaty and mistreated the amirs sent to collect the tribute. Sabuktigin launched another invasion in retaliation. While the mamluks remained the core of his army, he also hired the ''Afghans'', especially the [[Ghilji]] tribe, in his dominion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xx7ICQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilxNvYtPvYAhVMYo8KHcT3AHw4ChDoAQgiMAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Warfare in Pre-British India – 1500BCE to 1740CE|author=Kaushik Roy|publisher=Routledge|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to al-Utbi, Sabuktigin attacked Lamghan, conquering it and burning the residences of the &quot;infidels&quot; while also demolishing its idol-temples and establishing Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Essays on Islam and Indian History|author=Richard Maxwell Eaton|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proceeded to butcher the idolaters, destroyed their temples and plundered their shrines. It is said his forces even risked frostbite on their hands while counting the large booty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0IquM4BrJ4YC&amp;pg=PT212&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY9Of2wvvYAhVB6Y8KHfEuA7wQ6AEIIzAA|title=India: A History. Revised and Updated|author=John Keay|publisher=Grove/Atlantic Inc.|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To avenge the savage attack of Sabuktigin, Jayapala, who had earlier taken his envoys as hostage, decided to go to war again in revenge. According to al-Utbi, he assembled an army of 100,000 against Sabuktigin. The much later account of Ferishta states that it included troops from [[Kanauj]], [[Ajmer]], [[Delhi]] and [[Kalinjar]]. The two sides fought an open battlefield in Laghman. Sabuktigin divided his army into packs of 500 who attacked the Indians in succession. After sensing that they were weakened, his forces mounted a concerted attack. The forces of Kabul Shahi were routed and those still alive were killed in the forest or drowned in the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0IquM4BrJ4YC&amp;pg=PT212&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY9Of2wvvYAhVB6Y8KHfEuA7wQ6AEIIzAA|title=India: A History.

The second battle that took place between Sabuktigin and Jayapala in 988 A.D., resulted in the former capturing territory between Lamghan and [[Peshawar]]. Al-Utbi also states that the Afghans and [[Ghaljis|Khaljis]], living there as nomads, took the oath of allegiance to him and were recruited into his army.&lt;ref name=Raza&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress|title=The Afghans and their relations with the Ghaznavids and the Ghurids|author=[[Jabir Raza|Syed Jabir Raza]]|publisher=Indian History Congress|page=786}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped [[Nuh II]] in expelling the rebel and heretic [[Simjurids|Abu Ali Simjur]] from Khorasan, resulting in its governorship being given to Sabuktigin who appointed Mahmud as his deputy there. He appointed [[Ismail of Ghazni|Ismail]] as successor to his kingdom and died in 997. A succession war erupted between Ismail and Mahmud, with the latter gaining the throne in 998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AXAABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA187&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjfyfrezfvYAhUBuY8KHa9hByoQ6AEILjAC#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=A History of Afghanistan: Volumes 1 and 2|author=[[Percy Sykes]]|publisher=Routledge|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Samanid amir [[Mansur II]] appointed Bektuzun as Khorasan's governor after Sabuktigin's death. Mahmud however wished to reacquire the governorship after defeating his brother Ismail and his allies. Bektuzun and Fa'iq, the ''de facto'' power behind the Samanid throne, toppled Mansur II as they did not trust him and replaced him with [[Abd al-Malik II (Samanid emir)|Abu'l Fawaris 'Abd al-Malik]]. Their forces were however defeated in 999 by Mahmud, who acquired all the lands south of Oxus with even those to the north of the river submitting to him. The Samanid dynasty was later ended by the [[Karakhanids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hvx9jq_2L3EC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjkyb-osYrYAhWHNo8KHffpCU0Q6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 4|author=[[Richard N.

=====Wars against Kabul Shahi=====

Mahmud systemized plunder raids into India as a long-term policy of the Ghaznavids. The first raid was undertaken in September 1000, but was meant for reconnaissance and identifying the possible terrain and roads that could be used for future raids.  He reached Peshawar by September 1001 and was attacked by Jayapala. The two sides [[Battle of Peshawar (1001)|clashed]] on 27–28 November 1001 with Jayapala captured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xx7ICQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjOo8mn2fvYAhVHtY8KHbu8BV4Q6AEIMzAD#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title= Warfare in Pre-British India – 1500BCE to 1740CE|publisher=Routledge|author=Kaushik Roy|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anandapala]] who was at Waihand had to pay a heavy ransom to have his father and others released.

Mahmud used his plundered wealth to finance his armies which included mercenaries. The Indian soldiers, presumably Hindus, who were one of the components of the army with their commander called ''[[sipahsalar]]-i-Hinduwan'' lived in their quarter of Ghazna practicing their own religion. Indian soldiers under their commander Suvendhray remained loyal to Mahmud. They were also used against a Turkic rebel, with the command given to a Hindu named Tilak according to [[Abu'l-Fadl Bayhaqi|Baihaki]].&lt;ref name=Fadl&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PnBMFaGMabYC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWnIi-zv3YAhUDro8KHaLtD98Q6AEINDAD#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title= Somanatha: The Many Voices of a History|publisher=Verso|author=[[Romila Thapar]]|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The renowned 14th-century Moroccan Muslim scholar [[Ibn Battuta]] remarked that the [[Hindu Kush]] meant the &quot;slayer of Indians&quot;, because slaves brought from [[Indian subcontinent|India]] who had to pass through there died in large numbers due to the extreme cold and quantity of snow.&lt;ref name=Ransom&gt;{{cite book|author=Christoph Witzenrath|title=Eurasian Slavery, Ransom and Abolition in World History, 1200–1860|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LG1CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45 |year=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-14002-3 |page=45|quote=Ibn Battuta, the renowned Moroccan fourteenth century world traveller remarked in a spine-chilling passage that Hindu Kush means slayer of the Indians, because the slave boys and girls who are brought from India die there in large numbers as a result of the extreme cold and the quantity of snow.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states:

=====Invasions of Ghur=====

[[File:MuhammadibnSuriPaintingHistoryofIran.jpg|thumb|300px|Painting of [[Muhammad ibn Suri]] (white-haired) with his men by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]]]]

The conversion of Ghur occurred over a long period and it was mostly pagan until the 10th century, which [[Mohammad Habib]] and [[Khaliq Ahmad Nizami]] say was probably a result of the missionary activities by the [[Karramiyya]] movement established in the region in 10th-11th centuries. Its imperfect conversion is visible by the fact that while the people of Ghur had Muslim names, they led the life of pagans. Muhammad b. Suri who had acknowledged Sabuktigin as his sovereign, withheld tribute after his death, started plundering caravans and harassed the subjects of Sultan Mahmud.&lt;ref name=Nab/&gt; [[Rawżat aṣ-ṣafāʾ]] called him a pagan, al-Utbi stated he was a Hindu.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xd5VonTOppMC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=al+otbi+ghor+hindus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjG3Ouux5jhAhVLeysKHeY3CrQQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=al%20otbi%20ghor%20hindus&amp;f=false] Page 161 from “E.J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam 1913–1936”&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1011, Mahmud despatched an expedition to conquer Ghur under Altuntash, governor of [[Herat]], and Arslan Hajib, governor of [[Tus, Iran|Tus]]. Muhammad b. Suri, the king, placed himself in inaccessible hills and ravines. The Ghurids were however defeated and Suri was captured along with his son Shith. [[Abu Ali ibn Muhammad|Abu Ali]], who had remained on good terms with the Sultan, was made the ruler of Ghur by him. Eastern Ghur was brought under Ghaznavid control.&lt;ref name=Nab&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lodSckjlNuMC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjVw_CY6P3YAhUJNo8KHdVXC7UQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title= History of Civilizations of Central Asia - Volume IV, Part I|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|editor1=M. S. Asimov|editor2=C. E. Bosworth|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1015, Mahmud attacked Ghur's southwestern district of Khwabin and captured some forts.&lt;ref name=Nizami&gt;{{cite book|title=A Comprehensive History of India: The Delhi Sultanat, A.D. 1206–1526|publisher=[[Orient Longmans]]|year=1970|page=147|editor=[[Mohammed Habib]], [[K. A. Nizami]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1020, Mahmud's son [[Ma'sud I of Ghazni|Ma'sud]] was despatched to take Ghur's northwestern part called Tab. He was helped by Abul Hasan Khalaf and Shirwan, chieftains of the south-western and north-eastern regions respectively. He captured many forts, bringing entire Ghur except maybe the inaccessible interior under Ghaznavid control.&lt;ref name=Nizami/&gt; He also captured the stronghold of the chieftain Warmesh-Pat of Jurwas, levying a tribute of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Medieval History of Iran, Afghanistan, and Central Asia|pages= 142|publisher=Variorum Reprints|year=1977|author=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minhaj al-Siraj Juzjani praises Abu Ali for firmly establishing Islamic institutions in Ghur. The progress of Islam in this divided region after his death is however unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Medieval History of Iran, Afghanistan, and Central Asia|pages= 138, 149|publisher=Variorum Reprints|year=1977|author=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghur remained a pagan enclave until the 11th century. Mahmud who raided it, left Muslim precepts to teach Islam to the local population. The region became Muslim by 12th century though the historian [[Satish Chandra]] states that [[Mahayana Buddhism]] is believed to have existed until the end of the century.&lt;ref name= &quot;Satish2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=L5eFzeyjBTQC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2sJ_-5fvYAhWHq48KHQJtAkMQ6AEIKDAB#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title= Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals-Delhi Sultanat (1206–1526) - Part One|publisher=Har-Anand Publishers|author=[[Satish Chandra]]|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Mahmud nor Ma'sud conquered the interior. Habib and Nizami say Ghurids were gradually converted by propagandists of new mystic movements. The Shansabani succeeded in establishing their seniority, if not its unification. By the time of [[Bahram-Shah of Ghazna|Sultan Bahram]], Ghur was converted and politically unified.&lt;ref name=Habib&gt;{{cite book|title=Politics and Society During the Early Medieval Period: Collected Works of Professor Mohammad Habib|pages= 141|publisher=People's Publishing House|year=1977|author=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Minhaj, both [[Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad|Ghiyasuddin]] and [[Muhammad of Ghor|Mu'izzuddin]] were Karamis who later converted to [[Shafi‘i]] and [[Hanafi]] Islam respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= A Comprehensive History of India: Volume Five - The Delhi Sultanat (A.D. 1206–1526)|publisher=People's Publishing House|editor=[[Mohammad Habib]], [[Khaliq Ahmad Nizami]]|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tarikh-i guzida]] however says the Ghorids were only converted to Islam by Mahmud.&lt;ref&gt;Tarikh -I-Guzida of Hamdu-lla-Mustaufi. Page 65 from ''The History of India told by its own Historians H M Eliot and Dowson'' Volume 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion of Pashtun-Afghan people==

The name ''Afghanistan'' was first used in a political sense by Saifi Herawi in the 14th century. It was even used during the height of the [[Durrani Empire]]. Only after the [[Durand line]] was fixed, did its modern usage for the land between it and the Oxus river became usual. The people who were mostly responsible for establishing the Afghan kingdom are referred to as ''Pashtun''. The name ''[[Pashtuns|Pashtun]]'' (or ''Pakthun'') is the original and oldest name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i_C4CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR17&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB8MqI24zZAhWMM48KHZMuCgcQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Government and Society in Afghanistan: The Reign of Amir ‘Abd Al-Rahman Khan|author=Hasun Kawun Kakar|page= xvii|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tenth-century Persian geography ''[[Hudud al-'Alam]]'' is the earliest known mention of the [[Afghan (ethnonym)|Afghans]]. In ''Discourse on the Country of Hindistan and Its Towns'', he states that, &quot;Saul, a pleasant village on a mountain. In it live Afghans.&quot; [[Ibn Battuta]] described Saul being situated between [[Gardez]] and Husaynan along a common trade route, the exact location of Husaynan is unknown. Akhund Darweza states their original homeland was Qandahar from where they migrated in 11th century upon [[Mahmud of Ghazni]]'s request to assist him in his conquests. Afghan tradition considers &quot;Kase Ghar&quot; in [[Sulaiman Mountains|Sulayman range]] as the homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The transformation of Afghan tribal society: Tribal expansion, Mughal imperialism and the Roshaniyya insurrection, 1450-1600|pages=133–134|author=Joseph Theodore Arlinghaus, Duke University Dept. of History|publisher=Duke University|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hudud al-'Alam'' also mentions that the king of Ninhar ([[Nangarhar]]) had many wives including &quot;Moslem, Afghan and Hindu&quot;.&lt;ref name=Ninhar/&gt;

The Pashtun traditions speak of [[Islamization]] during [[Muhammad]]'s time through [[Khalid ibn Walid]].&lt;ref name=Meel&gt;{{cite book|title= Peshawar: Historic City of the Frontier|pages=64–65|author=Ahmed Hassan Dani|publisher=Sang-e-Meel Publications|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Qais Abdur Rashid]], the presumed ancestor of the Afghans, is said to have led a delegation to Mecca from [[Ghor]] after being summoned by Khalid b. Walid and converted to Islam while also distinguishing himself in the service of the prophet. Adopting the name Abdul Rashid, three sons - [[Sarbani|Saraban]], Ghurghust, [[Karlani]], and a foundling [[Karlani|Karlanri]] linked to Saban, are the progenitors of the major Afghan divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AAHna6aqtX4C&amp;pg=PA30|title= Historical Dictionary of Afghanistan|page=30|author=Ludwig W.

[[Nimat Allah al-Harawi|Ni'matullah]]'s ''Makhzan-i-Afghani'' traces their history to an [[Israelite]] called [[Afghana]] who constructed the [[al-Aqsa mosque]]. Per it under the time of [[Solomon in Islam|King Suleiman]], a figure named [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Bokhtnasser]] was responsible for &quot;carrying away the Israelites, whom he settled in the mountainous districts of Ghor, Ghazneen, Kabul, Candahar, Koh Firozeh, and the parts lying within the fifth and sixth climates; where they, especially those descended of Asif and Afghana, fixed their habitations, continually increasing in number, and incessantly making war on the infidels around them.&quot; [[Qais Abdur Rashid|Qais]] traveled to Medina to receive Mohammed's blessings and fought against the Meccans. Muhammad himself conferred the title of ''Pashtun'' upon Qais and his people. They returned to Ghor to spread Islam and pledged loyalty to Mahmud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f6_SCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11|title= Afghan Modern: The History of a Global Nation|pages=11–12|author=Robert D.

The Arabs, at war with the Kabul Shah, had directed their campaigns in direction of [[Gandhara]]. By the time of [[Muawiyah I|Muawiya]], Sistan's governorship was separated from Khorasan with the governor looking after the region and keeping a check on Kabul Shah. [[Ahmed Hassan Dani]] considers that the Arab activities may have led to conversion of Aghans as well, and it may have been wholesale because of their tribal nature ie all the Afghan tribes adopted Islam at once.&lt;ref name=Meel/&gt;

Quoting ''Matla-al-Anwar'', [[Ferishta]] states a man named Khalid, son of Abdullah, stated by some to be a descendant of [[Khalid bin Walid]] or [[Abu Jahl]], was for some time governor of Herat, Ghor, [[Gharjistan]] and Kabul. After being relieved of the charge, he settled in Koh Sulaiman, with the Lodis and [[Sur (Pashtun tribe)|Suris]] being the descendant of his daughter who married a converted Afghan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Peshawar: Historic City of the Frontier|pages=64|author=Ahmed Hassan Dani|publisher=Sang-e-Meel Publications|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only he continues with Afghan history after this. He states that the Hindu Shahi king gave them a few villages in [[Laghman Province|Laghman]] in return for guarding against the Arabs. He adds that after being unable to withstand Sabuktigin's raids, Jaipala appointed the Afghan [[Shiekh Hamid Lodhi]] to an ''[[Emir|Amirate]]'' but Lodhi was removed after Sabuktigin became supreme in Ghazni. Ferishta speaks of the Afghans here as Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Peshawar: Historic City of the Frontier|pages=65–66|author=Ahmed Hassan Dani|publisher=Sang-e-Meel Publications|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Utbi in ''[[Tarikh Yamini|Tarikh-i-Yamini]]'' states that the Afghans were enlisted by Sabuktigin and also Mahmud. During this period, the Afghan habitat was in the Sulaiman Mountains.&lt;ref name=Ninhar&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AXAABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14|title= A History of Afghanistan: Volumes 1 and 2|page=14|author=Percy Sykes|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; After defeating Jayapala in 988 A.D., Sabuktigin had acquired the territory between [[Laghman Province|Laghman]] and [[Peshawar]]. Al-Utbi states that the Afghans and [[Ghaljis|Khaljis]], living there as nomads, took the oath of allegiance to him and were recruited into his army.&lt;ref name=Raza/&gt;Iqtidar Husain Siddiqui citing the 13th century Persian translation, claims he mentions the &quot;Afghans&quot; were [[pagan]]s given to rapine and rapacity, they were defeated and converted to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;''The Process of Acculturation in Regional Historiography:The Case of the Delhi Sultanate'', Iqtidar Husain Siddiqui, '''Art and Culture: Endeavours in Interpretation''', Vol.1, Ed. Ahsan Jan Qaisar, Som Prakash Verma, Mohammad Habib, (Abhinav Publications, 1996), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the 11th century AD, [[Al-Biruni]] in his ''Tarikh al Hind'', stated that the Afghans tribes lived in mountains as west of India.&lt;ref name=Vogelsang&gt;The Afghans By Willem Vogelsang Edition: illustrated Published by Wiley-Blackwell, 2002 Page 118 {{ISBN|0-631-19841-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-631-19841-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes, &quot;In the western frontier mountains of India there live various tribes of the Afghans and extend up to the neighbourhood of the [[Indus Valley|Sindu valley]].&quot; 

Mahmud had gone to war against pagan Afghan while campaigning in the Sulayman mountains.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2lrRAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Mahmud+Ghaznavi+had+to+fight+against+the+infidel+Afghans+in+the+Sulaiman+mountains&amp;dq=Mahmud+Ghaznavi+had+to+fight+against+the+infidel+Afghans+in+the+Sulaiman+mountains&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA76_U9ZjhAhXFdysKHbiZDMEQ6AEIJjAA Page 21 from &quot;Studies in Asian history: proceedings&quot;, K.

In 1519, [[Babur]] mounted an [[Battle of Bajaur (1519)|attack]] on the fort of [[Bajaur]] and sent a [[Dilazak]] Afghan as an ambassador to the Gibri Sultan of Bajaur, Mir Haidar 'Ali, to surrender and enter his services. Gibri, a [[Dardic languages|Dardic language]] of Bajaur, was also spoken by the royal family and nobility of the [[Swat Valley]]. The Gibris decided to resist and Babur's forces stormed it in two days. He ordered a general massacre of its inhabitants on the pretext that they had rebelled against [[Babur#At Kabul|Kabul's regime]] and were infidels who had [[apostasy|forsaken]] Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The transformation of Afghan tribal society: tribal expansion, Mughal imperialism and the Roshaniyya insurrection, 1450-1600|publisher=Duke University|author=Joseph Theodore Arlinghaus|pages=191, 200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The westward migration of Pashtuns from Sulaiman mountains to [[Qandahar]] and [[Herat]] is thought to have begun in the 15th century. In the 16th century, the area around Qandahar formed a bone of contention between [[Ghilzai]] and [[Durranis|Abdalis]]. The latter gave in and migrated to Herat during the reign of [[Safavid]] [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas I]]. Their migration displaced or subjugated the indigenous populations especially the [[Tajiks]] who were also the dominant population in Kabul, [[Nangarhar]] and [[Laghman Province|Laghman]] in east Afghanistan. Before advent of Ghilzais of the [[Ahmadzai (Ghilji clan)|Ahmadzai]] division in the late 16th century, [[Logar River]] was also a Tajik stronghold. The Pashtuns also displaced the original [[Nuristanis|Kafirs]] and [[Pashayi people|Pashayi]] people in [[Kunar Valley]] and Laghman valley, located south of Kabul in east Afghanistan, to the infertile mountains.

== Conquests of Kafiristan ==

[[File:AfghanistanNurestan.png|thumb|300px|[[Nooristan]] province, renamed from [[Kafiristan]] in 1896]]

[[Kafiristan]] is a mountainous region of the [[Hindu Kush]] that was isolated and politically independent until the [[Emirate of Afghanistan|Afghan]] conquest of 1896.&lt;ref name=Pellat/&gt; Before their conversion to Islam, the Nuristanis or Kafir people practiced a form of [[ancient Hinduism]] infused with locally developed accretions.&lt;ref name=&quot;nuristan.info&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuristan.info/Nuristani/Nuristanis1.html|title=Richard Strand's Nuristân Site: Peoples and Languages of Nuristan|author=[[Richard Strand|Richard F. Strand]]|date=31 December 2005|work=nuristan.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kafiristan proper from west to east comprises basins of [[Alishang]], [[Alingar River|Alingar]], Pec or Praisun, Waigal and [[Landai Sin Valley|Bashgal]]. The region became a refuge of an old group of [[Indo-European people]] probably mixed with an older substratum, as well as a refuge of a distinct Kafiri group of [[Indo-Iranian languages]], forming part of the wider [[Dardic languages]]. The inhabitants were known as &quot;[[kafir]]s&quot; due to their enduring paganism while other regions around them became Muslim. However, the influence from district names in Kafiristan of Katwar or Kator and the ethnic name [[Kata people|Kati]] has also been suggested. The Kafirs were divided into [[Siah-Posh Kafirs|Siyah-Posh]], comprising five sub-tribes who spoke [[Kata-vari dialect|Lato language]] while the others were called [[Safed-Posh]] comprising Prasungeli, Wangeli, Wamais and Ashhkun.&lt;ref name=Pellat&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Volume IV|editor1=C.

The Kafirs called themselves &quot;Balor&quot;, a term that appeared in Chinese sources as early as the fifth century A.D. Both Chinese sources and Muslim sources like the 16th-century work of Kashmir's conqueror [[Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat]], the terms &quot;Bolor&quot; and &quot;Boloristan&quot; denote the area from the [[Kabul River|Kabul valley]] to Kashmir, [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]] and [[Kashgar]]. The country is the most inaccessible part of Hindu Kush. The Muslim conquerors could not achieve a lasting success here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Baz_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA84&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8iPP2noPZAhVH72MKHQzmAdcQ6AEIRjAG#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=An Historical Geography of Iran|author=[[Vasily Bartold]]|pages=84–85|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area extending from modern Nooristan to Kashmir was known as &quot;Peristan&quot;, a vast area containing host of &quot;Kafir&quot; cultures and Indo-European languages that became Islamized over a long period. Earlier, it was surrounded by Buddhist areas. The Islamization of the nearby [[Badakhshan]] began in the 8th century and Peristan was completely surrounded by Muslim states in the 16th century with Islamization of [[Baltistan]]. The Buddhist states temporarily brought literacy and state rule into the region. The decline of Buddhism resulted in it becoming heavily isolated.&lt;ref name=academia&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/35077429/Fence_of_Peristan_-_The_Islamization_of_the_Kafirs_and_Their_Domestication|journal=Archivio per l'Antropologia e la Etnologia

===Mahmud of Ghazna===

In 1020–21, Sultan Mahmud of Ghazna led a campaign against Kafiristan and the people of the &quot;pleasant valleys of Nur and Qirat&quot; according to Gardizi.&lt;ref name=Saran&gt;{{cite book|title= A Comprehensive History of India|publisher=Orient Longmans|author=[[Ram Sharan Sharma]]|page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian chronicles speak of Qirat and Nur (or Nardin) which [[H.

According to Gardezi, while returning from invasion of India, he had heard about them and the chief of Qirat surrendered without any struggle and accepted to convert, with the inhabitants converting as well. Nur however refused to surrender and his general 'Amir Ali led an attack on it and forcing its people to convert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Medieval Indian History|author=Sri Ram Sharma|page=28|publisher=Dayanand College|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Firshta, the rulers of both of them submitted and accepted Islam in 1022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uQ7k2vQlYxEC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjOj42zpIjZAhVFuo8KHV_jA684ChDoAQgtMAI#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Al-Hind: The Slavic Kings and the Islamic conquest, 11th-13th centuries|author=André Wink|page=123|publisher=Brill|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He adds, &quot;On breaking a great temple situated there, the ornamented figure of a lion came out of it, which according to the belief of the Hindus was four thousand years old.&quot;&lt;ref name=Habib2/&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History and Culture of the Indian People: The Delhi Sultanate|author=[[R.C. Majumdar]]|page=4|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |year=1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his way to India, Timur attacked the Siyah-Posh in 1398 A.D. after receiving complaints from the trading city of [[Andarab]] by raids from Kafirs. He penetrated it from Khawak pass and restored an old fortress there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Baz_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwikidO4rIDZAhVIvY8KHbOuAlc4ChDoAQhJMAg#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=An Historical Geography of Iran|author=[[Vasily Bartold]]|page=85|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He personally proceeded against the Kator region which extended from Kabul to Kashmir.&lt;ref name=Sultanatemajumdar/&gt;

Timur sent a detachment of 10,000 soldiers against Siyah-Poshas under Burhan Aglan and had the fort of Kator deserted by Kafirs destroyed while the houses of the city were burnt. The infidels took refuge on top of a hill and many were killed in the ensuing clash. Some held out for three days but agreed to convert after Timur offered them the choice between death and Islam. They however soon apostatised and ambushed Muslim soldiers in the night. They were however repelled and a number of the Kafirs were killed, with 150 taken prisoner and later executed. Timur ordered his men &quot;to kill all the men, to make prisoners of women and children, and to plunder and lay waste all their property.&quot; His soldiers carried out the order and he directed them to build a tower of skulls of the dead Kafirs.&lt;ref name=Sultanatemajumdar/&gt;

Timur had his expedition engraved on a neighboring hill in the month of Ramazan. His detachment sent against Siyah-Poshas however met with disaster with Aglan routed and fleeing. A small detachment of 400 men under Muhammad Azad was sent and defeated the Kafirs, retrieving the horses and armour Aglan lost. Timur later captured a few more places, though nothing more is stated, presumably he left the Siyah-poshas alone. He proceeded to exterminate the rebellious Afghan tribes and crossed the [[Indus River|Sindhu River]] in September 1398.&lt;ref name=Sultanatemajumdar&gt;{{cite book|title=The History and Culture of the Indian People: The Delhi Sultanate|author=[[R.C.

The [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] [[Sultan Mahmud Mirza]] is said to have raided Kafiristan twice by ''[[Baburnama]]'', which earned him the title of ''[[ghazi (warrior)|ghazi]]''.&lt;ref name=Pellat/&gt;

===Yarkand Khanate===

Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat invaded Balor under orders of [[Sultan Said Khan]] in 1527-1528 A.D. and was accompanied by Khan's eldest son [[Abdurashid Khan|Rashid Khan]]. The expedition was an Islamic frontier raid or ''[[Ghazi (warrior)|ghaza]]''.&lt;ref name=OUP/&gt; Dughlat undertook highly devastating plundering raids on Bolor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Central Asia|volume=2|issue=1|title=Bolor - A Contribution to the Political and Ethnic Geography of Pakistan|page=59|author=Karl Jettmar|publisher=Centre for the Study of the Civilizations of Central Asia, [[Quaid-i-Azam University]]|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rashid Khan (r. 1533–1569) undertook further expeditions against Bolor (Kafiristan) which are recorded by ''Tarikh-i-Kashgar'' and ''Bahr al-asar'' of Mahmud b. Amir Wali. The Kashgari author mentions it briefly though Wali goes into detail. The first campaign failed with a number of Kashgari captured and enslaved by the people of Bolor. A second invasion was successful and forced them to submit. ''Tarikh-i-Kashgar'' states that Bolor was governed by Shah Babur after [[Abdallah (Moghul Khan)|Abdullah Khan's]] successful campaign in 1640.&lt;ref name=OUP&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings of the Second International Hindukush Cultural Conference|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1996|editor= Elena Bashir, Israr-ul-Din}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mughals===

[[Babur]] writing in his memoirs notes that when he captured [[Asadabad, Afghanistan|Chigha Sarai]] in 1514, the &quot;Kafirs of Pech came to their assistance.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ludwig/&gt; He mentions some Muslim ''nīmčas'' or half-breeds, probably converted Kafirs, who married with the Kafirs and lived at Chigha Sarai, located at confluence of [[Kunar River]] and [[Pech River]].&lt;ref name=Pellat/&gt;

Babur himself came to the region in the winter of 1507–1508 and had an inscription carved commemorating his transit.&lt;ref name=Pellat/&gt; While fleeing to India to take refuge in Afghan-Indian borderlands after [[Muhammad Shaybani|Shibani Khan]] attacked [[Qandahar]], which Babur had recently conquered, he marched from Kabul to [[Lamghan]] in September 1507. He eventually reached [[Adinapur]] fort in [[Nangarhar]] district. He comments that his men had to forage for food and raided the rice fields of the Kafirs in the Alishang district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M6wPbXSyvjYC&amp;pg=PA229&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxr7-674LZAhVKuo8KHfd3BOoQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Garden of the Eight Paradises: Bābur and the Culture of Empire in Central Asia, Afghanistan and India (1483-1530)|author=Stephen Frederic Dale|page=229|publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]] |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1520, he mentions sending Haidar Alamdar to the Kafirs who returned and met him under Bandpakht along with some Kafir chiefs who gifted Babur some skins of wine.&lt;ref name=Ludwig&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical and Political Gazetteer of Afghanistan, Volume 6|author=[[Ludwig W.

The relationship of the Siahposh and residents of Panjshir and Andarab remained the same even more than a century after Timur's expedition. Babur records about Panjshir that, &quot;It lies upon the road, and is in the immediate vicinity of Kafiristan. The inroads of the robbers of Kafiristan are made through Panjshir. In consequence of their vicinity of the Kafirs - the inhabitants of this district are happy to pay them a fixed contribution. Since I last invaded Hindustan, and subdued it (in 1527), the Kafirs have descended into Panjshir, and returned after slaying a great number of people and committing extensive damages.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ludwig/&gt;

Per ''Tabakat-i-Akbari'', [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]] had dispatched his younger brother [[Mirza Muhammad Hakim]], who was a staunch adherent of the missionary-minded [[Naqshbandi]] [[Sufism|Sufi]] order, against the infidels of Katwar in 1582.&lt;ref name=Pellat/&gt; Hakim was a semi-independent governor of Kabul.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ğihād&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Israel Oriental Studies|volume=10|page=153|publisher=[[Tel Aviv University]]|author=[[C.

Muhammad Darvish's religious crusade fought its way from Lamghan to Alishang, and is stated to have conquered and converted 66 valleys to Islam. After conquering Tajau and Nijrau valleys in Panjshir area, the crusaders established a fort at Islamabad at confluence of Alishang and Alingar rivers. They continued the raid up to Alishang and made their last effort against the non-Muslims of Alingar, fighting up to Mangu, the modern border between [[Pashayi languages|Pashai]] and [[Askunu language|Ashkun-speaking]] areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gates of Peristan: history, religion and society in the Hindu Kush|publisher=Istituto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente|author=Alberto M.

===Final subjugation===

[[File:Amir Abdur Rahman Khan of Afghanistan-cropped.jpg|thumb|Amir [[Abdur Rahman Khan]]]]

Under Amir [[Sher Ali Khan]], Afghanistan was divided into provinces (''[[wilayat]]s'') of Kabul, Kandahar, Herat and [[Afghan Turkestan]]. [[Uruzgan]] and Kafiristan were later incorporated into Kabul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i_C4CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB8MqI24zZAhWMM48KHZMuCgcQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Government and Society in Afghanistan: The Reign of Amir ‘Abd Al-Rahman Khan|author=Hasun Kawun Kakar|page= 49|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some parts of Kafiristan were already following Islam before its conquest. Amir [[Abdul Rahman Khan]] tried to persuade them to convert to Islam by deputing Kafir elders. The Kafirs were poorly armed as compared to Afghans and numbered only 60,000. By 1895, demarcation of nearby [[Chitral district|Chitral]] under indirect [[British Empire|British]] rule and conquest of [[Pamirs]] by [[Russian Empire|Russia]] worried him about the endangerment of integration of Afghanistan through the independent Kafiristan.&lt;ref name=Texas&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i_C4CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA151&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB8MqI24zZAhWMM48KHZMuCgcQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Government and Society in Afghanistan: The Reign of Amir ‘Abd Al-Rahman Khan|author=Hasun Kawun Kakar|page=xxiv, 151|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghan tribes meanwhile undertook slave raids in places like Kafiristan, [[Hazarajat]], Badakhshan and Chitral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i_C4CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA174&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB8MqI24zZAhWMM48KHZMuCgcQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Government and Society in Afghanistan: The Reign of Amir ‘Abd Al-Rahman Khan|author=Hasun Kawun Kakar|page=174|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The territory between Afghanistan and [[British Raj|British India]] was [[Durand Line|demarcated between 1894 and 1896]]. Part of the frontier lying between Nawa Kotal in outskirts of [[Mohmand Agency|Mohmand country]] and [[Bashgal Valley]] on outskirts of Kafiristan were demarcated by 1895 with an agreement reached on 9 April 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PfrXAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA162&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjueb-sYDZAhVErY8KHaUfAxQQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=An Historical Geography of Iran|author=[[Vasily Bartold]]|page=85|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdur Rahman wanted to force every community and tribal confederation with his single interpretation of Islam due to it being the only uniting factor. After the subjugation of [[Hazaras]], Kafiristan was the last remaining autonomous part. [[Field marshal]] Ghulam Hayder Khan sent a message to Kafirs of Barikut which stated, &quot;It is not the duty of the government to compel, force or impose on them to accept, or take the path of the religion of Islam. The obligation that does exist is this: they render obedience and pay their taxes. As long as they do not disobey their command, they will not incinerate themselves with the fire of ''[[padishah]]'s'' [king's] wrath. In addition, they are not to block the building of the road [that was planned through their territory].&quot;&lt;ref name=Katib/&gt;

Emir Abdur Rahman Khan's forces invaded Kafiristan in the winter of 1895–1896 and captured it in 40 days according to his autobiography. Columns invaded it from the west through Panjshir to Kullum, the strongest fort of the region. The columns from the north came through [[Badakhshan]] and from the east through [[Asmar, Afghanistan|Asmar]]. A small column also came from south-west through [[Laghman Province|Laghman]]. The Kafirs were forcibly converted to Islam and resettled in Laghman while the region was settled by veteran soldiers and other Afghans. Kafiristan was renamed as [[Nooristan]].&lt;ref name=Sykes1&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AXAABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA195&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWx732tIDZAhUGro8KHSkABdQQ6AEILzAC#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=A History of Afghanistan: Volumes 1 and 2, Volume 1|author=[[Percy Sykes]]|publisher=Routledge|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other residents also converted to avoid the ''[[jizya]]''.&lt;ref name=Katib/&gt;
