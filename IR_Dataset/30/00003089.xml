'''Angela Vincent''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRS|FMedSci}} (born 1942)&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; is emeritus professor at the [[University of Oxford]] and a [[Fellow]] of [[Somerville College, Oxford]].&lt;Ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110107002838/http://www.neuroscience.ox.ac.uk/directory/angela-vincent Angela Vincent – Neuroscience]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080502162057/http://www.imm.ox.ac.uk/pages/research/neurosciences/vincent.htm WIMM]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoch|first=Werner|last2=McConville|first2=John|last3=Helms|first3=Sigrun|last4=Newsom-Davis|first4=John|last5=Melms|first5=Arthur|last6=Vincent|first6=Angela|date=2001|title=Auto-antibodies to the receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK in patients with myasthenia gravis without acetylcholine receptor antibodies|url=|journal=[[Nature Medicine]]|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=365–368|doi=10.1038/85520|issn=1546-170X|pmid= 11231638}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and research==
She was previously the head of a research group, located in the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine at the John Radcliffe Hospital, working on a wide range of [[biology|biological]] disciplines encompassing [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]], cellular [[immunology]] and intracellular [[neurophysiology]]. The group's research focused on autoimmune and [[genetic disorder]]s of the neuromuscular junction, peripheral nerves and more recently the exciting field of central nervous system diseases. The principal autoimmune diseases studied were [[myasthenia gravis]], the [[Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome]], [[limbic encephalitis]], other types of [[autoimmune encephalitis]] and acquired [[neuromyotonia]]. Since 2016 she has been Emeritus Professor at Oxford University and she continues to advise and support young researchers.  Her group's work is continued under Associate Professor Sarosh Irani and Dr Patrick Waters.  

Her contributions have been mainly on the roles of antibodies directed against [[ion channels]], proteins complexed to ion channels, such as LGI1, CASPR2 and Contactin-2, within [[neuron]]s, [[glia]] and the [[nerve]]-[[muscle]] junction in the pathogenesis of above-mentioned diseases.

She has demonstrated that transfer of these [[antibody|antibodies]] across the [[placenta]] from the [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] [[woman]] to the [[fetus]] [[in utero]] can cause developmental abnormalities. 

===Awards and honours===
In 2009 she presented the [[Leslie Oliver Oration]] at [[Queen's Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhrhospitals.nhs.uk/neuro/neuro4ha.php?id=1034 The Second Leslie Oliver Oration]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 she received the medal of the Association of British Neurologists and in 2017 the World Federation of Neurology Scientific Contributions to Neurology award.  She was awarded the Klaus Joachim Zülch Prize with J Posner and J Dalmau in 2018.  In 2003, she was elected a [[Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences]] (FMedSci) and in 2011 [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (FRS).
