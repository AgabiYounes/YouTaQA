'''ʻAbdu'l-Bahá'''&lt;ref&gt;The first apostrophe-like letter in &quot;ʻAbdu'l-Bahá&quot; is an [[ayin]], which in Persian is pronounced like the catch in the throat in English &quot;uh-oh!&quot;. The second is an actual apostrophe, used to show a contraction of a vowel, and is not pronounced. (I.e., ʻAbd-u-al-Baháʼ &gt; &quot;ʻAbdu'l-Bahá&quot; or &quot;ʻAbdul-Bahá&quot;.)&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ə|b|ˈ|d|ʊ|l|_|b|ə|ˈ|h|ɑː|}}; [[Persian language|Persian]]: {{lang|ar|عبد البهاء}}&amp;lrm;, 23 May 1844 – 28 November 1921), born '''ʻAbbás''' ({{lang-fa|عباس}}), was the eldest son of [[Baháʼu'lláh]] and served as head of the [[Baháʼí Faith]] from 1892 until 1921.{{sfn|Iranica|1989}} ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was later canonized as the last of three &quot;central figures&quot; of the religion, along with Baháʼu'lláh and the [[Báb]], and his writings and authenticated talks are regarded as a source of Baháʼí sacred literature.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=14-20}}

He was born in [[Tehran]] to an aristocratic family. At the age of eight his father was imprisoned during a government crackdown on the [[Bábism|Bábí Faith]] and the family's possessions were looted, leaving them in virtual poverty. His father was exiled from their native [[Iran]], and the family went to live in [[Baghdad]], where they stayed for nine years. They were later called by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] state to [[Istanbul]] before going into another period of confinement in [[Edirne]] and finally the prison-city of [[Acre, Palestine|ʻAkká]] (Acre). ʻAbdu'l-Bahá remained a political prisoner there until the [[Young Turk Revolution]] freed him in 1908 at the age of 64. He then made several [[ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West|journeys to the West]] to spread the Baháʼí message beyond its middle-eastern roots, but the onset of [[World War I]] left him largely confined to [[Haifa]] from 1914–1918. The war replaced the openly hostile Ottoman authorities with the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]], who [[Order of the British Empire|knighted]] him for his help in averting famine following the war.

In 1892 ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was appointed in his father's [[Tablets of Baháʼu'lláh#Kitáb-i-ʻAhd (Book of the Covenant)|will]] to be his successor and head of the [[Baháʼí Faith]]. He faced opposition from virtually all his family members, but held the loyalty of the great majority of Baháʼís around the world. His ''[[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]'' helped galvanize Baháʼís in North America into spreading the Baháʼí teachings to new territories, and his [[Will and Testament of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá|Will and Testament]] laid the foundation for the current [[Baháʼí administration|Baháʼí administrative order]]. Many of his writings, prayers and letters are extant, and his discourses with the Western Baháʼís emphasize the growth of the faith by the late 1890s.

ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's [[given name]] was ʻAbbás. Depending on context, he would have gone by either [[Mirza|Mírzá]] ʻAbbás (Persian) or ʻAbbás [[Effendi]] (Turkish), both of which are equivalent to the English [[Sir]] ʻAbbás. He preferred the title of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá (&quot;[[abdul|servant]] of Bahá&quot;, a reference to his father). He is commonly referred to in Baháʼí texts as &quot;The Master&quot;.

==Early life==
ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was born in [[Tehran]], Iran on 23 May 1844 (5th of [[Jumada al-awwal|Jamadiyu'l-Avval]], 1260 AH),&lt;ref name=&quot;Qazvini&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://bahai-library.com/qazvini_abdulbaha_prominent_iranians |title= ʻAbdu'l-Bahá Meeting with Two Prominent Iranians |accessdate=5 September 2007 | author= Muhammad Qazvini |year= 1949 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the eldest son of [[Baháʼu'lláh]] and [[Ásíyih Khánum|Navváb]]. He was born on the very same night on which the [[Báb]] declared his mission.{{sfn|Esslemont|1980}} Born with the given name of ʻAbbás,{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=14-20}} he was named after his grandfather [[Mírzá ʻAbbás Núrí]], a prominent and powerful nobleman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Kazemzadeh|2009&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kazemzadeh|2009|}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was shaped by his father's position as a prominent [[Bábí]]. He recalled how he met the Bábí  [[Táhirih]] and how she would take &quot;me on to her knee, caress me, and talk to me. I admired her most deeply&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blomfield|1975|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ʻAbdu'l-Bahá had a happy and carefree childhood. The family's Tehran home and country houses were comfortable and beautifully decorated. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá enjoyed playing in the gardens with his younger sister with whom he was very close.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blomfield 1975 40&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Blomfield|1975|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with his younger siblings – a sister, [[Bahíyyih Khánum|Bahíyyih]], and a brother, [[Mírzá Mihdí|Mihdí]] – the three lived in an environment of privilege, happiness and comfort.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Kazemzadeh|2009&quot;/&gt; With his father declining a position as minister of the royal court; during his young boyhood ʻAbdu'l-Bahá witnessed his parents' various charitable endeavours,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blomfield|1975|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included converting part of the home to a hospital ward for women and children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blomfield 1975 40&quot;/&gt;

ʻAbdu'l-Bahá received a haphazard education during his childhood. It was customary not to send children of nobility to schools. Most noblemen were educated at home briefly in scripture, rhetoric, calligraphy and basic mathematics. Many were educated to prepare themselves for life in the royal court. Despite a brief spell at a traditional preparatory school at the age of seven for one year,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taherzadeh|2000|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; ʻAbdu'l-Bahá received no formal education. As he grew he was educated by his mother, and uncle.&lt;ref&gt;Blomfield, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his education however, came from his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hogenson|2010|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later in 1890 [[Edward Granville Browne]] described how ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was &quot;one more eloquent of speech, more ready of argument, more apt of illustration, more intimately acquainted with the sacred books of the Jews, the Christians, and the Muhammadans...scarcely be found even amongst the eloquent.&quot;{{sfn|Browne|1891|p=xxxvi}}

When ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was seven, he contracted tuberculosis and was expected to die.&lt;ref&gt;Hogenson, p.81&lt;/ref&gt; Though the malady faded away,{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|p=12}} he would be plagued with bouts of illness for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Hogenson, p.82&lt;/ref&gt;

One event that affected ʻAbdu'l-Bahá greatly during his childhood was the imprisonment of his father when ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was eight years old; the imprisonment led to his family being reduced to poverty and being attacked in the streets by other children.{{sfn|Esslemont|1980}} ʻAbdu'l-Bahá accompanied his mother to visit [[Baháʼu'lláh]] who was then imprisoned in the infamous subterranean dungeon the [[Síyáh-Chál]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Kazemzadeh|2009&quot;/&gt; He described how &quot;I saw a dark, steep place. We entered a small, narrow doorway, and went down two steps, but beyond those one could see nothing. In the middle of the stairway, all of a sudden we heard His [Baháʼu'lláh's]…voice: 'Do not bring him in here', and so they took me back&quot;.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|p=12}}

== Baghdad ==
Baháʼu'lláh was eventually released from prison but ordered into exile, and ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, then 8 years old, joined his father on the journey to [[Baghdad]] in the winter (January to April)&lt;ref name=&quot;Winter'sChron&quot;&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/winters_chronology_babi_persecutions Chronology of persecutions of Babis and Baha'is] compiled by Jonah Winters&lt;/ref&gt; of 1853.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|p=12}} During the journey ʻAbdu'l-Bahá suffered from frost-bite. After a year of difficulties Baháʼu'lláh absented himself rather than continue to face the conflict with [[Mirza Yahya]] and secretly secluded himself in the mountains of [[Sulaymaniyah]] in April 1854 a month before ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's tenth birthday.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winter'sChron&quot;/&gt; Mutual sorrow resulted in him, his [[Ásíyih Khánum|mother]] and [[Bahiyyih Khánum|sister]] becoming constant companions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blomfield|1975|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was particularly close to both, and his mother took active participation in his education and upbringing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blomfield 1975 69&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Blomfield|1975|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the two-year absence of his father ʻAbdu'l-Bahá took up the duty of managing the affairs of the family,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peyman.info/cl/Baha'i/Others/ROB/V2/p388-396Ch18.html The Revelation of Baháʼu'lláh, volume two], page 391&lt;/ref&gt; before his [[age of majority|age of maturity]] (14 in middle-eastern society)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unrisd.org/unrisd/website/document.nsf/8b18431d756b708580256b6400399775/2e975aca2a81aa54c12576580028735c/$FILE/WebIran.pdf Can women act as agents of a democratization of theocracy in Iran?] by [[Homa Hoodfar]], Shadi Sadr, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; and was known to be occupied with reading and, at a time of hand-copied scriptures being the primary means of publishing, was also engaged in copying the writings of the [[Báb]].{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|p=14}} ʻAbdu'l-Bahá also took an interest in the art of horse riding and, as he grew, became a renowned rider.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt;

In 1856, news of an ascetic carrying on discourses with local Súfí leaders that seemed to possibly be Baháʼu'lláh reached the family and friends. Immediately, family members and friends went to search for the elusive [[dervish]] – and in March&lt;ref name=&quot;Winter'sChron&quot;/&gt; brought Baháʼu'lláh back to Baghdad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith17&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On seeing his father, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá fell to his knees and wept loudly &quot;Why did you leave us?&quot;, and this followed with his mother and sister doing the same.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|p=15}} ʻAbdu'l-Bahá soon became his father's secretary and shield.{{sfn|Esslemont|1980}} During the sojourn in the city ʻAbdu'l-Bahá grew from a boy into a young man. He was noted as a &quot;remarkably fine looking youth&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt; and remembered for his charity and amiableness.{{sfn|Esslemont|1980}} Having passed the age of maturity ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was regularly seen in the mosques of Baghdad discussing religious topics and the scripture as a young man. Whilst in Baghdad, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá composed a commentary at the request of his father on the Muslim tradition of &quot;[[I was a Hidden Treasure]]&quot; for a Súfí leader named ʻAlí Shawkat Páshá.{{sfn|Esslemont|1980}}&lt;ref name=&quot;iwaht&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = ʻAbdu'l-Bahá | title = ʻAbdu'l-Baha's Commentary on The Islamic Tradition: &quot;I Was a Hidden Treasure ...&quot; | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_kuntu_kanzan_makhfiyyan | publisher = Baha'i Studies Bulletin 3:4 (Dec. 1985), 4–35| accessdate=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was fifteen or sixteen at the time and ʻAlí Shawkat Páshá regarded the more than 11000 word essay as a remarkable feat for somebody of his age.{{sfn|Esslemont|1980}} In 1863, in what became known as the [[Garden of Ridván, Baghdad|Garden of Ridván]], his father Baháʼu'lláh announced to a few that he was the [[manifestation of God]] and [[He whom God shall make manifest]] whose coming had been foretold by the [[Báb]]. On day eight of the twelve days, it is believed ʻAbdu'l-Baha was the first person Baha'u'llah revealed his claim to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paintdrawer.co.uk/david/folders/Spirituality/001=Bahai/Ridvan.pdf  Declaration of Baha'u'llah]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/bahai/holydays/ridvan.shtml The history and significance of the Baháʼí festival of Ridván] BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

== Constantinople/Adrianople ==
[[File:Brothers1868.jpg|right|thumb|160px|ʻAbdu'l-Bahá (right) with his brother [[Mírzá Mihdí]]]]
In 1863 Baháʼu'lláh was summoned to [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]), and thus his whole family including ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, then nineteen, accompanied him on his 110-day journey.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|p=17}} The journey to Constantinople was another wearisome  journey,&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt; and ʻAbdu'l-Bahá helped feed the exiles.{{sfn|Kazemzadeh|2009}} It was here that his position became more prominent amongst the Baháʼís.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=14-20}} This was further solidified by [[Baháʼu'lláh]]'s [[tablet of the Branch]] in which he constantly exalts his son's virtues and station.&lt;ref name=&quot;totb&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Tablet of the Branch | url = http://bahai-library.com/bahaullah_surih_ghusn | publisher = Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust| accessdate=5 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family were soon exiled to [[Adrianople]] and ʻAbdu'l-Bahá went with the family.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=14-20}} ʻAbdu'l-Bahá again suffered from frostbite.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Phelps|1912|pp=27–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Adrianople ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was regarded as the sole comforter of his family – in particular to his [[Ásíyih Khánum|mother]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt; At this point ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was known by the Baháʼís as &quot;the Master&quot;, and by non-Baháʼís as ʻAbbás Effendi (&quot;Effendi&quot; signifies &quot;Sir&quot;). It was in Adrianople that Baháʼu'lláh referred to his son as &quot;the Mystery of God&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt; The title of &quot;Mystery of God&quot; symbolises, according to Baháʼís, that ʻAbdu'l-Bahá is not a [[manifestation of God]] but how a &quot;person of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá the incompatible characteristics of a human nature and superhuman knowledge and perfection have been blended and are completely harmonized&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcob&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = The Covenant of Baháʼu'lláh | url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/wob-39.html.utf8?query=completely&amp;action=highlight#gr8 | publisher = US Baháʼí Publishing Trust | accessdate=5 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bwo&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = The World Order of Baháʼu'lláh | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_kuntu_kanzan_makhfiyyan | publisher = Baha'i Studies Bulletin 3:4 (Dec. 1985), 4–35| accessdate=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was at this point noted for having black hair which flowed to his shoulders, large blue eyes, rose-through-alabaster coloured skin and a fine nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gail|Khan|1987|pp=225, 281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baháʼu'lláh gave his son many other titles such as ''G͟husn-i-Aʻzam'' (meaning &quot;Mightiest Branch&quot; or &quot;Mightier Branch&quot;),{{efn|The [[elative (gradation)|elative]] is a stage of gradation in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] that can be used both for a [[superlative]] or a [[comparative]]. ''G͟husn-i-Aʻzam'' could mean &quot;Mightiest Branch&quot; or &quot;Mightier Branch&quot;}} the &quot;Branch of Holiness&quot;, &quot;the Center of the Covenant&quot; and the apple of his eye.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=14-20}} ʻAbdu'l-Bahá (&quot;the Master&quot;) was devastated when hearing the news that he and his family were to be exiled separately from [[Baháʼu'lláh]]. It was, according to Baháʼís, through his intercession that the idea was reverted and the family were allowed to be exiled together.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt;

== ʻAkká ==
[[File:AkkaPrison.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Prison in ʻAkká where Baháʼu'lláh and his family were housed]]
At the age of 24, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was clearly chief-steward to his father and an outstanding member of the Baháʼí community.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|p=17}} Baháʼu'lláh and his family were – in 1868 – exiled to the penal colony of [[Acre, Palestine]] where it was expected that the family would perish.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Foltz|2013|pp=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrival in ʻAkká was distressing for the family and exiles.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=14-20}} They were greeted in a hostile manner by the surrounding population and his sister and father fell dangerously ill.{{sfn|Esslemont|1980}} When told that the women were to sit on the shoulders of the men to reach the shore, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá took a chair and carried the women to the bay of ʻAkká.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt; ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was able to procure some anesthetic and nursed the sick.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt; The Baháʼís were imprisoned under horrendous conditions in a cluster of cells covered in excrement and dirt.{{sfn|Esslemont|1980}} ʻAbdu'l-Bahá himself fell dangerously ill with [[dysentery]],{{sfn|Esslemont|1980}} however a sympathetic soldier permitted a physician to help cure him.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt; The population shunned them, the soldiers treated them the same, and the behaviour of Siyyid Muhammad-i-Isfahani (an [[Azali]]) did not help matters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Kazemzadeh|2009&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|p=22}} Morale was further destroyed with the accidental death of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's youngest brother [[Mírzá Mihdí]] at the age of 22.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt; His death devastated the family – particularly his [[Ásíyih Khánum|mother]] and father – and the grieving ʻAbdu'l-Bahá kept a night-long vigil beside his brother's body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Kazemzadeh|2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt;

=== Later in ʻAkká ===
Over time, he gradually took over responsibility for the relationships between the small [[Baháʼí Faith|Baháʼí]] exile community and the outside world. It was through his interaction with the people of ʻAkká (Acre) that, according to the Baháʼís, they recognized the innocence of the Baháʼís, and thus the conditions of imprisonment were eased.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|pp=33–43}} Four months after the death of Mihdí the family moved from the prison to the [[House of ʻAbbúd]].{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|p=33}} The people of ʻAkká started to respect the Baháʼís and in particular, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was able to arrange for [[House of ʻAbbúd|houses to be rented]] for the family, the family later moved to the [[Mansion of Bahjí]] around 1879 when an epidemic caused the inhabitants to flee.

ʻAbdu'l-Bahá soon became very popular in the penal colony and [[Myron Henry Phelps]] a wealthy New York lawyer described how &quot;a crowd of human beings...Syrians, Arabs, Ethiopians, and many others&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phelps|1912|pp=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; all waited to talk and receive ʻAbdu'l-Bahá.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2000|pp=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He undertook a history of the Bábí religion through publication of [[A Traveller's Narrative]] (Makála-i-Shakhsí Sayyáh) in 1886,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/B/browne/tn/tnfrnt.htm A Traveller's Narrative, (Makála-i-Shakhsí Sayyáh)]&lt;/ref&gt; later translated and published in translation in 1891 through Cambridge University by the agency of [[Edward Granville Browne]] who described ʻAbdu'l-Bahá as: {{quote|Seldom have I seen one whose appearance impressed me more.

===Marriage and family life===
[[File:Abbaseffendi1868.jpg|right|thumb|190px|ʻAbdu'l-Bahá at age 24]]
When ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was a young man, speculation was rife amongst the Baháʼís to whom he would marry.{{sfn|Esslemont|1980}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Hogenson, p.87&quot;&gt;Hogenson, p.87&lt;/ref&gt; Several young girls were seen as marriage prospects but ʻAbdu'l-Bahá seemed disinclined to marriage.{{sfn|Esslemont|1980}} On 8 March 1873, at the urging of his father,&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Kazemzadeh|2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ma'ani|2008|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; the twenty-eight-year-old ʻAbdu'l-Bahá married [[Munírih Khánum|Fátimih Nahrí of Isfahán]] (1847–1938) a twenty-five-year-old from an upper-class family of the city.&lt;ref name=Smith2000-p255&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was Mírzá Muḥammad ʻAlí Nahrí of [[Isfahan]] an eminent Baháʼí with prominent connections.{{efn|The Nahrí family had earned their fortune from a successful trading business.

In the meantime, Fátimih lived in the home of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's uncle [[Mírzá Músá]].

The marriage resulted in nine children. The first born was a son Mihdí Effendi who died aged about 3. He was followed by Ḍíyáʼíyyih K͟hánum, Fuʼádíyyih K͟hánum (d. few years old), Rúhangíz Khánum (d. 1893), Túbá Khánum, Husayn Effendi (d.1887 aged 5), Túbá K͟hánum, Rúhá K͟hánum and Munnavar K͟hánum. The death of his children caused ʻAbdu'l-Bahá immense grief – in particular the death of his son Husayn Effendi came at a difficult time following the death of his mother and uncle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Maʼani|2008|p=323}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving children (all daughters) were; Ḍíyáʼíyyih K͟hánum (mother of [[Shoghi Effendi]]) (d. 1951) Túbá K͟hánum (1880–1959) Rúḥá K͟hánum and Munavvar K͟hánum (d. 1971).{{sfn|Esslemont|1980}} [[Baháʼu'lláh]] wished that the Baháʼís follow the example of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá and gradually move away from polygamy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ltoae&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aittbf&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Maʼani|2008|p=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá to one woman and his choice to remain monogamous,&lt;ref name=&quot;ltoae&quot;/&gt; from advice of his father and his own wish,&lt;ref name=&quot;ltoae&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aittbf&quot;/&gt; legitimised the practice of monogamy&lt;ref name=&quot;aittbf&quot;/&gt; to a people who hitherto had regarded polygamy as a righteous way of life.&lt;ref name=&quot;ltoae&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aittbf&quot;/&gt;

==Early years of his ministry==
After Baháʼu'lláh died on 29 May 1892, the [[Tablets of Baháʼu'lláh#Kitáb-i-ʻAhd (Book of the Covenant)|Will and Testament]] of Baháʼu'lláh named ʻAbdu'l-Bahá as Centre of the Covenant, successor and interpreter of Baháʼu'lláh's writings.{{efn|In the ''Kitáb-i-ʻAhd'' Baháʼu'lláh refers to his eldest son ʻAbdu'l-Bahá as ''G͟husn-i-Aʻzam'' (meaning &quot;Mightiest Branch&quot; or &quot;Mightier Branch&quot;) and his second eldest son [[Mírzá Muhammad ʻAlí]] as ''G͟husn-i-Akbar'' (meaning &quot;Greatest Branch&quot; or &quot;Greater Branch&quot;).}}{{sfn|Taherzadeh|2000|p=256}}{{sfn|Iranica|1989}}

Baháʼu'lláh designates his successor with the following verses:
{{quote|The Will of the divine Testator is this: It is incumbent upon the [[Aghsán]], the [[Afnán]] and [[Baháʼu'lláh's family|My Kindred]] to turn, one and all, their faces towards the Most Mighty Branch. Consider that which We have revealed in Our Most Holy Book: 'When the ocean of My presence hath ebbed and the Book of My Revelation is ended, turn your faces toward Him Whom God hath purposed, Who hath branched from this Ancient Root.' The object of this sacred verse is none other except the Most Mighty Branch [ʻAbdu'l-Bahá]. Thus have We graciously revealed unto you Our potent Will, and I am verily the Gracious, the All-Powerful. Verily God hath ordained the station of the Greater Branch [Muḥammad ʻAlí] to be beneath that of the Most Great Branch [ʻAbdu'l-Bahá]. He is in truth the Ordainer, the All-Wise.

This translation of the ''Kitáb-i-ʻAhd'' is based on a [[solecism]], however, as the terms ''Akbar'' and ''Aʻzam'' do not mean, respectively, 'Greater' and 'Most Great'.  Not only do the two words derive from entirely separate [[Semitic root#Triconsonantal roots|triconsonantal roots]] (''Akbar'' from ''k-b-r'' and ''Aʻzam'' from ''ʻ-z-m''), but the [[Arabic language]] possesses the [[elative (gradation)|elative]], a stage of gradation, with no clear distinction between the [[comparative]] and [[superlative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://bahai-library.com/maceoin_schaefer_crooked_straight |title= ''Making the Crooked Straight'', by Udo Schaefer, Nicola Towfigh, and Ulrich Gollmer: Review |last= MacEoin |first= Denis| authorlink= Denis MacEoin |date= June 2001 |website= Baháʼí Library Online |publisher= |access-date= 22 May 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Will and Testament ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's half-brother, [[Mírzá Muhammad ʻAlí|Muhammad ʻAlí]], was mentioned by name as being subordinate to ʻAbdu'l-Bahá.

Muhammad ʻAlí and Mirza Javad began to openly accuse ʻAbdu'l-Bahá of taking on too much authority, suggesting that he believed himself to be a [[Manifestation of God]], equal in status to Baháʼu'lláh.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1918|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this time that ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, in order to provide proof of the falsity of the accusations leveled against him, in tablets to the West, stated that he was to be known as &quot;ʻAbdu'l-Bahá&quot; an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] phrase meaning the Servant of Bahá to make it clear that he was not a Manifestation of God, and that his station was only servitude.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|p=60}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TAB/tab-473.html.utf8?query=my%7Cname%7Cabdul&amp;action=highlight#gr5| title = Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas | author = Abdul-Baha }}&lt;/ref&gt; ʻAbdu'l-Bahá left a [[Will and Testament of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá|Will and Testament]] that set up the framework of administration.

=== First Western pilgrims ===

By the end of 1898, Western pilgrims started coming to Akka on pilgrimage to visit ʻAbdu'l-Bahá; this group of pilgrims, including [[Phoebe Hearst]], was the first time that Baháʼís raised up in the West had met ʻAbdu'l-Bahá.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|p=69}} The first group arrived in 1898 and throughout late 1898 to early 1899 Western Baháʼís sporadically visited ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. The group was relatively young containing mainly women from high American society in their 20s.&lt;ref&gt;Hogenson, p.x&lt;/ref&gt; The group of Westerners aroused suspicion for the authorities, and consequently ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's confinement was tightened.&lt;ref&gt;Hogenson, p.308&lt;/ref&gt; During the next decade ʻAbdu'l-Bahá would be in constant communication with Baháʼís around the world, helping them to teach the religion; the group included [[May Maxwell|May Ellis Bolles]] in Paris, Englishman [[Thomas Breakwell]], American Herbert Hopper,  French {{Interlanguage link multi|Hippolyte Dreyfus|fr|3=Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney}}, Susan Moody, Lua Getsinger, and American Laura Clifford Barney.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|pp=72–96}} It was Laura Clifford Barney who, by asking questions of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá over many years and many visits to Haifa, compiled what later became the book [[Some Answered Questions]].{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|p=82}}

===Ministry, 1901–1912===
During the final years of the 19th century, while ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was still officially a prisoner and confined to ʻAkka, he organized the transfer of the remains of the [[Báb]] from Iran to Palestine.  He then organized the purchase of land on [[Mount Carmel]] that Baháʼu'lláh had instructed should be used to lay the remains of the Báb, and organized for the construction of the [[Shrine of the Báb]]. This process took another 10 years.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|pp=90–93}} With the increase of pilgrims visiting ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, Muhammad ʻAlí worked with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman authorities]] to re-introduce stricter terms on ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's imprisonment in August 1901.{{sfn|Iranica|1989}}{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|pp=94–95}} By 1902, however, due to the Governor of ʻAkka being supportive of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, the situation was greatly eased; while pilgrims were able to once again visit ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, he was confined to the city.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|pp=94–95}} In February 1903, two followers of Muhammad ʻAlí, including Badiʻu'llah and Siyyid ʻAliy-i-Afnan, broke with Muhammad ʻAli and wrote books and letters giving details of Muhammad ʻAli's plots and noting that what was circulating about ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was fabrication.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|p=102}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Afroukhteh|2003|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1902 to 1904, in addition to the building of the [[Shrine of the Báb]] that ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was directing, he started to put into execution two different projects; the restoration of the [[House of the Báb]] in [[Shiraz, Iran]] and the construction of the first [[Baháʼí House of Worship]] in [[Ashgabat]], Turkmenistan.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|p=107}}  ʻAbdu'l-Bahá asked Aqa Mirza Aqa to coordinate the work so that the house of the Báb would be restored to the state that it was at the time of the Báb's declaration to [[Mulla Husayn]] in 1844;{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|p=107}}  he also entrusted the work on the House of Worship to [[Vakil-u'd-Dawlih]].{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|p=109}}

During this period, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá communicated with a number [[Young Turk]]s, opposed to the reign of [[Abdul Hamid II|Sultan Abdul Hamid II]], including [[Namık Kemal]], [[Ziya Pasha]] and [[Midhat Pasha]], in an attempt to disseminate Baháʼí thought into their political ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Alkan |first= Necati |date= 2011  |title= Late Ottoman Palestine: The Period of Young Turk Rule | chapter= The Young Turks and the Baháʼís in Palestine  |chapter-url=  http://bahai-library.com/alkan_young_turks_palestine | editor1-last= Ben-Bassat | editor1-first= Yuval |editor2-last= Ginio |editor2-first= Eyal |publisher= I.B.Tauris  |page= 262 |isbn= 978-1848856318}}&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized Baháʼís &quot;seek freedom and love liberty, hope for equality, are well-wishers of humanity and ready to sacrifice their lives to unite humanity&quot; but on a more broad approach than the Young Turks.  [[Abdullah Cevdet]], one of the founders of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] who considered the Baháʼí Faith an intermediary step between Islam and the ultimate abandonment of religious belief, would go on trial for defense of Baháʼís in a periodical he founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hanioğlu |first= M.

‛Abdu'l-Bahá also had contact with military leaders as well, including such individuals as [[Bursalı Mehmet Tahir Bey]] and Hasan Bedreddin.  The latter, who was involved in the overthrow of [[Abdülaziz of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan Abdülaziz]], is commonly known as Bedri Paşa or Bedri Pasha and is referred to in Persian Baháʼí sources as Bedri Bey (Badri Beg).  He was a Baháʼí who translated ‛Abdu'l-Baha's works into French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Alkan |first= Necati |date= 2011  |title= Late Ottoman Palestine: The Period of Young Turk Rule | chapter= The Young Turks and the Baháʼís in Palestine  |chapter-url=  http://bahai-library.com/alkan_young_turks_palestine | editor1-last= Ben-Bassat | editor1-first= Yuval |editor2-last= Ginio |editor2-first= Eyal |publisher= I.B.Tauris  |page= 266 |isbn= 978-1848856318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's political activities and alleged accusation against him by Muhammad ʻAli, a Commission of Inquiry interviewed ʻAbdu'l-Bahá in 1905, with the result that he was almost exiled to [[Fezzan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Alkan |first= Necati |date= 2011  |title= Late Ottoman Palestine: The Period of Young Turk Rule | chapter= The Young Turks and the Baháʼís in Palestine  |chapter-url=  http://bahai-library.com/alkan_young_turks_palestine | editor1-last= Ben-Bassat | editor1-first= Yuval |editor2-last= Ginio |editor2-first= Eyal |publisher= I.B.Tauris  |page= 263 |isbn= 978-1848856318}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|pp=111–113}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Momen|1981|pp=320–323}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá wrote the sultan a letter protesting that his followers refrain from involvement in partisan politics and that his ''[[tariqa]]'' had guided many Americans to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Alkan |first= Necati |date= 2011  |title= Late Ottoman Palestine: The Period of Young Turk Rule | chapter= The Young Turks and the Baháʼís in Palestine  |chapter-url=  http://bahai-library.com/alkan_young_turks_palestine | editor1-last= Ben-Bassat | editor1-first= Yuval |editor2-last= Ginio |editor2-first= Eyal |publisher= I.B.Tauris  |page= 264 |isbn= 978-1848856318}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The next few years in ʻAkka were relatively free of pressures and pilgrims were able to come and visit ʻAbdu'l-Bahá.

{{main|ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West}}

The 1908 [[Young Turks]] revolution freed all political prisoners in the Ottoman Empire, and ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was freed from imprisonment. His first action after his freedom was to visit the [[Shrine of Baháʼu'lláh]] in [[Bahji]].{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|p=131}} While ʻAbdu'l-Bahá continued to live in ʻAkka immediately following the revolution, he soon moved [[House of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá|to live]] in [[Haifa]] near the Shrine of the Báb.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|p=131}} In 1910, with the freedom to leave the country, he embarked on a three-year journey to [[Egypt]], Europe, and North America, spreading the Baháʼí message.{{sfn|Iranica|1989}}

From August to December 1911, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá visited cities in Europe, including London, Bristol, and Paris. The purpose of these trips was to support the Baháʼí communities in the west and to further spread his father's teachings.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|pp=159–397}}

In the following year, he undertook a much more extensive journey to the United States and Canada to once again spread his father's teachings. He arrived in New York City on 11 April 1912, after declining an offer of passage on the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']], telling the Baháʼí believers, instead, to &quot;Donate this to charity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacroix&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Lacroix-Hopson | first = Eliane | author2 = ʻAbdu'l-Bahá | title = ʻAbdu'l-Bahá in New York- The City of the Covenant | publisher = NewVistaDesign | year = 1987 | url = http://bahai-library.com/hopson_abdulbaha_new_york | isbn = | ref = harv | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131216001528/http://bahai-library.com/hopson_abdulbaha_new_york | archivedate = 16 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He instead travelled on a slower craft, the [[RMS Cedric|RMS ''Cedric'']], and cited preference of a longer sea journey as the reason.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|p=171}} After hearing of the Titanic's sinking on 16 April he was quoted as saying &quot;I was asked to sail upon the Titanic, but my heart did not prompt me to do so.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacroix&quot;/&gt; While he spent most of his time in New York, he visited Chicago, [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], Washington, D.C., Boston and [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]. In August of the same year he started a more extensive journey to places including [[New Hampshire]], the [[Green Acre]] school in [[Maine]], and [[Montreal]] (his only visit to Canada). He then travelled west to [[Minneapolis]], San Francisco, [[Stanford University|Stanford]], and Los Angeles before starting to return east at the end of October. On 5 December 1912 he set sail back to Europe.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|pp=159-397}}

During his visit to North America he visited many missions, churches, and groups, as well as having scores of meetings in Baháʼís' homes, and offering innumerable personal meetings with hundreds of people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallagher196&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Gallagher|Ashcraft|2006|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his talks he proclaimed Baháʼí principles such as the [[God in the Baháʼí Faith|unity of God]], [[Baháʼí Faith and the unity of religion|unity of the religions]], [[Baháʼí Faith and the unity of humanity|oneness of humanity]], [[Baháʼí Faith and gender equality|equality of women and men]], world peace and economic justice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallagher196&quot;/&gt; He also insisted that all his meetings be open to all races.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallagher196&quot;/&gt;

His visit and talks were the subject of hundreds of newspaper articles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallagher196&quot;/&gt; In Boston newspaper reporters asked ʻAbdu'l-Bahá why he had come to America, and he stated that he had come to participate in conferences on peace and that just giving warning messages is not enough.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|p=232}} ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's visit to Montreal provided notable newspaper coverage; on the night of his arrival the editor of the ''[[Montreal Daily Star]]'' met with him and that newspaper along with [[The Montreal Gazette]], ''Montreal Standard'', [[Le Devoir]] and [[La Presse (Canada)|La Presse]] among others reported on ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanderHoonaard56&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Van den Hoonaard|1996|pp=56–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|p=256}} The headlines in those papers included &quot;Persian Teacher to Preach Peace&quot;, &quot;Racialism Wrong, Says Eastern Sage, Strife and War Caused by Religious and National Prejudices&quot;,  and &quot;Apostle of Peace Meets Socialists, Abdul Baha's Novel Scheme for Distribution of Surplus Wealth.&quot;{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|p=256}}  The ''Montreal Standard'', which was distributed across Canada, took so much interest that it republished the articles a week later; the Gazette published six articles and Montreal's largest French language newspaper published two articles about him.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanderHoonaard56&quot;/&gt; His 1912 visit to Montreal also inspired humourist [[Stephen Leacock]] to parody him in his bestselling 1914 book ''[[Arcadian Adventures with the Idle Rich]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Ralph D.

On 23 February 1914, at the eve of World War I, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá hosted Baron [[Edmond James de Rothschild]], a member of the [[Rothschild family|Rothschild banking family]] who was a leading advocate and financier of the Zionist movement, during one of his early trips to Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= February 23, 1914 |url= https://bahai.works/Star_of_the_West/Volume_9/Issue_10#pg107 |newspaper= Star of the West |page= 107 | volume= 9 | issue= 10 |location= |date= 8 September 1918 |access-date= 4 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years (1914–1921)==
[[File:AAbdul-baha late life.jpg|thumb|275px|ʻAbdu'l-Bahá on Mount Carmel with pilgrims in 1919]]
During [[World War I]] (1914–1918) ʻAbdu'l-Bahá stayed in Palestine and was unable to travel. He carried on a limited correspondence, which included the ''[[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]'', a collection of 14 letters addressed to the [[Baháʼí Faith in North America|Baháʼís of North America]], later described as one of three &quot;charters&quot; of the Baháʼí Faith. The letters assign a leadership role for the North American Baháʼís in spreading the religion around the planet.

Haifa was under real threat of [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] bombardment, enough that ʻAbdu'l-Bahá and other Baháʼís temporarily retreated to the hills east of ʻAkka.{{sfn|Effendi|1944|p=304}}

ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was also under threats from [[Djemal Pasha|Cemal Paşa]], the Ottoman military chief who at one point expressed his desire to crucify him and destroy Baháʼí properties in Palestine.{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=18}} The surprisingly swift [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign#Megiddo offensive|Megiddo offensive]] of the British [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]] swept away the Turkish forces in Palestine before harm was done to the Baháʼís, and the war was over less than two months later.

===Post-war period===
[[File:‘Abdu’l-Bahá portrait.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The elderly ʻAbdu'l-Bahá]]
The conclusion of [[World War I]] led to the openly hostile Ottoman authorities being replaced by the more friendly [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]], allowing for a renewal of correspondence, pilgrims, and development of the [[Baháʼí World Centre]] properties.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001|pp=400–431}} It was during this revival of activity that the Baháʼí Faith saw an expansion and consolidation in places like [[Egypt]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Iran]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[North America]] and [[South Asia]] under the leadership of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá.

The end of the war brought about several political developments that ʻAbdu'l-Bahá commented on. The [[League of Nations]] formed in January 1920, representing the first instance of [[collective security]] through a worldwide organization. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá had written in 1875 for the need to establish a &quot;Union of the nations of the world&quot;, and he praised the attempt through the League of Nations as an important step towards the goal. He also said that it was &quot;incapable of establishing Universal Peace&quot; because it did not represent all nations and had only trivial power over its member states.{{sfn|Esslemont|1980|pp=166-168}}{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=345}} Around the same time, the British Mandate supported the ongoing [[Aliyah|immigration of Jews to Palestine]]. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá mentioned the immigration as a fulfillment of prophecy, and encouraged the [[Zionism|Zionists]] to develop the land and &quot;elevate the country for all its inhabitants... They must not work to separate the Jews from the other Palestinians.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Declares Zionists Must Work with Other Races |url= https://bahai.works/Star_of_the_West/Volume_10/Issue_10#pg196 |newspaper= Star of the West |page= 196 | volume= 10 | issue= 10 |location= |date=8 September 1919 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abdulbaha knighting.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|ʻAbdu'l-Bahá at his knighting ceremony, April 1920]]

The war also left the region in famine. In 1901, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá had purchased about 1704 acres of scrubland near the [[Jordan river]] and by 1907 many Baháʼís from Iran had begun [[sharecropping]] on the land. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá received between 20-33% of their harvest (or cash equivalent), which was shipped to [[Haifa]]. With the war still raging in 1917, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá received a large amount of wheat from the crops, and also bought other available wheat and shipped it all back to Haifa. The wheat arrived just after the British seized control, and the wheat was widely distributed to allay the famine.{{sfn|McGlinn|2011}}{{sfn|Poostchi|2010}} For this service in averting a famine in Northern Palestine he received a [[Order of the British Empire|knighthood]] at a ceremony held in his honor at the home of the British Governor on 27 April 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Luke |first= Harry Charles | authorlink= Harry Luke |date= 23 August 1922 |title= The Handbook of Palestine |url= http://www.bahai-library.com/luke_handbook_palestine |location= London |publisher= Macmillan and Company |page= 59 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/69065/3/Yazdani_Mina_20116_PhD_thesis.pdf Religious Contentions in Modern Iran, 1881-1941], by Mina Yazdani, PhD, Department of Near and Middle Eastern Civilizations, University of Toronto, 2011, pp. 190-191, 199–202.&lt;/ref&gt; He was later visited by [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]], [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal]] (later king of Iraq), [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]] (High Commissioner for Palestine), and [[Ronald Storrs]] (Military Governor of Jerusalem).{{sfn|Effendi|1944|p=306-307}}

===Death and funeral===
[[File:Abdul Baha Abbas Funeral.jpg|thumb|350px|Funeral of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá in [[Haifa]], [[British Mandate-Palestine]]]]
ʻAbdu'l-Bahá died on Monday, 28 November 1921, sometime after 1:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. (27th of [[Rabi' al-awwal]], 1340 [[Hijri year|AH]]).{{sfn|Effendi|1944|p=311}}

Then Colonial Secretary [[Winston Churchill]] telegraphed the High Commissioner for Palestine, &quot;convey to the Baháʼí Community, on behalf of His Majesty's Government, their sympathy and condolescence.&quot; Similar messages came from [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Viscount Allenby]], the [[Council of Ministers]] of Iraq, and others.{{sfn|Effendi|1944|p=312}}

On his funeral, which was held the next day, Esslemont notes:
{{quote|text=... a funeral the like of which Haifa, nay Palestine itself, had surely never seen... so deep was the feeling that brought so many thousands of mourners together, representative of so many religions, races and tongues.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Esslemont|1980|p=77}}, quoting 'The Passing of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá&quot;, by Lady Blomfield and Shoghi Effendi, pp 11, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Among the talks delivered at the funeral, [[Shoghi Effendi]] records [[Stewart Symes]] giving the following tribute:
{{quote|text=Most of us here have, I think, a clear picture of Sir ʻAbdu'l‑Bahá ʻAbbás, of His dignified figure walking thoughtfully in our streets, of His courteous and gracious manner, of His kindness, of His love for little children and flowers, of His generosity and care for the poor and suffering. So gentle was He, and so simple, that in His presence one almost forgot that He was also a great teacher, and that His writings and His conversations have been a solace and an inspiration to hundreds and thousands of people in the East and in the West.{{sfn|Effendi|1944|pp=313-314}} }}

He was buried in the front room of the [[Shrine of the Báb]] on [[Mount Carmel]]. His interment there is meant to be temporary, until his own mausoleum can be built in the vicinity of Riḍván Garden&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/the-universal-house-of-justice/messages/20190420_001/1#744198387 Ridvan 2019&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===

ʻAbdu'l-Bahá left a ''[[Will and Testament of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá|Will and Testament]]'' that was originally written between 1901-1908 and addressed to Shoghi Effendi, who at that time was only 4–11 years old. The will appoints Shoghi Effendi as the first in a line of [[Guardian (Baháʼí Faith)|Guardians]] of the religion, a hereditary executive role that may provide authoritative interpretations of scripture. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá directed all Baháʼís to turn to him and obey him, and assured him of divine protection and guidance. The will also provided a formal reiteration of his teachings, such as the instructions to teach, manifest spiritual qualities, associate with all people, and shun [[Covenant-breaker]]s. Many obligations of the [[Universal House of Justice]] and the [[Hands of the Cause]] were also elaborated.{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=356-357}}{{sfn|Iranica|1989}} Shoghi Effendi later described the document as one of three &quot;charters&quot; of the Baháʼí Faith.

The authenticity and provisions of the will were almost universally accepted by Baháʼís around the world, with the exception of [[Ruth White (Baháʼí author)|Ruth White]] and a few other Americans who tried to protest Shoghi Effendi's leadership.

During his lifetime there was some ambiguity among Baháʼís as to his station relative to Baháʼu'lláh, and later to Shoghi Effendi. Some American newspapers reported him to be a Baháʼí prophet or the [[Second Coming|return of Christ]]. Shoghi Effendi later formalized his legacy as the last of three &quot;Central Figures&quot; of the Baháʼí Faith and the &quot;Perfect exemplar&quot; of the teachings, also claiming that holding him on an equal status to Baháʼu'lláh or Jesus was heretical. Shoghi Effendi also wrote that during the anticipated Baháʼí dispensation of 1000 years there will be no equal to ʻAbdu'l-Bahá.{{sfn|Effendi|1938}}

==Works==
The total estimated number of [[Tablet (religious)|tablets]] that ʻAbdu'l-Bahá wrote are over 27,000, of which only a fraction have been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bahai-library.com/uhj_numbers_sacred_writings | title = Numbers and Classifications of Sacred Writings texts | author = Universal House of Justice |date=September 2002 | accessdate =20 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His works fall into two groups including first his direct writings and second his lectures and speeches as noted by others.{{sfn|Iranica|1989}} The first group includes ''[[The Secret of Divine Civilization]]'' written before 1875, ''A Traveller's Narrative'' written around 1886, the Resāla-ye sīāsīya or ''Sermon on the Art of Governance'' written in 1893, the ''Memorials of the Faithful'', and a large number of [[tablets (religious)|tablets]] written to various people;{{sfn|Iranica|1989}} including various Western intellectuals such as [[August Forel]] which has been translated and published as the [[Tablet to Dr. Forel|Tablet to Auguste-Henri Forel]]. The ''Secret of Divine Civilization'' and the ''Sermon on the Art of Governance'' were widely circulated anonymously.

The second group includes [[Some Answered Questions]], which is an English translation of a series of table talks with Laura Barney, and [[Paris Talks]], ''ʻAbdu'l-Baha in London'' and ''Promulgation of Universal Peace'' which are respectively addresses given by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá in Paris, London and the United States.{{sfn|Iranica|1989}}
