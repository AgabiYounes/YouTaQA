'''Ann Druyan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|r|iː|æ|n}} {{respell|DREE|ann}};&lt;ref&gt;In the revised edition of ''Cosmos: A Personal Voyage'', Ann Druyan introduces herself in a {{YouTube|L1-D2X5_9CQ|prologue to Episode No. 1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; born June 13, 1949) is an Emmy and Peabody Award-winning American writer, producer, and director specializing in the communication of science.  She co-wrote the 1980 [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] [[Documentary film|documentary]] series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|Cosmos]]'', hosted by [[Carl Sagan]], whom she married in 1981. She is the creator, producer, and writer of the 2014 sequel, ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]'' and its upcoming new sequel series, ''[[Cosmos: Possible Worlds]]''. She is credited with directing episodes of both series as well.

She was the Creative Director of NASA's [[Voyager Golden Record|Voyager Interstellar Message Project]], the golden discs affixed to both the ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2]]'' spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2011/apr/HQ_M11-084_Voyager_Update.html#.Vztu1pMrJE4&lt;/ref&gt; Druyan's role on the project was discussed on the July 8, 2018 60 Minutes segment &quot;The Little Spacecraft That Could.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-the-little-spacecraft-that-could/|title=The little spacecraft that could|website=www.cbsnews.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the segment, Druyan explained her insistence Chuck Berry's &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; be included on the Golden Record, saying, &quot;...''Johnny B. Goode'', rock and roll, was the music of motion, of moving, getting to someplace you've never been before, and the odds are against you, but you want to go. That was Voyager.&quot; The segment also discussed Sagan's suggestion, in 1990, that Voyager 1 turns its cameras back towards Earth to take a series of photographs showing the planets of our solar system. The shots, showing Earth from a distance of 3.7 billion miles as a small point of bluish light, became the basis for Sagan's famous &quot;[[Pale Blue Dot]]&quot; passage, first published in ''[[Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space]]''. (1994)

Druyan and Sagan's working and resulting romantic relationship has been the subject of numerous treatments in popular culture, including the [[Radiolab]] episode &quot;Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan's Ultimate Mix Tape&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2010/02/12/123534818/carl-sagan-and-ann-druyans-ultimate-mix-tape|title=Carl Sagan And Ann Druyan's Ultimate Mix Tape|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a segment of the Comedy Central program ''[[Drunk History]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s episode, &quot;Space.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Space|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4998726/|access-date=2019-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, it was announced Warner Brothers was in development on a drama about Sagan and Druyan's relationship, to be produced by producer Lynda Obst and Druyan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/carl-sagan-ann-druyan-cosmos-warner-brothers-movie-drama/|title=Warner Bros.

== Early life ==
Druyan was born in Queens, New York, the daughter of Pearl A. ({{nee|Goldsmith}}) and Harry Druyan, who co-owned a knitwear firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=On the trail of the meaning of life |newspaper=Toronto Star |page=J.8 |date=28 November 1992 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/460161891.html?FMT=ABS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E3D61E31F932A35756C0A9639C8B63 | title=Paid Notice: Deaths DRUYAN, PEARL A.

And there I was having this religious experience, and she made me feel like such a fool. I was completely flummoxed from then on until after college.&quot; Druyan characterized her three years at New York University as &quot;disastrous,&quot; and it was only after she left school without graduating that she discovered the pre-Socratic philosophers and began her educating herself, thus leading to a renewed interest in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1992-11-15-9204130523-story.html|title=LUCKY ANN DRUYAN ENJOYS A LIFE OF CURIOSITY|last=Richman|first=Ruth|website=chicagotribune.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Druyan was one of the three writers of the [[TV series]] ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'', along with [[Carl Sagan]] and [[Steven Soter]]. Druyan is credited, with Carl Sagan, as the co-creator and co-producer of the 1997 feature film ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Contact (1997) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118884/fullcredits|access-date=2019-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
Druyan has for many years been a vocal advocate for nuclear disarmament. She was arrested three times at the Mercury, Nevada nuclear test site during Mikhail Gorbachev's unilateral moratorium on underground nuclear testing, with which President Ronald Reagan refused to cooperate. This included an arrest in June 1986, when Druyan crossed a white painted line indicating the test site's boundary; Sagan, who attended the same protest with Druyan, was not arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1986/06/03/Scores-arrested-at-nuclear-test-site/8569518155200/|title=Scores arrested at nuclear test site|website=UPI|language=en|access-date=2019-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, Druyan worked with Sagan and then-Senator Al Gore, Jr. and a host of religious and scientific leaders to bring the scientific and religious worlds together in a unified effort to preserve the environment, resulting in the ''Declaration of the 'Mission to Washington.'&lt;nowiki /&gt;''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnl.gov/envsci/schwartz/jointappeal.html|title=DECLARATION OF THE 'MISSION TO WASHINGTON'|website=www.bnl.gov|access-date=2019-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Druyan served as a founding director of the Children's Health Fund until the spring of 2004, a project that provides mobile pediatric care to homeless and disadvantaged children in more than half a dozen cities. She currently serves a member of their Advisory Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.childrenshealthfund.org/advisory-council/|title=Childrens Health Fund Advisory Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Druyan has served on the Board of Directors of the [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws]] (NORML) for over 10 years and was president from 2006 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Honors==
In November 2006, Druyan was a speaker at &quot;[[Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival]]&quot;.

In January 2007, she was a juror at the [[2007 Sundance Film Festival]], responsible for selecting the winner of the [[Alfred P. Sloan Prize]] for films about science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Religious and philosophical views==
In an interview with [[Joel Achenbach]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Druyan stated that her early interest in science stemmed from a fascination with [[Karl Marx]]. Achenbach commented that &quot;She had, at the time, rather vaporous standards of evidence,&quot; a reference to her belief in the [[ancient astronauts]] of [[Erich von Däniken]] and the theories of [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] pertaining to the Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Achenbach, Joel |title=Captured by Aliens: the search for life and truth in a very large universe |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location=New York |year=1999 |isbn=0-684-84856-2 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/capturedbyaliens00joel/page/95 95–6] |quote=Her interest in science came primarily from her interest in the philosophy of Karl Marx. ...

She believed in the ancient astronauts of Erich von Daniken. |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/capturedbyaliens00joel/page/95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Druyan freely acknowledged her past views and also said that they {{clarify|text=changed dramatically|date=August 2015}} after marrying [[Carl Sagan]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
