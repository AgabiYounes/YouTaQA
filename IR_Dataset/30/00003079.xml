The '''Australian Broadcasting Corporation''' ('''ABC''') is Australia's national broadcaster, founded in 1929. It is principally funded by the direct grants from the Australian government but is expressly independent of government and partisan politics. The ABC plays a leading role in journalistic independence and is fundamental in the history of broadcasting in Australia.

Modeled on the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] in the United Kingdom, which is owned and controlled by the UK government, the ABC was originally financed by consumer licence fees on broadcast receivers. Licence fees were abolished in 1973 and replaced principally by direct government grants, as well as revenue from commercial activities related to its core broadcasting mission.

The ABC now provides radio, television, online and mobile services throughout metropolitan and regional Australia and overseas through [[ABC Australia (Asia-Pacific Television)|ABC Australia]] and [[Radio Australia]]. The ABC's headquarters is in [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]], an inner-city suburb of [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]].

==Origin==
Founded in 1929 as the [[Australian Broadcasting Company]], the ABC was a Government licensed consortium of private entertainment and content providers, authorised under supervision to broadcast on the airwaves using a two-tiered system. The &quot;A&quot; system derived its funds primarily from the licence fees levied on the purchasers of the radio receivers, with an emphasis on building the radio wave infrastructure into regional and remote areas, whilst the &quot;B&quot; system relied on privateers and their capacity to establish viable enterprises using the new technology. Following the general downward economic trends of the era, as entrepreneurial ventures in National infrastructure struggled with viability, the &quot;Company&quot; was subsequently acquired to become a fully state-owned corporation on 1 July 1932 and renamed as '''Australian Broadcasting Commission''', re-aligning more closely to the British, BBC model.

The ''Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983''&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-act83&quot; /&gt; changed the name of the organisation to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, effective 1 July 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-act83&quot; /&gt; Although funded and owned by the government, the ABC remains [[editorial independence|editorially independent]] as ensured through the ''Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983''.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-act83&quot; /&gt;

The ABC is sometimes informally referred to as &quot;Aunty&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;NewTeethForAunty&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=New Teeth for Aunty: Reinvigorating the National Broadcaster |url=http://www.themonthly.com.au/reinvigorating-national-broadcaster-new-teeth-aunty-robert-manne-749 |date=1 December 2007 | work=Monthly |author=Robert Manne|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-07-16/aunty-celebrates-75th-birthday-in-townsville/2503718|title=Aunty celebrates 75th birthday in Townsville|last=|first=|date=16 July 2007|work=ABC News|access-date=1 August 2018|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2012/06/28/3534787.htm|title=Why I love Aunty at 80|last=|first=|date=28 June 2012|website=ABC|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally in imitation of the [[BBC#Attitudes toward the BBC in popular culture|British Broadcasting Corporation's nickname]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fabc.org.au/fabc/fabc_archive_data/background_briefing/bb104/bb4_9.html |title=Aunty, a personality of steady and solid conservatism |work=Background briefing 4 – Ken Inglis |publisher=Friends of the ABC |accessdate=29 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127091453/http://www.fabc.org.au/fabc/fabc_archive_data/background_briefing/bb104/bb4_9.html |archive-date=27 January 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first public radio station in Australia opened in Sydney on 23 November 1923 under the call sign 2SB with other stations in Melbourne, [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]], [[Perth]] and [[Hobart]] following.&lt;ref name=&quot;abcradio100&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Following a 1927 [[royal commission]] inquiry into radio licensing issues, the government established the National Broadcasting Service which subsequently took over a number of the larger funded stations. It also nationalised the [[Australian Broadcasting Company]] which had been created by entertainment interests to supply programs to various radio stations.&lt;ref name=&quot;langdon95&quot; /&gt; On 1 July 1932, the Australian Broadcasting Commission was established, taking over the operations of the National Broadcasting Service and eventually establishing offices in each of Australia's capital cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;langdon95&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC010712&gt;{{cite web |title=ABC celebrates 80 years of broadcasting|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date= 1 July 2012|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-07-01/abc-celebrates-80-years/4103108
|accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next four years the stations were reformed into a cohesive broadcasting organisation through regular program relays, coordinated by a centralised bureaucracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;bcasthistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web

News broadcasts were initially restricted, due to pressure from [[Keith Murdoch|Sir Keith Murdoch]], who controlled many Australian newspapers. However, journalists such as Frank Dixon and [[John Hinde (broadcaster)|John Hinde]] began to subvert the agreements in the late 1930s. in 1939, Warren Denning was appointed to Canberra as the first ABC political correspondent, after Murdoch had refused to allow his newspapers to cover a speech by [[Joseph Lyons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=How the newspapers tried to kill an independent ABC news before it even began | author=Stan Correy | date=1 June 2017 | publisher=ABC News | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-01/how-the-newspapers-tried-to-kill-abc-news-before-it-even-began/8568482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942 ''The Australian Broadcasting Act'' was passed, giving the ABC the power to decide when, and in what circumstances, political speeches should be broadcast.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-waryears&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The ABC commenced television broadcasting in 1956, and followed the earlier radio practice of naming the station after the first letter of the base state. [[ABN-2]] (New South Wales) Sydney was inaugurated by Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] on 5 November 1956, with the first broadcast presented by [[Michael Charlton]], and [[James Dibble]] reading the first television news bulletin.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Broadcasting Corporation, [http://www.abc.net.au/corp/history/galpost9.htm &quot;About the ABC: History of the ABC: James Dibble&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113143939/http://www.abc.net.au/corp/history/galpost9.htm |date=13 January 2009 }}. Retrieved 3 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[ABV-2]] (Melbourne, Victoria) followed two weeks later, on 18 November 1956. Stations in other capital cities followed: [[ABQ-2]] (Brisbane, Queensland) (1959), [[ABS-2]] (Adelaide, South Australia) (1960), [[ABW-2]] (Perth, Western Australia) (1960), and [[ABT-2]] (Hobart, Tasmania) (1960). [[ABC-9|ABC-3]] Canberra opened in 1961, and [[ABD-6]] (Darwin, Northern Territory) started broadcasting in 1971, both named after the base city.

Although radio programs could be distributed nationally by [[landline]], television relay facilities were not in place until the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-50s&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that news bulletins had to be sent to each capital city by [[teleprinter]], to be prepared and presented separately in each city, with filmed materials copied manually and sent to each state.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-50s&quot; /&gt; Other television programs at the time included the popular ''[[Six O'Clock Rock]]'' hosted by [[Johnny O'Keefe]], ''[[Mr. Squiggle]]'', as well as operas and plays.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-50s&quot; /&gt;

In 1973 [[New South Wales Rugby League]] boss [[Kevin Humphreys (rugby league)|Kevin Humphreys]] negotiated rugby league's first television deal with the ABC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rothfield|first1=Phil|title=NRL now generates more money per minute than AFL|url=http://www.news.com.au/sport/nrl/nrl-now-generates-more-money-per-minute-than-afl/story-fndujljl-1226455280731|accessdate=22 August 2014|work=news.com.au|publisher=News Ltd|date=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1975, colour television was permanently introduced into Australia after experimental colour broadcasts since 1967, and within a decade the ABC had moved into satellite broadcasting, greatly enhancing its ability to distribute content nationally. In the same year, the ABC introduced a 24-hour-a-day AM rock station in Sydney, 2JJ ([[Double Jay (radio network)|Double Jay]]), which was eventually expanded into the national [[Triple J]] FM network.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-60s70s&quot; /&gt; A year later, a national classical music network was established on the [[frequency modulation|FM]] band, broadcasting from Adelaide. It was initially known as ABC-FM (now called [[ABC Classic FM]]) – referring both to its 'fine music' programming and radio frequency.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-60s70s&quot;&gt;{{cite web

ABC budget cuts began in 1976 and continued until 1985. In 1978 the ABC NSW Staff Association organised a strike against budget cuts and political interference. Sydney ABC was off air for four days.&lt;ref&gt;Molomby, Tom, ''Is there a moderate on the roof?

The ''Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983''&lt;ref name = &quot;abc-act83&quot;/&gt; changed the name of the organisation from the &quot;Australian Broadcasting Commission&quot; to the &quot;Australian Broadcasting Corporation&quot;, effective 1 July 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-act83&quot; /&gt; At the same time, the newly formed Corporation underwent significant restructuring.

A new Concert Music Department was formed in 1985 to co-ordinate the corporation's six symphony orchestras, which in turn received a greater level of autonomy to better respond to local needs.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-80s&quot; /&gt; Open-air free concerts and tours, educational activities, and joint ventures with other music groups were undertaken at the time to expand the orchestras' audience reach.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-80s&quot; /&gt;

ABC Radio was restructured significantly again in 1985 – Radio One became the Metropolitan network, while Radio 2 became known as [[Radio National]] (callsigns, however, were not standardised until 1990). New programs such as ''The World Today'', ''Australia All Over'', and ''The Coodabeen Champions'' were introduced, while [[ABC Classic FM|ABC-FM]] established an Australian Music Unit in 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-80s&quot; /&gt; [[Radio Australia]] began to focus on the Asia-Pacific region, with coverage targeted at the south west and central Pacific, south-east Asia, and north Asia. Radio Australia also carried more news coverage, with special broadcasts during the [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|1987 Fijian coup]], [[Tiananmen Square massacre]], and the [[First Gulf War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-80s&quot; /&gt;

The ABC Multimedia Unit was established in July 1995, to manage the new ABC website (launched in August). Funding was allocated later that year specifically for online content, as opposed to reliance on funding for television and radio content. The first online election coverage was put together in 1996, and included news, electorate maps, candidate information and live results.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-90s&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1990s, all major ABC broadcasting outlets moved to 24-hour-a-day operation, while regional radio coverage in Australia was extended with 80 new transmitters.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-90s&quot; /&gt; Live television broadcasts of selected parliamentary sessions started in 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-90s&quot; /&gt; [[ABC NewsRadio]], a continuous news network broadcast on the [[Parliamentary and News Network]] when parliament is not sitting, was launched on 5 October 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-90s&quot; /&gt;

At the same time, the ABC's Multimedia division was renamed &quot;ABC New Media&quot;, becoming an output division of the ABC alongside Television and Radio.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-00s&quot; /&gt; Legislation allowed the ABC to provide 'multichannels' – additional, digital-only, television services managed by the New Media Division. Soon after the introduction of digital television in 2001, [[Fly TV]] and the [[ABC Kids channel]] launched, showing a mix of programming aimed at teenagers and children.

In 2002, the ABC launched [[Australia Network|ABC Asia Pacific]] – the replacement for the defunct Australia Television International operated previously by the Seven Network. Much like its predecessor, and companion radio network [[Radio Australia]], the service provided a mix of programming targeted at audiences throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Funding cuts in 2003 led to the closure of Fly TV and the ABC Kids channel.

The ABC launched a digital radio service, [[ABC DiG]], in November 2002, available though the internet and digital television, but not available through any other terrestrial broadcast until [[DAB+]] became available in 2009.

[[ABC2]], a second attempt at a digital-only television channel, launched on 7 March 2005. Unlike its predecessors the new service was not dependent on government funding, instead running on a budget of A$3&amp;nbsp;million per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;whoseabc&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Inglis |first=Kenneth Stanley |title=Whose ABC?

A high incidence of breast cancer in female staff working at the ABC's offices in Brisbane led to the closure of the site, based in [[Toowong, Queensland|Toowong]], on 21 December 2006.

On 8 February 2008, ABC TV was rebranded as [[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC1]], complementing the existing [[ABC2]] digital-only channel which was launched on 7 March 2005.

In 2006, the definitive history of the ABC by [[Ken Inglis]] was issued by [[Black Inc.]], re-issuing the 1983 edition of ''This is the ABC - 1932-1983''&lt;ref name=&quot;thisistheabc&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Inglis |first=Kenneth Stanley |title=This is the ABC?

===2010s===
[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] launched on 22 July 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/07/13/2952551.htm/ |title=ABC to launch 24h news channel |publisher=ABC |location=Australia |accessdate=16 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715053603/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/07/13/2952551.htm |archive-date=15 July 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and brought with it both new programming content as well as a collaboration of existing news and current affair productions and resources. The ABC launched the 24-hour news channel to both complement its existing 24-hour [[ABC NewsRadio|ABC News Radio]] service and compete with commercial offerings on cable TV. It became the ABC's fifth domestic TV channel and the fourth launched within the past 10 years.

On 20 July 2014, [[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC1]] reverted to its original name of ABC TV.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jul/10/abc-rebrands-its-main-television-channel-using-social-media-hashtag ABC rebrands its main television channel using social media hashtag], ''[[The Guardian]]'',

In June 2018, the Liberal Party's annual federal council voted to privatise the ABC.

It was reported in February 2019 that Australian prime minister, [[Scott Morrison]], has been given a shortlist of potential candidates for the role of ABC Chairman after the company has gone without a chairman or managing director for over four months.

===Funding===
The ABC is funded mainly by the Australian government, in addition to some revenue received from [[ABC Commercial|its retail outlets]]. Government funding to the ABC was $1,036.1 million in 2016-17;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://about.abc.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ABC7171_AR_2017_Vol2_tagged_v5.pdf|title=ABC Annual Report 2017 - Volume 2|page=90|website=Australian Broadcasting Corporation - About the ABC|access-date=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; $1,043.7 million in 2017-18; and is estimated at $1,045.9 million in 2018–19.&lt;ref name=&quot;Current Govt Funding&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.communications.gov.au/file/36496/download?token=Grh26rLo|title=Australian Broadcasting Corporation - Entity resources and planned performance|page=78|website=Department of Communications and the Arts|access-date=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1948, the ABC was funded directly by radio licence fees; amendments were also made to the ''Australian Broadcasting Act'' that meant the ABC would receive its funding directly from the federal government. Licence fees remained until 1973 when they were abolished by the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] Labor government, on the basis that the near-universality of television and radio services meant that public funding was a fairer method of providing revenue for government-owned radio and television broadcasters.

The term &quot;where your 8 cents a day goes&quot;, coined in the late 1980s during funding negotiations,&lt;ref name=&quot;8cents&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Your ABC |url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/stories/s203582.htm |date=24 October 2000 |publisher=Lateline |access-date=3 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113151239/http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/stories/s203582.htm |archive-date=13 January 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; is often used in reference to the services provided by the ABC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech

===Independence and impartiality===
Under the ''Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2008C00174|title=Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983|publisher=Australian Government|work=Federal Register of Legislation|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[ABC Board]] is bound to &quot;maintain the independence and integrity of the Corporation&quot; and to ensure that &quot;the gathering and presentation by the Corporation of news and information is accurate and impartial according to the recognized standards of objective journalism.&quot;

In relation to impartiality and diversity of perspectives, the current ABC editorial policy requires of the broadcaster that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1415/ABCoverview|title=The ABC: an overview|publisher=Parliament of Australia|date=11 August 2014|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The broadcaster is expected to take no editorial stance other than a commitment to fundamental democratic principles.|ABC Editorial Policy}}

=== Criticisms ===
As a publicly funded broadcaster, the ABC is expected not to take editorial stances on political issues, and is required to present a range of views with impartiality. Over the decades, accusations of &quot;bias&quot; at the ABC have arisen at different times, and various inquiries undertaken.

Reviews of the ABC are regularly commissioned and sometimes not released.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Fiona|title=What would be the point of yet another ABC inquiry?|url=http://theconversation.com/what-would-be-the-point-of-yet-another-abc-inquiry-21213|work=The Conversation|accessdate=30 November 2014|date=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gordon&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Michael|title=Canberra refuses to release report on ABC funding|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/canberra-refuses-to-release-report-on-abc-funding-20140305-347l7.html|accessdate=30 November 2014|date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maxine McKew Portrait 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|Former Lateline host [[Maxine McKew]] won a seat in federal parliament in the 2007 and served for one term.]]

The ABC's requirement of impartiality has led to persistent debates. External critics have complained in particular of left-wing political bias at the broadcaster, citing a prominence of Labor Party-connected journalists hosting masthead political programs or a tendency to favour &quot;progressive&quot; over &quot;conservative&quot; political views on issues such as immigration, refugees, the republic, multiculturalism, reconciliation,  feminism, environmentalism, anti-Americanism, gay marriage, budgeting and the like.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1415/ABCoverview#_Toc395086092|title=The ABC: an overview- Pt 5 The ABC and Bias|last=|first=|date=11 August 2014|website=Parliament of Australia|language=en-AU|access-date=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s1771608.htm|title=The ABC of How To Complain|newspaper=Media Watch|date=23 October 2006|publisher=ABC|accessdate=8 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NewTeethForAunty/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/kerry-obrien-opens-up-about-his-critics-his-family-and-a-new-life-in-byron-20101130-18el9.html|title=Kerry O'Brien opens up about his critics, his family and a new life in Byron|last=Dick|first=Tim|date=30 November 2010|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201235805/https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/kerry-obrien-opens-up-about-his-critics-his-family-and-a-new-life-in-byron-20101130-18el9.html|archive-date=1 December 2010|url-status=|access-date=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been internal and external research on the question of bias at the ABC. A 2013 [[University of the Sunshine Coast]] study of the voting intentions of journalists found that 73.6 per cent of ABC journalists supported [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] or [[Australian Greens|The Greens]] - with 41% supporting the Greens (whereas only around 10% of people in the general population voted Green).&lt;ref name=Hanusch&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hanusch|first1=Folker|title=Journalists in times of change: evidence from a new survey of Australia's journalistic workforce|url=http://research.usc.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/usc:10859?queryType=vitalDismax&amp;sort=ss_dateNormalized%5C&amp;query=Folker+Hanusch+2013&amp;f0=sm_creator%3A%22Hanusch%2C+F%22|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/columnists/jennifer-oriel/diversity-of-thought-practically-whitewashed-by-pc-ideology/news-story/9d16179ec45fe24f6b05072f64540ec7 Why the ABC is at odds with us]; www.theaustralian.com.au; 24 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 [[Roy Morgan Research|Roy Morgan]] media credibility survey found that journalists regarded [[ABC Radio and Regional Content|ABC Radio]] as the most accurate news source in the country and the ABC as the second &quot;most politically biased media organisation in

At the 2016 federal election, a study commissioned by the ABC and conducted by iSentia compiled share-of-voice data and found that the ABC devoted 42.6% of election coverage to the Coalition government (this compares to the 42.04% vote received by the Coalition in the House of Representatives (HOR)), 35.9% to the Labor opposition (34.73% HOR), 8% to the Greens (10.23% HOR), 3.1% to independents (1.85% HOR), 2.2% to Nick Xenophon's Team (1.85% HOR) and 8.1% to the rest. However, the ABC itself notes the &quot;significant limitations around the value of share of voice data&quot; as &quot;duration says nothing about tone or context&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Australian Broadcasting Corporation 2016 Federal Election Report of the Chairman, Election Coverage Review Committee |url=http://about.abc.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016FederalElectionECRCRPT.pdf |year=2016 |accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====From Hawke to Rudd====
Labor Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] considered the ABC's coverage of the 1991 Gulf War to be biased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/comment/abbotts-bias-crusade-as-simple-as-abc-20140130-31phn.html#ixzz48nAslZrK Abbott's Bias Crusade: as simple as ABC]; The Age; 31 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, conservative Opposition Leader John Howard refused to have Kerry O'Brien of the ABC moderate the television debates with Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating because Howard saw O'Brien as biased against the Coalition.&lt;ref&gt;John Howard; ''Lazarus Rising: A Personal and Political Autobiography''; Harper Collins; 2010; pp. 194 &amp; 223&lt;/ref&gt;

; Opposition to leadership coup against Turnbull

When Turnbull lost the leadership after a conservative challenge in August 2018, the hosts of the ABC's political programs denounced the change. The 7pm News political correspondent [[Andrew Probyn]], who had been censured by [[Australian Communications and Media Authority|ACMA]] earlier in the year for biased reporting against Abbott, said the removal of Turnbull was about &quot;vengeance pure and simple&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/abc-censured-for-calling-tony-abbott-most-destructive-politician-20180501-p4zcp6.html ABC censured for calling Tony Abbott 'most destructive politician']; abc.net.au; 1 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ABC News, 24 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in the year.

She said &quot;one of frustrations that voters have had with your prime ministership is the sense that you have conceded too regularly to the conservatives&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/new-pm-scott-morrison-facing-an-enormous-task/10162832 New PM Scott Morrison facing an enormous task]; abc.net.au; 23 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Vanstone called the challenge &quot;disgraceful&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/it-s-no-wonder-australians-are-so-annoyed-20180823-p4zzaz.html It's no wonder Australians are so annoyed]; www.smh.com.au; 26 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

; Management responses to allegations of bias

In a March 2016 interview with ABC Managing Director Mark Scott, ''Media Watch'' host Paul Barry examined the question of perceptions of left wing bias at the ABC. Scott noted that while perhaps the ABC was more concerned about gay marriage than about electricity prices, he did not accept the criticism of bias because &quot;a lot of that criticism comes from right wing commentators and they wonder where are the strong right wing commentators on the ABC. We don't do that kind of journalism. We don't ask questions about our journalists' voting pattern and where their ideology are. We look at the journalism that they put to air and we have strong editorial standards...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s4432757.htm Easter Special: An interview with Mark Scott]; Media Watch; Episode 09, 28 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the interview, conservative ABC critic Andrew Bolt wrote &quot;How can the man heading our biggest media organisation be so blind to the ABC's unlawful and dangerous Leftist bias?&quot; while former ''Media Watch'' host Jonathan Holmes wrote for ''The Age'' that this interview indicated that ABC management had failed to recognise a clear problem of left wing bias among some capital city radio presenters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/comment/abc-radio-personalities-need-to-tune-out-their-leftwing-bias-20160404-gnyfse.html#ixzz48n8clYIF ABC radio personalities need to tune out their left-wing bias]; Jonathan Holmes, ''The Age''; 5 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the period, ABC TV and radio hosts advocated strongly in support of same-sex marriage, upon which the wider Australian community and political parties were divided. When the Turnbull Government announced plans for a postal plebiscite on the issue, advocacy for change continued, prompting a call for restraint from the ABC's editorial policy manager Mark Maley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/media/the-abc-does-not-have-a-position-on-the-issue-abc-tells-staff-to-stop-campaigning-for-samesex-marriage/news-story/5b66b904187e8bb7651f6275bc6dbe8b 'The ABC does not have a position on the issue': ABC tells staff to stop campaigning for same-sex marriage]; www.news.com.au; 10 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

An interview by ABC presenter Joe O'Brien with Lyle Shelton was the subject of a complaint by the Australian Christian Lobby. Bringing up [[Ian Thorpe]]'s swimming achievements, O'Brien asked Shelton &quot;what right do you have to participate in that joy, and take national pride in those achievements, if you now deny him the right to feel like an equal and experience the joy of marriage?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.3aw.com.au/podcast/abc-tv-exposed-neil-mitchell-takes-aim-at-disgraceful-piece-of-television/|title=ABC TV 'exposed': Neil Mitchell takes aim at 'disgraceful piece of television'|author=[[Neil Mitchell (radio presenter)|Mitchell, Neil]]|date=28 August 2017|work=[[3AW]]|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rejecting any perceived bias, the ABC said &quot;It was a 'devil's advocate' question and not inconsistent with standards&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/broadcast/christian-lobby-complains-over-abc-thorpe-question/news-story/4968aafc590a50bad7bf078d52023f69|title=Christian lobby complains over ABC question|author=Denholm, Matthew|date=28 August 2017|work=[[The Australian]]|accessdate=29 August 2017|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|ABC Radio and Regional Content}}
The ABC operates 54 local radio stations, in addition to four national networks and international service [[Radio Australia]]. In addition, [[ABC DiG|DiG Radio]] launched on digital platforms in 2002, currently offering three separate stations.

[[ABC Local Radio]] is the Corporation's flagship radio station in each broadcast area. There are 54 individual stations, each with a similar format consisting of locally presented light entertainment, news, talk back, music, sport and interviews, in addition to some national programming such as ''AM'', ''PM'', ''[[The World Today (Australian radio program)|The World Today]]'', sporting events and ''Nightlife''.

These are the four national networks:

[[Radio National]] broadcasts more than 60 special interest programmes per week covering a range of topics including music, comedy, book readings, radio dramas, poetry, science, health, the arts, religion, social history and current affairs.

[[ABC News (Australian radio network)|ABC News]] is a rolling news service, previously known as the [[Parliamentary and News Network]] and ABC NewsRadio. The service was established to broadcast federal parliamentary sittings, to relieve the local ABC radio network from this intermittent task, and to provide a news service at other times. The network broadcasts news on a 24/7 format with updates on the quarter-hour. Much of its news content is produced by the ABC itself, however many programmes are relayed from the [[BBC World Service]], [[National Public Radio|NPR]], [[Deutsche Welle]], [[Radio Netherlands]] and [[CNN Radio]].

[[ABC Classic]] was the ABC's first FM radio service. It was originally known simply as &quot;ABC FM&quot;, and for a short time{{quantify|eg &quot;until [year] as&quot;|date=April 2013}} &quot;ABC Fine Music&quot;. Its format borrowed heavily from community stations that eventually founded the Fine Music Network, as well as [[BBC Radio 3]].

[[Triple J]] is the national youth radio network, and broadcasts contemporary alternative and independent music; it is targeted at people aged 18–35. While the network plays music from around the world, it has a strong focus on local artists. Triple J was formerly known as &quot;Double Jay&quot; when it launched in Sydney on 19 January 1975.

ABC Radio broadcasts regular news bulletins across most of its radio stations.  Many of these bulletins are heralded by the &quot;[[Majestic Fanfare]]&quot;, written by British composer [[Charles Williams (composer)|Charles Williams]] in 1935.

In addition to these, there is also [[Radio Australia]], the international radio station of the ABC.

These are the digital only stations:

[[ABC Grandstand]] is a live radio sports focused commentary and talk-back program which runs on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation local radio network across Australia and on one digital-only station. The program runs on Saturdays and Sundays, typically from noon or an hour before, until 6 pm.

[[Double J (radio station)|Double J]] is aimed at over-30s alternative music listeners. It is owned and operated by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

[[ABC Jazz]] was launched as a digital only station designed to broadcast a variety of different jazz styles including bebop, acid jazz, cool jazz and contemporary styles of Jazz.

[[Triple J Unearthed]] is where artists upload their music and they play and judge it on the channel.

ABC Extra is for special events national Digital Radio channel brings you extra coverage of events and ideas that matter.

[[ABC Country]] features country style music.

===Television===
{{Main|ABC Television}}

The ABC operates 5 national television channels.

[[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC]], the Corporation's original television service, receives the bulk of funding for television and shows first-run comedy, drama, documentaries, and [[ABC News and Current Affairs|news and current affairs]]. In each [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]] a local [[ABC News (Australia)|news bulletin]] is shown at 7{{nbsp}}pm nightly.

[[ABC Comedy]] (originally ABC2), launched in 2005, shows comedic content in addition to some repeats from ABC TV of which the amount has decreased gradually since ABC Comedy's inception. It is not a 24-hour channel, but is broadcast daily from 5{{nbsp}}pm to around 2{{nbsp}}am the following night. The channel shares airspace with the [[ABC Kids (Australia)|ABC Kids]] programming block from 5{{nbsp}}am to 7{{nbsp}}pm.

[[ABC Me]] (originally ABC3) became a fully fledged channel on 4 December 2009, but has been part of the electronic guide line-up since 2008, broadcasting an ABC1 simulcast until 4 December 2009, then an ABC Radio simulcast and teaser graphic until its official launch. It is broadcast from 6{{nbsp}}am to 9{{nbsp}}pm daily, and consists of a broad range programmes aimed at a young audience aged 6–15, with a core demographic of 8–12.

[[ABC Kids (Australia)|ABC Kids]] (originally ''ABC For Kids on 2'' and ''ABC 4 Kids'') is a new preschool children's block featuring children's programming aimed at the 0 to 5 age groups. ABC Kids broadcasts during [[ABC2]]'s downtime, from 5{{nbsp}}am to 7{{nbsp}}pm daily.

[[ABC News (TV channel)|ABC News]] (originally ABC News 24), a 24-hour news channel, featuring the programming from [[ABC News and Current Affairs]], selected programs from the [[BBC World News]] channel, coverage of the Federal Parliament's Question Time, documentaries and factual, arts programming and state or national election coverage.

Although the ABC's headquarters in Sydney serve as a base for program distribution nationally, ABC Television network is composed of eight state- and territory-based stations, each based in their respective state capital and augmented by repeaters:
{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}
* [[ABN (TV station)|ABN]] ([[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]])
* [[ABV (TV station)|ABV]] ([[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]])
* [[ABQ]] ([[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]])
* [[ABS (TV station)|ABS]] ([[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]])
* [[ABW (TV station)|ABW]] ([[Perth, Western Australia]])
* [[ABT (TV station)|ABT]] ([[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]])
* [[ABC (TV station)|ABC]] ([[Canberra]], [[Australian Capital Territory]])
* [[ABD (TV station)|ABD]] ([[Darwin, Northern Territory]])
{{Div col end}}

The eight ABC stations carry opt outs for local programming. In addition to the nightly 7{{nbsp}}pm news, the stations also broadcast weekly state editions of ''[[7.30]]'' on Friday evenings (until 5 December 2014), state election coverage and in most areas, live sport on Saturday afternoons.

===Studios===

===Online===
{{Main|ABC Innovation}}
An experimental Multimedia Unit was established in 1995, charged with developing policy for the ABC's work in web publishing.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-90s&quot; /&gt; This unit continued until 2000, when the New Media division was formed, bringing together the ABC's online output as a division similar to Television or Radio.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-00s&quot; /&gt; The division had over a million pages of material published by late 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-00s&quot; /&gt;

In 2001 the New Media division became New Media and Digital Services, reflecting the broader remit to develop content for digital platforms such as [[digital television]]. In addition to ABC Online, the division also had responsibility over the ABC's two digital television services, [[Fly TV]] and the [[ABC Kids channel]], until their closure in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In conjunction with the ABC's radio division, New Media and Digital Services implemented the ABC's first [[podcast]]s in December 2004. By mid-2006 the ABC had become an international leader in podcasting with over fifty podcast programmes delivering hundreds of thousands of downloads per week,&lt;ref name=&quot;podcasting&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The ABC logo is one of the most recognisable logos in Australia. In the early years of television, the ABC had been using [[Lissajous curve]]s as fillers between programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The ABC's of LIssajous figures |url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/holo/liss.htm |website=ABC.net |publisher=ABC |accessdate=13 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1963, the ABC conducted a staff competition to create a new logo for use on television, stationery, publications, microphone badges and ABC vehicles.&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-50s60s&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=AusTVHistory: Australian Broadcasting Corporation 1950s–1960s |url=http://www.austvhistory.com/abc/index.htm |publisher=Aus TV History |author=Brooklyn Ross-Hulands |accessdate=4 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007030333/http://www.austvhistory.com/abc/index.htm |archive-date = 7 October 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Memoirs of a Space Engineer – about Doug Rickard | publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date = 19 October 2000 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/science/slab/memoirs/about.htm | accessdate =30 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, ABC graphics designer Bill Kennard submitted a design representing a [[Lissajous curve|Lissajous]] display, as generated when a sine wave signal is applied to the &quot;X&quot; input of an [[oscilloscope]] and another at three times the frequency at the &quot;Y&quot; input. The letters &quot;ABC&quot; were added to the design and it was adopted as the ABC's official logo. Kennard was presented with [[Australian pound|£]]25 for his design.&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-50s60s&quot;/&gt;

On 19 October 1974, the Lissajous curve design experienced its first facelift with the line thickened to allow for colour to be used. It would also be treated to the ‘over and under’ effect, showing the crossover of the line in the design. This logo would be served as the longest-running design with a lifespan of 44 years and 28 on its first on-air run. To celebrate its 70th anniversary on 1 July 2002, the ABC adopted a new logo, which was created by (Annette) Harcus Design in 2001. This logo utilized a silver 3D texture but the crossover design was left intact. This logo would then be used across the ABC's media outlets. However, some brands may continue to use this logo. The 2002 silver logo is no longer in use by the corporation, with the exception of some of the ABC's radio station logos. After the on-air revival of the 1974 logo since 2014, the ABC gradually reinstated the classic symbol while using a new logotype in 2018. The change comes with a press release that the ABC released on 12 February announcing a new brand positioning under its tagline, ''Yours''.
