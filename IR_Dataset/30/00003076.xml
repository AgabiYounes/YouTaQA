'''Antares''' {{IPAc-en|æ|n|ˈ|t|ɛər|iː|z}},&lt;ref&gt;{{MW|Antares}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kunitzsch/&gt; designated '''α Scorpii''' ([[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] to '''Alpha Scorpii''', abbreviated '''Alpha Sco''', '''α Sco'''), is on average [[list of brightest stars|the fifteenth-brightest star]] in the [[night sky]], and the brightest object in the [[constellation]] of [[Scorpius]]. Distinctly reddish when viewed with the naked eye, Antares is a [[slow irregular variable]] star that ranges in brightness from [[apparent magnitude]] +0.6 to +1.6. Often referred to as &quot;the heart of the scorpion&quot;, Antares is flanked by [[Sigma Scorpii|σ Scorpii]] and [[Tau Scorpii|τ Scorpii]] near the center of the constellation.

Classified as a [[red supergiant]] of [[stellar classification#Spectral types|spectral type]] [[Stellar classification#Class M|M1.5Iab-Ib]], Antares is a [[red supergiant]], a large evolved massive star.  Its exact size remains uncertain, but if placed at the center of the [[Solar System]] it would reach to somewhere between the orbits of [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]]. Its mass is calculated to be around 12 times [[Solar mass|that of the Sun]].

Antares is the brightest, most massive, and most evolved stellar member of the nearest [[stellar association|OB association]], the [[Scorpius–Centaurus Association]]. Antares is a member of the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the association, which contains thousands of stars with a mean age of 11 million years, about {{convert|170|pc|ly|lk=on}} from Earth.

Antares appears as a single star when viewed with the naked eye, but it is actually a [[binary star]], with its two components called α Scorpii A and α Scorpii B.  The brighter of the pair is the red supergiant, while the fainter is a hot [[main sequence]] star of magnitude 5.5.

==Nomenclature==
[[File:Infrared Rho Ophiuchi Complex.jpg|thumb|left|Antares between [[sigma Scorpii|σ]] and [[tau Scorpii|τ Scorpii]]. Antares appears white in this [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer|WISE]] false colour [[infrared]] image.]]
''α Scorpii'' (Latinised to ''Alpha Scorpii'') is the star's [[Bayer designation]]. Antares has the [[Flamsteed designation]] 21 Scorpii, as well as catalogue designations such as HR 6134 in the [[Bright Star Catalogue]] and HD 148478 in the [[Henry Draper Catalogue]]. As a prominent [[infrared]] source, it appears in the [[Two Micron All-Sky Survey]] catalogue as 2MASS J16292443-2625549 and the [[IRAS|Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) Sky Survey Atlas]] catalogue as IRAS 16262-2619. It is also catalogued as a double star [[Washington Double Star Catalog|WDS]] J16294-2626 and [[Catalog of Components of Double and Multiple Stars|CCDM]] J16294-2626.  Antares is a variable star and is listed in the [[General Catalogue of Variable Stars]] but as a Bayer-designated star it does not have a separate [[variable star designation]].&lt;ref name=gcvs/&gt;

Its traditional name ''Antares'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|Ἀντάρης}},&lt;ref name=LSJ/&gt; meaning &quot;rival to-[[Ares]]&quot; (&quot;opponent to-Mars&quot;), due to the similarity of its [[red]]dish hue to the appearance of the planet [[Mars]].&lt;ref name=gettings/&gt; The comparison of Antares with Mars may have originated with early [[Babylonian astronomy|Mesopotamian astronomers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;allen&quot;/&gt; Some scholars have speculated that the star may have been named after [[Antarah ibn Shaddad|Antar]], or Antarah ibn Shaddad, the [[Arabs|Arab]] warrior-hero celebrated in the pre-Islamic poems [[Mu'allaqat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;allen&quot; /&gt; In 2016, the [[International Astronomical Union]] organised a [[IAU Working Group on Star Names|Working Group on Star Names]] (WGSN)&lt;ref name=&quot;WGSN&quot;/&gt; to catalog and standardise proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016&lt;ref name=&quot;WGSN1&quot;/&gt; included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN, which included ''Antares'' for the star α Scorpii A. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAU-CSN&quot;/&gt;

== Observation ==
Antares is visible all night around May 31 of each year, when the star is at [[opposition (astronomy and astrology)|opposition]] to the [[Sun]]. Antares then rises at dusk and sets at dawn as seen at the equator. For two to three weeks on either side of November 30 Antares is not visible in the night sky, because it is near [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] with the Sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;LASCO&quot;/&gt; In higher northern latitudes, Antares is only visible low in the south in summertime. Higher than 64º northern latitude, the star does not rise at all. On the other side in the whole of Antarctica, the star is circumpolar as the whole continent is above 64º S latitude. &lt;!--this period of invisibility is longer in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] than in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], since the star's [[celestial latitude]] is south of the ecliptic.--&gt;

=== History ===
[[File:Antares near the Sun every year around 2 December.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Antares near the Sun on 30 November]][[Radial velocity]] variations were observed in the spectrum of Antares in the early 20th century&lt;ref name=wright/&gt; and attempts were made to derive [[spectroscopic binary|spectroscopic]] orbits.&lt;ref name=lunt/&gt;  It became apparent that the small variations could not be due to orbital motion, and were actually caused by pulsation of the star's atmosphere.  Even in 1928, it was calculated that the size of the star must vary by about 20%.&lt;ref name=spencerjones/&gt;

Antares was first reported to have a companion star by [[Johann Tobias Bürg]] during an occultation on April 13, 1819,&lt;ref name=&quot;burnham&quot; /&gt; although this was not widely accepted and dismissed as a possible atmospheric effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson1879&quot; /&gt;  It was then observed by Scottish astronomer [[James William Grant (astronomer)|James William Grant]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] while in [[India]] on 23 July 1844.&lt;ref name=wikisource/&gt; It was rediscovered by [[Ormsby M. Mitchel]] in 1846,&lt;ref name=crossley/&gt; and measured by [[William Rutter Dawes]] in April 1847.&lt;ref name=innes/&gt;&lt;ref name=dawes/&gt;

In 1952, Antares was reported to vary in brightness.  A photographic magnitude range from 3.00 to 3.16 was described.&lt;ref name=cousins/&gt;  The brightness has been monitored by the [[American Association of Variable Star Observers]] since 1945,&lt;ref name=aavso/&gt; and it has been classified as an ''LC'' [[slow irregular variable]] star, whose [[apparent magnitude]] slowly varies between extremes of +0.6 and +1.6, although usually near magnitude +1.0. There is no obvious periodicity, but statistical analyses have suggested periods of 1,733 days or {{val|1,650|640}} days.&lt;ref name=&quot;kiss&quot; /&gt; No separate long secondary period has been detected,&lt;ref name=&quot;percy&quot; /&gt; although it has been suggested that primary periods longer than a thousand days are analogous to long secondary periods.&lt;ref name=&quot;kiss&quot; /&gt;

Research published in 2018 demonstrated that Ngarrindjeri [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] people from South Australia observed the variability of Antares and incorporated it into their oral traditions as Waiyungari (meaning 'red man').&lt;ref name=hamacher/&gt;

=== Occultations and Conjunctions ===
[[File:Antares-R.webm|thumb|right|Lunar Occultation of Antares (reappearance) was observed on 2006 May 14 from The Blue Mountains, Australia. Antares B reappears first, followed by Antares A 7.53 seconds later.]]
Antares is 4.57 degrees south of the [[ecliptic]], one of four [[First magnitude star|first magnitude stars]] within 6° of the ecliptic (the others are [[Spica]], [[Regulus]] and [[Aldebaran]]), so it can be [[Occultation|occulted]] by the [[Moon]]. On 31 July 2009, Antares was occulted by the Moon. The event was visible in much of southern Asia and the Middle East.&lt;ref name=&quot;iota&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;timesofindia&quot; /&gt; Every year around December 2 the Sun passes 5° north of Antares.&lt;ref name=&quot;LASCO&quot; /&gt; Lunar occultations of Antares are fairly common, depending on the 18.6-year cycle of the [[lunar node]]s. The last cycle ended in 2010 and the next begins in 2023. Shown at right is a video of a reappearance event, clearly showing events for both components.

Antares can also be occulted by the planets, e.g. [[Venus]], but these events are rare. The last occultation of Antares by Venus took place on September 17, 525 BC; the next one will be November 17, 2400.&lt;ref name=jbaa/&gt; Other planets have been calculated not to have occulted Antares over the last millennium, nor will they in the next millennium, as most planets stay near the ecliptic and pass north of Antares.&lt;ref name=nightwatch/&gt; Venus will be extremely near Antares on October 19, 2117 and every eight years thereafter through to October 29, 2157 it will pass ''south'' of the star.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.skyandtelescope.com/interactive-sky-chart/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stellar system==
α Scorpii is a double star that are thought to form a [[binary system]]. The best calculated orbit for the stars is considered to be unreliable.&lt;ref name=malkov/&gt;  It describes an almost circular orbit seen nearly edge-on, with a period of 1,218 years and a [[semi-major axis]] of about {{val|2.9|ul=&quot;}}.&lt;ref name=pavlovic/&gt;  Other recent estimates of the period have ranged from 880 years for a calculated orbit,&lt;ref name=baize/&gt; to 2,562 years for a simple [[Kepler's Law]] estimate.&lt;ref name=&quot;reimers&quot;/&gt;

Early measurements of the pair found them to be about {{val|3.5|u=&quot;}} apart in 1847-49,&lt;ref name=dawes/&gt; or {{val|2.5|u=&quot;}} apart in 1848.&lt;ref name=crossley/&gt;  More modern observations consistently give separations around {{val|2.6|u=&quot;}} - {{val|2.8|u=&quot;}}.&lt;ref name=wds/&gt;&lt;ref name=gault/&gt;&lt;ref name=jdso/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcalister/&gt;  The variations in the separation are often interpreted as evidence of orbital motion,&lt;ref name=crossley/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aaa474_1_229&quot;/&gt; but are more likely to be simply observational inaccuracies with very little true relative motion between the two components.&lt;ref name=pavlovic/&gt; 

The pair have a [[projected separation]] of about 529 [[astronomical unit]]s (AU) (≈ 80 billion km) at the estimated distance of Antares, giving a minimum value for the distance between them. Spectroscopic examination of the energy states in the outflow of matter from the companion star suggests that it is over {{val|220|ul=AU}} beyond the primary (more than 110 billion km).&lt;ref name=&quot;aaa474_1_229&quot;/&gt;

===Antares===
[[File:VLTI reconstructed view of the surface of Antares.jpg|thumb|left|[[VLTI]] reconstructed view of the surface of Antares A|alt=]]
Antares is a red [[supergiant star]] with a [[stellar classification]] of M1.5Iab-Ib, and is indicated to be a spectral standard for that class.&lt;ref name=&quot;perkins&quot; /&gt; Due to the nature of the star, the derived [[parallax]] measurements have large errors, so that the true distance of Antares is approximately {{Convert|550|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on}} from the Sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaa474_2_653&quot; /&gt;

The [[Absolute magnitude|brightness]] of Antares at visual wavelengths is about 10,000 times that of the [[Sun]], but because the star radiates a considerable part of its energy in the [[infrared]] part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]], the true [[bolometric luminosity]] is around 100,000 times that of the Sun. There is a large margin of error assigned to values for the bolometric luminosity, typically 30% or more. There is also considerable variation between values published by different authors, for example {{solar luminosity|75,900}} and {{solar luminosity|97,700}} published in 2012 and 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pecaut&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ohnaka2013&quot; /&gt;

The mass of the star has been calculated to be about {{solar mass|12}},&lt;ref name=&quot;Pecaut&quot; /&gt; or {{solar mass|11 to 14.3}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;ohnaka2013&quot; /&gt; Comparison of the [[effective temperature]] and luminosity of Antares to theoretical evolutionary tracks for massive stars suggest a progenitor mass of {{solar mass|17}} and an age of 12 million years (MYr),&lt;ref name=&quot;Pecaut&quot; /&gt; or an initial mass of {{solar mass|15}} and an age of 11 to 15 MYr.&lt;ref name=&quot;ohnaka2013&quot; /&gt; Massive stars like Antares are expected to explode as [[supernova]]e.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hockey2010&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Redgiants.svg|thumb|upright=1.0|right|Comparison between the [[red supergiant]] Antares and the Sun, shown as the tiny dot toward the upper right|alt=Portion of a large yellow-orange circle representing Antares, with a black circle for the orbit of [[Mars]], and images of [[Arcturus]] and the sun to scale]]
Like most cool supergiants, Antares's size has much uncertainty due to the tenuous and translucent nature of the extended outer regions of the star. Defining an effective temperature is difficult due to spectral lines being generated at different depths in the atmosphere, and linear measurements produce different results depending on the wavelength observed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ireland2004&quot; /&gt; In addition, Antares appears to pulsate, varying its radius by {{solar radius|165}} or 19%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pecaut&quot; /&gt; It also varies in temperature by 150 K, lagging 70 days behind [[radial velocity]] changes which are likely to be caused by the pulsations.&lt;ref name=&quot;pugh2013&quot; /&gt;

The diameter of Antares can be measured most accurately using [[interferometry]] or observing [[Occultation|lunar occultation]]s events. An apparent diameter from occultations 41.3 ± 0.1 [[Minute and second of arc#Symbols and abbreviations|milliarcseconds]] has been published.&lt;ref name=&quot;richichi&quot; /&gt; Interferometry allows synthesis of a view of the stellar disc, which is then represented as a [[Limb darkening|limb-darkened]] disk surrounded by an extended atmosphere. The diameter of the limb-darkened disk was measured as {{val|37.38|0.06|u=milliarcseconds}} in 2009 and {{val|37.31|0.09|u=milliarcseconds}} in 2010. The linear radius of the star can be calculated from its angular diameter and distance. However, the distance to Antares is not known with the same accuracy as modern measurements of its diameter.

The [[Hipparcos]] satellite's [[parallax|trigonometric parallax]] of {{val|5.89|1.00|u=mas}}&lt;ref name=&quot;HIPPARCOS&quot; /&gt; leads to a radius of about {{solar radius|680}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;ohnaka2013&quot; /&gt; Older radii estimates exceeding {{solar radius|850}} were derived from older measurements of the diameter,&lt;ref name=&quot;pugh2013&quot; /&gt; but those measurements are likely to have been affected by asymmetry of the atmosphere and the narrow range of infrared wavelengths observed; Antares has an extended shell which radiates strongly at those particular wavelengths.&lt;ref name=&quot;ohnaka2013&quot; /&gt; Despite its large size compared to the Sun, Antares is dwarfed by even larger red supergiants, such as [[VY Canis Majoris]], which is almost 30 times larger in terms of volume, or [[VV Cephei]] A and [[Mu Cephei]].

Antares, like the similarly-sized red supergiant [[Betelgeuse]] in the constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], will almost certainly explode as a [[supernova]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Firestone2014&quot; /&gt; possibly in the next ten thousand years. For a few months, the Antares supernova could be as bright as the full moon and be visible in daytime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hockey2010&quot; /&gt;

===Antares B===
Antares B is a magnitude 5.5 [[B-type main-sequence star|blue-white main-sequence star]] of spectral type B2.5V; it also has numerous unusual spectral lines suggesting it has been polluted by matter ejected by Antares.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaa474_1_229&quot; /&gt;  It is assumed to be a relatively normal early-B main sequence star with a mass around {{solar mass|7|link=y}}, a temperature around {{val|18,500|fmt=commas|ul=K}}, and a radius of about {{solar radius|5}}.&lt;ref name=antaresb/&gt;

Antares B is normally difficult to see in small telescopes due to glare from Antares, but can sometimes be seen in apertures over {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;schaaf&quot; /&gt; It is often described as green, but this is probably either a [[contrast effect]],&lt;ref name=&quot;kaler&quot; /&gt; or the result of the mixing of light from the two stars when they are seen together through a telescope and are too close to be completely resolved. Antares B can sometimes be observed with a small telescope for a few seconds during lunar [[occultation]]s while Antares is hidden by the Moon.&lt;ref name=&quot;burnham&quot; /&gt;  Antares B appears a profound blue or bluish-green color, in contrast to the orange-red Antares.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson1879&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;burnham&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=crossley/&gt;

==Etymology and mythology==
[[File:Antares overlooking an Auxiliary Telescope.jpg|thumb|left|Antares seen from the ground]]
In the [[Babylonian star catalogues]] dating from at least 1100 BCE, Antares was called GABA GIR.TAB, &quot;the Breast of the Scorpion&quot;. In [[MUL.APIN]], which dates between 1100 and 700 BC, it is one of the stars of Ea in the southern sky and marks breast of the Scorpion goddess [[Ishara|Ishhara]].&lt;ref name=rogers/&gt; Later names that translate as &quot;the Heart of Scorpion&quot; include ''{{lang|la|Calbalakrab}}'' from the Arabic ''{{transl|ar|Qalb al-Άqrab}}''.&lt;ref name=kunitzsch/&gt; This had been directly translated from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|Καρδία Σκορπίου}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|Kardia Skorpiū}}''. ''{{lang|la|Cor Scorpii}}'' translated above Greek name into [[Latin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;allen&quot; /&gt;

In ancient [[Mesopotamia]], Antares may have been known by the following names: Urbat, Bilu-sha-ziri (&quot;the Lord of the Seed&quot;), Kak-shisa (&quot;the Creator of Prosperity&quot;), Dar Lugal (&quot;The King&quot;), Masu Sar (&quot;the Hero and the King&quot;), and Kakkab Bir (&quot;the Vermilion Star&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;allen&quot; /&gt; In ancient [[Egypt]], Antares represented the scorpion goddess [[Serket]] (and was the symbol of [[Isis]] in the pyramidal ceremonies).&lt;ref name=&quot;allen&quot; /&gt; It was called ''&lt;u&gt;t&lt;/u&gt;ms n &lt;u&gt;h&lt;/u&gt;ntt'' &quot;the red one of the prow&quot;.  
&lt;ref name=lull/&gt;

In [[Persia]] Antares was known as ''Satevis'', one of the four &quot;[[royal stars]]&quot;. In [[India]], it with [[Sigma Scorpii|σ Scorpii]] and [[Tau Scorpii|τ Scorpii]] were [[Jyeshtha (nakshatra)|Jyeshthā]] (the eldest or biggest, probably attributing its huge size), one of the ''[[nakshatra]]'' ([[Hindu]] [[lunar mansion]]s).&lt;ref name=&quot;allen&quot;/&gt; 

The ancient Chinese called Antares 心宿二 (''Xīnxiù'èr'', &quot;second star of mansion Heart&quot;), because it was the second star of the mansion ''[[Heart (Chinese constellation)|Xin]]'' (心). It was the national star of the [[Shang Dynasty]], and it was sometimes referred to as ({{zh|c=火星|p=Huǒxīng|l=fiery star}}) because of its reddish appearance.

The [[Māori people]] of New Zealand call Antares ''Rēhua'', and regard it as the chief of all the stars. Rēhua is father of ''[[Puanga]]/Puaka'' ([[Rigel]]), an important star in the calculation of the Māori calendar. The Wotjobaluk [[Koori]] people of Victoria, Australia, knew Antares as ''Djuit'', son of ''Marpean-kurrk'' ([[Arcturus]]); the stars on each side represented his wives. The Kulin Kooris saw Antares (''Balayang'') as the brother of ''Bunjil'' ([[Altair]]).&lt;ref name=mudrooroo/&gt;
