It is formed by the junction of the [[Vakhsh River|Vakhsh]] and [[Panj River|Panj]] rivers, in the [[Tigrovaya Balka Nature Reserve]] on the border between [[Afghanistan]] and [[Tajikistan]], and flows from there north-westwards into the [[South Aral Sea|southern remnants]] of the [[Aral Sea]]. In [[ancient history]], the river was regarded as the boundary between [[Greater Iran]] and [[Turan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Iranica&quot;&gt;B. Spuler, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/amu-darya-gk Āmū Daryā], in [[Encyclopædia Iranica]], online ed., 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
[[Image:Amu darya delta.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Amu Darya delta from space]]
In [[classical antiquity]], the river was known as the {{lang|la|Ōxus}} in [[Latin language|Latin]] and {{wikt-lang|grc|Ὦξος}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|Ôxos}}) in [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] — a clear derivative of [[Vakhsh River|Vakhsh]], the name of the largest tributary of the river.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} In [[Vedic Sanskrit]], the river is also referred to as {{lang|sa-Latn|Vakṣu}} ({{lang|sa|वक्षु}}). The [[Brahmanda Purana]] refers to the river as {{lang|sa-Latn|Chaksu}}. The [[Avestan]] texts too refer to the River as Yakhsha/Vakhsha (and Yakhsha Arta (&quot;upper Yakhsha&quot;) referring to the [[Jaxartes]]/[[Syr Darya]] twin river to Amu Darya). In [[Middle Persian]] sources of the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid period]] the river is known as {{lang|pal-Latn|Wehrōd}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Iranica&quot; /&gt; (lit. 'good river').

The name ''Amu'' is said to have come from the medieval city of ''Āmul'', (later, Chahar Joy/Charjunow, and now known as [[Türkmenabat]]), in modern [[Turkmenistan]], with ''Darya'' being the Persian word for &quot;river&quot;. Medieval [[Arabic]] and [[Islam]]ic sources call the river ''Jayhoun'' ({{lang-ar|جَـيْـحُـوْن|Jayḥūn}}; also ''Jaihun'', ''Jayhoon'', or ''Dzhaykhun'') which is derived from ''[[Gihon]]'', the biblical name for one of the four rivers of the [[Garden of Eden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ref1&quot;&gt;[[William C. Brice]]. 1981. ''Historical Atlas of Islam (Hardcover)''.

===As the river Gozan===
Western travelers in the 19th century mentioned that one of the names by which the river was known in Afghanistan was ''Gozan'', and that this name was used by Greek, Mongol, Chinese, Persian, Jewish, and Afghan historians. However, this name is no longer used.

:&quot;... and were brought into Halah (modern day [[Balkh]]), and Habor (which is Pesh Habor or [[Peshawar]]), and Hara (which is [[Herat]]), and to the river Gozan (which is the Ammoo, also called Jehoon) ...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tamerlane and the Jews&quot;&gt;{{citation |title=Tamerlane and the Jews |author=Michael Shterenshis |page=xxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Amudaryamap.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Map of the Amu Darya watershed]]

The river's total length is {{convert|2400|km|mi}} and its drainage basin totals {{convert|534739|km2|sqmi}} in area, providing a mean discharge of around {{convert|97.4|km3|cumi}}&lt;ref name=&quot;utexas&quot;/&gt; of water per year. The river is navigable for over {{convert|1450|km|mi}}. All of the water comes from the high mountains in the south where annual [[precipitation]] can be over {{convert|1000|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Even before large-scale irrigation began, high summer evaporation meant that not all of this discharge reached the [[Aral Sea]] – though there is some evidence the large Pamir [[glacier]]s provided enough melt water for the Aral to overflow during the 13th and 14th centuries.

Since the end of the 19th century there have been four different claimants as the true source of the Oxus:
* The [[Pamir River]], which emerges from Lake [[Zorkul]] (once also known as Lake Victoria) in the [[Pamir Mountains]] (ancient [[Mount Imeon]]), and flows west to Qila-e Panja, where it joins the [[Wakhan River]] to form the [[Panj River]].
* The Sarhad or [[Little Pamir]] River flowing down the Little Pamir in the High [[Wakhan]]
* Lake Chamaktin, which discharges to the east into the [[Bartang River|Aksu River]], which in turn becomes the [[Murghab River (Tajikistan)|Murghab]] and then [[Bartang River|Bartang]] rivers, and which eventually joins the Panj Oxus branch 350 kilometres downstream at Roshan Vomar in Tajikistan.
* An [[ice cave]] at the end of the [[Wakhjir]] valley, in the [[Wakhan Corridor]], in the [[Pamir Mountains]], near the border with Pakistan.

A glacier turns into the [[Wakhan River]] and joins the Pamir River about {{convert|50|km}} downstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Mock, J. |author2=O'Neil, K. |year=2004 |url=http://www.mockandoneil.com/stg04r3.htm#oxus |title=Expedition Report |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Colegrave's expedition to Wakhan in 2007 found that both claimants 2 and 3 had the same source, the Chelab stream, which bifurcates on the watershed of the Little Pamir, half flowing into Lake Chamaktin and half into the parent stream of the Little Pamir/Sarhad River. Therefore, the Chelab stream may be properly considered the true source or parent stream of the Oxus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Colegrave|first=Bill|title=Halfway House to Heaven|year=2011|publisher=Bene Factum Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-1-903071-28-1|pages=176|url=http://bene-factum.co.uk/product/halfway-house-to-heaven/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Panj River forms the border of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Tajikistan]]. It flows west to [[Ishkashim, Afghanistan|Ishkashim]] where it turns north and then north-west through the [[Pamirs]] passing the [[Tajikistan–Afghanistan bridge at Panji Poyon|Tajikistan–Afghanistan Friendship Bridge]]. It subsequently forms the border of Afghanistan and Uzbekistan for about {{convert|200|km}}, passing [[Termez]] and the [[Afghanistan–Uzbekistan Friendship Bridge]]. It delineates the border of Afghanistan and Turkmenistan for another {{convert|100|km}} before it flows into Turkmenistan at [[Atamurat]]. It flows across Turkmenistan south to north, passing [[Türkmenabat]], and forms the border of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan from Halkabat. It is then split by the [[Tuyamuyun Hydro Complex]] into many waterways that used to form the [[river delta]] joining the Aral Sea, passing [[Urgench]], [[Daşoguz]], and other cities, but it does not reach what is left of the sea any more and is lost in the desert. Use of water from the Amu Darya for [[irrigation]] has been a major contributing factor to the shrinking of the Aral Sea since the late 1950s. Historical records state that in different periods, the river flowed into the [[Aral Sea]] (from the south), into the [[Caspian Sea]] (from the east), or both, similar to the [[Syr Darya]] (Jaxartes, in [[Ancient Greek]]).

The ancient [[Greeks]] called the Amu Darya the ''Oxus''. In ancient times, the river was regarded{{by whom|date=October 2015}} as the boundary between [[Greater Iran]] and [[Turan|Ṫūrān]] ({{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|تُوران}}}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iranica&quot; /&gt; The river's drainage lies in the area between the former empires of [[Genghis Khan]] and [[Alexander the Great]], although they occurred at very different times. When the Mongols came to the area, they used the water of the Amu Darya to flood [[Konye-Urgench]].&lt;ref name=Sykes&gt;{{cite book|last=Sykes |first=Percy| authorlink = Percy Sykes |title=A History of Persia|year=1921|publisher=Macmillan and Company|location=London|page=64|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7307/view/1/64/}}&lt;/ref&gt; One southern route of the [[Silk Road]] ran along part of the Amu Darya northwestward from [[Termez]] before going westwards to the [[Caspian Sea]].

It is believed{{by whom|date=October 2015}} that the Amu Darya's course across the Kara-Kum Desert has gone through several major shifts in the past few thousand years. Much of the time – most recently from the 13th century to the late 16th century – the Amu Darya emptied into both the Aral and the Caspian Seas, reaching the latter via a large [[distributary]] called the [[Uzboy River]]. The Uzboy splits off from the main channel just south of the river's delta. Sometimes the flow through the two branches was more or less equal, but often most of the Amu Darya's flow split to the west and flowed into the Caspian.

People began to settle along the lower Amu Darya and the Uzboy in the 5th century, establishing a thriving chain of agricultural lands, towns, and cities. In about AD 985, the massive Gurganj Dam at the bifurcation of the forks started to divert water to the Aral. [[Genghis Khan]]'s troops destroyed the dam in 1221, and the Amu Darya shifted to distributing its flow more or less equally between the main stem and the Uzboy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Volk |first=Sylvia |url=http://www.iras.ucalgary.ca/~volk/sylvia/OxusRiver.htm |title=The Course of the Oxus River |publisher=University of Calgary |date=2000-11-11 |access-date=2010-02-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223173101/http://www.iras.ucalgary.ca/~volk/sylvia/OxusRiver.htm |archive-date=2009-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in the 18th century, the river again turned north, flowing into the Aral Sea, a path it has taken since. Less and less water flowed down the Uzboy. When Russian explorer Bekovich-Cherkasski surveyed the region in 1720, the Amu Darya did not flow into the Caspian Sea anymore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kozubov |first=Robert |url=http://www.turkmenistaninfo.ru/?page_id=6&amp;type=article&amp;elem_id=page_6/magazine_55/478&amp;lang_id=en |title=Uzboy |work=Turkmenistan Analytic Magazine |date=November 2007 |access-date=2010-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1800's, the ethnographic makeup of the region was described by [[Peter Kropotkin]] as the communities of &quot;the vassal Khanates of Maimene, Khulm, Kunduz, and even the Badakshan and Wahkran.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He found modern-day Lake Zorkul, called it Lake Victoria, and proclaimed he had found the source.&lt;ref&gt;Keay, J. (1983) ''When Men and Mountains Meet'' {{ISBN|0-7126-0196-1}} Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the French explorer and geographer [[Thibaut Viné]] collected a lot of information about this area during five expeditions between 1856 and 1862.

[[File:Thibaut Viné.jpg|thumb|left|French geographer Thibaut Viné]]
The question of finding a route between the Oxus valley and India has been of concern historically. A direct route crosses extremely high mountain passes in the [[Hindu Kush]] and isolated areas like [[Kafiristan]]. Some in Britain feared that the Empire of Russia, which at the time wielded great influence over the Oxus area, would overcome these obstacles and find a suitable route through which to invade [[British India]] – but this never came to pass.&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''Can Russia invade India?'' by Henry Bathurst Hanna, 1895, (Google eBook), or ''The Káfirs of the Hindu-Kush'', Sir George Scott Robertson, Illustrated by Arthur David McCormick, Lawrence &amp; Bullen, Limited, 1896, (Google eBook)&lt;/ref&gt; The area was taken over by Russia during the [[Russian conquest of Turkestan]].

The [[Soviet Union]] became the ruling power in the early 1920s and expelled [[Mohammed Alim Khan]]. It later put down the [[Basmachi movement]] and killed [[Ibrahim Bek]]. A large refugee population of Central Asians, including Turkmen, Tajiks and Uzbeks, fled to northern Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Taliban and Talibanism in Historical Perspective, M Nazif Shahrani, chapter 4 of ''The Taliban And The Crisis of Afghanistan'', 2008 Harvard Univ Press, edited by Robert D Crews and Amin Tarzi&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s the Soviets started using the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya to irrigate extensive [[cotton]] fields in the Central Asian plain. Before this time, water from the rivers was already being used for agriculture, but not on this massive scale. The [[Qaraqum Canal]], Karshi Canal, and Bukhara Canal were among the larger of the irrigation diversions built. However, the [[Main Turkmen Canal]], which would have diverted water along the dry Uzboy River bed into central Turkmenistan, was never built. The 1970s, in the course of the [[Soviet–Afghan War]], Soviet forces used the valley to invade Afghanistan through [[Termez]].&lt;ref&gt;Termez – See the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] article&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union fell in the 1990s and Central Asia split up into the many smaller countries that lie within or partially within the Amu Darya basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pavlovskaya |first=L.

During the Soviet era, a resource-sharing system was instated in which [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Tajikistan]] shared water originating from the Amu and [[Syr Darya]]s with [[Kazakhstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]] in summer. In return, [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Tajikistan]] received Kazakh, Turkmen, and Uzbek coal, gas, and electricity in winter. After the fall of the Soviet Union this system disintegrated and the Central Asian nations have failed to reinstate it. Inadequate infrastructure, poor water-management, and outdated irrigation methods all exacerbate the issue.&lt;ref&gt;International Crisis Group. &quot;[http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/europe/central-asia/233-water-pressures-in-central-asia.pdf Water Pressures in Central Asia]&quot;, [http://www.crisisgroup.org CrisisGroup.org]. 11 September 2014.

A feasibility study was initiated to investigate if the area is suitable and if such an initiative would receive support from relevant decision makers. A viable tiger population of about 100 animals would require at least {{convert|5000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of large tracts of contiguous habitat with rich prey populations. Such habitat is not available at this stage and cannot be provided in the short term. The proposed region is therefore unsuitable for the reintroduction, at least at this stage.&lt;ref name=Jungius09&gt;Jungius, H., Chikin, Y., Tsaruk, O., Pereladova, O. (2009).

{{quote|But the majestic River floated on,&lt;br&gt;
Out of the mist and hum of that low land, &lt;br&gt;
Into the frosty starlight, and there moved, &lt;br&gt;
Rejoicing, through the hushed Chorasmian waste,&lt;br&gt;
Under the solitary moon: — he flowed &lt;br&gt;
Right for the polar star, past [[Orgunjè]],&lt;br&gt;
Brimming, and bright, and large: then sands begin &lt;br&gt;
To hem his watery march, and dam his streams, &lt;br&gt;
And split his currents; that for many a league &lt;br&gt;
The shorn and parcelled Oxus strains along &lt;br&gt;
Through beds of sand and matted rushy isles — &lt;br&gt;
Oxus, forgetting the bright speed he had &lt;br&gt;
In his high mountain-cradle in [[Pamir Mountains|Pamere]], &lt;br&gt;
A foiled circuitous wanderer: — till at last &lt;br&gt;
The longed-for dash of waves is heard, and wide &lt;br&gt;
His luminous home of waters opens, bright &lt;br&gt;
And tranquil, from whose floor the new-bathed stars &lt;br&gt;
Emerge, and shine upon the [[Aral Sea]].&lt;br&gt;
~ [[Matthew Arnold]], [[Sohrab and Rustum]]}}

The Oxus river, and Arnold's poem, fire the imaginations of the children who adventure with ponies over the moors of the West Country in the 1930s children's book ''[[The Far-Distant Oxus]]''. There were two sequels, ''Escape to Persia'' and ''Oxus in Summer''.

[[Robert Byron]]'s 1937 travelogue, ''[[The Road to Oxiana]]'', describes its author's journey from the [[Levant]] through [[Persia]] to [[Afghanistan]], with the Oxus as his stated goal.

[[George MacDonald Fraser]]'s ''[[Flashman at the Charge]]'', (1973), places Flashman on the Amu Darya and the Arral Sea during the (fictitious) Russian advance on India during [[The Great Game]] period.
