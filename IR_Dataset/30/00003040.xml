==Biography==
Abu al-Faraj al-Iṣfahānī was born in [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], Persia (present-day [[Iran]]) but spent his youth and made his early studies in [[Baghdad]] (present-day [[Iraq]]). He was a direct descendant of the last of the [[Umayyad]] [[caliph]]s, [[Marwan II]],{{efn|Al-Isfahani traces his descent to Marwan II as follows: Abu al-Faraj Ali ibn al-Husayn ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn al-Haytham ibn Abd al-Rahman ibn Marwan ibn Abd Allah ibn Marwan II ibn Muhammad ibn Marwan I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=De Slane |first=Mac Guckin |authorlink= 
William McGuckin de Slane |title=Ibn Khallikan's Biographical Dictionary, Volume 3 |date=1842 |publisher=Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and Ireland |location=Paris |page=300 |url={{Google Books|XccfAAAAMAAJ|plainurl=y}}}} &lt;/ref&gt;}} and was thus connected with the Umayyad rulers in [[al-Andalus]], and seems to have kept up a correspondence with them and to have sent them some of his works. He became famous for his knowledge of early Arabian antiquities.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abulfaraj|volume=1|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His later life was spent in various parts of the Islamic world, in [[Aleppo]] with its [[Hamdanid]] governor [[Sayf ad-Dawlah]] (to whom he dedicated the ''Book of Songs''), in [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] with the [[Buwayhid]] [[vizier]] Ibn 'Abbad, and elsewhere.

Although he wrote [[poetry]], also an anthology of verses on the [[monastery|monasteries]] of [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Egypt]], and a genealogical work, his fame rests upon his ''Book of Songs'' ([[Kitab al-Aghani]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;/&gt;

==''Book of Songs'' &amp; Other Works==

*''[[Kitab al-Aghani|Kitāb al-Aġānī]]'' ({{lang|ar|كتاب الأغاني}}) 'Book of Songs', a collection of Arabic chants rich in information on Arab and Persian poets, singers and other musicians from the 7th - 10th centuries of major cities such as [[Mecca]], [[Damascus]], [[Isfahan]], [[Rey, Iran|Rey]], [[Baghdad|Baghdād]] and [[Basra|Baṣrah]]. The Book of Songs contains details of the ancient Arab tribes and courtly life of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] and provides a complete overview of the Arab civilization from the pre-Islamic [[Jahiliyya]] era, up to his own time.{{sfn|Al-A'zami|p=192}}&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]]'', {{ISBN|0-550-18022-2}}, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; Abū ‘l-Faraj employs the classical Arabic genealogical devise, or ''[[isnad]]'', (chain of transmission), to relate the biographical accounts of the authors and composers.{{sfn|Al-A'zami|p=192}} Although originally the poems were put to music, the musical signs are no longer legible.  Abū ‘l-Faraj spent in total 50 years creating this work, which remains an important historical source.
The first printed edition, published in 1868, contained 20 volumes. In 1888 [[Rudolf Ernst Brünnow]] published a 21st volume being a collection of biographies not contained in the Bulāq edition, edited from MSS in the Royal Library of [[Munich]].{{sfn|Brünnow|1888}}

*''Maqātil aṭ-Ṭālibīyīn'' ({{lang|ar|مقاتل الطالبيين}}}), Tālibid Fights, a collection of more than 200 biographies of the descendants of [[Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib|Abū Tālib ibn'Abd al-Muttalib]], from the time of the Prophet [[Muhammad|Muḥammad]] to the writing of the book in 313 the [[Hijri]] (= 925/926 CE) who died in an unnatural way. {{sfn|Günther|p=13}}As Abūl-Faraj said in the foreword to his work, he included only those [[Alī|Tālibids]] who rebelled against the government and were killed, slaughtered, executed or poisoned, lived underground, fled or died in captivity. {{sfn|Günther|p=14}}  The work is a major source for the [[Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid|Abbāsid]] [[Alid]] [[Alid revolt of 762–763|uprisings]] and the main source for the [[Hashimites|Hashimite]] meeting that took place after the assassination of the Umayyad Caliph [[Al-Walid II|al-Walīd II]] in the village of [[al-Abwa|al-Abwā]]' between [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]. At this meeting, al-'Abdallah made the Hashimites pledge an oath of allegiance to his son [[Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya]] as the new [[Mahdi]]. {{sfn|Nagel|pp=258–262}}
*''Kitāb al-Imā'āš-šawā'ir'' ({{lang|ar|كتاب الإماء الشواعر}}) 'The Book of the Poet-slaves', a collection of accounts of poetic slaves of the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] period.
