'''Alexey Leonidovich Pajitnov'''{{efn|{{lang-rus|links=no|Алексей Леонидович Пажитнов|p=ɐlʲɪˈksʲej lʲɪɐˈnʲidəvʲɪtɕ ˈpaʐɨtnəf}}&lt;!-- but he prefers the spelling Pajitnov, as explained on the talk page --&gt;}} (born 14 March 1956) is a Russian [[video game designer]] and [[Computer engineering|computer engineer]] who developed ''[[Tetris]]'' while working for the [[Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Soviet Academy of Sciences]], a Soviet government-founded [[Research and development|R&amp;D]] center.

He only started to get royalties from his creation in 1996 when he and [[Henk Rogers]] formed [[The Tetris Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atarihq.com/tsr/special/tetrishist.html |title=Tetris: a history |publisher=Atarihq.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Pajitnov was born on 14 March 1956 in [[Moscow]], in the [[Soviet Union]]. He studied [[applied mathematics]] at the [[Moscow Aviation Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tetris.com/bios#alexey |title=Alexey Pajitnov, Creator of Tetris |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=tetris.com |publisher=tetris holding |access-date=2018-08-05 |quote=&quot;He received his Masters degree in Applied Mathematics from the Moscow Institute of Aviation&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Computers and Computing, Birth of the modern computer, Software history, Tetris of Alexey Pajitnov |url=https://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Software/Tetris.html |website=history-computer.com |accessdate=10 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then went on to work on speech recognition at the [[Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre]] where he would develop the first version of [[Tetris]] on an [[Electronika 60]] computer in 1984.

As a child, he was a fan of puzzles and played with [[pentomino]] toys.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/interview-with-the-tetris-company-creators-alexei-pajitnov-and-henk-rogers/|title=Meet the men who built the only perfect video game: Tetris|website=Digital Trends|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In creating ''Tetris'', he drew inspiration from these toys.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Pajitnov created ''Tetris'' with the help of Dmitry Pavlovsky and [[Vadim Gerasimov]] in 1984. The game, first available in the Soviet Union, appeared in the West in 1986.

Pajitnov also created a sequel to ''Tetris'', entitled ''[[Welltris]]'', which has the same principle but in a [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] environment where the player sees the playing area from above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mds.mdh.se/~frv95pen/game/tetris/welltris/ |title=Screenshots from Welltris, retrieved 31-10-2007 |publisher=Mds.mdh.se |accessdate=2009-11-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422232106/http://www.mds.mdh.se/~frv95pen/game/tetris/welltris/ |archivedate=2006-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tetris'' was licensed and managed by Soviet company [[ELORG]], which had a monopoly on the import and export of computer hardware and software in the Soviet Union, and advertised with the slogan ''&quot;From Russia with Love&quot;'' (on NES: ''&quot;From Russia with Fun!&quot;''). Because he was employed by the Soviet government, Pajitnov did not receive royalties.

Pajitnov, together with [[Vladimir Pokhilko]], moved to the [[United States]] in 1991 and later, in 1996, founded [[The Tetris Company]] with Henk Rogers, which finally allowed him to collect royalties from his game. He helped design the puzzles in the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] versions of ''[[Yoshi's Cookie]]'' and designed the game ''[[Pandora's Box (1999 video game)|Pandora's Box]]'', which incorporates more traditional [[jigsaw puzzle|jigsaw-style puzzles]].

He was employed by [[Microsoft]] from October 1996 until 2005. While there he worked on the ''[[Microsoft Entertainment Pack: The Puzzle Collection]]'', MSN Mind Aerobics and [[MSN Games]] groups. Pajitnov's new, enhanced version of ''[[Hexic]]'', ''Hexic HD'', was included with every new [[Xbox 360]] Premium package.

On 18 August 2005, WildSnake Software announced that Pajitnov would be collaborating with them to release a new line of puzzle games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildsnake.com/newsletter/2005-08-18/ |title=WildSnake newsletter 18 August 2005, retrieved 31-10-2007 |publisher=Wildsnake.com |date=2005-08-18 |accessdate=2009-11-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091112184900/http://www.wildsnake.com/newsletter/2005-08-18/| archivedate= 12 November 2009 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Pajitnov's son, Dmitri, died in a skiing accident on [[Mount Rainier]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dmitripajitnov.com/ |title=Dmitri Pajitnov - In Memoriam, retrieved February 9, 2018 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article168633372.html | title=Skier identified after body was missing for a month on Mount Rainier, retrieved Feb 9, 2018 | publisher=The News Tribune| date=2017-08-22| url-status=live}}
