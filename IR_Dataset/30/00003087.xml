The town is on the [[River Leven, Dunbartonshire|River Leven]], {{convert|3|miles|km|1|spell=in}} north of [[Dumbarton]] and 15&amp;nbsp;miles north-west of [[Glasgow]].

==Demographics==
In 2001, the population of the town was 13,444. It is the largest town in the [[Vale of Leven]], the others being [[Balloch, Dunbartonshire|Balloch]], [[Bonhill]], [[Jamestown, Dunbartonshire|Jamestown]] and [[Renton, Scotland|Renton]]; their combined population is over 20,000.

==Economy==
The town's traditional industries, most importantly [[Cotton mill|cotton manufacturing]], bleaching and printing, have been phased out. In the 1970s Alexandria was redeveloped, with a new town centre layout and traffic system. Local landmarks include Christie Park and the [[Listed buildings in Scotland|Category B]] listed Smollett Fountain in the town centre. Lomond Galleries on North Main Street is a former car factory with an impressive dome and an even more impressive marble entrance hall and staircase. It was originally built in 1906 as the [[Argyll Motor Works]], for [[Argyll (car)|Argyll Motors Ltd]]. A carving above the entrance shows one of the company's cars. After the car production ceased in 1914, it was used by the [[Admiralty]] for the manufacture of [[torpedo]]es, which were test-fired in [[Loch Long]], and in the early 1970s was the scene of the [[Plessey]] sit-in.&lt;ref name=wdc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/tourism-and-visitor-attractions/museums-and-galleries/collections/industry/argyll-motor-works/ |title=Argyll Works |publisher=West Dunbartonshire Council |accessdate=28 August 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130828140953/http://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/tourism-and-visitor-attractions/museums-and-galleries/collections/industry/argyll-motor-works/ |archive-date=2013-08-28 |url-status = dead|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building now hosts a shopping mall but has retained many of its striking architectural features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visit-lochlomond.com/content/lomond-galleries-0|title=Lomond Galleries {{!}} Visit loch lomond|website=www.visit-lochlomond.com|access-date=2019-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major employers in the area were [[Westclox]] and [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]], both based in the Leven Industrial Estate; [[Aggreko]] based a major purpose-built factory in the estate from 2000–2010. The [[Ballantine's]] whisky distillery continues to operate in the estate.

==Transport==
Alexandria sits on the former [[A82 road|A82]] main road between [[Glasgow]] and [[Loch Lomond]]. There are regular bus services on the route, and the town has a [[Alexandria railway station|railway station]] on the rail line between [[Balloch railway station|Balloch]] and [[Glasgow Queen Street railway station|Glasgow Queen Street]].

Alexandria is reputed to be the only town in the UK with a railway station, carnival (periodically Codonnaz travelling fayre sets up in the car park) and a [[public house|pub]] in the middle of a roundabout. [[A. J. Cronin|A. J. Cronin's]] uncle owned a pub in Bridge Street. Alexandria Library is located on Gilmour Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexandria Library|url=http://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/education-and-learning/libraries/library-branches/alexandria-library/|work=West Dunbartonshire Council|accessdate=11 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121218181856/http://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/education-and-learning/libraries/library-branches/alexandria-library/|archive-date=18 December 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
The town is home to [[Vale of Leven F.C.|Vale of Leven]] football club, who play at [[Millburn Park]]. The club was a dominant force in early Scottish football history, winning the [[Scottish Cup]] in [[1876–77 Scottish Cup|1877]], [[1877–78 Scottish Cup|1878]] and [[1878–79 Scottish Cup|1879]], and were founder members of the [[Scottish Football League]].
