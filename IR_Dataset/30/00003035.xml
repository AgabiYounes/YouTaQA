The settlement established [[Alaska Native]] claims to the land by transferring titles to twelve [[Alaska Native Regional Corporations|Alaska Native regional corporations]] and over 200 local village corporations.&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt; A thirteenth regional corporation was later created for Alaska Natives who no longer resided in [[Alaska]].&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt; The act is codified as 43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.&lt;ref name=chapter33&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/43/chapter-33|title=43 U.S. Code Chapter 33 |website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Cliff Groh.jpg|thumb|160px|Cliff Groh was one of a number of non-Native lawyers who assisted various Native organizations and AFN's president Emil Notti in achieving passage of ANCSA.]]
When Alaska became a state in 1959, section 4 of the [[Alaska Statehood Act]] provided that any existing Alaska Native land claims would be unaffected by statehood and held in status quo.&lt;ref name=jones&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Richard S.|title=Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 (Public Law 92-203): History and Analysis Together With Subsequent Amendments Report No. 81-127 GOV|url=http://www.alaskool.org/projects/ancsa/reports/rsjones1981/ANCSA_History71_Ftnts.htm#28|publisher=alaskool.org (June 1, 1981)|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=statehood&gt;{{cite web|title=Alaska Statehood Act Public Law 85-508, 72 Stat. 339, July 7, 1958|url=http://www.lbblawyers.com/ancsa/state6.htm|website=lbblawyers.com|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet while section 4 of the act preserved Native land claims until later settlement, section 6 allowed for the state government to claim lands deemed vacant.&lt;ref name=statehood/&gt; Section 6 granted the state of Alaska the right to select lands then in the hands of the federal government, with the exception of Native territory. As a result, nearly {{convert|104.5|e6acre|km2}} from the public domain would eventually be transferred to the state.&lt;ref name=statehood/&gt;&lt;ref name=jones2&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richard S.|first1=Jones|title=Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 (Public Law 92-203): History and Analysis Together With Subsequent Amendments: Introduction|url=http://www.alaskool.org/projects/ancsa/reports/rsjones1981/ancsa_history71.htm|publisher=alaskool.org|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state government also attempted to acquire lands under section 6 of the Statehood Act that were subject to Native claims under section 4, and that were currently occupied and used by Alaska Natives.&lt;ref name=jones2/&gt; The federal [[Bureau of Land Management]] began to process the Alaska government's selections without taking into account the Native claims and without informing the affected Native groups.&lt;ref name=jones2/&gt;

It was against this backdrop that the original language for a land claims settlement was developed.&lt;ref name=ray&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of Ray Christiansen, State Senator for District K|url=http://www.alaskool.org/projects/ancsa/testimony/ancsa_hearings/r_christiansen.html|website=alaskool.org|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, [[Emil Notti]] called for a statewide meeting inviting numerous leaders around Alaska to gather and create the first meeting of a committee. The historic meeting was held October 18, 1966 - on the 99th anniversary of the transfer of Alaska from Russia. Notti presided over the three-day conference as it discussed matters of land recommendations, claims committee's, and political challenges the act would have getting through congress. Many respected politicians and business men attended the meeting and delegates were astonished at the attention which they received from well-known political figures of the state. The growing presence and political importance of Natives was evidenced when association leaders were elected to the legislature. Members of the associated gathered and were able to gain seven of the sixty seats in the legislature. When the group met a second time early in 1967, it emerged with a new name, The Alaska Federation of Natives, and a new full-time President, [[Emil Notti]]. AFN changed the human rights and economic stability of the Alaska Native population forever.&lt;ref&gt;[[Emil Notti]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}

In 1968, Governor [[Walter Hickel]] summoned a group of Native leaders to work out a settlement that would be satisfactory to Natives.&lt;ref name=ray/&gt; The group met for ten days and asked for $20 million in exchange for requested lands.&lt;ref name=ray/&gt; They also asked for 10% of federal mineral lease revenue.&lt;ref name=frigid&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haycox|first1=Stephen W.|title=Frigid Embrace: Politics, Economics, and Environment in Alaska|date=2002|publisher=Oregon University Press|isbn=0870715364|pages=99–112|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=1UR5VMuhIraPsQSSpoLgAQ&amp;id=ZQUYAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Stephen+Haycox%2C+%27%27Frigid+Embrace%3A+Politics%2C+Economics%2C+and+Environment+in+Alaska%27%27%2C&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=ten+percent|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, President Nixon appointed Hickel as [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]].&lt;ref name=ray/&gt;&lt;ref name=sealaska&gt;{{cite web|title=1 Testimony of Sealaska Corporation Native Regional Corporation for Southeast Alaska’s Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian People May 16, 2013|url=http://docs.house.gov/meetings/ii/ii24/20130516/100839/hhrg-113-ii24-wstate-mallottb-20130516.pdf|publisher=pp.41-66|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alaska Federation of Natives (AFN) protested against Hickel's nomination, but he was eventually confirmed.&lt;ref name=ray/&gt;&lt;ref name=sealaska/&gt;

Hickel worked with the AFN, negotiating with Native leaders and state government over the disputed lands. Offers went back and forth, with each rejecting the other's proposals.&lt;ref name=naske&gt;{{cite book|last1=Naske|first1=Claus-M.|title=Alaska: A History of the 49th State|date=1994|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=080612573X|pages=202–205|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-xhQl1WDWa0C&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=Hickel+worked+with+the+AFN,+negotiating+between+Natives+and+Alaska&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XUF6VLu1O5LasATJnYG4AQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Hickel%20worked%20with%20the%20AFN%2C%20negotiating%20between%20Natives%20and%20Alaska&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AFN wanted rights to land, while then-Governor [[Keith Harvey Miller|Keith Miller]] believed Natives did not have legitimate claims to state land in light of the provisions of the [[Alaska Statehood Act]].&lt;ref name=naske/&gt;

But a succeeding Alaska state administration under Governor [[William A.

Jackson]] from [[Washington (state)|Washington state]].&lt;ref name=haycox2/&gt; The most controversial issues that continued to hold up approval were methods for determining land selection by Alaska Natives and financial distribution.&lt;ref name=haycox2/&gt;

In 1968, the [[ARCO|Atlantic-Richfield Company]] discovered oil at [[Prudhoe Bay Oil Field|Prudhoe Bay]] on the [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] coast, catapulting the issue of [[land ownership]] into headlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Coile |first=Zachery |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/08/29/MNGLGEEKSF1.DTL |title=Arctic Oil: Oil is the lifeblood of Alaska, with residents ready to drill |date=August 9, 2005 |accessdate=2005-09-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051003231635/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2005%2F08%2F29%2FMNGLGEEKSF1.DTL |archivedate=3 October 2005 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=banet&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Banet (Jr.) |first1=Arthur C. |title=Oil and Gas Development on Alaska's North Slope: Past Results and Future Prospects |journal=Open File Reports: Bureau of Land Management |date=March 1991 |pages=6, 22 |url=http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/ak/aktest/ofr.Par.49987.File.dat/OFR_34.pdf |accessdate=30 November 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923231432/http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/ak/aktest/ofr.Par.49987.File.dat/OFR_34.pdf |archivedate=23 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to lessen the difficulty of drilling at such a remote location and transporting the oil to the [[lower 48 states]], the oil companies proposed building a pipeline to carry the oil across Alaska to the port of [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]]&lt;ref name=banet/&gt;&lt;ref name=naske2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Naske|first1=Claus-M.|title=Alaska: A History of the 49th State|date=1994|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=080612573X|pages=241–269|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-xhQl1WDWa0C&amp;dq=Hickel+worked+with+the+AFN,+negotiating+between+Natives+and+Alaska&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Valdez, the oil would be loaded onto tankers and shipped to the contiguous states.&lt;ref name=naske2/&gt; The plan had been approved&lt;!-- by whom?

==Effect of land conveyances==
In 1971, barely one million acres of land in Alaska were in private hands.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; ANCSA, together with section 6 of [[Alaska Statehood Act]], which the new act allowed to come to fruition, affected ownership to about {{convert|148.5|e6acre|km2}} of land in Alaska once wholly controlled by the federal government.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; That is larger by {{convert|6|e6acre|km2}} than the combined areas of [[Maine]], [[Vermont]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Connecticut]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Delaware]], [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|title=Areas As Vast As Whole States Now Change Hands In Alaska |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 8, 1982 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E3DA163BF93BA35753C1A964948260&amp;scp=15&amp;sq=Alaska%20native%20corporations&amp;st=cse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the bill passed in 1971, it included provisions that had never before been attempted in previous United States settlements with Native Americans.&lt;ref name=haycox2/&gt; The newly passed Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act created twelve Native regional economic development corporations.&lt;ref name=haycox2/&gt; Each corporation was associated with a specific region of Alaska and the Natives who had traditionally lived there.&lt;ref name=haycox2/&gt; This innovative approach to native settlements engaged the tribes in corporate capitalism.&lt;ref name=haycox2/&gt;&lt;ref name=linxwiler4a&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Linxwiler|first1=James D.|title=Chapter 12 The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act at 35: Delivering on the Promise|journal=ANCSA at 35|date=2007|pages=3–5|url=http://www.lbblawyers.com/ancsa/ANCSA%20at%2035%20Delivering%20on%20the%20Promise%20Proof%2010-25-07.pdf|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea originated with the AFN, who believed that the Natives would have to become a part of the capitalist system in order to survive.&lt;ref name=haycox2/&gt; As stockholders in these corporations, the Natives could earn some income and stay in their traditional villages.&lt;ref name=kirk&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dombrowski|first1=Kirk|title=Against Culture: Development, Politics, and Religion in Indian Alaska|date=2001|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0803266324|pages=75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Snl8E4H5RUC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=ANCSA+remain+in+villages&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fDat_FvatH&amp;sig=TE6gSdcV9Da5sZ5GHgLjdM58WYI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zM18VNmNHemJsQTLyoKwCw&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=ANCSA%20remain%20in%20villages&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the corporations were managed properly, they could make profits that would enable individuals to stay, rather than having to leave Native villages to find better work.&lt;ref name=haycox2/&gt;&lt;ref name=kirk/&gt; This was intended to help preserve Native culture.&lt;ref name=haycox2/&gt;&lt;ref name=frigid2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haycox|first1=Stephen W.|title=Frigid Embrace: Politics, Economics, and Environment in Alaska|date=2002|publisher=Oregon University Press|isbn=0870715364|pages=132–133|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=1UR5VMuhIraPsQSSpoLgAQ&amp;id=ZQUYAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Stephen+Haycox%2C+%27%27Frigid+Embrace%3A+Politics%2C+Economics%2C+and+Environment+in+Alaska%27%27%2C&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=ten+percent|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Native and state land selection==
Alaska Natives had three years from passage of ANCSA to make land selections of the {{convert|44|e6acre|km2}} granted under the act.&lt;ref name=section1611&gt;{{cite web|title=43 U.S. Code § 1611 - Native land selections|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/43/1611|publisher=Legal Information Institute|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases Native corporations received outside aid in surveying the land.&lt;ref name=haynes/&gt; For instance, [[Doyon, Limited]] (one of the 13 [[Alaska native corporation|regional corporations]]) was helped by the Geophysical Institute of the [[University of Alaska]].&lt;ref name=haynes/&gt; The Institute determined which land contained resources such as minerals and coal.&lt;ref name=haynes/&gt; [[NASA]] similarly provided satellite imagery to aid in Native corporations finding areas most suited for vegetation and their traditional subsistence culture.&lt;ref name=haynes/&gt; The imagery showed locations of caribou and moose, as well as forests with marketable timber.&lt;ref name=haynes/&gt; In total about {{convert|7|e6acre|km2}} were analyzed for Doyon.&lt;ref name=haynes/&gt; Natives were able to choose tens of thousands of acres of land rich with timber while Doyon used mineral analysis to attract businesses.&lt;ref name=haynes&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haynes|first1=James B.|title=Land Selection and Development under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act|journal=Arctic Institute of North America|date=September 1975|volume=28 |issue=3|pages=201–208|url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic28-3-201.pdf|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of Alaska to date has been granted approximately 85% or {{convert|90|e6acre|km2}}  of the land claims it has made under ANCSA.&lt;ref name=dnr&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet Title: Land Ownership In Alaska (March 2000)|url=http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/factsht/land_own.pdf|publisher=Alaska Department of Natural Resources|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state is entitled to a total of {{convert|104.5|e6acre|km2}} under the terms of the Statehood Act.&lt;ref name=section6/&gt; Originally the state had 25 years after passage of the [[Alaska Statehood Act]] to file claims under section 6 of the act with the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM).&lt;ref name=section6&gt;{{cite web|title=Alaska Statehood Act: Selection of public lands, fish and wildlife, public schools, mineral permits, mineral grants, confirmation of grants, internal improvements, submerged lands (Section 6)|url=http://www.lbblawyers.com/ancsa/state6.htm|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amendments to ANCSA extended that deadline until 1994, with the expectation that BLM would complete processing of land transfers subject to overlapping Native claims by 2009.&lt;ref name=note&gt;{{cite web|title=118 Stat. 3594 (Public Law 108–452—DEC. 10, 2004) 43 USC 1635 note|url=http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/info/regulations/alaska_specific_legislation.-WidePar-35782-DownloadFile.tmp/PL108-2-452.pdf|accessdate=30 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616103958/http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/info/regulations/alaska_specific_legislation.-WidePar-35782-DownloadFile.tmp/PL108-2-452.pdf|archive-date=2015-06-16|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, some Native and state selections under ANCSA remained unresolved as late as December 2014.&lt;ref name=ruskin&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruskin|first1=Liz|title=Sealaska Selections in Tongass Added to Defense Bill|url=http://www.alaskapublic.org/2014/12/03/sealaska-selections-in-tongass-added-to-defense-bill/|publisher=Alaska Public Media|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Natives have argued that ANCSA has hastened cultural genocide of Alaska Natives.&lt;ref name=haycoxprologue&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haycox|first1=Steven|title=Alaska: An American Colony|date=2006|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=0295986298|pages=xiii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=natRq6WCu4oC&amp;pg=PR13&amp;lpg=PR13&amp;dq=ANCSA+cultural+genocide&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hZLJ24HM3O&amp;sig=c9QZ5YChmAbWMxIcBKvTE3BEYqQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wdt7VJy8BYjksAT3yYJQ&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=genocide&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=williams&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Maria Sháa Tláa|title=The Alaska Native Reader: History, Culture, Politics|date=2009|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0822390833|pages=180–181|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1qe5vzMqJW0C&amp;pg=PA388&amp;lpg=PA388&amp;dq=The+Alaska+Native+Reader:+History,+Culture,+Politics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sHTYKGX3c1&amp;sig=11Y7EWtv2q5JP2HH-i3IHobe2hA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mNV7VKfuC4e1sQSYzoLICg&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCQ#v=snippet&amp;q=ANCSA&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Natives critiqued ANCSA as an illegitimate treaty since only tribal leaders were involved and the provisions of the act were not voted on by indigenous populations.&lt;ref name=williams/&gt; One native described it as a social and political experiment.&lt;ref name=williams/&gt; Critics have also argued that Natives so feared massacre or incarceration that they offered no resistance to the act.&lt;ref name=williams/&gt;

Others have argued that the settlement was arguably the most generous afforded by the United States to a Native group. They note that some of the largest and most profitable corporations in the state are the twelve created by ANCSA.&lt;ref name=linxwiler4/&gt;&lt;ref name=saga528&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borneman|first1=Walter R.|title=Alaska: Saga of a Bold Land|date=2009|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=0061865273|pages=528–529|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A9QXxo-MeUEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=alaska+saga+of+a+bold+land&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6dd7VMbVGsONsQSiloKoDg&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=ANCSA&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics attacked the act as &quot;Native welfare&quot; and such complaints continue to be expressed.&lt;ref name=saga470/&gt;

==Selected provisions of ANCSA==
* [[Alaska Native|Native]] claims in Alaska were extinguished by means of section 4 of ANCSA.&lt;ref name=linxwiler&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Linxwiler|first1=James D.|title=Chapter 12 The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act at 35: Delivering on the Promise|journal=ANCSA at 35|date=2007|pages=5|url=http://www.lbblawyers.com/ancsa/ANCSA%20at%2035%20Delivering%20on%20the%20Promise%20Proof%2010-25-07.pdf|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In exchange for abrogating Native claims, approximately one-ninth of the state's land plus $962.5 million were distributed to more than 200 local Alaska Native [[Alaska Native Regional Corporations|&quot;village corporations&quot;]] established under section 8, in addition to 12 land-owning for-profit Alaska Native [[Alaska Native Regional Corporations|&quot;regional corporations&quot;]] and a non-land-owning thirteenth corporation for Alaska Natives who had left the state established under section 6.&lt;ref name=linxwiler2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Linxwiler|first1=James D.|title=Chapter 12 The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act at 35: Delivering on the Promise|journal=ANCSA at 35|date=2007|pages=2–6|url=http://www.lbblawyers.com/ancsa/ANCSA%20at%2035%20Delivering%20on%20the%20Promise%20Proof%2010-25-07.pdf|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Of the approximately 80,000 Natives enrolled under ANCSA, those living in villages (approximately two-thirds of the total) would receive 100 shares in both a village and a regional corporation.&lt;ref name=madden&gt;{{cite book|last1=Madden|first1=Ryan|title=Alaska: On-the-road histories|date=2005|publisher=Interlink Books|isbn=1566565669|pages=250|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=trCsJ_AhtgYC&amp;pg=PA250 |accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The remaining one-third would be &quot;at large&quot; shareholders with 100 shares in a [[The 13th Regional Corporation|regional corporation]] with additional rights to revenue from regional mineral and timber resources.&lt;ref name=madden/&gt;
* The [[Alaska Native Allotment Act]] was revoked but with the proviso that pending claims under that act would continue to be processed under section 18.&lt;ref name=linxwiler5&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Linxwiler|first1=James D.|title=Chapter 12 The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act at 35: Delivering on the Promise|journal=ANCSA at 35|date=2007|pages=33–34|url=http://www.lbblawyers.com/ancsa/ANCSA%20at%2035%20Delivering%20on%20the%20Promise%20Proof%2010-25-07.pdf|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful applicants would be excluded under ANCSA by section 14(h)(5) from land to be used for a primary residence.&lt;ref name=linxwiler5/&gt;

* A [[The 13th Regional Corporation|thirteenth corporation]] composed of Natives who had left the state would receive compensation but not land.&lt;ref name=madden/&gt;
* Surface rights to {{convert|44|e6acre|km2}} were patented to the Native village and regional corporations under sections 12(c), as well as 14(h)(1) and (8).&lt;ref name=linxwiler6&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Linxwiler|first1=James D.|title=Chapter 12 The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act at 35: Delivering on the Promise|journal=ANCSA at 35|date=2007|pages=27|url=http://www.lbblawyers.com/ancsa/ANCSA%20at%2035%20Delivering%20on%20the%20Promise%20Proof%2010-25-07.pdf|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The surface rights to the patented land were granted to the village corporations and the subsurface right to the land were granted to the regional corporation, creating a [[split estate]] pursuant to section 14(f).&lt;ref name=linxwiler6/&gt;
