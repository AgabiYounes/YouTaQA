{{Anime and manga}}

{{Nihongo|'''Akira Toriyama'''|鳥山 明|Toriyama Akira|born April 5, 1955}} is a Japanese [[Mangaka|manga artist]] and character designer. He first achieved mainstream recognition for his highly successful [[manga]] series ''[[Dr. Slump]]'', before going on to create ''[[Dragon Ball]]''—his best-known work—and acting as a character designer for several popular video games such as the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series, ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' and ''[[Blue Dragon (video game)|Blue Dragon]]''. Toriyama is regarded as one of the artists that changed the history of manga, as his works are highly influential and popular, particularly ''Dragon Ball,'' which many manga artists cite as a source of inspiration.

He earned the 1981 [[Shogakukan Manga Award]] for best ''[[shōnen manga|shōnen]]'' or ''[[shōjo manga|shōjo]]'' manga with ''Dr. Slump'', and it went on to sell over 35 million copies in Japan. It was adapted into a successful [[anime]] series, with a second anime created in 1997, 13 years after the manga ended. His next series, ''Dragon Ball'', would become one of the most popular and successful manga in the world. Having sold 250–300 million copies worldwide, it is the [[List of best-selling manga|second best-selling manga of all time]] and is considered to be one of the main reasons for the period when manga circulation was at its highest in the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. Overseas, ''Dragon Ball''{{'}}s anime adaptations have been more successful than the manga and are credited with boosting anime's popularity in the Western world. In 2019, Toriyama was decorated a ''Chevalier'' of the French [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] for his contributions to the arts.

==Early life==
Akira Toriyama was born in Nagoya, Aichi, Japan. He has recalled that when he was in elementary school all of his classmates drew, imitating anime and manga, as a result of not having many forms of entertainment.&lt;ref name=&quot;MoviesSpecials&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=DRAGON　BALL　大全集　6: MOVIES &amp; TV SPECIALS |language=Japanese |year=1995 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |pages=212–216 |isbn=4-08-782756-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that he began to advance above everyone else when he started drawing pictures of his friends, and after winning a prize at the local art studio for a picture of ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'', began to think &quot;art was fun&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MoviesSpecials&quot;/&gt;

==Career==

===Early work and success 1978–2000===
Before becoming a manga artist, he worked at an [[advertising agency]] in Nagoya designing posters for three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slump11&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Toriyama|first=Akira|title=Dr. Slump, Volume 11 |year=2009 |publisher=[[Viz Media]]|isbn=978-1-4215-0635-7|pages=48, 110}}&lt;/ref&gt; After quitting his previous job, Toriyama entered the manga industry by submitting a work to an amateur contest in a ''[[Jump (magazine line)|Jump]]'' magazine in order to win the prize money.&lt;ref name=&quot;Special&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=ドラゴンボール 冒険SPECIAL |journal=[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]] |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |date=December 1, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it did not win, [[Kazuhiko Torishima]], who would later become his editor, contacted him and gave him encouragement.&lt;ref name=&quot;SJ interview&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=none |journal=[[Shonen Jump (magazine)|Shonen Jump]] |issue=1 |pages= |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |date=November 26, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; His debut came later in 1978 with the story ''[[Wonder Island]]'', which was published in ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]''. However, he did not rise to popularity until the comedy series ''[[Dr. Slump]]'', which was serialized in ''Weekly Shōnen Jump'' from 1980 to 1984. It follows the adventures of a perverted professor and his small but super-strong robot [[Arale Norimaki|Arale]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ANNJT&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Thompson|first=Jason|authorlink=Jason Thompson (writer)|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/house-of-1000-manga/2011-03-10|title=Jason Thompson's House of 1000 Manga – Dragon Ball|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=March 10, 2011|accessdate=March 24, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916075738/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/house-of-1000-manga/2011-03-10|archive-date=September 16, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began the series at age 25 while living at home with his parents, but when the series ended in 1984 he was a &quot;manga superstar&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANNJT&quot;/&gt; In 1981, ''Dr. Slump'' earned him the [[Shogakukan Manga Award]] for best ''[[shōnen manga|shōnen]]'' or [[shōjo manga|''shōjo'' manga]] series of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShogakukanAward&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.shogakukan.co.jp/mangasho/rist.html |script-title=ja:小学館漫画賞: 歴代受賞者 |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Shogakukan]] |accessdate=August 19, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929094941/http://comics.shogakukan.co.jp/mangasho/rist.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A very successful anime adaptation aired on TV from 1981 to 1986, with a remake series airing from 1997 to 1999.

Toriyama's official fan club {{nihongo|Akira Toriyama Hozonkai|鳥山明保存会||&quot;Akira Toriyama Preservation Society&quot;}} was established in 1982. Its newsletters were called ''Bird Land Press'' and were sent to members until the club closed in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://dragonball.news/news/20190528_wx.html |script-title=ja:[鳥山明ほぼ全仕事] 平日更新24時間限定公開！ 2019/05/28 |work=Dragon Ball Official Site |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |language=Japanese |date=May 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528143658/https://dragonball.news/news/20190528_wx.html |archive-date=May 28, 2019 |url-status=dead |access-date=May 29, 2019 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, ''Weekly Shōnen Jump'' began serializing Toriyama's ''[[Dragon Ball (manga)|Dragon Ball]]'', which became an instant hit. As of 2014, it had sold 159.5{{nbsp}}million ''[[tankōbon]]'' copies in Japan alone,&lt;ref name=&quot;jump2014&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adnavi.shueisha.co.jp/mediaguide/2014/pdf/boys.pdf |title=Shueisha Media Guide 2014: Boy's &amp; Men's Comic Magazines |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |accessdate=2015-04-20 |page=2 |language=Japanese |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721170746/http://adnavi.shueisha.co.jp/mediaguide/2014/pdf/boys.pdf |archivedate=2015-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it [[Shueisha]]'s second best-selling manga of all time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shueishabest&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 10 Shonen Jump Manga by All-Time Volume Sales |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-10-23/top-10-shonen-jump-manga-by-all-time-volume-sales |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=October 23, 2012 |accessdate=November 17, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008192850/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-10-23/top-10-shonen-jump-manga-by-all-time-volume-sales |archive-date=October 8, 2016 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It began as an adventure/gag manga but later turned into a martial arts fighting series, considered by many to be the &quot;most influential ''shōnen'' manga.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ANNJT&quot;/&gt; ''Dragon Ball'' was one of the main reasons for the magazine's circulation hitting a record high of 6.53 million copies (1995).&lt;ref name=&quot;IbarakiInterview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://comipress.com/article/2008/03/31/3452 |title=The Reminiscence of My 25 Years with Shonen Jump |last=Ibaraki |first=Masahiko |author2=Ohara, T.

At the series' end, Toriyama said that he asked everyone involved to let him end the manga, so he could &quot;take some new steps in life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toriyama|first=Akira|title=Dragon Ball, Volume 42 |year=1995 |publisher=[[Shueisha]]|isbn=978-4-08-851090-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that 11-year period, he produced 519 chapters that were collected into 42 volumes. Moreover, the success of the manga led to five anime adaptations, [[List of Dragon Ball films|several animated movies]], [[List of Dragon Ball video games|numerous video games]], and mega-merchandising. The third anime adaptation, ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]'', was not based on his manga; however, Toriyama was still involved in coming up with the name and designing the main cast.&lt;ref name=&quot;GTDragonBox&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Dragon Ball GT Dragon Box: Dragon Book |publisher=[[Pony Canyon]]|year=2005|page=1|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from its popularity in Japan, ''Dragon Ball'' was successful internationally as well, including Asia, Europe, and the Americas, with 250–300{{nbsp}}million copies of the manga sold worldwide.

While Toriyama was serializing ''Dragon Ball'' weekly, Torishima recruited him to work as character designer for the 1986 [[role-playing video game]] ''[[Dragon Quest (video game)|Dragon Quest]]''. The artist admitted he was pulled into it without even knowing what an RPG was and that it made his already busy schedule even more hectic, but he was happy to have been a part after enjoying the finished game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chozenshu&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Dragon Ball 超全集 4: 超事典|trans-title=Chōzenshū 4: Super Encyclopedia|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|year=2013|pages=346–349|isbn=978-4-08-782499-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toriyama has continued to work on every installment in the [[Dragon Quest|''Dragon Quest'' series]]. He has also served as the character designer for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] RPG ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' and for the [[fighting game]]s ''[[Tobal No. 1]]'' and ''[[Tobal 2]]'' for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=74.

Toriyama's own studio is called Bird Studio,&lt;ref name=&quot;studio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Ashcraft|first=Brian|url=http://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-is-made-in-a-very-orange-building-1609446227|title=Dragon Ball Is Made in a Very Orange Building|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=July 23, 2014|accessdate=October 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824151427/http://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-is-made-in-a-very-orange-building-1609446227|archive-date=August 24, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a play on his name; {{nihongo|&quot;tori&quot;|鳥}} meaning &quot;bird&quot;. Toriyama does nearly all of the work at Bird Studio himself, and even when he employed an assistant (until 1995, and only one at a time, which is itself rare for manga artists), the assistant did mostly backgrounds. The studio founded in 1983 has produced occasional one-shots, or stand-alone manga that are not serialized, and some other design work. All of Toriyama's manga after ''Dragon Ball'' tend to be short (100–200-page) stories, including ''[[Cowa!]]'', ''[[Kajika]]'', and ''[[Sand Land]]''.

===2002–2013===
On December 6, 2002, Toriyama made his only promotional appearance in the United States at the launch of ''Weekly Shōnen Jump'''s North American counterpart, ''[[Shonen Jump (magazine)|Shonen Jump]]'', in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Akira Toriyama To Appear at Shonen Jump Launch Party |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-12-02/akira-toriyama-to-appear-at-shonen-jump-launch-party |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=December 2, 2002 |accessdate=March 24, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510150117/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-12-02/akira-toriyama-to-appear-at-shonen-jump-launch-party |archive-date=May 10, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Toriyama's ''Dragon Ball'' and ''Sand Land'' were published in the magazine in the first issue, which also included an in-depth interview with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Shonen Jump No. 1 Contents |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-10-03/shonen-jump-no.1-contents |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=October 3, 2002 |accessdate=March 24, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510232756/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-10-03/shonen-jump-no.1-contents |archive-date=May 10, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 2005, CQ Motors began selling an [[electric car]] designed by Toriyama.&lt;ref name=&quot;car&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Akira Toriyama Car |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-01-31/akira-toriyama-car |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=January 31, 2005 |accessdate=November 17, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925090345/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-01-31/akira-toriyama-car |archive-date=September 25, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The one-person QVOLT is part of the company's [[Choro-Q]] series of small electric cars, with only 9 being produced. It costs 1,990,000 yen (about $19,000 US), has a top speed of {{convert|30|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and is available in 5 colors.&lt;ref name=&quot;car&quot;/&gt; Designed to look like an American [[Street rod (car)|street rod]], the QVOLT has a top and a door that are both opened by pulling a cord. Toriyama stated that the car took over a year to design, &quot;but due to my genius mini-model construction skills, I finally arrived at the end of what was a very emotional journey.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;car&quot;/&gt;

He worked on a 2006 [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] called ''[[Cross Epoch (manga)|Cross Epoch]]'', in cooperation with ''[[One Piece]]'' creator [[Eiichiro Oda]]. The story is a short [[Intercompany crossover|crossover]] that presents characters from both ''Dragon Ball'' and ''One Piece''. Toriyama was the character designer and artist for the 2006 [[Mistwalker]] [[Xbox 360]] exclusive RPG ''[[Blue Dragon (video game)|Blue Dragon]]'', working with [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] and [[Nobuo Uematsu]], both of whom he had previously worked with on ''Chrono Trigger''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Toriyama to work on Xbox 360 game |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-05-17/toriyama-to-work-on-xbox-360-game |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=May 17, 2005 |accessdate=November 17, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110052542/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-05-17/toriyama-to-work-on-xbox-360-game |archive-date=November 10, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He announced that his help with the making of the [[Blue Dragon (anime)|''Blue Dragon'' anime]] might very well be his final work in anime. In his own words, he said:
{{quote|The offer to direct an animated version of ''Blue Dragon'' came in February of last year [2006]. [[Studio Pierrot]] approached me regarding it. I knew that Sakaguchi had been working on assembling staff to produce a game, although at the time ''Blue Dragon'' hadn't yet been formally announced. According to the materials, it was to be a fantasy world like ''[[The Lord of the Rings|Lord of the Rings]]'', with a detailed world view and story. This may be my final anime, I'm a little worried (about it). There's incredible pressure, but at the same time, there's a sense of accomplishment – that it's worth doing. ''Blue Dragon'' will be a masterpiece, not simply because I'm working hard on it, but because the staff is expecting nothing less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/blue-dragon/blue-dragon-toriyamas-final-anime-247955.php|title=Blue Dragon, Toriyama's Final Anime?|author=Brian Ashcraft|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713170411/http://kotaku.com/gaming/blue-dragon/blue-dragon-toriyamas-final-anime-247955.php |archivedate=July 13, 2011|publisher=Kotaku|date=March 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Manga critic [[Jason Thompson (writer)|Jason Thompson]] declared Toriyama's art influential, saying that his &quot;extremely personal and recognizable style&quot; was a reason for ''Dragon Ball'''s popularity.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANNJT&quot;/&gt; He points out that the popular ''shōnen'' manga of the late 1980s and early 1990s had &quot;[[Masculinity|manly]]&quot; heroes, such as ''[[City Hunter]]'' and ''[[Fist of the North Star]]'', whereas ''Dragon Ball'' starred the cartoonish and small Goku, thus starting a trend that Thompson says continues to this day.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANNJT&quot;/&gt; Toriyama himself said he went against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size, designing many of the series' most powerful characters with small statures.&lt;ref name=&quot;SJ interview 2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Interview with the Majin!
