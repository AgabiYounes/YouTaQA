'''Androphagi''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀνδροφάγοι}}, literally &quot;man-eaters&quot;) was an ancient nation of [[cannibalism|cannibals]] north of [[Scythia]] (according to [[Herodotus]]&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus iv. 18, 106&lt;/ref&gt;), probably in the forests between the upper waters of the [[Dneiper River|Dnepr]] and [[Don River, Russia|Don]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Androphagi|volume=1|page=976}}&lt;/ref&gt; These people may have assisted the [[Scythians]] when King [[Darius the Great]] led [[European Scythian campaign of Darius I|a Persian invasion]] into what is now Southern Russia.

==Etymology==

Historian Marija Gimbutas has hypothesized&lt;ref&gt;Marija Gimbutas's &quot;The Balts&quot; and &quot;The Slavs&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; that &quot;Androphagoi&quot; is a Greek translation of *mard-xwaar &quot;man-eater&quot; in the old North Iranian language of the [[Scythians]]. From *mard-xwaar one can derive &quot;Mordva&quot; or &quot;Mordvin&quot;, the Russian name of the Finno-Ugrian [[Erzya people|Erzya]] and [[Moksha (people)|Moksha]] peoples of east-central European Russia. From Herodotus we can deduce a location for the Androphagoi that is approximately the same as that occupied by the modern [[Mordvins]].

==Ancient accounts==

[[Herodotus]] first wrote of ''andropophagi'' in his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'', where he described them as one of several tribes near [[Scythia]].  An extra note indicates that the ''andropophagi'' are cannibals, as reflected in their name:

{{quote|The manners of the Androphagi are more savage than those of any other race. They neither observe justice, nor are governed, by any laws. They are nomads, and their dress is Scythian; but the language which they speak is peculiar to themselves. Unlike any other nation in these parts, they are cannibals.|''Histories'', Book 4 (''Melpomene'')|&lt;sub&gt;trans. [[George Rawlinson]], 1858-1860&lt;/sub&gt;}}

[[Pliny the Elder]] later wrote in his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' that the same cannibals near Scythia wore the [[scalp]]s of men on their chest.

{{quote|The Androphagi, whom we have previously mentioned as dwelling ten days' journey beyond the Borysthenes, according to the account of Isigonus of Nicæa, were in the habit of drinking out of human skulls, and placing the scalps, with the hair attached, upon their breasts, like so many napkins.|''Naturalis Historia'' Book 7, Chapter 2|&lt;sub&gt;trans. [[John Bostock (physician)|John Bostock]] and [[Henry Thomas Riley]], 1855&lt;/sub&gt;}}
