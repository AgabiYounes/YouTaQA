'''Amnon''' ({{lang-he-n|אַמְנוֹן}}, &quot;faithful&quot;, born circa 1000 [[BCE]]) was the oldest son of [[David (biblical king)|King David]] and his second wife, [[Ahinoam]] of [[Jezreel (city)|Jezreel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|2 Samuel 3:2|3=AKJV}}, {{Bibleref2|1 Samuel 25:43|3=AKJV}}. {{Bibleref2|1 Samuel 27:3|3=AKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Hebron]] during his father's reign in [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|2 Samuel 3:2|3=AKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the [[heir apparent]] to the throne of [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Israel]] until he was assassinated by his half-brother [[Absalom]] to avenge the rape of their sister [[Tamar (daughter of David)|Tamar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|2 Samuel 3:2|3=AKJV}}, {{Bibleref2|2 Samuel 13:32|3=AKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical account==

===Amnon's background===
Amnon was born in [[Hebron]] to [[Ahinoam]] and [[David (biblical king)|King David]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|2 Samuel 3:2|3=AKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the presumptive heir to the throne of [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Israel]], Amnon enjoyed a life of power and privilege.&lt;ref&gt;'Babylonian Talmud: Tractate Sanhedrin', page 21, verses 31-32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rape of Tamar===
Although he was the heir-apparent to David's throne, Amnon is best remembered for the [[rape]] of his half-sister [[Tamar (daughter of David)|Tamar]], daughter of David and [[Talmai#Talmai, father of Maacah|Maachah]]. Despite the biblical [[Mitzvah|prohibition]] on sexual relations between half-brothers and sisters,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Leviticus 18:11|3=AKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnon had an overwhelming desire for her. He acted on advice from his cousin, [[Jonadab]] the son of Shimeah, David's brother, to lure Tamar into his quarters by pretending to be sick and desiring her to cook a special meal for him. While in his quarters, and ignoring her protests, he [[rape]]d her, then had her expelled from his house. King David was angry about the incident, but could not bring himself to punish his eldest son, while [[Absalom]], Amnon's half-brother and Tamar's full brother, nursed a bitter grudge against Amnon for the rape of his sister. According to [[Michael D. Coogan]]'s claims, however, it would have been perfectly all right for Amnon to have married his sister (he claims that the Bible was incoherent about prohibiting incest).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coogan|first=Michael|title=God and Sex. What the Bible Really Says|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=2_gPKQEACAAJ&amp;dq=god+and+sex&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=4fbCTaPKDpGXOrq88Z0I&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwAQ|accessdate=5 May 2011|edition=1st|year=2010|publisher=Twelve. Hachette Book Group|location=New York, Boston|isbn=978-0-446-54525-9|oclc=505927356|pages=112-113}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the Torah, per [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0318.htm Leviticus 18], &quot;the children of Israel&quot;—Israelite men and women alike—are forbidden from sexual relations between people who are &quot;near of kin&quot; (cf. verse 6). Siblings and half siblings (cf. verses 9 and 11). Relationships between these are particularly singled out for a curse in [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0527.htm Deuteronomy 27], and they are of the only two kinds incestuous relationships that are among the particularly-singled-out relationships—with the other particularly-singled-out relationships being ones of non-incestuous family betrayal (cf. verse 20) and bestiality (cf. verse 21). Incestuous relationships are considered so severe among [[Chillul Hashem|''chillulim HaShem'']], acts which bring shame to the name of God, as to be, along with the other forbidden relationships that are mentioned in Leviticus 18, punishable by death as specified in [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0320.htm Leviticus 20].

Two years later, to avenge Tamar, Absalom invited all of David's sons to a feast at sheep-shearing time, then had his servants kill Amnon after he had become drunk with wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|2 Samuel 13|3=AKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Absalom fled to [[Geshur]].

{{Bibleref2|2 Samuel 13:39|3=AKJV}} records that in time David came to terms with the death of Amnon, his first-born. [[Methodism|Methodist]] founder [[John Wesley]] is critical of David: &quot;He can almost find in his heart to receive into favour the murderer of his brother. How can we excuse David from the sin of [[Eli (biblical figure)|Eli]], who honoured his sons more than God?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/wes/2_samuel/13.htm Wesley's Notes on 2 Samuel 13], accessed 24 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary references==
* The Spanish poet [[Federico García Lorca]] wrote a poem about Amnon's rape of his sister Tamar, included in Lorca's 1928 poetry collection ''[[Romancero Gitano]]'' (translated as ''Gypsy Ballads''). Lorca's version is considerably different from the Biblical original - Amnon is depicted as being overcome by a sudden uncontrollable passion, with none of the cynical planning and premeditation of the original story. He assaults and rapes Tamar and then flees into the night on his horse, with archers shooting at him from the walls - whereupon King David cuts the strings of his harp.
