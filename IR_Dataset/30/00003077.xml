'''Aldebaran''' {{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|d|ɛ|b|ər|ə|n}}, designated '''α Tauri''' ([[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] to '''Alpha Tauri''', abbreviated '''Alpha Tau''', '''α Tau'''), is a [[red giant star]] about 65 [[light-year]]s from the Sun in the [[zodiac]] [[constellation]] [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]. It is the brightest [[star]] in Taurus and generally the [[list of brightest stars|fourteenth-brightest star]] in the night sky, though it varies slowly in brightness between magnitude 0.75 and 0.95. Aldebaran hosts a planet several times the mass of [[Jupiter]], named {{nowrap|[[Aldebaran b]]}}.

Aldebaran is a red giant, cooler than the sun with a surface temperature of {{val|3,900|fmt=commas|ul=K}}, but its radius is about 44 times [[solar radius|the sun's]], so it is over 400 times as [[solar luminosity|luminous]].  It spins slowly and takes 520 days to complete a rotation.

The planetary exploration probe [[Pioneer 10]] is heading in the general direction of the star and should make its closest approach in about two million years.

==Nomenclature==
The traditional name Aldebaran derives from the Arabic ''al Dabarān'', meaning &quot;the follower&quot;, because it seems to follow the [[Pleiades]].&lt;ref name=mythology2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=allen/&gt;  In 2016, the [[International Astronomical Union]] [[IAU Working Group on Star Names|Working Group on Star Names]] (WGSN) approved the proper name ''Aldebaran'' for this star.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAU-CSN&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WGSN&quot;/&gt;

Aldebaran is the brightest star in the constellation Taurus and so has the [[Bayer designation]] α Tauri, Latinised as Alpha Tauri.  It has the [[Flamsteed designation]] 87 Tauri as the 87th star in the constellation of approximately 7th magnitude or brighter, ordered by [[right ascension]].  It also has the [[Bright Star Catalogue]] number 1457, the [[Henry Draper Catalogue|HD]] number 29139, and the [[Hipparcos]] catalogue number 21421, mostly seen in scientific publications.

It is a variable star listed in the [[General Catalogue of Variable Stars]], but it is listed using its Bayer designation and does not have a separate [[variable star designation]].&lt;ref name=gcvs/&gt;

Aldebaran and several nearby stars are included in double star catalogues such as the [[Washington Double Star Catalog]] as WDS&amp;nbsp;04359+1631 and the [[Aitken Double Star Catalogue]] as ADS&amp;nbsp;3321. It was included with an 11th magnitude companion as a double star as H&amp;nbsp;IV&amp;nbsp;66 in the [[Herschel Catalogue of Double Stars]] and Σ&amp;nbsp;II&amp;nbsp;2 in the [[Struve Double Star Catalog]], and together with a 14th magnitude star as β&amp;nbsp;550 in the [[Burnham Double Star Catalogue]].&lt;ref name=burnham1900/&gt;&lt;ref name=WDSC2014/&gt;

==Observation==
[[File:Iades and Pleiades (32446251210).jpg|thumb|left|Aldebaran in the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]]]]
Aldebaran is one of the easiest stars to find in the [[night sky]], partly due to its brightness and partly due to being near one of the more noticeable [[asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]] in the sky. Following the three stars of [[Orion's Belt|Orion's belt]] in the opposite direction to [[Sirius]], the first bright star encountered is Aldebaran.&lt;ref name=dickinson&gt;{{cite book|author=Terence Dickinson|title=NightWatch: A Practical Guide to Viewing the Universe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BaMBgoKPmjAC&amp;pg=PA56|year=1998|publisher=Firefly Books|isbn=978-1-55209-302-3|pages=56–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The star is, by chance, in the line of sight between the Earth and the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]], so it has the appearance of being the brightest member of the [[open cluster]], but the cluster that forms the bull's-head-shaped asterism is more than twice as far away, at about 150 light years.&lt;ref name=ridpath&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Ridpath|title=The Monthly Sky Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFQIutJ8GSsC&amp;pg=PA55|date=28 May 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43719-6|pages=55–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aldebaran is 5.47 degrees south of the [[ecliptic]] and so can be [[Occultation|occulted]] by the [[Moon]]. Such occultations occur when the Moon's [[ascending node]] is near the [[autumnal equinox]]. A series of 49 occultations occurred starting on 29 January 2015 and ending at 3 September 2018.&lt;ref name=konnen/&gt; Each event was visible from points in the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern hemisphere]] or close to the [[equator]]; people in e.g. Australia or [[South Africa]] can never observe an Aldebaran occultation since it is too far south of the ecliptic. A reasonably accurate estimate for the diameter of Aldebaran was obtained during the occultation of 22 September 1978.&lt;ref name=white/&gt; Aldebaran is in [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] with the Sun around June 1 of each year.&lt;ref name=&quot;LASCO&quot;/&gt;
&lt;!--
Occultations by [[Planet|planets]] are not possible at present, as each planet passes north of Aldebaran. The closest conjunction of a planet with Aldebaran in the 21st century occurred on 9 July 2012, when [[Venus]] passed Aldebaran 56' northward. In the distant past and future, occultations of Aldebaran by [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and Venus have and will occur as result of wandering nodes. The next occultation of Aldebaran by a planet, Venus, will occur on 27 August 5366.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

With a near-[[infrared]] [[J band (infrared)|J band]] [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] of −2.1, only [[Betelgeuse]] (−2.9), [[R Doradus]] (−2.6), and [[Arcturus]] (−2.2) are brighter at that wavelength.&lt;ref name=2mass/&gt;

==Observational history==
[[File:Moon occults Aldebaran.png|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Occultation of Aldebaran by [[Moon|the Moon]]. Aldebaran is the red dot to the right, barely visible in the thumbnail.]]
On 11 March AD&amp;nbsp;509, a lunar [[occultation]] of Aldebaran was observed in [[Athens]], [[Greece]].&lt;ref name=lynn/&gt; English astronomer [[Edmund Halley]] studied the timing of this event, and in 1718 concluded that Aldebaran must have changed position since that time, moving several minutes of arc further to the north. This, as well as observations of the changing positions of stars [[Sirius]] and [[Arcturus]], led to the discovery of [[proper motion]]. Based on present day observations, the position of Aldebaran has shifted 7′ in the last 2000 years; roughly a quarter the diameter of the [[full moon]].&lt;ref name=halley/&gt;&lt;ref name=burnham/&gt;  Due to [[precession of the equinoxes]], 5,000 years ago the [[Vernal equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|vernal equinox]] was close to Aldebaran.&lt;ref name=marduk/&gt;

English astronomer [[William Herschel]] discovered a faint companion to Aldebaran in 1782;&lt;ref name=CD/&gt; an 11th magnitude star at an [[angular separation]] of 117[[arc second|″]]. This star was shown to be itself a close [[double star]] by [[Sherburne Wesley Burnham|S. W. Burnham]] in 1888, and he discovered an additional 14th magnitude companion at an angular separation of 31″. Follow on measurements of proper motion showed that Herschel's companion was diverging from Aldebaran, and hence they were not physically connected. However, the companion discovered by Burnham had almost exactly the same proper motion as Aldebaran, suggesting that the two formed a wide [[binary star]] system.&lt;ref name=gore/&gt;

Working at his private observatory in [[Tulse Hill]], [[England]], in 1864 [[William Huggins]] performed the first studies of the spectrum of Aldebaran, where he was able to identify the lines of nine elements, including [[iron]], [[sodium]], [[calcium]], and [[magnesium]]. In 1886, [[Edward Charles Pickering|Edward C. Pickering]] at the [[Harvard College Observatory]] used a photographic plate to capture fifty [[absorption line]]s in the spectrum of Aldebaran. This became part of the [[Henry Draper Catalogue|Draper Catalogue]], published in 1890. By 1887, the photographic technique had improved to the point that it was possible to measure a star's [[radial velocity]] from the amount of [[Doppler shift]] in the spectrum. By this means, the recession velocity of Aldebaran was estimated as {{nowrap|30 miles per second}} (48&amp;nbsp;km/s), using measurements performed at [[Potsdam Observatory]] by [[Hermann Carl Vogel|Hermann C. Vogel]] and his assistant [[Julius Scheiner]].&lt;ref name=clerke/&gt;

Aldebaran was observed using an interferometer attached to the [[Hooker Telescope]] at the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] in 1921 in order to measure its [[angular diameter]], but it was not resolved in these observations.&lt;ref name=pease/&gt;

The extensive history of observations of Aldebaran led to it being included in the list of 33 stars chosen as benchmarks for the [[Gaia mission]] to calibrate derived stellar parameters.&lt;ref name=sahldoldt/&gt;  It had previously been used to calibrate instruments on board the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].&lt;ref name=heiter/&gt;

==Physical characteristics==
[[File:Aldebaran-Sun comparison-en.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Size comparison between Aldebaran and the [[Sun]]]]

Aldebaran is listed as the [[stellar classification|spectral standard]] for [[K-type giant|type K5+ III stars]].&lt;ref name=perkins/&gt;  Its spectrum shows that it is a [[giant star]] that has evolved off the [[main sequence]] band of the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] after exhausting the [[hydrogen]] at its core.  The collapse of the centre of the star into a degenerate [[helium]] core has ignited a shell of hydrogen outside the core and Aldebaran is now on the [[red giant branch]] (RGB).&lt;ref name=stock/&gt;

The [[effective temperature]] of Aldebaran's [[photosphere]] is {{val|3,910|ul=K|fmt=commas}}.  It has a surface gravity of {{val|1.59|ul=cgs}}, typical for a giant star, but around 25 times lower than the Earth's and 700 times lower than the sun's.  Its [[metallicity]] is about 30% lower than the sun's.

Measurements by the [[Hipparcos]] satellite and other sources put Aldebaran around {{convert|65.3|ly|pc|abbr=off}} away.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gatewood2008&quot;/&gt; Asteroseismology has determined that it is about 16% more massive than the [[Sun]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Farr2018&quot;/&gt; yet it shines with 518 times the Sun's luminosity due to the expanded radius.  The angular diameter of Aldebaran has been measured many times.  The value adopted as part of the Gaia benchmark calibration is {{val|20.580|0.030|ul=mas}}.&lt;ref name=heiter/&gt;  It is 44 times the [[Solar radius|diameter of the Sun]], approximately 61 million kilometres.&lt;ref name=aaa526_A100/&gt;

Aldebaran is a slightly [[variable star]], assigned to the [[slow irregular variable|slow irregular]] type ''LB''.  The [[General Catalogue of Variable Stars]] indicates variation between apparent magnitude 0.75 and 0.95 from historical reports.&lt;ref name=gcvs/&gt;  Modern studies show a smaller amplitude, with some showing almost no variation.&lt;ref name=wasatonic/&gt;  Hipparcos photometry shows an amplitude of only about 0.02 magnitudes and a possible period around 18 days.&lt;ref name=koen/&gt;  Intensive ground-based photometry showed variations of up to 0.03 magnitudes and a possible period around 91 days.&lt;ref name=wasatonic/&gt;  Analysis of observations over a much longer period still find a total amplitude likely to be less than 0.1 magnitudes, and the variation is considered to be irregular.&lt;ref name=percy/&gt;

The [[photosphere]] shows abundances of [[carbon]], [[oxygen]], and [[nitrogen]] that suggest the giant has gone through its first [[dredge-up]] stage—a normal step in the evolution of a star into a red giant during which material from deep within the star is brought up to the surface by [[Convection zone|convection]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohnaka2013&quot;/&gt; With its slow rotation, Aldebaran lacks a [[Dynamo theory|dynamo]] needed to generate a [[corona]] and hence is not a source of [[X-ray astronomy|hard X-ray emission]]. However, small scale [[Stellar magnetic field|magnetic fields]] may still be present in the lower atmosphere, resulting from convection turbulence near the surface. The measured strength of the magnetic field on Aldebaran is 0.22&amp;nbsp;[[Gauss (unit)|Gauss]].&lt;ref name=aa574_A90_30/&gt; Any resulting soft X-ray emissions from this region may be attenuated by the [[chromosphere]], although ultraviolet emission has been detected in the [[stellar spectrum|spectrum]].&lt;ref name=apj598_1_610/&gt; The star is currently losing mass at a rate of {{nowrap|(1–1.6) × 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt; yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} (about one [[Earth mass]] in 300,000 years) with a velocity of {{nowrap|30 km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohnaka2013&quot;/&gt; This [[stellar wind]] may be generated by the weak magnetic fields in the lower atmosphere.&lt;ref name=apj598_1_610/&gt;

Beyond the chromosphere of Aldebaran is an extended molecular outer atmosphere (MOLsphere) where the temperature is cool enough for molecules of gas to form. This region lies at about 2.5 times the radius of the star and has a temperature of about {{val|1,500|fmt=commas|ul=K}}. The spectrum reveals lines of [[carbon monoxide]], [[water]], and [[titanium oxide]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohnaka2013&quot;/&gt; Outside the MOLSphere, the stellar wind continues to expand until it reaches the [[termination shock]] boundary with the hot, ionized [[interstellar medium]] that dominates the [[Local Bubble]], forming a roughly spherical [[astrosphere]] with a radius of around 1,000&amp;nbsp;AU, centered on Aldebaran.&lt;ref name=Wood2007/&gt;

==Visual companions==
Five faint stars appear close to Aldebaran in the sky. These [[double star]] components were given upper-case [[Latin-script alphabet|Latin letter]] designations more or less in the order of their discovery, with the letter A reserved for the primary star. Some characteristics of these components, including their position relative to Aldebaran, are shown in the table.

Some surveys, for example [[Gaia Data Release 2]],&lt;ref name=dr2B/&gt; have indicated that Alpha Tauri B may have about the same [[proper motion]] and [[parallax]] as Aldebaran and thus may be a [[binary star|physical binary]] system. These measurements are difficult, since the dim B component appears so close to the bright primary star, and the margin of error is too large to establish (or exclude) a physical relationship between the two. So far neither the B component, nor anything else, has been unambiguously shown to be physically associated with Aldebaran.&lt;ref name=poveda/&gt;  A spectral type of M2.5 has been published for Alpha Tauri B.&lt;ref name=bidelman/&gt;

Alpha Tauri CD is a [[binary star|binary system]] with the C and D component stars gravitationally bound to and co-orbiting each other. These co-orbiting stars have been shown to be located far beyond Aldebaran and are members of the Hyades star cluster. As with the rest of the stars in the cluster they do not physically interact with Aldebaran in any way.&lt;ref name=CD/&gt;

==Planetary system==
{{Main|Aldebaran b}}

In 1993 radial velocity measurements of Aldebaran, [[Arcturus]] and [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]] showed that Aldebaran exhibited a long-period radial velocity oscillation, which could be interpreted as a [[substellar companion]]. The measurements for Aldebaran implied a companion with a minimum mass 11.4 times that of [[Jupiter]] in a 643-day orbit at a separation of {{convert|2.0|AU|Gm|abbr=on}} in a mildly [[Eccentricity (orbit)|eccentric]] orbit. However, all three stars surveyed showed similar oscillations yielding similar companion masses, and the authors concluded that the variation was likely to be intrinsic to the star rather than due to the gravitational effect of a companion.&lt;ref name=Kgiants/&gt;

In 2015 a study showed stable long-term evidence for both a planetary companion and stellar activity.&lt;ref name=hatzes/&gt; An [[asteroseismic]] analysis of the residuals to the planet fit has determined that Aldebaran&amp;nbsp;b has a minimum mass of {{val|5.8|0.7}} [[Jupiter mass]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farr2018&quot; /&gt;
&lt;!--==View from this star==
If the Sun were to be observed from this star, it would be located at the [[antipodal point]] of Aldebaran's coordinates, at {{RA|16|35|55}}, {{DEC|–16|30|33}} in the constellation [[Ophiuchus]]. Assuming a distance of {{val|20|u=pc}} and negligible [[extinction (astronomy)|extinction]], it would be a faint 6.3 magnitude star, dimmer than [[Uranus]] at maximum brightness from [[Earth]] at 5.38.&lt;ref name=uranus/&gt;--&gt;

==Etymology and mythology==
Aldebaran was originally نير الضبران (''Nā᾽ir al Dabarān'' in Arabic), meaning &quot;the bright one of the follower&quot;.  ''al Dabarān'' (الدبران) then applied to the whole of the [[lunar mansion]] containing the Hyades.&lt;ref name=allen/&gt;  It is assumed that what it was following is the [[Pleiades]].&lt;ref name=mythology2011/&gt;  A variety of transliterated spellings have been used, with the current ''Aldebaran'' becoming standard relatively recently.&lt;ref name=allen/&gt;

===Mythology===
This easily seen and striking star in its suggestive [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] is a popular subject for ancient and modern myths.

* Mexican culture: For the [[Seri people|Seris]] of northwestern Mexico, this star provides light for the seven women giving birth ([[Pleiades]]). It has three names: ''{{lang|sei-Latn|Hant Caalajc Ipápjö}}'', ''{{lang|sei-Latn|Queeto}}'', and ''{{lang|sei-Latn|Azoj Yeen oo Caap}}'' (&quot;star that goes ahead&quot;). The lunar month corresponding to October is called ''{{lang|sei-Latn|Queeto yaao}}'' &quot;Aldebaran's path&quot;.&lt;ref name=moser/&gt;
* Aboriginal culture: in the Clarence River of northeastern [[New South Wales]], this star is the Ancestor ''Karambal'', who stole another man's wife. The woman's husband tracked him down and burned the tree in which he was hiding. It is believed that he rose to the sky as smoke and became the star Aldebaran.&lt;ref name=clarke/&gt;
&lt;!--* In Hindu mythology Aldebaran is known by the name Rohini and is the fourth of the 27 daughters of Daksha given to God Chandra(moon) as wives. The Moon God enamoured by the beauty of Rohini started spending all his time with her neglecting the others. (This amounts to moon not going round the constellations of zodiac and remaining in one place!). Daksha got angry and cursed him to suffer by slow desiccation. After pleading to the lord [[Shiva]] the curse was held at bay and the moon was rejuvenated by shiva's grace for 15 days and desiccated for another 15 days thus waning and waxing to make a lunar month.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}--&gt;

===Names in other languages===
* In [[Hindu astronomy]] it is identified as the [[Rohini (nakshatra)|lunar mansion Rohini]] (&quot;the red one&quot;) and as one of the twenty-seven daughters of [[Daksha]] and the wife of the god [[Chandra]] (Moon).
&lt;!--* In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], it is named Stacidan due to the stars noticeably orange-reddish hue.{{cn|date=April 2018}}--&gt;
&lt;!--* In [[Persia]] it was known as Tascheter.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}--&gt;
&lt;!--* The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] called it ''{{lang|la|[[Parilia|Palilicium]]}}''.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}--&gt;
* In [[Ancient Greek]] it has been called {{lang|el|Λαμπαδίας}} ''Lampadias'', literally &quot;torch-like ''or'' -bearer&quot;.&lt;ref name=lsj/&gt;
&lt;!--* In the Middle Ages it was sometimes called Cor Tauri (the Heart of the Bull/Taurus).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}--&gt;
* In [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese]], {{lang|zh|畢宿}} ({{lang|zh-Latn|Bì Xiù}}), meaning ''[[Net (Chinese constellation)|Net]]'', refers to an [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] consisting Aldebaran, [[Epsilon Tauri|ε Tauri]], [[Delta3 Tauri|δ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Tauri]], [[Delta1 Tauri|δ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Tauri]], [[Gamma Tauri|γ Tauri]], [[71 Tauri]] and [[Lambda Tauri|λ Tauri]].&lt;ref name=zh/&gt; Consequently, the [[Chinese star names|Chinese name]] for Aldebaran itself is {{lang|zh|畢宿五}} ({{lang|zh-Latn|Bì Xiù wǔ}}), &quot;the Fifth Star of Net&quot;.&lt;ref name=lcsd/&gt;

===In modern culture===

* United States Navy stores ship {{USS|Aldebaran|AF-10}} and Italian frigate [[Italian frigate Aldebaran (F 590)|''Aldebaran'' (F 590)]]
* proposed micro-satellite launch vehicle  [[Aldebaran (rocket)|Aldebaran]]
* French company [[Aldebaran Robotics]]
* fashion brand [[AlphaTauri]]
* [[Formula 1]] team [[Scuderia AlphaTauri]], previously known as [[Toro Rosso]]

The star also appears in [[Aldebaran in fiction|works of fiction]] such as ''[[Far From the Madding Crowd]]'' and ''[[Down and Out in Paris and London]]''.  It is frequently seen in [[science fiction]], including the ''[[Lensman series]]'' and ''[[Fallen Dragon]]''.  As the brightest star in a Zodiac constellation, it is also given [[Stars in astrology#Aldebaran|great significance]] within [[astrology]].

Aldebaran regularly features in [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] as one of the origins of [[List of alleged extraterrestrial beings|extraterrestrial aliens]],&lt;ref name=lafayette/&gt; often linked to [[Nazi UFOs]].&lt;ref name=vanhelsing/&gt; A well-known example is the German conspiracy theorist [[Axel Stoll]], who considered the star the home of the [[Aryan#Nazism and white supremacy|Aryan race]] and the target of expeditions by the [[Wehrmacht]].&lt;ref name=stoll/&gt;

The planetary exploration probe [[Pioneer 10]] is no longer powered or in contact with Earth, but its trajectory is taking it in the general direction of Aldebaran.  It is expected to make its closest approach in about two million years.&lt;ref name=cp48_1_41/&gt;
