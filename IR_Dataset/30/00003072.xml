'''Arcturus''', designation '''α&amp;nbsp;Boötis''' ([[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] to '''Alpha&amp;nbsp;Boötis''', abbreviated '''Alpha&amp;nbsp;Boo''', '''α&amp;nbsp;Boo'''), is the brightest [[star]] in the [[constellation]] of [[Boötes]], the [[List of brightest stars|fourth-brightest]] in the [[night sky]], and the brightest in the [[northern celestial hemisphere]]. Together with [[Spica]] and [[Denebola]] (or [[Regulus]], depending on the source), Arcturus is part of the [[Spring Triangle]] [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] and, by extension, also of the [[Great Diamond]] along with the star [[Cor Caroli]].

Relatively close at 36.7 [[light-year]]s from the [[Sun]], Arcturus is a [[red giant]] of spectral type K0III—an aging star around 7.1 billion years old that has used up its [[Stellar core|core]] [[hydrogen]] and moved off the [[main sequence]]. It is {{Val|1.08|0.06}} times as massive [[Solar mass|as the Sun]], but has expanded to {{Val|25.4|0.2}} times [[Solar radius|its diameter]] and is around 170 times [[Solar luminosity|as luminous]].

==Nomenclature==
''α Boötis'' ([[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] to ''Alpha Boötis'') is the star's [[Bayer designation]].

The traditional name ''Arcturus'' derives from [[Ancient Greek]] Ἀρκτοῦρος (''Arktouros'') and means &quot;Guardian of the Bear&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*%29arktou%3Dros |title=Ἀρκτοῦρος |author1=Henry George Liddell |author2=Robert Scott |work=A Greek-English Lexicon| accessdate=2019-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately from ἄρκτος (''arktos''), &quot;bear&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Frktos |title=ἄρκτος |author1=Henry George Liddell |author2=Robert Scott |work=A Greek-English Lexicon| accessdate=2019-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and οὖρος (''ouros''), &quot;watcher, guardian&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dou%29%3Dros2 |title=οὖρος |author1=Henry George Liddell |author2=Robert Scott |work=A Greek-English Lexicon| accessdate=2019-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been known by this name since at least the time of [[Hesiod]].&lt;ref name=rogers982/&gt;

===Mythology===
{{See also|Ursa Major#Mythology|Boötes#History and mythology}}
One astronomical tradition associates Arcturus with the mythology around [[Arcas]], who was about to shoot and kill his own mother [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]] who had been transformed into a bear. Zeus averted their imminent tragic fate by transforming the boy into the constellation Boötes, called Arctophylax &quot;bear guardian&quot; by the Greeks, and his mother into Ursa Major (Greek: Arctos &quot;the bear&quot;). The account is given in [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]]'s ''[[De Astronomica|Astronomy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref={{SfnRef|Eratosthenes|Hyginus|Aratus|Hard (tr.)|2015}}|author1=Eratosthenes |author2=Hyginus |author3=Aratus |others=Hard, Robin (transl.) |title=Eratosthenes and Hyginus: Constellation Myths, with Aratus's Phaenomena |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2015 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7IMSBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36 |pages=5–7, 35–37|isbn=9780198716983 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aratus]] in his ''Phaenomena'' said that the star Arcturus lay below the belt of Arctophylax, although according to [[Ptolemy]] in the ''Almagest'' it lay between his thighs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/bootes.htm| author=Ridpath, Ian |title=Star Tales Boötes |accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative lore associates the name with the legend around [[Icarius (Athenian)|Icarius]], who gave the gift of wine to other men, but was murdered by them, because they had had no experience with intoxication and mistook the wine for poison. It is stated this Icarius, became Arcturus, while his dog, [[Maera (hound)|Maira]], became Canicula ([[Procyon]]), although &quot;Arcturus&quot; here may be used in the sense of the constellation rather than the star.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eratosthenes|Hyginus|Aratus|Hard (tr.)|2015|pp=38–40}}, p. 182 (note to p. 40)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standardization===
In 2016, the [[International Astronomical Union]] organized a [[IAU Working Group on Star Names|Working Group on Star Names]] (WGSN)&lt;ref name=&quot;WGSN&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.iau.org/science/scientific_bodies/working_groups/280/ | title=IAU Working Group on Star Names (WGSN)|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016&lt;ref name=&quot;WGSN1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/WGSN/WGSN_bulletin1.pdf | title=Bulletin of the IAU Working Group on Star Names, No. 1 |accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included ''Arcturus'' for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAU-CSN&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/WGSN/IAU-CSN.txt | title=IAU Catalog of Star Names |accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observation==

With an [[apparent visual magnitude]] of&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;0.05, Arcturus is the brightest star in the [[northern celestial hemisphere]] and the [[list of brightest stars|fourth-brightest star]] in the night sky,&lt;ref name=&quot;100greatest&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=The Hundred Greatest Stars | author=Kaler, James B. | date=2002 | publisher=Copernicus Books | location=New York, New York | isbn=978-0-387-95436-3 | page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Sirius]] (&amp;minus;1.46&amp;nbsp;apparent magnitude), [[Canopus (star)|Canopus]] (&amp;minus;0.72) and [[α Centauri]] (combined magnitude of &amp;minus;0.27). However, α Centauri AB is a [[binary star]], whose components are both fainter than Arcturus. This makes Arcturus the third-brightest individual star, just ahead of α Centauri&amp;nbsp;A (officially named ''Rigil Kentaurus''), whose apparent magnitude {{nobr|is &amp;minus;0.01}}.&lt;ref name=schaaf&gt;{{cite book| first=Fred | last=Schaaf | date=2008 | title=The Brightest Stars: Discovering the Universe Through the Sky's Most Brilliant Stars | pages=126–36 | publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey | isbn=978-0-471-70410-2 | bibcode=2008bsdu.book.....S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The French mathematician and astronomer [[Jean-Baptiste Morin (mathematician)|Jean-Baptiste Morin]] observed Arcturus in the daytime with a telescope in 1635, a first for any star other than the [[Sun]] and [[supernova]]e.  Arcturus has been seen at or just before sunset with the naked eye.&lt;ref name=schaaf/&gt;

Arcturus is visible from both of [[Earth]]'s hemispheres as it is located 19° north of the [[celestial equator]]. The star [[culmination|culminates]] at midnight on 27 April, and at 9 p.m. on June 10 being visible during the late northern spring or the southern autumn.&lt;ref&gt;Schaaf, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[northern hemisphere]], an easy way to find Arcturus is to follow the arc of the handle of the [[Big Dipper]] (or Plough). By continuing in this path, one can find [[Spica]], &quot;Arc to Arcturus, then spike (or speed on) to Spica&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rao |first1=Joe |title=Arc to Arcturus, Speed on to Spica |url=https://www.space.com/3953-arc-arcturus-speed-spica.html |accessdate=14 August 2018 |work=Space.com |date=June 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Follow the arc to Arcturus, and drive a spike to Spica {{!}} EarthSky.org |url=http://earthsky.org/tonight/follow-the-arc-to-arcturus |accessdate=14 August 2018 |work=earthsky.org |date=April 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ptolemy described Arcturus as ''subrufa'' (&quot;slightly red&quot;): it has a B-V color index of +1.23, roughly midway between [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]] (B-V +1.00) and [[Aldebaran]] (B-V +1.54).&lt;ref name=schaaf/&gt;

[[η Boötis]], or Muphrid, is only 3.3 [[light-year]]s distant from Arcturus, and would have a visual magnitude −2.5, about as bright as [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] from [[Earth]], whereas an observer on the former system would find Arcturus as bright as [[Venus]] as seen from Earth.&lt;ref name=schaaf/&gt;

In 1984, the 90 cm (36-inch) reflecting [[Yapp telescope]] at Herstmonceux was tested with an [[echelle spectrograph]] from [[Queen's University Belfast]] and a CCD camera. Observations of the stars Arcturus and [[Deneb]] (Alpha Cygni) were conducted in the summer of 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1985A&amp;A...145..321B |title=High dispersion spectroscopy trials using an echelle spectrograph with CCD camera |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=145 |pages=321 |last1=Bates |first1=B. |last2=McKeith |first2=C.

==Physical characteristics==
[[File:Arcturus (optical).png|thumb|right|275 px|Optical image of Arcturus (DSS2 / MAST / STScI / NASA)]]
Based upon an annual [[stellar parallax|parallax]] shift of 88.83&amp;nbsp;[[Minute and second of arc#Astronomy|milliarcseconds]] as measured by the [[Hipparcos]] satellite, Arcturus is {{Convert|11.26|pc|ly|abbr=off|lk=on|order=flip}} from the Sun. The parallax [[margin of error]] is 0.54 milliarcseconds, translating to a distance margin of error of ±{{Convert|0.069|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanLeeuwen2007&quot;/&gt; Because of its proximity, Arcturus has a high [[proper motion]], two [[Minute and second of arc#Astronomy|arcseconds]] a year, greater than any [[first magnitude star]] other than α&amp;nbsp;Centauri.

Arcturus is moving rapidly ({{nowrap|122 km/s}}) relative to the Sun, and is now almost at its closest point to the Sun. Closest approach will happen in about 4,000 years, when the star will be a few hundredths of a light-year closer to Earth than it is today. (In antiquity, Arcturus was closer to the centre of the constellation.&lt;ref name=rogers982&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rogers | first = John H. | date = 1998 | title = Origins of the Ancient Constellations: II. The Mediterranean Traditions | journal = Journal of the British Astronomical Association | volume = 108 | issue = 2 | pages = 79–89 | bibcode = 1998JBAA..108...79R}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Arcturus is thought to be an [[old-disk star]], and appears to be moving with a group of 52 other such stars, known as the [[Arcturus stream]].&lt;ref name=ramya&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2012MNRAS.425.3188R|arxiv=1207.0767|title=Chemical compositions of stars in two stellar streams from the Galactic thick disc|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=425|issue=4|pages=3188|last1=Ramya|first1=P.|last2=Reddy|first2=Bacham E.|last3=Lambert|first3=David L.|date=2012|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2012.21677.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With an [[absolute magnitude]] of −0.30, Arcturus is, together with [[Vega]] and Sirius, one of the most luminous stars in the Sun's neighborhood. It is about 110 times brighter than the Sun in visible light wavelengths, but this underestimates its strength as much of the light it gives off is in the [[infrared]]; total ([[Bolometric correction|bolometric]]) power output is about 180&amp;nbsp;times that of the Sun.  With a near-infrared [[J band (infrared)|J band]] [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] of −2.2, only [[Betelgeuse]] (−2.9) and [[R Doradus]] (−2.6) are brighter.  The lower output in visible light is due to a lower [[Luminous efficacy|efficacy]] as the star has a lower [[effective temperature|surface temperature]] than the Sun.

Arcturus is an [[stellar evolution|evolved]] [[red giant]] star with a [[stellar classification]] of K0&amp;nbsp;III. As the brightest K-type [[Giant star#Red giants|giant]] in the sky, it was the subject of an [[spectral atlas|atlas]] of its visible [[stellar spectrum|spectrum]], made from [[photographic plate|photographic]] spectra taken with the [[Reflecting telescope#Coudé|coudé]] [[spectrograph]] of the [[Mount Wilson Observatory|Mt. Wilson 2.5m telescope]] published in 1968,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Griffin | first=R.

As a single star, the mass of Arcturus cannot be measured directly, but models suggest it is slightly larger than that of the Sun. Evolutionary matching to the observed physical parameters gives a mass of {{Val|1.08|0.06|u=solar mass}},&lt;ref name=ramirez_prieto_2011/&gt; while the oxygen isotope ratio for a first [[dredge-up]] star gives a mass of {{solar mass|1.2}}.&lt;ref name=abia&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2012A&amp;A...548A..55A|arxiv=1210.1160|title=Carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios in Arcturus and Aldebaran.

A weak magnetic field has been detected in the [[photosphere]] with a strength of around half a [[Gauss (unit)|gauss]]. The magnetic activity appears to lie along four latitudes and is rotationally-modulated.&lt;ref name=Sennhauser2011&gt;{{cite journal | title=First detection of a weak magnetic field on the giant Arcturus: remnants of a solar dynamo? | last1=Sennhauser | first1=C. | last2=Berdyugina | first2=S.

Arcturus is estimated to be around 6 billion to 8.5 billion years old,&lt;ref name=ramirez_prieto_2011/&gt; but there is some uncertainty about its evolutionary status.&lt;ref name=Pavlenko2008/&gt; Based upon the [[Color index|color characteristics]] of Arcturus, it is currently ascending the [[red-giant branch]] and will continue to do so until it accumulates a large enough degenerate helium [[Stellar core|core]] to ignite the [[helium flash]].&lt;ref name=ramirez_prieto_2011/&gt; It has likely exhausted the [[hydrogen]] from its core and is now in its active [[red giant|hydrogen shell burning]] phase. However, Charbonnel et al. (1998) placed it slightly above the [[horizontal branch]], and suggested it has already completed the helium flash stage.&lt;ref name=Pavlenko2008&gt;{{cite journal | title=The carbon abundance and &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C isotopic ratio in the atmosphere of Arcturus from 2.3 µm CO bands | last1=Pavlenko | first1=Ya.

===Oscillations===
As one of the brightest stars in the sky, Arcturus has been the subject of a number of studies in the emerging field of [[asteroseismology]]. Belmonte and colleagues carried out a radial velocity (Doppler shift of spectral lines) study of the star in April and May 1988, which showed variability with a frequency of the order of a few micro[[hertz]] (μHz), the highest peak corresponding to 4.3&amp;nbsp;μHz (2.7&amp;nbsp;days) with an amplitude of 60 ms&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, with a [[frequency separation]] of c.&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;μHz. They suggested that the most plausible explanation for the variability of Arcturus is stellar oscillations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Belmonte, J. A.|author2=Jones, A. R.|author3=Palle, P.

Asteroseismological measurements allow direct calculation of the mass and radius, giving values of {{Val|0.8|0.2|u=solar mass}} and {{Val|27.9|3.4|ul=solar radius}}.

===Element abundance===
Astronomers term &quot;metals&quot; those elements with higher [[atomic number]]s than [[helium]]. Arcturus has an enrichment of [[alpha elements]] relative to [[iron]] but only about a third of solar [[metallicity]]. Arcturus is possibly a [[Population II star]].&lt;ref name=schaaf/&gt;

===Possible planetary system===
''Hipparcos'' also suggested that Arcturus is a [[binary star]], with the companion about twenty times dimmer than the primary and orbiting close enough to be at the very limits of humans' current ability to make it out. Recent results remain inconclusive, but do support the marginal ''Hipparcos'' detection of a binary companion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1=T.|last1=Verhoelst|first2=P.

In 1993, radial velocity measurements of Aldebaran, Arcturus and Pollux showed that Arcturus exhibited a long-period radial velocity oscillation, which could be interpreted as a ''substellar companion''. This [[substellar object]] would be nearly 12&amp;nbsp;times the [[mass of Jupiter]] and be located roughly at the same orbital distance from Arcturus as the Earth is from the Sun, at 1.1&amp;nbsp;[[astronomical unit]]s. However, all three stars surveyed showed similar oscillations yielding similar companion masses, and the authors concluded that the variation was likely to be intrinsic to the star rather than due to the gravitational effect of a companion. So far no substellar companion has been confirmed.&lt;ref name=Kgiants&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/173002|title=Long-period radial velocity variations in three K giants|author=Hatzes, A.|author2=Cochran, W.|journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=413|issue = 1|pages=339–348|date=August 1993|bibcode=1993ApJ...413..339H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other names==

=== In Arabic ===
In [[Arabic]], Arcturus is one of two stars called ''al-simāk'' &quot;the uplifted ones&quot; (the other is [[Spica]]). Arcturus is specified as السماك الرامح ''as-simāk ar-rāmiħ'' &quot;the uplifted one of the lancer&quot;. The term ''Al Simak Al Ramih'' has appeared in Al Achsasi Al Mouakket catalogue (translated into [[Latin]] as ''Al Simak Lanceator'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knobel|first=E.

This has been variously [[Romanization|romanized]] in the past, leading to obsolete variants such as ''Aramec'' and ''Azimech''. For example, the name ''Alramih'' is used in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[A Treatise on the Astrolabe]]'' (1391). Another Arabic name is ''Haris-el-sema'', from ''حارس السماء'' ''ħāris al-samā’'' &quot;the keeper of heaven&quot;.&lt;ref name=arabicstar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jas.org.jo/arabic/alma.html|title= List of the 25&amp;nbsp;brightest stars|website = Jordanian Astronomical Society|accessdate=March 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=allen&gt;{{cite book|author=Allen, Richard Hinckley |title=Star-names and their meanings|date=1936|pages= 100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arabicdict&gt;{{cite book|author=Wehr, Hans |editor=Cowan, J.

===Asia===
In [[Chinese astronomy]], Arcturus is called ''Da Jiao'' ({{zh|c=大角|p=Dàjiǎo|l=great horn}}), because it is the brightest star in the [[Chinese constellation]] called ''[[Horn (Chinese constellation)|Jiao Xiu]]'' ({{zh|c=角宿|p=Jiǎo Xiǔ|l=horn star|links=no}}). Later it became a part of another constellation ''[[Neck (Chinese constellation)|Kang Xiu]]'' ({{zh|c=亢宿|p=Kàng Xiǔ|links=no}}).

In Indian [[Astrology]] or [[Hindu astrology|Vedic Astrology]] or [[Sidereal Astrology]], Arcturus is called ''[[Swati the Star|Swati]]'' which is a word meaning &quot;very beneficent&quot; derived from the language [[Sanskrit]]. It is the [[eponymous]] star of one of the [[nakshatra]]s (lunar mansions) of [[Hindu astrology]].

Arcturus had several names that described its significance to indigenous [[Polynesia]]ns. In the [[Society Islands]], Arcturus, called ''Ana-tahua-taata-metua-te-tupu-mavae'' (&quot;a pillar to stand by&quot;), was one of the ten &quot;pillars of the sky&quot;, bright stars that represented the ten heavens of the [[Tahiti]]an afterlife.&lt;!--{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=199}}--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;makemson&quot;/&gt; In [[Hawaii]], the pattern of Boötes was called ''Hoku-iwa'', meaning &quot;stars of the frigatebird&quot;.

==In culture==

As one of the [[brightest stars]] in the sky, Arcturus has been significant to observers since antiquity.

===Historical cultures===

Prehistoric [[Polynesian navigation|Polynesian navigators]] knew Arcturus as ''Hōkūleʻa'', the &quot;Star of Joy&quot;. Arcturus is the [[zenith]] star of the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. Using Hōkūleʻa and other stars, the Polynesians launched their double-hulled canoes from [[Tahiti]] and the [[Marquesas Islands]]. Traveling east and north they eventually crossed the [[equator]] and reached the [[latitude]] at which Arcturus would appear directly overhead in the summer night sky. Knowing they had arrived at the exact latitude of the island chain, they sailed due west on the [[trade winds]] to landfall. If Hōkūleʻa could be kept directly overhead, they landed on the southeastern shores of the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of [[Hawaii|Hawaiʻi]]. For a return trip to Tahiti the navigators could use Sirius, the zenith star of that island. Since 1976, the [[Polynesian Voyaging Society]]'s ''[[Hōkūleʻa]]'' has crossed the Pacific Ocean many times under navigators who have incorporated this [[wayfinding]] technique in their non-instrument navigation.

In ancient [[Mesopotamia]], it was linked to the god [[Enlil]], and also known as Shudun, &quot;yoke&quot;,&lt;ref name=rogers982/&gt; or SHU-PA of unknown derivation in the ''Three Stars Each'' [[Babylonian star catalogues]] and later [[MUL.APIN]] around 1100 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rogers | first = John H. | date = 1998 | title = Origins of the Ancient Constellations: I.

In [[Ancient Rome]], the star's celestial activity was supposed to portend tempestuous weather, and a personification of the star acts as narrator of the prologue to [[Plautus]]' comedy ''[[Rudens (play)|Rudens]]'' (circa 211 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Plautus |author-link=Plautus |title=Rudens|page= prol.&amp;nbsp;71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Lewis|author2= Short|last-author-amp= yes |author-link= Lewis and Short|work= Latin Dictionary |title= Arcturus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the possible etymologies offered for the name &quot;[[Arthur]]&quot; assumes that it is derived from &quot;Arcturus&quot; and that the early Medieval character on whom the myth of [[King Arthur]] is based was originally named for the star &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer, Stefan, Die keltischen Wurzeln der Artussage: mit einer vollständigen Übersetzung der ältesten Artuserzählung Culhwch und Olwen, Winter, 2006, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer, Stefan, &quot;The Name of Arthur – A New Etymology &quot;, Journal of Celtic Linguistics, Volume 13, Number 1, March 2009, University of Wales Press, pp. 131–136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter, Philippe, Faccia M.

Arcturus achieved fame when its light was rumored to be the mechanism used to open the [[Century of Progress|1933 Chicago World's Fair]]. The star was chosen as it was thought that light from Arcturus had started its journey at about the time of the [[World's Columbian Exposition|previous Chicago World's Fair]] in 1893 (at 36.7&amp;nbsp;light-years away, the light actually started in 1896).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Century of Progress World's Fair, 1933-1934|publisher=University of Illinois-Chicago|date=January 2008|url=http://collections.carli.illinois.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/uic_cop&amp;CISOPTR=45&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=1| accessdate=2009-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The star is mentioned in the 1977 documentary film ''[[Powers of Ten (film)|Powers of Ten]]'', in which it is seen when a camera zooms from Earth to the whole of the known universe.
