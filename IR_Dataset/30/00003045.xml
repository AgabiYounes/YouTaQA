      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''amyl alcohol''' is any of 8 [[alcohols]] with the formula C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;ref&gt;[[Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary]] 11th Ed. 2004&lt;/ref&gt; A mixture of [[pentyl|amyl]] alcohols (also called amyl alcohol) can be obtained from [[fusel alcohol]]. Amyl alcohol is used as a solvent and in [[esterfication]], by which is produced [[amyl acetate]] and other important products. The name ''amyl alcohol'' without further specification applies to the normal (straight-chain) form, [[1-Pentanol|1-pentanol]].

These are the 8 [[structural isomer]]s of alcohols with [[molecular formula]] C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O:

Three of these alcohols, active amyl alcohol (2-methylbutan-1-ol), methyl (n) propyl carbinol (pentan-2-ol), and methyl isopropyl carbinol (3-methylbutan-2-ol), contain an asymmetric carbon atom and are therefore [[optical isomerism|optically active]].

The most important is [[isobutyl carbinol]], the chief constituent of fermentation amyl alcohol and a constituent of [[fusel oil]]. It can be separated from fusel oil by either of two methods: shaking with strong [[brine]] solution and separating the oily layer from the brine layer; [[distillation|distilling]] it and collecting the fraction that boils between 125 and 140&amp;nbsp;°C. Further purification is possible with this procedure: shaking the product with hot [[limewater]], separating the oily layer, drying the product with [[calcium chloride]], and distilling it, collecting  the fraction boiling between 128 and 132&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amyl Alcohols|volume=1|page=900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isobutyl carbinol can be synthesized from [[isobutanol]] by conversion into isovaleraldehyde, which is subsequently reduced to isobutyl carbinol by means of [[sodium amalgam]].  It is a colourless liquid of density 0.8247 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (0&amp;nbsp;°C), boiling at 131.6&amp;nbsp;°C, slightly soluble in water, and easily dissolved in organic solvents. It has a characteristic strong smell and a sharp burning taste. Amyl alcohol has an oral LD50 of 200&amp;nbsp;mg/kg in mice,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that it is significantly more toxic than ethanol. On passing the vapour through a red-hot tube, it decomposes into [[acetylene]], [[ethylene]], [[propylene]], and other compounds. It is [[oxidation|oxidized]] by [[chromic acid]] to [[isovaleraldehyde]], and it forms [[addition compound]]s [[crystal]]s with calcium chloride and [[tin(IV) chloride]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

The other amyl alcohols may be obtained synthetically. Of these, tertiary butyl carbinol has been the most difficult to obtain, with the first reported synthesis in 1891 by L. Tissier&lt;ref&gt;Comptes Rendus'', 1891, 112, p. 1065''&lt;/ref&gt; using the reduction of a mixture of trimethyl acetic acid and trimethylacetyl chloride with sodium amalgam. It is a solid that melts at 48 to 50&amp;nbsp;°C and boils at 112.3&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;
