===Security compromise===
Lamo was a [[white hat hacker]] who viewed the rise of the world wide web with a mixture of excitement and alarm. He felt that others failed to see the importance of internet security in the early days of the world wide web. Lamo would break into corporate computer systems, but he never caused damage to the systems involved. Instead, he would offer to fix the security flaws free of charge, and if the flaw wasn't fixed, he would alert the media.&lt;ref name=&quot;HacksSquats&quot; /&gt; Lamo hoped to be hired by a corporation to attempt to break in systems and test their security, a practice known as [[red team]]ing. However, by the time this practice was common, his felony conviction prevented him from being hired.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

In December 2001, Lamo was praised by [[Worldcom]] for helping to fortify their corporate security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Poulsen|first=Kevin|title=FBI reportedly hunting Adrian Lamo|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/09/05/fbi_reportedly_hunting_adrian_lamo/|work=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2002, he broke into the internal computer network of ''[[The New York Times]]'', added his name to the internal database of expert sources, and used the paper's [[LexisNexis]] account to conduct research on high-profile subjects. ''The New York Times'' filed a complaint, and a warrant for Lamo's arrest was issued in August 2003 following a 15-month investigation by federal prosecutors in New York. At 10:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. on September 9, after spending a few days in hiding, he surrendered to the [[United States Marshals Service|US Marshals]] in [[Sacramento, California]]. He re-surrendered to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] in New York City on September 11, and pleaded guilty to one felony count of [[computer crime]]s against [[Microsoft]], [[LexisNexis]], and ''The New York Times'' on January 8, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Noah|last=Shachtman|url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/news/2004/01/61831|title=Adrian Lamo Cuts Deal With Feds|work=Wired|access-date=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kevin Poulsen|url=http://www.securityfocus.com/news/7771|title=Lamo Pleads Guilty to Times Hack|website=Securityfocus.com|date=January 8, 2004|access-date=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2004, Lamo was sentenced to two years' probation, with six months to be served in home detention, and ordered to pay $65,000 in restitution.&lt;ref name=Sentence/&gt; He was convicted of compromising security at ''The New York Times'', Microsoft,&lt;ref&gt;

When challenged for a response to allegations that he was glamorizing crime for the sake of publicity, his response was: &quot;Anything I could say about my person or my actions would only cheapen what they have to say for themselves&quot;. When approached for comment during his criminal case, Lamo frustrated reporters with [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequiturs]], such as &quot;Faith manages&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

He subsequently declared on the question and answer site [[Quora]] that: &quot;We all own our actions in fullness, not just the pleasant aspects of them.&quot; Lamo accepted that he had committed mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.quora.com/How-often-do-criminals-hand-themselves-in/answer/Adri%C3%A1n-Lamo &quot;Adrián Lamo's answer to How often do criminals hand themselves in? – Quora&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;

===DNA controversy===
[[File:Adrian Lamo bus station.jpg|thumb|right|Lamo in San Francisco in 2006]]
On May 9, 2006, while 18 months into a two-year probation sentence, Lamo refused to give the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] a blood sample, which they had demanded to record his [[DNA]] in their [[Combined DNA Index System|CODIS]] system.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; According to his attorney at the time Lamo had a religious objection to giving blood but was willing to give his DNA in another form. On June 15, 2007, lawyers for Lamo filed a motion citing the [[Book of Genesis]] as one basis for Lamo's religious opposition to the giving of blood.

On June 20, 2007, Lamo's legal counsel reached a settlement agreement with the U.S. [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] whereby Lamo would submit a [[cheek swab]] in place of the blood sample.&lt;ref&gt;

In February 2009, a partial list of the anonymous donors to the WikiLeaks not-for-profit website was leaked and published on the WikiLeaks website. Some media sources indicated at the time that Lamo was among the donors on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytech.com/Wikileaks+Forced+to+Post+Its+Own+Secrets/article14328.htm|title=Wikileaks Forced to Post Its Own Secrets|website=DailyTech|access-date=December 20, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117071425/http://www.dailytech.com/Wikileaks+Forced+to+Post+Its+Own+Secrets/article14328.htm|archive-date=January 17, 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wikileaked&gt;{{cite web|last=Singel|first=Ryan|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/02/wikileaks-force/|title=Wikileaks forced to leak its own secret info (Wired)|website=Wired|access-date=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamo commented on his Twitter page, &quot;Thanks WikiLeaks, for leaking your donor list&amp;nbsp;...

Lamo stated, in an article written by [[Kevin Poulsen]] in [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']] magazine, that he would not have turned Manning in &quot;if lives weren't in danger&amp;nbsp;... [She] was in a war zone and basically trying to vacuum up as much classified information as [she] could, and just throwing it up into the air.&quot;&lt;ref name=wiredIntAnarrest /&gt; WikiLeaks responded by denouncing Lamo and Poulsen as &quot;notorious felons, informers &amp; manipulators&quot;, and said: &quot;journalists should take care.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot; /&gt;

According to Andy Greenberg of ''[[Forbes]]'',&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.forbes.com/firewall/2010/08/01/stealthy-government-contractor-monitors-u-s-internet-providers-says-it-employed-wikileaks-informant/|title=Andy Greenberg: Stealthy Government Contractor Monitors U.S. Internet Providers, Worked With Wikileaks Informant, August 1, 2010|website=Forbes|access-date=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamo was a volunteer &quot;adversary characterization&quot; analyst for Project Vigilant, a Florida-based semi-secret government contractor, which encouraged him to inform the government about the alleged WikiLeaks source.

Lamo was criticized by fellow hackers, such as those at the [[Hackers on Planet Earth]] conference in 2010, who labeled him a &quot;[[Informant|snitch]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharya, Sanjiv (July 22, 2010).

In April 2011, WikiLeaks founder [[Julian Assange]] called Lamo &quot;a very disreputable character&quot;, and said it was not right to call him a financial contributor to WikiLeaks, since Lamo's monetary support amounted to only [[United States dollar|US$]]20 on one occasion.

Lamo characterized his decision to work with the government as morally ambiguous, but objectively necessary, writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'': &quot;There were no right choices that day, only less wrong ones. It was cold, it was needful, and it was no one's to make except mine,&quot; adding to ''The Guardian''{{'}}s Ed Pilkington: &quot;There were hundreds of thousands of documents—let's drop the number to 250,000 to be conservative—and doing nothing meant gambling that each and every one would do no harm if no warning was given.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Greenwald, Lamo, and ''Wired'' magazine===
Lamo's role in the Manning case drew criticism from [[Glenn Greenwald]] of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]''. Greenwald suggested that Lamo lied to Manning by turning Manning in, and then lied after the fact to cover up the circumstances of Manning's confessions.&lt;ref name=gg&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Greenwald places the incident in the context of what he calls &quot;the Obama administration's unprecedented war on whistle-blowers&quot;.&lt;ref name=gg /&gt; Greenwald's critique of ''Wired'' has drawn a response from that magazine which suggests that Greenwald is writing disingenuously: &quot;At his most reasonable, Greenwald impugns our motives, attacks the character of our staff and carefully selects his facts and sources to misrepresent the truth and generate outrage in his readership.&quot;&lt;ref name=wiredgg&gt;{{cite news|last=Hansen|first=Evan|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/12/greenwald/|title=Putting the Record Straight on the Lamo–Manning Chat Logs &amp;#124; Threat Level|work=Wired|date=December 31, 2010|access-date=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article about the Manning case, Greenwald mentions ''Wired'' reporter [[Kevin Poulsen]]'s 1994 felony conviction for computer hacking, suggesting that &quot;over the years, Poulsen has served more or less as Lamo's personal media voice.&quot;&lt;ref name=gg /&gt; Greenwald is skeptical of an earlier story written by Poulsen about Lamo's institutionalization on psychiatric grounds, writing: &quot;Lamo claimed he was diagnosed with [[Asperger's syndrome]], a somewhat fashionable [[autism]] diagnosis which many stars in the computer world have also claimed.&quot;&lt;ref name=gg /&gt; In an article entitled &quot;The Worsening Journalistic Disgrace at Wired&quot;, Greenwald claimed that ''Wired'' was &quot;actively conceal[ing] from the public, for months on end, the key evidence [the Lamo–Manning chat logs] in a political story that has generated headlines around the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenwald|first=Glenn|url=http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/12/27/wired|title=The worsening journalistic disgrace at Wired|work=Salon|date=December 27, 2010|access-date=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of Anonymous===
Lamo had been critical of media coverage of the hacker collective [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], saying that media outlets have over-hyped and mythologized the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;IBT&quot;/&gt; He also said that Anonymous is not the &quot;invulnerable&quot; group it is claimed to be, and he can see &quot;no rational point in what they're doing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;IBT&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/344388/20120523/adrian-lamo-snitch-anonymous-bradley-manning-wikileaks.htm|title=EXCLUSIVE: Hacker Adrian Lamo Who Betrayed Wikileaks' Manning Turns Fire on Anonymous|author=Gianluca Mezzofiore|date=May 23, 2012|website=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and television==
On August 22, 2002, Lamo was removed from a segment of ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' when, after being asked to demonstrate his skills for the camera, he gained access to NBC's internal network.&lt;ref&gt;

''[[Hackers Wanted]]'', a documentary film focusing on Lamo's life as a hacker, was produced by [[Trigger Street Productions]], and narrated by [[Kevin Spacey]].&lt;ref name=film&gt;{{cite web|last=Poulsen|first=Kevin|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/05/hackers-wante/|title=Lost Hacking Documentary Surfaces on Pirate Bay &amp;#124; Threat Level|website=Wired|date=May 21, 2010|access-date=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focusing on the 2003 hacking scene, the film features interviews with [[Kevin Rose]] and [[Steve Wozniak]].&lt;ref name=film /&gt; The film has not been conventionally released.

Lamo also appeared on ''[[Good Morning America]]'', [[Fox News]], ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'', and repeatedly on [[KCRA-TV]] News as an expert on netcentric crime and incidents.

Lamo used a wide variety of supplements and drugs throughout his life. His wife, Lauren Fisher, called his drug use body hacking. One of Lamo's preferred supplements was [[Kratom]], which he used as a less-dangerous alternative to opioids.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; In 2001, he overdosed on prescription [[amphetamine]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;mpalm03&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jkahn04&quot; /&gt; After he turned in Manning, his drug use escalated, but later claimed that he was in recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/03/adrian-lamo-bradley-manning-q-and-a|title=Adrian Lamo on Bradley Manning|last1=Pilkington|first1=Ed|date=January 3, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
