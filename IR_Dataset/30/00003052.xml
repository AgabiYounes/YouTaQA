==History==
{{more citations needed section|date=November 2011}}

===Early history and settlement===
Alameda occupies what was originally a [[peninsula]] connected to Oakland. Much of it was low-lying and marshy. The higher ground nearby and adjacent parts of what is now [[downtown Oakland]] were the site of one of the largest coastal oak forests in the world. Spanish colonists called the area ''Encinal'', meaning &quot;forest of evergreen oak&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ| title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt. Print. Off. | author=Gannett, Henry | year=1905 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ/page/n118 119]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Alameda'' is Spanish for &quot;grove of poplar trees,&quot; or &quot;tree-lined avenue.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dict_en_es/spanish/alameda;_ylt=AmS17PW60RO5ki1NGlCOvxP2s8sF |title=alameda – Spanish-English Translation and Pronunciation |work=Yahoo!

The inhabitants at the time of the arrival of the Spanish in the late 18th century were a local band of the [[Ohlone]] tribe. The peninsula was included in the vast [[Rancho San Antonio (Peralta)|Rancho San Antonio]] granted in 1820 to Luis Peralta by the Spanish king who claimed California. The grant was later confirmed by the [[Mexico|Republic of Mexico]] upon its independence in 1821 from Spain.

Over time, the place became known as Bolsa de Encinal or Encinal de San Antonio.&lt;ref name=CGN&gt;{{California's Geographic Names|592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===City development===
The city was founded by European Americans on June 6, 1853, after the United States acquired California following the Mexican-American War of 1848. The town originally contained three small settlements. &quot;Alameda&quot; referred to the village at Encinal and High streets, [[Hibbardsville, Alameda, California|Hibbardsville]] was located at the North Shore ferry and shipping terminal, and [[Woodstock, Alameda, California|Woodstock]] was on the west near the ferry piers of the [[South Pacific Coast Railroad]] and the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]]. Eventually, the Central Pacific's ferry pier became the [[Alameda Mole]], featuring transit connections among the  San Francisco ferries, local trollies, and [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] (formerly Central Pacific) commuter lines.

The first post office opened in 1854.&lt;ref name=CGN /&gt; The first school, Schermerhorn School, was opened in 1855 (and eventually was renamed as Lincoln School); Encinal School was opened in 1860 (and closed in 1980). The [[San Francisco and Alameda Railroad]] opened the Encinal station in 1864.&lt;ref name=CGN /&gt; The Encinal area was also known as Fasskings Station in honor of Frederick Louis Fassking.&lt;!-- Significance? --&gt;&lt;ref name=CGN /&gt; Encinal's own post office opened in 1876, was renamed West End in 1877, and closed in 1891.&lt;ref name=CGN /&gt; The West End area was originally called Bowman's Point in honor of Charles G. Bowman, an early United States settler.&lt;ref name=CGN /&gt;

On September 6, 1869, the [[Alameda Terminal]] made history; it was the site of the arrival of the first train via the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] to reach the shores of [[San Francisco Bay]],&lt;ref name=&quot;daily alta ca&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=DAC18690907.2.6&amp;srpos=66&amp;e=01-06-1869-31-12-1869--en--20--61--txt-txIN-western+pacific-------1|title=The first through train on the Western Pacific Road|publisher=Daily Alta California 7 September 1869 — California Digital Newspaper Collection|website=cdnc.ucr.edu|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus achieving the first coast to coast transcontinental railroad in [[North America]]. The transcontinental terminus was switched to the [[Oakland Pier]] two months later, on November 8, 1869.

The borders of Alameda were made coextensive with the island in 1872, incorporating Woodstock into Alameda.&lt;ref name=CGN /&gt; In his autobiography, writer [[Mark Twain]] described Alameda as &quot;The Garden of California.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Twain|first1=Mark|title=Autobiography of Mark Twain, Volume 1: The Complete and Authoritative Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tQjH8yzrdcC&amp;pg=PA254|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-94699-6|page=254|date=2010-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neptune Beach===
In 1917, a private entertainment park called [[Neptune Beach, California|Neptune Beach]] was built in the area now known as Crab Cove. Often compared to [[Coney Island]] in Brooklyn, New York, the park was a major recreation destination in the 1920s and 1930s. The original owners, the Strehlow family, partnered with a local confectioner to create treats unique to Neptune Beach. Both the American [[snow cone]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Around Town – Alameda, CA| url=http://www.alamedamagazine.com/media/Alameda-Magazine/January-February-2005/Around-Town/| accessdate=December 6, 2007| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205022242/http://www.alamedamagazine.com/media/Alameda-Magazine/January-February-2005/Around-Town/| archive-date=December 5, 2008| url-status=dead| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[popsicle (brand)|popsicle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alameda Museum Quarterly Newsletter |url=http://www.alamedamuseum.org/Quarterly/alamedamuseumQ405.pdf |page=8 |accessdate=December 4, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229174221/https://www.alamedamuseum.org/Quarterly/alamedamuseumQ405.pdf |archivedate=February 29, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; were first sold at Neptune Beach. The [[Kewpie doll (toy)|Kewpie doll]], hand-painted and dressed in unique hand-sewn dresses, became the original prize for winning games of chance at the beach&amp;nbsp;– another Neptune Beach innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://48hills.org/sfbgarchive/2011/06/08/alameda-all-once/|title=Alameda all at once - 48 hills|last=paula|work=48 hills|access-date=2017-06-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alamedamagazine.com/Alameda-Magazine/December-2011/11-Goners/|title=11 Goners|work=Alameda Magazine|language=en|date=December 2011 |access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Strehlows owned and operated the beach on their own. They filled in a section of the bay to add an additional Olympic-size swimming pool and a roller coaster, which must have given riders a tremendous view of the bay. The ''Cottage Baths'' were available for rent.

Neptune Beach's two large outdoor pools hosted swimming races and exhibitions by such notable swimmers such as Olympian [[Johnny Weissmuller]] and [[Jack LaLanne]]. Weissmuller later starred in films as the original [[Tarzan]] character. LaLanne started a longlasting chain of health clubs and appeared on television. The park closed down in 1939 because the [[Great Depression]] left many people without much money, the completion of the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge]] changed traffic patterns, people avoided paying the admission price, and the rise of car culture gave people many more choices for recreation destinations.

Once the Bay Bridge was complete, the rail lines, which ran past the entrance to Neptune Beach on the way to the Alameda Mole and the Ferry, lost passengers in great number as people shifted to automobiles. People began using their cars to escape the city and the close suburbs like Alameda, and traveled further afield in California. More distant locations appealed to cash-rich San Francisco tourists in the postwar years. Youngsters in town became aware of ways to avoid paying the dime for admission to the park. Strong swimmers or waders could sneak in on the bay side just by swimming around the fence.

Some resort homes and buildings from the Neptune Beach era still exist in present-day Alameda. The [[Croll Building]], on the corner of Webster Street and Central Avenue, was the site of Croll's Gardens and Hotel, used as training quarters for some of the greatest fighters in boxing history from 1883 to 1914. James J. Corbett, Bob Fitzsimmons, Jim Jeffries, [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], and several other champions all stayed and trained here.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Today this preserved building has been adapted as a retail site, for Croll's Pizza and the 1400 Bar &amp; Grill Restaurant. Neptune Court, a block away on the corner of Central and McKay avenues, also is a surviving building from the resort era.

The vast majority of the Neptune Beach structures&amp;nbsp;– the hand-carved carousel from the world-famed Dentzel Company, the [[Ferris wheel]], the roller coaster, and other rides&amp;nbsp;– were auctioned off in 1940, yielding pennies on the dollar of their original cost. the city did not construct any swimming facilities or develop a local beach to replace that of Neptune Beach.

===Transportation===
[[File:Oakland 1917.jpg|thumb|upright|Map of East Bay area in 1917, showing Alameda, Oakland, and Berkeley]]
[[File:Alameda 1937.jpg|thumb|Street and transportation lines in Alameda in 1937]]
When the railroad came to town in the 1860s, Park Street developed as the major thoroughfare of the city. After the main Alameda train station was located here, residents of Old Alameda pulled up stakes and moved across town to the new downtown. The street's location was chosen by two landowners who wished to attract tenants and development to their land. They designated their mutual property line as Park Street.

The need for expanded shipping facilities and increased flow of current through the [[estuary]] led to the dredging of a tidal canal through the marshland between Oakland and Alameda. Construction started in 1874, but it was not completed until 1902, resulting in Alameda becoming an island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2013/12/18/days-gone-by-in-1902-island-city-alameda-celebrates-its-new-tidal-canal/|title=Days Gone By: In 1902, 'island city' Alameda celebrates its new tidal canal|work=San Jose Mercury News|date=December 18, 2013|last=Rego|first=Nilda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the soil from the canal dredging was used to fill in nearby marshland. The area of Alameda called Bay Farm Island is no longer an island, but is attached by fill to Oakland. In his youth, author [[Jack London]] was known to take part in oyster pirating in the highly productive [[oyster]] beds near Bay Farm Island, today long gone.

The [[Alameda Works Shipyard]] was one of the largest and best equipped shipyards in the country. Together with other industrial facilities, it became part of the defense industry buildup before and during World War II, which attracted many African-American and European-American migrants from other parts of the United States for the high-paying jobs. In the 1950s, Alameda's industrial and ship building industries thrived along the [[Oakland Estuary|Alameda Estuary]]. This was the site of operation of the world's first-ever, land-based, containerized shipping crane.

In the early 21st century, the [[Port of Oakland]], across the estuary, has become one of the largest ports on the West Coast. Its operators use shipping technologies originally experimented with in Alameda. As of March 21, 2006, Alameda is a &quot;Coast Guard City&quot;, one of seven then designated in the country. As of 2018, it is one of twenty-one within the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20060322/ai_n16140812|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202181523/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20060322/ai_n16140812/|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 2, 2010|title=After 80 years, Alameda named 'Coast Guard City'|last=Bender|first=Kristin|date=March 22, 2006|work=Oakland Tribune|publisher=BNET|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the regular trains running to the [[Alameda Mole]], Alameda was also served by local steam commuter lines of the Southern Pacific (initially, the Central Pacific). Alameda was the site of the Southern Pacific's West Alameda Shops, where all the electric trains were maintained and repaired. These were later adapted as the [[East Bay Electric Lines]]. Southern Pacific's electrified trains were not [[streetcar]]s, but full-sized railroad cars that connected to the mainland via bridges at Webster Street and Fruitvale (only the latter bridge survives today). The trains ran to both the [[Oakland Long Wharf|Oakland Mole]] and the Alameda Mole. A line that ran between the two moles was dubbed the &quot;Horseshoe Line&quot; for the shape of the route on a map. Soon after completion of the Bay Bridge, Alameda trains connected directly to San Francisco by the lower deck of the bridge. The ferries became unnecessary.

In the 1930s [[Pan American Airways]] established a [[seaplane]] port along the fill that led to the Alameda Mole. This was the original home base for the [[China Clipper]] flying boat.
In 1929, the University of California established the San Francisco Airdrome located near the current Webster Street tube as a public airport. The Bay Airdrome had its gala christening party in 1930. The airfield was a busy place, as an early home base for Coastal Air Freight, Varney Air Lines, West Coast Air Transport, Western Air Express, the transbay Air Ferries, and Boeing's Pacific Air Transport. The Airdrome was closed in 1941 when its air traffic interfered with the newly built [[Naval Air Station Alameda]] (NAS Alameda).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airfields-freeman.com/CA/Airfields_CA_Oakland.htm#sanfranbay|title=Abandoned &amp; Little-Known Airfields: Oakland Area|last=Freeman|first=Paul|date=December 27, 2009|work=[[Abandoned &amp; Little-Known Airfields]]: California|publisher=Paul Freeman|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of World War II, a vast stretch of the marshy area southwest of the Alameda Mole was filled and the NAS Alameda established. This major Naval facility included a large airfield, as well as docks for several [[aircraft carriers]]. It closed in 1997.

===1950–present===
In the late 1950s the Utah Construction Company began a landfill beyond the ''Old Sea Wall'' and created ''[[South Shore, Alameda, California|South Shore]]''.

On February 7, 1973, a USN [[Ling-Temco-Vought|Vought]] [[LTV A-7 Corsair II|A-7E Corsair II]] fighter jet on a routine training mission from [[Lemoore Naval Air Station]], suddenly caught fire, 28,000 feet over the [[San Francisco Bay]] and crashed into the Tahoe Apartments in Alameda. Eleven people, including pilot Lieutenant Robert Lee Ward died in the crash and fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Crash of Navy A-7E Corsair II – Alameda, Calif. – February 7, 1973|url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/Navy_A-7_CorsairII_crash_site.htm|website=Check-Six.com|accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kulczyk, David.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|23.0|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|10.6|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|12.3|sqmi|km2}} (53.79%) is water.

Although Alameda's nickname is &quot;The Island City&quot; (or simply &quot;the island&quot;), the current city occupies two islands as well as a small section of the mainland. Today, the city consists of the main original section, with the former [[Naval Air Station Alameda]] (NAS Alameda) at the west end of Alameda Island, [[South Shore, Alameda, California|Southshore]] along the southern side of Alameda Island, and [[Bay Farm Island]], which is part of the mainland proper. The area of the former NAS is now known as &quot;Alameda Point.&quot; The Southshore area is separated from the main part of Alameda Island by a lagoon; the north shore of the lagoon is located approximately where the original south shore of the island was. Alameda Point and Southshore are built on bay fill.

Not all of Alameda Island is part of the City of Alameda. Although nearly all of the island is in Alameda city limits, a small portion of a dump site west of the former runways at Alameda Point extends far enough into San Francisco Bay that it is over the county line and part of the [[San Francisco|City and County of San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/NASAlameda.html|title=Historic California Posts: Naval Air Station, Alameda|website=www.militarymuseum.org|accessdate=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Notice the small grey sliver on Alameda Point; it is part of San Francisco.--&gt;

[[Coast Guard Island]], a small island between Alameda Island and Oakland, is also part of Alameda and is the home of [[Integrated Support Command Alameda]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/mlcpac/iscalameda/|title=ISC Alameda Home|website=webarchive.loc.gov|accessdate=July 13, 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20011109232748/http://www.uscg.mil/mlcpac/iscalameda/|archivedate=November 9, 2001|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Naval Air Station Alameda]] (NAS) which was decommissioned in 1997, has been turned over to the City of Alameda for civilian development.

===America's Cup ===
The 33rd [[America's Cup]] Race was won by Golden Gate Yacht Club racing team BMW Oracle, founded by [[Larry Ellison]]. A possible use of the air station that was considered was to partner with San Francisco for [[34th America's Cup]].
Within 2 weeks of the [[Golden Gate Yacht Club]] winning the America's Cup,  [https://web.archive.org/web/20101010113238/http://alamedawaterfront.com/alameda-locals-and-city-start-americas-cup-campaign Alameda city council with local support] sent a unanimous letter of support to hold AC 34 in San Francisco Bay Area. In early 2011, the City Council created an ad hoc America's Cup Citizens Advisory Committee to look for ways that Alameda could draw interest from teams and potential spectators.

==Media==
Alameda's first newspaper, the ''Encinal'', appeared in the early 1850s and the paper's editor was instrumental in the movement to incorporate the city. Following the ''Encinal'', several other papers appeared along geographic lines, and the ''Daily Argus'' eventually rose to prominence. A young Alameda native, [[Joseph R. Knowland]], wrote political and historical articles for the Alameda papers. Later, Knowland owned the powerful ''[[Oakland Tribune]]''. Around 1900, the ''Daily Argus'' began to fade in importance and east and west papers ''The Times'' and ''The Star'' combined to take the leading role as the ''[[Alameda Times-Star]]'' in the 1930s. The ''Times-Star'' was sold to the [[Alameda Newspaper Group]] in the 1970s.

In 1997, the Hills Newspaper chain was bought by [[Knight Ridder]], at the time, the second-largest newspaper chain in the U.S. Following the buyout, former Hills Newspapers employees recognized the lack of a local community voice in Alameda, and again formed a new locally based newspaper, the ''Alameda Sun'', in 2001. In 2006, Knight Ridder announced its impending sale to [[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy Corp.]], a Sacramento-based publishing firm. McClatchy Corp. has put the ''Contra Costa Times'', which under the Knight Ridder reorganization included all five of the original Hills Newspapers, up for sale. The current owners of the ''Alameda Times-Star'', [[Digital First Media]], based in [[Colorado]], have announced a strong interest in buying both the ''Contra Costa Times'' chain and the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', consolidating the daily newspaper market of the East Bay, effectively under one owner. MediaNews closed the ''Times-Star'' in 2011.

The Alameda community is currently served by two weekly newspapers, the Alameda Journal, owned by the Digital First Media, and the Alameda Sun.

==Services==
===Alameda Free Library===

After two previous failures, voters in the city passed a ballot measure in 2000 authorizing a [[bond measure]] for construction of a new main library to replace the city's [[Carnegie library]], damaged during the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]]. The city also received state funds for the new main library and opened the doors to the new facility in November 2006.

There are three library locations: the '''Main Library''' in downtown Alameda and two library branches; the '''Bay Farm Island Library''' serving the Bay Farm and Harbor Bay communities and the '''West End Library''' serving the West End of Alameda.

===Alameda Hospital===
Founded in 1894, [[Alameda Hospital]] is located at Clinton Avenue and Willow Street.

===Alameda Municipal Power===
Unlike surrounding communities, Alameda has a municipal power service, [[Alameda Municipal Power]] (AMP), that delivers services directly to consumers. AMP sold the majority of its telecommunications business to [[Comcast]] in 2008 but continues to provide telecommunication service at Alameda Point.

During the [[California electricity crisis]] of 2000 and 2001, Alameda Municipal Power did not raise electricity rates, while residents in most of the state endured significant price increases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindfully.org/Energy/Alameda-Produces-Energy.htm Alameda Produces Its Own Energy Island residents sustain low rates GeorgeRaine / SF Chronicle 13jan01] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050325161330/http://www.mindfully.org/Energy/Alameda-Produces-Energy.htm |date=March 25, 2005 }} Alameda Produces Its Own Energy Island residents sustain low rates SF Chronicle, Jan 13, 2001 (archived)&lt;/ref&gt;

Webster Street in Alameda has long been the host of many arts, crafts and holiday festivals. During some of these festivals, the Chamber of Commerce along with the West Alameda Business Association (WABA) will block off a portion of Webster St. for the entertainment of festival goers. Festivals such as The Island JAM formerly known as the [http://westalamedabusiness.com/events/ Peanut Butter Jam Festival] brings a lot of local and outside visitors.

==Sister cities==
Alameda's relationships with Wuxi and Jiangyin were initiated in 2005, in part, by Stewart Chen, who then served on the City of Alameda Social Service and Human Relations board, and who went on to be elected to Alameda City Council in November, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thealamedan.org/news/students-chinese-sister-city-tour-alameda|publisher=The Alamedan|accessdate=October 3, 2013|title=Students from Chinese sister city tour Alameda|date=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wuxi, China, is a so-called friendship city, because the diplomacy organization [[Sister Cities International]] does not recognize the relationship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alameda Sun&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alamedasun.com/local-and-hometown/4020 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130929163126/http://www.alamedasun.com/local-and-hometown/4020 |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 29, 2013 |publisher=Alameda Sun |accessdate=October 1, 2013 |title=Alameda Forges Ties With Jiangyin, China }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
In September, 2013, a Tibetan rights group initiated a social media and e-mail campaign &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tibettruth.com/2013/09/25/asking-the-mayor-of-alameda-not-to-fly-chinas-flag/|title=Asking The Mayor Of Alameda Not To Fly China's Flag|last=tibettruth|date=September 25, 2013|publisher=|accessdate=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; targeting the Mayor of Alameda, complaining that City of Alameda's participation in, and association with, a flag-raising ceremony to recognize [[National Day of the People's Republic of China]] on October 1 was tantamount to endorsing the communist regime in China, its human rights abuses, and the occupation of [[Tibet]]. The City of Alameda responded that the ceremony was a function of the Alameda Sister City Association and the Alameda Wuxi Friendship Committee, not a function of the City of Alameda. The Tibetan rights group responded that on September 26, the City of Alameda Social Service and Human Relations board appointed a member, Michael Robles-Wong, as a representative to the Sister City Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.action-alameda-news.com/2013/09/27/tibetan-rights-group-takes-city-to-task-on-twitter-by-email/|publisher=Action Alameda News|accessdate=October 1, 2013|title=Tibetan Rights Group Takes City to Task on Twitter, by Email}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2013, the Tibetan rights groupsTibetTruth and Bay Area Friends of Tibet sent roughly 75 protesters to Alameda City Hall to protest the ceremony, which organizers ultimately canceled before it began. Former City of Alameda Councilmember Frank Matarrese announced the cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_24218191/alameda-protesters-force-cancellation-chinas-national-day-celebration|newspaper=Mercury News|accessdate=October 3, 2013|title=Protesters force cancellation of China's National Day celebration|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then-city councilmember Stewart Chen subsequently defended the ceremony, as a diplomatic, not political, exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alamedasun.com/sites/default/files/print-editions/Page%2008%20101013%20Oped%20reduced.pdf|publisher=Alameda Sun|accessdate=October 20, 2013|title=Chinese Culture Does Deserve Celebration}}&lt;/ref&gt;
