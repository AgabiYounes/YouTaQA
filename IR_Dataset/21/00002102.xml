The '''Arizona Cardinals''' are a professional [[American football]] franchise based in [[Phoenix metropolitan area|Phoenix, Arizona]]. They compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) [[NFC West|West division]]. The Cardinals were founded as the '''Morgan Athletic Club''' in 1898, and are the oldest continuously run professional football team in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;CardsHistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Franchise History|url=http://www.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/pdf/media-guides/ARI-Media-Guide.pdf#page=247|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|work=2019 Arizona Cardinals Media Guide|access-date=February 6, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cardinals play their home games at [[State Farm Stadium]], which opened in 2006 and is located in the northwestern suburb of [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]].

The team was established in [[History of the Chicago Cardinals|Chicago]] in 1898 as an [[amateur]] football team and joined the NFL as a charter member on September 17, 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;CardinalsHOF&quot; /&gt; Along with the [[Chicago Bears]], the club is one of two NFL charter member franchises still in  operation since the league's founding (the [[Green Bay Packers]] were an independent team until they joined the NFL a year after its creation in 1921). The club then moved to [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|St. Louis]] in {{Cardinals NFL season|1960}} and played in that city through {{Cardinals NFL season|1987}} (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Football Cardinals&quot; or the &quot;Big Red&quot; to avoid confusion with the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] of [[Major League Baseball]]). Before the {{Cardinals NFL season|1988}} season, the team moved west to [[Tempe, Arizona]], a [[college town|college suburb]] east of Phoenix, and played their home games for the next 18 seasons at [[Sun Devil Stadium]] on the campus of [[Arizona State University]]. In {{Cardinals NFL season|2006}}, the club moved to their current home field in Glendale, although the team's executive offices and training facility remain in Tempe.

The franchise has won two NFL championships, both while it was based in Chicago. The first occurred in {{Cardinals NFL season|1925}}, but is the subject of [[1925 NFL Championship controversy|controversy]], with supporters of the [[Pottsville Maroons]] believing that Pottsville should have won the title. Their second title, and the first to be won in a [[History of the National Football League championship|championship game]], came in {{Cardinals NFL season|1947}}, nearly two decades before the [[Super Bowl I|first]] [[Super Bowl]]. They returned to the title game to defend in [[1948 NFL Championship Game|1948]], but lost the rematch 7–0 in a snowstorm in Philadelphia.

Since winning the [[1947 NFL Championship Game|championship in 1947]], the team suffered many losing seasons, and currently holds [[List of NFL franchise post-season droughts|the longest active championship drought]] of North American sports at 72 consecutive seasons. In [[2012 NFL season|2012]] the Cardinals became the first NFL franchise to lose 700 games since its inception. The franchise's all-time win-loss record (including [[National Football League regular season|regular season]] and [[National Football League playoffs|playoff]] games) at the conclusion of the [[2019 NFL season|2019 season]] is {{Win-loss record|w=565|l=772|d=41}} ({{Win-loss record|w=558|l=763|d=41}} in the regular season, {{Win-loss record|w=7|l=9}} in the playoffs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All-Time Records of Current NFL Franchises|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/assets/1/6/Copy_of_W-L_-_Start_of_2017_Final(1).pdf|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|date=February 10, 2017|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been to the playoffs ten times and have won seven playoff games, three of which were victories during their run in the [[2008–09 NFL playoffs]]. During that season, they won their only [[NFC Championship Game]] since the 1970 [[AFL–NFL merger]], and reached [[Super Bowl XLIII]] (losing 27–23 to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]). The team has also won five division titles ({{Cardinals NFL season|1974}}, {{Cardinals NFL season|1975}}, {{Cardinals NFL season|2008}}, {{Cardinals NFL season|2009}} and {{Cardinals NFL season|2015}}) since their 1947–48 NFL championship game appearances. The Cardinals are the only NFL team who have never lost a playoff game at home, with a 5–0 record: the [[1947 NFL Championship Game]], two postseason victories during the aforementioned 2008–09 NFL playoffs, one during the [[2009–10 NFL playoffs|2009–10 playoffs]], and one during the [[2015–16 NFL playoffs|2015–16 playoffs]].

From 1988 to 2012 (except 2005, when they trained in [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]]), the Cardinals conducted their annual summer training camp at [[Northern Arizona University]] in [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]]. The Cardinals moved their training camp to [[State Farm Stadium]] (then known as '''University of Phoenix Stadium''') in 2013. The stadium was the site of the [[2015 Pro Bowl]], unlike in past years, where it was held at [[Aloha Stadium]] in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. The stadium also played host to Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XLII|XLII]] and [[Super Bowl XLIX|XLIX]], and will host [[Super Bowl LVII]] in 2023.

==Franchise history==
{{Main|History of the Arizona Cardinals}}

===Chicago===
{{Main|History of the Chicago Cardinals}}
{{NFL Cardinals history}}
The franchise's inception dates back to 1898, when a neighborhood group gathered to play in the [[Chicago]] [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]], calling themselves Morgan Athletic Club. Chicago painting and building contractor [[Chris O'Brien (American football)|Chris O'Brien]] acquired the team, which he relocated to [[Normal Park|Normal Field]] on Racine Avenue. The team was known as Racine Normals until 1901, when O'Brien bought used jerseys from the [[University of Chicago]]. He described the faded [[maroon]] clothing as &quot;[[Cardinal (color)|Cardinal red]]&quot; and the team became the Racine Street Cardinals. The team eventually became in 1920 a charter member of the American Professional Football Association (APFA), which two years later was rechristened to [[National Football League]] (NFL). The team entered the league as the Racine Cardinals, however the name was changed in 1922 to Chicago Cardinals to avoid confusion with the [[Racine Legion|Horlick-Racine Legion]], who entered the league the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = To the NFL: You Sure Started Somethin': A Historical Guide of All 32 NFL Teams and the Cities They've Played In|last = Griffith|first = R.D.|publisher = Dorrance Publishing|year = 2012|isbn = 978-1434916815|location = |page = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for [[1925 NFL season|1925]], when they were awarded the championship after the [[Pottsville Maroons]] were suspended, the Cardinals experienced only minimal success on the playing field during their first 26 seasons in the league. During the post-World War II years, the team reached two straight NFL finals against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], winning in [[1947 NFL Championship Game|1947]] &amp;ndash; eight months after [[Charles Bidwill]]'s death &amp;ndash; and losing the following year. After years of bad seasons and losing fans to the cross-town rivals [[Chicago Bears]], by the late 1950s the Cardinals were almost bankrupt, and owner [[Violet Bidwill Wolfner]] became interested in a relocation.

===St. Louis===
{{main|History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)}}
Due to the formation of the rival [[American Football League]], the NFL allowed Bidwill to relocate the team to [[St. Louis]], Missouri, where they became the [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|St. Louis Cardinals]] (locally, they were called the &quot;Big Red&quot;, the &quot;Gridbirds&quot; or the &quot;Football Cardinals&quot; in order to avoid confusion with the [[St. Louis Cardinals|baseball team]] of the same name).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wyche|first=Steve|title=Before coming to desert, Cards were substandard in St. Louis|url=http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/story/09000d5d80e52e28/article/before-coming-to-desert-cards-were-substandard-in-st-louis|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=SuperBowl.com|date=June 29, 2011|accessdate=June 11, 2016|quote=Having grown up in St. Louis, I was always resigned to the fact that the football Cardinals, regardless of where they were located, would never play in a Super Bowl.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Cardinals' 28-year stay in St. Louis, they advanced to the playoffs just three times (1974, 1975 &amp; 1982), never hosting or winning in any appearance. The overall mediocrity of the Cardinals, combined with a then-[[Busch Memorial Stadium|21-year-old stadium]], caused game attendance to dwindle, and owner [[Bill Bidwill]] decided to move the team to Arizona.

===Phoenix===
Not long after the [[1987 NFL season]], Bidwill agreed to move to [[Arizona]] on a handshake deal with state and local officials, and the team became the Phoenix Cardinals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eskenazi|first=Gerald|title=N.F.L. Approves Team Shift|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/16/sports/nfl-approves-team-shift.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 16, 1988|accessdate=June 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The franchise changed its geographic name from Phoenix to Arizona on March 17, 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;CardsHistory&quot; /&gt; (The franchise has never played in the city of Phoenix proper.) The [[1998 NFL season]] saw the Cardinals break two long droughts, qualifying for the playoffs for the first time in 16 years. The team got their first postseason win since [[1947 NFL Championship Game|1947]] by defeating the Dallas Cowboys 20-7 in the [[NFL playoffs, 1998-99|Wild Card Playoffs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/28/sports/pro-football-last-second-field-goal-ends-cardinals-playoff-drought.html|title=PRO FOOTBALL; Last-Second Field Goal Ends Cardinals' Playoff Drought|last=Gurnick|first=Ken|date=1998-12-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-03|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[2008 NFL season|In 2008]], the Cardinals, led by quarterback Kurt Warner, won the [[NFC Championship Game]] to advance to the [[Super Bowl]] for the first time in franchise history. They lost [[Super Bowl XLIII]] 27–23 to the [[2008 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] in the final seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arizona Cardinals Team History|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/team.aspx?franchise_id=1|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|date=August 26, 2015|accessdate=August 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After their historic 2008 season, the Cardinals posted a 10–6 record in 2009, their first season with 10 wins in Arizona. The Cardinals clinched their second consecutive [[NFC West]] title, and were defeated by eventual Super Bowl champion [[New Orleans Saints]] 45–14 in the divisional playoffs. The next time they would make the playoffs would be in [[2014 Arizona Cardinals season|2014]], when they ended up as a wild card. They set the best regular-season record in the team's history in Arizona at 11–5, but were defeated by the 7–8–1 [[NFC South]] champions [[2014 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]].

The next year, the Cardinals set a franchise-best 13–3 record, and clinched their first-ever first-round playoff bye as the NFC's second seed. They defeated the [[2015 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] 26–20 in overtime, giving quarterback [[Carson Palmer]] his first playoff victory. The Cardinals then advanced to their second [[NFC Championship Game]] in their history, but were blown out by the top-seeded 15–1 [[2015 Carolina Panthers season|Panthers]] 49–15, committing seven turnovers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wesseling|first=Chris|title=Arizona Cardinals' biggest stars fall flat in Carolina|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000627957/article/arizona-cardinals-biggest-stars-fall-flat-in-carolina|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=January 24, 2016|accessdate=August 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logos and uniforms==
[[File:NFCW-Throwback2-Uniform-ARI.PNG|thumb|left|150px|Phoenix Cardinals uniform: 1989–1995]]

[[File:Chicago cardinals.png|left|thumb|150px|Chicago Cardinals logo.]]

Starting in {{Cardinals NFL season|1947}}, the team had a logo of a [[Northern cardinal|cardinal bird]] perched on the laces of a football.

The Cardinals moved to Arizona in {{Cardinals NFL season|1988}}, and the [[flag of Arizona]] was added to the sleeves the following year. In {{Cardinals NFL season|1990}}, the team began wearing red pants with their white jerseys, as new coach [[Joe Bugel]] wanted to emulate his former employer, the [[Washington Redskins]], who at the time wore burgundy pants with their white jerseys (the Redskins later returned to their 1970s gold pants with all their jerseys).

In {{nfly|1994}}, the Cardinals participated in the NFL's 75th anniversary throwback uniform program. The jerseys were similar to those of the 1920s Chicago Cardinals, with an interlocking &quot;CC&quot; logo and three stripes on each sleeve. The uniform numbers were relocated to the right chest. The pants were khaki to simulate the color and material used in that era. The Cardinals also stripped the logos from their helmets for two games: at [[1994 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland]] and home vs. [[1994 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh]].

The Cardinal head on the helmet also appeared on the sleeve of the white jersey from 1982 to 1995. In 1996, the state flag of Arizona was moved higher on the sleeve after the Cardinal head was eliminated as sleeves on football jerseys became shorter, and black was removed as an accent color, instead replaced with a blue to match the predominant color of the state flag. In 2002, the Cardinals began to wear all-red and all-white combinations, and continued to do so through 2004, prior to the team's makeover.

In {{nfly|2005}}, the team unveiled its first major changes in a century. The cardinal-head logo was updated to look sleeker and meaner than its predecessor. Numerous fans had derisively called the previous version a &quot;[[parakeet]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cards Brush Up Bird|url=http://www.azcardinals.com/news/news_details.html?iid=2588|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=AZCardinals.com|date=January 27, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122212338/http://www.azcardinals.com/news/news_details.html?iid=2588|archive-date=November 22, 2005 |access-date=August 26, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black again became an accent color after an eight-year absence, while trim lines were added to the outside shoulders, sleeves, and sides of the jerseys and pants. Both the red and white jerseys have the option of red or white pants.&lt;ref name=&quot;AZCardinalsUnis2005&quot; /&gt;

Hoping to break a six-game losing streak, the Cardinals wore the red pants for the first time on October 29, 2006, in a game at [[Lambeau Field]] against the Green Bay Packers. The Packers won 31–14, and the Cards headed into their bye week with a 1–7 mark. Following the bye week, the Cardinals came out in an all-red combination at home against the Dallas Cowboys and lost, 27–10. Arizona did not wear the red pants for the remainder of the season and won four of their last seven games. However, the following season, in {{Cardinals NFL season|2007}}, the Cardinals again wore their red pants for their final 3 home games. They wore red pants with white jerseys in games on the road at the Cincinnati Bengals and Seattle Seahawks. They paired red pants with red jerseys, the all-red combination, for home games against the Detroit Lions, San Francisco 49ers, Cleveland Browns, and St. Louis Rams. The red pants were not worn at all in {{Cardinals NFL season|2008}}, but they were used in home games vs. Seattle, Minnesota, and St. Louis in {{Cardinals NFL season|2009}}. The red pants were paired with the white road jersey for the first time in three years during a 2010 game at Carolina, but the white jersey/red pants combination were not  used again until 2018, when they broke out the combination against the Kansas City Chiefs.

The Cardinals' first home game in Arizona, in 1988, saw them play in red jerseys. Thereafter, for the next 18 years in Arizona, the Cardinals, like a few other NFL teams in warm climates, wore their white jerseys at home during the first half of the season—forcing opponents to suffer in their darker jerseys during Arizona autumns that frequently see temperatures over 100&amp;nbsp;°F (38&amp;nbsp;°C). However, this tradition did not continue when the Cardinals moved from Sun Devil Stadium to State Farm Stadium in 2006, as early-season games (and some home games late in the season) were played with the roof closed. With the temperature inside at a comfortable 70&amp;nbsp;°F (21&amp;nbsp;°C), the team opted to wear red jerseys at home full-time. The Cardinals wore white jerseys at home for the first time at State Farm Stadium on August 29, 2008, in a preseason game against the [[Denver Broncos]].

The Cardinals wore white at home for the first time in a regular season game at State Farm Stadium against the [[Houston Texans]] on October 11, {{nfly|2009}}. In October 2009, the NFL recognized [[Breast Cancer Awareness Month]], and players wore pink-accented items, including gloves, wristbands, and shoes. The team thought the pink accents looked better with white uniforms than with red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Somers|first=Kent|title=Is white out for the Big Red?|url=http://archive.azcentral.com/members/Blog/KentSomers/66308|newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=October 29, 2009|accessdate=June 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1970 through 1983, and again in many seasons between 1989 and 2002, the Cardinals would wear white when hosting the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in order to force the Cowboys to don their &quot;jinxed&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/southwest/story/things-only-a-cowboys-fan-would-understand-070614|title=Things only a Cowboys fan would understand|last=Jul 6|first=foxsports|last2=ET|first2=2014 at 6:51p|date=2014-07-06|website=FOX Sports|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; blue jerseys. They have not done this since moving into State Farm Stadium, however.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The {{Cardinals NFL season|2010}} season saw the Cardinals debut a new, alternate black jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Urban|first=Darren|title=Cards Unveil Third Jerseys|url=https://www.azcardinals.com/news/cards-unveil-third-jerseys-2235287|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=AZCardinals.com|date=April 22, 2010|access-date=June 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to its introduction, the Cardinals were the only NFL team without an alternate jersey or throwback uniform, save for the NFL's 75th anniversary program in 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;UniWatch&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Lukas|first=Paul|title=There's No Service Like Wire Service, Vol. 6|url=http://www.uni-watch.com/2010/02/22/theres-no-service-like-wire-service-vol-6/|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=February 22, 2010|accessdate=February 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In {{Cardinals NFL season|2017}}, the Cardinals debuted an all-black set for the [[NFL Color Rush]] program. While the regular black alternates featured white lettering and are paired with white pants, the Cardinals' Color Rush alternates used red lettering and black pants for the occasion.

The Cardinals' flagship radio station is [[KMVP-FM]]; [[Dave Pasch]], [[Ron Wolfley]], and Paul Calvisi handle the radio broadcast. Spanish-language radio broadcasts are heard on the combo of [[KQMR|KQMR/KHOV-FM]] &quot;Latino Mix&quot; under a contract with [[Univisión]], signed in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediamoves.com/2015/08/univision-arizona-radio-signs-deal-with-arizona-cardinals.html Media Moves, &quot;Univision Arizona radio signs deal with Arizona Cardinals&quot;], ''Media Moves'' August 28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 2015, they were heard on [[KDVA]]/[[KVVA-FM]] &quot;José FM&quot;, as well as co-owned [[KBMB]] AM 710. The Cardinals were the first NFL team to offer all 20 preseason and regular season games on Spanish-language radio, doing so in 2000. Gabriel Trujillo and [[Rolando Cantú]] are the Spanish broadcast team. The Cardinals have the most extensive Mexican affiliate network in the NFL, with contracts with Grupo Larsa (in the state of Sonora) and [[Grupo Radiorama]] (outside Sonora) and stations in 20 cities, including [[Hermosillo]], [[Guadalajara]] and [[Mexico City]].

As of the 2017 season, NBC affiliate [[KPNX]] broadcasts the team's preseason games on television (which, that year, included the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game|Hall of Fame Game]] [[NBC Sunday Night Football|broadcast]] by NBC), called by Pasch and Wolfley, with station anchor Paul Gerke as sideline reporter. The broadcasts are syndicated regionally to [[KTTU (TV)|KTTU]] and [[KMSB-TV]] in Tucson, and [[KVVU-TV]] in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cardinals Preseason Games Will Air On NBC|url=http://www.azcardinals.com/news-and-events/article-2/Cardinals-Preseason-Games-Will-Air-On-NBC/0d8c4e6d-963e-4c27-9d3b-48a6e13f5447|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=AZCardinals.com|date=July 19, 2017|access-date=August 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720021631/http://www.azcardinals.com/news-and-events/article-2/Cardinals-Preseason-Games-Will-Air-On-NBC/0d8c4e6d-963e-4c27-9d3b-48a6e13f5447|archive-date=July 20, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cox|first=Seth|title=Arizona Cardinals preseason games to be available on NBC locally|url=https://www.revengeofthebirds.com/2017/7/19/15999582/arizona-cardinals-preseason-games-to-be-available-on-nbc-locally|website=[[SB Nation|Revenge of the Birds]]|date=July 19, 2017|accessdate=August 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
