'''Adalbert of Prague''' ({{lang-la|Sanctus Adalbertus}}, {{lang-cs|svatý Vojtěch}}, {{lang-pl|święty Wojciech}}, {{lang-hu|Szent Adalbert}}; {{circa}} 956{{snd}}23 April 997), known in Czech by his birth name '''Vojtěch''' ({{lang-la|Voitecus}}), was a Bohemian [[missionary]] and [[Christians|Christian]] [[saint]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=Alban |last2=Burns |first2=Paul |title=Butler's Lives of the Saints: April |date=1999 |publisher=A&amp;C Black |isbn=978-0-86012-253-1 |page=166 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=OaqWAEry-wkC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;lpg=PA166&amp;dq=Adalbert+of+Prague+canonization#v=onepage&amp;q=Adalbert%20of%20Prague%20canonization&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the [[Bishop of Prague]] and a [[missionary]] to the Hungarians, Poles, and Prussians, who was martyred in his efforts to convert the [[Baltic peoples|Baltic]] [[Old Prussians|Prussians]] to [[Christianity]]. He is said to be the composer of the oldest Czech hymn ''[[Hospodine, pomiluj ny]]'' and ''[[Bogurodzica]]'', the oldest known Polish hymn, but his authorship of it has not been confirmed.{{sfn|Vlasto|1970|p=123}}

St. Adalbert was later declared the [[patron saint]] of the [[Czech Republic]], [[Patron saints of Poland|Poland]] and the [[Duchy of Prussia]]. He is also the patron saint of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Esztergom-Budapest|Archdiocese of Esztergom]] in [[Hungary]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Katolikus.hu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Szent Adalbert|url=http://www.katolikus.hu/szentek/0423.html|website=Katolikus.hu|publisher=Catholic Church in Hungary|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Early Years===
Born as ''[[Vojtěch]]'' in 952{{sfn|Molnar|1978|p=12}} or ca. 956{{sfn|Vlasto|1970|p=97}} in [[Gord (Slavic settlement)|gord]] [[Libice nad Cidlinou|Libice]], he belonged to the [[Slavník dynasty|Slavnik clan]], one of the two most powerful families in Bohemia.{{sfn|Molnar|1978|p=12}} Events from his life were later recorded by a Bohemian priest [[Cosmas of Prague]] (1045–1125). Vojtěch's father was [[Slavník]] (d. 978–981), a duke ruling a province centred at Libice.{{sfn|Cosmas of Prague|2009|pp=77–78}} His mother was [[Střezislava]] (d. 985–987),{{sfn|Cosmas of Prague|2009|pp=77–78}} and according to David Kalhous belonged to the [[Přemyslid dynasty]].{{sfn|Kalhous|2015|p=10}} He had five brothers: [[Soběslav (d. 1004)|Soběslav]], Spytimír, Dobroslav, Pořej, and Čáslav.{{sfn|Cosmas of Prague|2009|p=81}} Cosmas also refers to Radim (later [[Radim Gaudentius|Gaudentius]]) as a brother;{{sfn|Cosmas of Prague|2009|pp=87, 156}} who is believed to have been a half-brother by his father's liaison with another woman. After he survived a grave illness in childhood, his parents decided to dedicate him to the service of God. Adalbert was well educated, having studied for approximately ten years (970-80) in [[Magdeburg]] under the tutelage of [[Adalbert of Magdeburg|St. Adalbert of Magdeburg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/Saint.aspx?id=1910,|title=St. Adalbert of Prague {{!}} Saint of the Day {{!}} AmericanCatholic.org|last=|first=|date=2016-03-04|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053145/http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/Saint.aspx?id=1910,|archive-date=2016-03-04|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The young Vojtěch took his tutor's name &quot;Adalbert&quot; at his [[Confirmation]].

===Episcopacy===
[[File:Socha Svateho Vojtecha a Radima.jpg|thumb|left|upright|210px|Monument to St. Adalbert and his brother Gaudentius, [[Libice nad Cidlinou]], [[Czech Republic]].]]
[[File:Adalbert Siegel Domkapitel Gnesen.png|thumb|left|upright|210px|Adalbert on a seal of the chapter of [[Gniezno Cathedral]] (Gnesen)]] 
In 981 [[Adalbert of Magdeburg|St. Adalbert of Magdeburg]] died, and his young protege Adalbert returned to [[Bohemia]]. Later Bishop [[Dětmar|Dietmar of Prague]] ordained him a [[Catholic]] [[priest]]. In 982, Bishop Dietmar died, and Adalbert, despite being under canonical age, was chosen to succeed him as [[Bishop of Prague]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Foley&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053145/http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/Saint.aspx?id=1910, Leonard Foley, OFM, &quot;St. Adalbert of Prague&quot;, ''Saint of the Day, Lives, Lessons and Feast'', revised by Pat McCloskey, OFM, Franciscan Media]&lt;/ref&gt; Amiable and somewhat worldly, he was not expected to trouble the secular powers by making excessive claims for the Church.{{sfn|Butler|2003|p=181}} Although Adalbert was from a wealthy family, he avoided comfort and luxury, and was noted for his charity and austerity. After six years of preaching and prayer, he had made little headway in evangelizing the Bohemians, who maintained deeply embedded pagan beliefs.

Adalbert opposed the participation of Christians in the [[slavery|slave]] trade and complained of [[polygamy]] and idolatry, which were common among the people. Once he started to propose reforms he was met with opposition from both the secular powers and the clergy. His family refused to support Duke [[Boleslaus II, Duke of Bohemia|Boleslaus]] in an unsuccessful war against Poland. Adalbert was no longer welcome and eventually forced into exile.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; In 988 he went to [[Rome]]. He lived as a hermit at the Benedictine [[Santi Bonifacio e Alessio|monastery of Saint Alexis]]. Five years later, Boleslaus requested that the [[Pope]] send Adalbert back to Prague, in hopes of securing his family's support. [[Pope John XV]] agreed, with the understanding that Adalbert was free to leave Prague if he continued to encounter entrenched resistance. Adalbert returned as bishop of Prague, where he was initially received with demonstrations of apparent joy. Together with a group of [[Italians|Italian]] Benedictine monks which brought with him, he founded in 14 January 993 a [[Brevnov Monastery|monastery in Břevnov]] (then situated westward from Prague, now almost in the middle of the city), the second oldest monastery on Czech territory.

In 995, the [[Slavniks]]' former rivalry with the Přemyslids, who were allied with the powerful Bohemian clan of the [[Vršovci]]s, resulted in the storming of the Slavnik town of [[Libice nad Cidlinou]], which was led by the Přemyslid [[Boleslaus II the Pious]]. During the struggle four or five of Adalbert's brothers were killed. The Zlič Principality became part of the Přemyslids' estate. Adalbert unsuccessfully attempted to protect a noblewoman caught in adultery. She had fled to a convent, where she was killed. In upholding the right of sanctuary, Bishop Adalbert responded by excommunicating the murderers. Butler suggests that the incident was orchestrated by enemies of his family.{{sfn|Butler|2003|p=181}}

After this, Adalbert could not safely stay in Bohemia and escaped from Prague. Strachkvas was eventually appointed to be his successor. However, Strachkvas suddenly died during the liturgy at which he was to accede to his episcopal office in Prague. The cause of his death is still ambiguous. The Pope directed Adalbert to resume his see, but believing that he would not be allowed back, he requested a brief as an itinerant missionary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foley&quot; /&gt;

Adalbert then traveled to [[Hungary]] and probably baptized [[Géza, Grand Prince of the Hungarians|Géza of Hungary]] and his son [[Stephen of Hungary|Stephen]] in [[Esztergom]]. Then he went to [[Poland]] where he was cordially welcomed by [[Boleslaus I of Poland|then-Duke Boleslaus I]] and installed as Bishop of [[Gniezno]].

===Mission and Martyrdom in Prussia===
[[File:Gniezno Cathedral detail 02.jpg|thumb|The execution of St. Adalbert by the pagan [[Old Prussians|Prussians]], [[Gniezno Doors]] panel]]

Adalbert again relinquished his diocese, namely that of Gniezno, and set out as a missionary to preach to the inhabitants near [[Prussia (Baltic)|Prussia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://saints.sqpn.com/book-of-saints-adalbert Monks of Ramsgate. “Adalbert”, ''Book of Saints'' (1921)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boleslaus I of Poland|Bolesław I]], Duke (and, later, King) of Poland, sent [[soldiers]] with Adalbert on his mission to the Prussians. The Bishop and his companions, including his half-brother Radim (Gaudentius), entered Prussian territory and traveled along the coast of the [[Baltic Sea]] to [[Gdańsk]].

Success attended his efforts at first, but his imperious manner in commanding the people to abandon paganism irritated them, and at the instigation of one of the pagan priests he was murdered on 23 April 997 on the Baltic Sea coast east of [[Truso]] (currently the city of [[Elbląg]]) or near Tenkitten and [[Fischhausen]]. It is recorded that his body was bought back for its weight in [[gold]] by King [[Boleslaus I of Poland]].

==Veneration and Relics==

A few years after his martyrdom, Adalbert was [[canonization|canonized]] as '''St. Adalbert of Prague.''' His life was written in ''Vita Sancti Adalberti Pragensis'' by various authors, the earliest being traced to imperial [[Aachen]] and the Bishop of [[Liège (city)|Liège]], [[Notger von Lüttich]], although it was previously assumed that the [[Rome|Roman]] monk [[John Canaparius]] wrote the first ''Vita'' in 999. Another famous biographer of St. Adalbert was [[Bruno of Querfurt|St. Bruno of Querfurt]] who wrote a hagiography of him in 1001-4.

Notably, the Přemyslid rulers of Bohemia initially refused to ransom St. Adalbert's body from the Prussians who murdered him, and therefore it was purchased by Poles. This fact may be explained by the Saint belonging to the Slavniks family which was rival to the Přemyslids. Thus St. Adalbert's bones were preserved in [[Gniezno]], which assisted [[Boleslaus I of Poland]] in increasing Polish political and diplomatic power in Europe.

According to Bohemian accounts, in 1039 the Bohemian Duke [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Břetislav I]] looted the bones of St. Adalbert from [[Gniezno]] in a raid and translated them to [[Prague]]. According to Polish accounts, however, he stole the wrong relics, namely those of [[St. Gaudentius]], while the Poles concealed St. Adalbert's relics which remain in [[Gniezno]]. In 1127 his severed head, which was not in the original purchase according to ''Roczniki Polskie'', was discovered and translated to [[Gniezno]]. In 1928, one of the arms of St. Adalbert, which Bolesław I had given to [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Otto III]] in 1000, was added to the bones preserved in Gniezno. Therefore, today St. Adalbert has two elaborate shrines in the [[Prague Cathedral]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/relics-of-bohemias-patron-saint-adalbert-find-new-resting-placeRelics of Behemia's patron saint Adalbert find new resting place]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gniezno Cathedral|Royal Cathedral of Gniezno]], each of which claims to possess his relics, but which of these bones are his authentic relics is unknown. For example, pursuant to both claims the Saint has two skulls. The one in Gniezno was stolen in 1923.

The massive bronze [[Gniezno Doors|doors]] of [[Gniezno Cathedral]], dating from around 1175, are decorated with eighteen [[relief]]s of scenes from the Saint's life. They are the only [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] ecclesiastical doors in Europe depicting a cycle illustrating the life of a saint, and therefore are a precious relic documenting Adalbert's martyrdom. We can read that door literally and theologically.  

The one thousandth anniversary of St. Adalbert's martyrdom was on 23 April 1997. It was commemorated in [[Poland]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[Russia]], and other nations. Representatives of [[Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], and [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] churches traveled on a pilgrimage to the Saint's tomb located in Gniezno. [[Pope John Paul II]] visited the cathedral and celebrated a liturgy there in which heads of seven European nations and approximately one million faithful participated.

A ten-meter cross was erected near the village of Beregovoe (formerly Tenkitten), [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], where St. Adalbert is thought to have been martyred by the Prussians.
