      <text xml:space="preserve">{{short description|Truth of a statement rests on its demonstrability, not its correspondence to an external reality}}
In [[analytic philosophy]], '''anti-realism''' is an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] position first articulated by British philosopher [[Michael Dummett]]. The term was coined as an argument against a form of [[Philosophical realism|realism]] Dummett saw as 'colorless reductionism'.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Realism (1963)|Realism (1963)]] p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

In anti-realism, the truth of a statement rests on its demonstrability through internal logic mechanisms, such as the [[context principle]] or [[intuitionistic logic]], in direct opposition to the realist notion that the truth of a statement rests on its correspondence to an external, independent reality.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Realism (1963)|Realism (1963)]] p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;  In anti-realism, this external reality is hypothetical and is not assumed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Truth (1959)|Truth (1959)]] p. 24 (postscript)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Blackburn|Blackburn, Simon]] ([2005] 2008). &quot;realism/anti-realism,&quot; ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]'', 2nd ed. revised, pp. 308–9. Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it encompasses statements containing abstract ideal objects (i.e. mathematical objects), anti-realism may apply to a wide range of philosophic topics, from [[Physical body|material objects]] to the theoretical entities of [[science]], [[mathematical object|mathematical statement]], [[The problem of other minds|mental states, events and processes]], the [[past]] and the [[future]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Realism (1963)|Realism (1963)]] pp. 147–8&lt;/ref&gt;

{{also|Philosophical skepticism}}
One kind of metaphysical anti-realism maintains a [[skepticism]] about the physical world, arguing either: 1) that nothing exists outside the mind, or 2) that we would have no access to a mind-independent reality, even if it exists.&lt;ref&gt;Karin Johannesson, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_ZPJb3iipY8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22anti-realism%22&amp;f=false God Pro Nobis: On Non-metaphysical Realism and the Philosophy of Religion]'', Peeters Publishers, 2007, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter case often takes the form of a denial of the idea that we can have 'unconceptualised' experiences (see [[Myth of the Given]]).  Conversely, most realists (specifically, [[Indirect realism|indirect realists]]) hold that perceptions or [[sense data]] are caused by mind-independent objects. But this introduces the possibility of another kind of skepticism: since our understanding of [[causality]] is that the same effect can be produced by multiple causes, there is a [[Indeterminacy (philosophy)|lack of determinacy]] about what one is really perceiving, as in the [[brain in a vat]] scenario. The main alternative to this sort of metaphysical anti-realism is [[metaphysical realism]].

On a more abstract level, [[model theory|model-theoretic]] anti-realist arguments hold that a given set of [[symbol]]s in a [[theory]] can be mapped onto any number of sets of real-world objects&amp;mdash;each set being a &quot;model&quot; of the theory—provided the relationship between the objects is the same (compare with [[symbol grounding]].)

In [[ancient Greek philosophy]], [[Problem of universals#Nominalism|nominalist (anti-realist) doctrines]] about [[universals (metaphysics)|universals]] were proposed by the [[Stoics]], especially [[Chrysippus]].&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', Routledge, 2014, pp. 84–85: &quot;[Stoics] have often been presented as the first nominalists, rejecting the existence of universal concepts altogether. ... For Chrysippus there are no universal entities, whether they be conceived as substantial [[Platonic Forms]] or in some other manner.&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iep.utm.edu/chrysipp/ Chrysippus – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[early modern philosophy]], [[Conceptualism|conceptualist]] anti-realist doctrines about universals were proposed by thinkers like [[René Descartes]], [[John Locke]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Bostock (philosopher)|David Bostock]], ''Philosophy of Mathematics: An Introduction'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2009, p. 43: &quot;All of Descartes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume supposed that mathematics is a theory of our ''ideas'', but none of them offered any argument for this conceptualist claim, and apparently took it to be uncontroversial.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Di Bella, Tad M. Schmaltz (eds.), ''The Problem of Universals in Early Modern Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2017, p. 64 &quot;there is a strong case to be made that Spinoza was a ''conceptualist'' about universals&quot; and p. 207 n. 25: &quot;Leibniz's conceptualism [is related to] the Ockhamist tradition...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In [[late modern philosophy]], anti-realist doctrines about knowledge were proposed by the [[German idealist]] [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Hegel was a proponent of what is now called [[Semantic inferentialism|inferentialism]]: he believed that the ground for the axioms and the foundation for the validity of the inferences are the right consequences and that the axioms do not explain the consequence.&lt;ref&gt;P. Stekeler-Weithofer (2016), [https://www.sozphil.uni-leipzig.de/cm/philosophie/files/2012/11/StekelerHegelsAnalyticPragmatism.pdf &quot;Hegel's Analytic Pragmatism&quot;], University of Leipzig, pp. 122–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant and Hegel held conceptualist views about universals.&lt;ref&gt;Oberst, Michael. 2015. &quot;Kant on Universals.&quot; ''History of Philosophy Quarterly'' '''32'''(4):335–352.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Sarlemijn, ''Hegel's Dialectic'', Springer, 1975, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[contemporary philosophy]], anti-realism was revived in the form of [[empirio-criticism]], [[logical positivism]], [[Semantic anti-realism (epistemology)|semantic anti-realism]] and scientific [[instrumentalism]] (see below).

=== Semantic anti-realism ===
{{main|Semantic anti-realism (epistemology)}}
The term &quot;[[Semantic anti-realism (epistemology)|anti-realism]]&quot; was introduced by [[Michael Dummett]] in his 1982 paper &quot;Realism&quot; in order to re-examine a number of classical philosophical disputes, involving such doctrines as [[nominalism]], [[Platonic realism]], [[idealism]] and [[phenomenalism]]. The novelty of Dummett's approach consisted in portraying these disputes as analogous to the dispute between [[intuitionism (philosophy of mathematics)|intuitionism]] and [[Platonism]] in the [[philosophy of mathematics]].

According to intuitionists (anti-realists with respect to mathematical objects), the [[truth]] of a mathematical statement consists in our ability to prove it. According to Platonic realists, the truth of a statement is proven in its correspondence to [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] reality. Thus, intuitionists are ready to accept a statement of the form &quot;P or Q&quot; as true [[Disjunction and existence properties|only if we can prove P or if we can prove Q.]] In particular, we cannot in general claim that &quot;P or not P&quot; is true (the [[law of excluded middle]]), since in some cases [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|we may not be able to prove the statement &quot;P&quot; nor prove the statement &quot;not P&quot;]]. Similarly, intuitionists object to the [[existence property]] for classical logic, where one can prove &lt;math&gt;\exists x.\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;, without being able to produce any term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; of which &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; holds.

Dummett argues that this notion of truth lies at the bottom of various classical forms of anti-realism, and uses it to re-interpret [[phenomenalism]], claiming that it need not take the form of [[reductionism]].

Dummett's writings on anti-realism draw heavily on the later writings of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], concerning meaning and rule following, and can be seen as an attempt to integrate central ideas from the ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' into the constructive tradition of [[analytic philosophy]] deriving from [[Gottlob Frege]].

===Scientific anti-realism&lt;!--'Scientific anti-realism' and 'Scientific antirealism' redirect here--&gt;===
{{also|Semantic anti-realism (philosophy of science)}}
In [[philosophy of science]], anti-realism applies chiefly to claims about the non-reality of &quot;unobservable&quot; entities such as [[electron]]s or [[gene]]s, which are not detectable with human senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social Construction Of What?|last=Hacking|first=Ian|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophy of Science: A Very Short Introduction|last=Okasha|first=Samir|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One prominent variety of '''scientific anti-realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is [[instrumentalism]], which takes a purely agnostic view towards the existence of unobservable entities, in which the unobservable entity X serves as an instrument to aid in the success of theory Y and does not require proof for the existence or non-existence of X.

Some scientific anti-realists, however, deny that unobservables exist, even as non-truth conditioned instruments.

=== Moral anti-realism ===
In the [[Ethics|philosophy of ethics]], moral anti-realism (or moral irrealism) is a [[Meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] doctrine that there are no objective [[Morality|moral values]]. It is usually defined in opposition to [[moral realism]], which holds that there are objective moral values, which any moral claim are either true or false.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_moral_anti-realism.html|title=Moral Anti-Realism - By Branch / Doctrine - The Basics of Philosophy|website=www.philosophybasics.com|access-date=2019-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of anti-realist moral theories might be:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Joyce|first=Richard|title=Moral Anti-Realism|date=2016|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/moral-anti-realism/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2019-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;{{div col}}

{{div end}}

===Mathematical anti-realism===
{{main|Mathematical anti-realism}}
{{also|Post rem structuralism}}
In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], realism is the claim that mathematical entities such as 'number' have an observer-independent existence. [[Mathematical empiricism|Empiricism]], which associates numbers with concrete physical objects, and [[Mathematical Platonism|Platonism]], in which numbers are abstract, non-physical entities, are the preeminent forms of mathematical realism.

The &quot;[[epistemic]] argument&quot; against Platonism has been made by [[Paul Benacerraf]] and [[Hartry Field]]. Platonism posits that mathematical objects are ''[[abstract object|abstract]]'' entities. By general agreement, abstract entities cannot interact [[causal]]ly with physical entities (&quot;the truth-values of our mathematical assertions depend on facts involving platonic entities that reside in a realm outside of space-time&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Field, Hartry, 1989, ''Realism, Mathematics, and Modality'', Oxford: Blackwell, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;) Whilst our knowledge of physical objects is based on our ability to [[perception|perceive]] them, and therefore to causally interact with them, there is no parallel account of how mathematicians come to have knowledge of abstract objects.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Since abstract objects are outside the nexus of causes and effects, and thus perceptually inaccessible, they cannot be known through their effects on us&quot; — [[Jerrold Katz]], ''Realistic Rationalism'', 2000, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.philosophynow.org/issue81/ |title=Philosophy Now: &quot;Mathematical Knowledge: A dilemma&quot; |access-date=2011-02-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207095054/http://philosophynow.org/issue81 |archive-date=2011-02-07 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism-mathematics/#EpiAcc Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Field developed his views into [[Mathematical fictionalism|fictionalism]]. Benacerraf also developed the philosophy of [[mathematical structuralism]], according to which there are no mathematical objects. Nonetheless, some versions of structuralism are compatible with some versions of realism.

====Counterarguments&lt;!--'Realistic rationalism' redirects here--&gt;====
Anti-realist arguments hinge on the idea that a satisfactory, [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] account of thought processes can be given for mathematical reasoning. One line of defense is to maintain that this is false, so that mathematical reasoning uses some special [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] that involves contact with the [[Platonic realm]], as in the argument given by [[Sir Roger Penrose]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?TheEmperorsNewMind Review of] [[The Emperor's New Mind]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another line of defense is to maintain that abstract objects are relevant to mathematical reasoning in a way that is non causal, and not analogous to perception. This argument is developed by [[Jerrold Katz]] in his 2000 book ''Realistic Rationalism''. In this book, he put forward a position called '''realistic rationalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, which combines metaphysical realism and [[rationalism]].

A more radical defense is to deny the separation of physical world and the platonic world, i.e. the [[mathematical universe hypothesis]] (a variety of [[mathematicism]]). In that case, a mathematician's knowledge of mathematics is one mathematical object making contact with another.
