The first African slaves arrived via [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]] to the [[San Miguel de Gualdape]] colony (most likely located in the [[Winyah Bay]] area of present-day [[South Carolina]]), founded by Spanish explorer [[Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón]] in 1526.&lt;ref name=wright&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robert Wright|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Robert Wright|year=1941|title=Negro Companions of the Spanish Explorers|journal=Phylon|volume=2|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ill-fated colony was almost immediately disrupted by a fight over leadership, during which the slaves revolted and fled the colony to seek refuge among local [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. De Ayllón and many of the colonists died shortly afterwards of an epidemic and the colony was abandoned. The settlers and the slaves who had not escaped returned to [[Haiti]], whence they had come.&lt;ref name=wright/&gt;

An indentured servant (who could be white or black) would work for several years (usually four to seven) without wages. The status of indentured servants in early Virginia and Maryland was similar to slavery. Servants could be bought, sold, or leased and they could be physically beaten for disobedience or running away. Unlike slaves, they were freed after their term of service expired or was bought out, their children did not inherit their status, and on their release from contract they received &quot;a year's provision of corn, double apparel, tools necessary&quot;, and a small cash payment called &quot;freedom dues&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Tim |last=Hashaw |title=The First Black Americans |url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070121/29african.htm |magazine=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |date=January 21, 2007 |accessdate=February 13, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202205901/https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070121/29african.htm |archivedate=February 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1640s and 1650s, several African families owned farms around Jamestown and some became wealthy by colonial standards and purchased indentured servants of their own. In 1640, the Virginia General Court recorded the earliest documentation of lifetime slavery when they sentenced [[John Punch (slave)|John Punch]], a Negro, to lifetime servitude under his master Hugh Gwyn for running away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=White Over Black: American attitudes Toward the Negro, 1550–1812|first=Winthrop|last=Jordan|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=1968|isbn=978-0807871416}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In the Matter of Color: Race and the American Legal Process: The Colonial Period|first=A.

In the [[Spanish Florida]] some Spanish married or had unions with Pensacola, Creek or [[List of ethnic groups of Africa|African]] women, both slave and free, and their descendants created a mixed-race population of [[mestizo]]s and [[mulatto]]s. The Spanish encouraged slaves from the southern British colonies to come to Florida as a refuge, promising freedom in exchange for conversion to [[Catholicism]]. King [[Charles II of Spain]] issued a royal proclamation freeing all slaves who fled to Spanish Florida and accepted conversion and baptism. Most went to the area around [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], but escaped slaves also reached Pensacola. St. Augustine had mustered an all-black militia unit defending Spain as early as 1683.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nps.gov/articles/sanctuary-in-the-spanish-empire.htm|title=Sanctuary in the Spanish Empire: An African American officer earns freedom in Florida|author=Gene Allen Smith, Texas Christian University|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popular conception of a race-based slave system did not fully develop until the 18th century. The [[Dutch West India Company]] introduced slavery in 1625 with the importation of eleven black slaves into [[New Amsterdam]] (present-day New York City). All the colony's slaves, however, were freed upon its surrender to the British.&lt;ref name=&quot;branchandroot&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Hodges|first=Russel Graham|title=Root and Branch: African Americans in New York and East Jersey, 1613–1863|place=Chapel Hill, North Carolina |publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=1999|edition=|url=|id=|isbn=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Massachusetts]] was the first British colony to legally recognize slavery in 1641. In 1662, Virginia passed a law that children of enslaved women (who were of African descent and thus foreigners) took the status of the mother, rather than that of the father, as under English common law. This principle was called ''[[partus sequitur ventrum]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Banks&quot;&gt;[https://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/fac_pubs/52/ Taunya Lovell Banks, &quot;Dangerous Woman: Elizabeth Key's Freedom Suit – Subjecthood and Racialized Identity in Seventeenth Century Colonial Virginia&quot;], 41 ''Akron Law Review'' 799 (2008), Digital Commons Law, University of Maryland Law School, accessed April 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PBS.

In the [[Spanish Louisiana]] although there was no movement toward abolition of the African slave trade, Spanish rule introduced a new law called ''coartación'', which allowed slaves to buy their freedom, and that of others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/693820/Early_Anti-Slavery_Sentiment_in_the_Spanish_Atlantic_World_1765_1817]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Berquist, Emily.

During the 1790s, Governor [[Francisco Luis Héctor de Carondelet|Francisco Luis Héctor, baron of Carondelet]] reinforced local fortifications and recruit even more free blackmen for the militia. Carondelet doubled the number of free blackmen who served, creating two more militia companies—one made up of black members and the other of [[pardo]] (mixed race). Serving in the militia brought free blackmen one step closer to equality with whites, allowing them, for example, the right to carry arms and boosting their earning power. However actually these privileges distanced free blackmen from enslaved blacks and encouraged them to identify with whites.&lt;ref name=&quot;louisiana&quot;/&gt;

Slavery had been tacitly enshrined in the [[U.S. Constitution]] through provisions such as Article I, Section 2, Clause 3, commonly known as the  [[3/5 compromise]]. Slavery, which by then meant almost exclusively African Americans, was the most important political issue in the [[antebellum United States]], leading to one crisis after another. Among these were the [[Missouri Compromise]], the [[Compromise of 1850]], the [[Fugitive Slave Act]], and the [[Dred Scott decision]].

The slaves not only constituted a large investment, they produced America's most valuable product and export: [[King Cotton|cotton]]. They not only helped build the [[U.S. Capitol]], they built the [[White House]] and other [[District of Columbia]] buildings. ([[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] was a slave trading center.)&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://emancipation.dc.gov/page/ending-slavery-district-columbia Ending slavery in the District of Columbia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119044541/https://emancipation.dc.gov/page/ending-slavery-district-columbia |date=November 19, 2018 }}&quot;, consulted June 20, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar building projects existed in slaveholding states.

Slavery in Union-held Confederate territory continued, at least on paper, until the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;[https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=013/llsl013.db&amp;recNum=803 Seward certificate] proclaiming the Thirteenth Amendment to have been adopted as part of the Constitution as of December 6, 1865.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the Civil War, only white men of property could vote, and the [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] limited U.S. citizenship to whites only.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schultz&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sato&quot;/&gt;  The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] (1868) gave African-Americans citizenship, and the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendment]] (1870) gave African-American males the right to vote (only males could vote in the U.S. at the time).

===Reconstruction Era and Jim Crow===
{{Main|Reconstruction Era|Jim Crow laws}}

African Americans quickly set up congregations for themselves, as well as schools and community/civic associations, to have space away from white control or oversight. While the post-war Reconstruction era was initially a time of progress for African Americans, that period ended in 1876. By the late 1890s, Southern states enacted Jim Crow laws to enforce [[racial segregation]] and [[disfranchisement after the American Civil War|disenfranchisement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creating Jim Crow: In-Depth Essay |last=Davis |first=Ronald L.F., PhD |website=The History of Jim Crow |publisher=[[New York Life Insurance Company]] |accessdate=June 7, 2007 |url=https://www.jimcrowhistory.org/history/creating2.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020614223755/https://jimcrowhistory.org/history/creating2.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 14, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Segregation, which began with slavery, continued with Jim Crow laws, with signs used to show blacks where they could legally walk, talk, drink, rest, or eat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leon Litwack 2004&quot;&gt;Leon Litwack, ''Jim Crow Blues'', Magazine of History (OAH Publications, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; For those places that were racially mixed, non whites had to wait until all white customers were dealt with.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leon Litwack 2004&quot;/&gt; Most African Americans obeyed the Jim Crow laws, in order to avoid [[ethnic violence|racially motivated violence]].

In the last decade of the 19th century, racially discriminatory laws and racial violence aimed at African Americans began to mushroom in the United States, a period often referred to as the &quot;[[nadir of American race relations]]&quot;.  These discriminatory acts included [[racial segregation]]—upheld by the United States Supreme Court decision in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' in 1896—which was legally mandated by southern states and nationwide at the local level of government, voter suppression or disenfranchisement in the southern states, denial of economic opportunity or resources nationwide, and private acts of violence and mass racial violence aimed at African Americans unhindered or encouraged by government authorities.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Plessy v.

Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Red Summer]] of 1919 was marked by hundreds of deaths and higher casualties across the U.S. as a result of race riots that occurred in more than three dozen cities, such as the [[Chicago race riot of 1919]] and the [[Omaha race riot of 1919]]. Overall, blacks in Northern and Western cities experienced [[Racism in the United States|systemic discrimination]] in a plethora of aspects of life. Within employment, economic opportunities for blacks were routed to the lowest-status and restrictive in potential mobility. Within the housing market, stronger discriminatory measures were used in correlation to the influx, resulting in a mix of &quot;targeted violence, restrictive covenants, [[redlining]] and racial steering&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tolnay|first=Stewart|title=The African American 'Great Migration' and Beyond|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|year=2003|volume=29|pages=218–221|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100009|jstor=30036966}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many whites defended their space with violence, intimidation, or legal tactics toward African Americans, many other whites migrated to more racially homogeneous suburban or exurban regions, a process known as [[white flight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seligman|first=Amanda|title=Block by block : neighborhoods and public policy on Chicago's West Side|year=2005|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-74663-0|pages=213–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite discrimination, drawing cards for leaving the hopelessness in the South were the growth of African American institutions and communities in Northern cities.  Institutions included black oriented organizations (e.g., [[Urban League]], [[NAACP]]), churches, businesses, and newspapers, as well as successes in the development in African American intellectual culture, music, and popular culture (e.g., [[Harlem Renaissance]], [[Chicago Black Renaissance]]).  Black Americans also found a new ground for political power in Northern cities, without the enforced disabilities of [[Jim Crow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tolnay|first=Stewart|title=The African American 'Great Migration' and Beyond|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|year=2003|volume=29|pages=217 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100009|jstor=30036966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Wilkerson |first=Isabel |date=September 2016 |title=The Long-Lasting Legacy of the Great Migration |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/long-lasting-legacy-great-migration-180960118/ |magazine=Smithsonian Magazine|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1950s, the [[civil rights movement]] was gaining momentum. A 1955 lynching that sparked public outrage about injustice was that of [[Emmett Till]], a 14-year-old boy from Chicago. Spending the summer with relatives in [[Money, Mississippi]], Till was killed for allegedly having [[wolf-whistle]]d at a white woman. Till had been badly beaten, one of his eyes was gouged out, and he was shot in the head.

The [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] and the conditions which brought it into being are credited with putting pressure on Presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Johnson put his support behind passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] that banned discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and [[Trade union|labor unions]], and the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965, which expanded federal authority over states to ensure black political participation through protection of voter registration and elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/intro/intro_b.php|title=History of Federal Voting Rights Laws: The Voting Rights Act of 1965|publisher=United States Department of Justice|accessdate=August 12, 2017|date=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1966, the emergence of the [[Black Power]] movement, which lasted from 1966 to 1975, expanded upon the aims of the civil rights movement to include economic and political self-sufficiency, and freedom from white authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;abbeville&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abbeville.com/civilrights/washington.asp |title=The March On Washington, 1963 |accessdate=October 22, 2007 |publisher=Abbeville Press |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012121716/https://abbeville.com/civilrights/washington.asp |archivedate=October 12, 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the postwar period, many African Americans continued to be economically disadvantaged relative to other Americans. Average black income stood at 54 percent of that of white workers in 1947, and 55 percent in 1962. In 1959, median family income for whites was $5,600, compared with $2,900 for nonwhite families. In 1965, 43 percent of all black families fell into the poverty bracket, earning under $3,000 a year. The Sixties saw improvements in the social and economic conditions of many black Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;The Unfinished Journey: America Since World War II by William H. Chafe&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1965 to 1969, black family income rose from 54 to 60 percent of white family income. In 1968, 23 percent of black families earned under $3,000 a year, compared with 41 percent in 1960. In 1965, 19 percent of black Americans had incomes equal to the national median, a proportion that rose to 27 percent by 1967. In 1960, the median level of education for blacks had been 10.8 years, and by the late Sixties the figure rose to 12.2 years, half a year behind the median for whites.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

In 1790, when the first [[United States Census|U.S. Census]] was taken, Africans (including slaves and free people) numbered about 760,000—about 19.3% of the population. In 1860, at the start of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the African-American population had increased to 4.4 million, but the percentage rate dropped to 14% of the overall population of the country. The vast majority were slaves, with only 488,000 counted as &quot;[[Freedman|freemen]]&quot;. By 1900, the black population had doubled and reached 8.8 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/wepeople/we-1.pdf|title= We the Americans: Blacks|website= US Bureau of Census|accessdate= 3 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, about 90% of African Americans lived in the South. Large numbers began migrating north looking for better job opportunities and living conditions, and to escape [[Jim Crow laws]] and racial violence. The [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], as it was called, spanned the 1890s to the 1970s. From 1916 through the 1960s, more than 6 million [[black people]] moved north. But in the 1970s and 1980s, [[New Great Migration|that trend reversed]], with more African Americans moving south to the [[Sun Belt]] than leaving it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=|first1=|title=Time: Almanac 2005|publisher=Time Incorporated Home Entertainment|page=[https://archive.org/details/timealmanac2006w00brun/page/377 377]|url=https://archive.org/details/timealmanac2006w00brun|url-access=registration|date=December 7, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1990, the African-American population reached about 30 million and represented 12% of the U.S. population, roughly the same proportion as in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/aap/timelin2.html|title=Time Line of African American History, 1881–1900|publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov|date=|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the [[United States Census 2000|2000 Census]], 54.8% of African Americans lived in the [[Southern United States|South]]. In that year, 17.6% of African Americans lived in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and 18.7% in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], while only 8.9% lived in the [[Western United States|western]] states. The west does have a sizable black population in certain areas, however. California, the nation's most populous state, has the fifth largest African-American population, only behind New York, Texas, Georgia, and Florida. According to the 2000 Census, approximately 2.05% of [[Black Hispanic and Latino Americans|African Americans identified as Hispanic or Latino in origin]],&lt;ref name=&quot;tthqvu&quot;/&gt; many of whom may be of [[Afro-Brazilian|Brazilian]], [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]], [[Dominican American|Dominican]], [[Afro-Cuban|Cuban]], [[Haitian Americans|Haitian]], or other [[Afro-Latin American|Latin American]] descent. The only self-reported ''ancestral'' groups larger than African Americans are the [[Irish American|Irish]] and [[German Americans|Germans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/c2kbr-35.pdf|title=c2kbr01-2.qxd|accessdate=January 20, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040920132346/https://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/c2kbr-35.pdf|archivedate=September 20, 2004|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. Census]], nearly 3% of people who self-identified as black had recent ancestors who immigrated from another country. Self-reported [[West Indian American|non-Hispanic black immigrants from the Caribbean]], mostly from Jamaica and Haiti, represented 0.9% of the U.S. population, at 2.6 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;factfinder2.census.gov&quot;&gt;[https://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_B04003&amp;prodType=table &quot;Total Ancestry Reported&quot;], American FactFinder.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-reported black immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa also represented 0.9%, at about 2.8 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;factfinder2.census.gov&quot;/&gt; Additionally, self-identified [[Black Hispanic and Latino Americans|Black Hispanics]] represented 0.4% of the United States population, at about 1.2 million people, largely found within the Puerto Rican and Dominican communities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-04.pdf &quot;The Hispanic Population: 2010&quot;], 2010 Census Briefs. US Census Bureau, May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-reported black immigrants hailing from other countries in the Americas, such as Brazil and Canada, as well as several European countries, represented less than 0.1% of the population. Mixed-Race Hispanic and non-Hispanic Americans who identified as being part black, represented 0.9% of the population. Of the 12.6% of United States residents who identified as black, around 10.3% were &quot;native black American&quot; or ethnic African Americans, who are direct descendants of West/Central Africans brought to the U.S. as slaves. These individuals make up well over 80% of all blacks in the country. When including [[Multiracial American|people of mixed-race origin]], about 13.5% of the U.S. population self-identified as black or &quot;mixed with black&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_DP05&amp;prodType=table|title=American FactFinder – Results|first=U.S. Census|last=Bureau|website=factfinder2.census.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the U.S. census bureau, evidence from the 2000 Census indicates that many African and Caribbean immigrant ethnic groups do not identify as &quot;Black, African Am., or Negro&quot;. Instead, they wrote in their own respective ethnic groups in the &quot;Some Other Race&quot; write-in entry. As a result, the census bureau devised a new, separate &quot;African American&quot; ethnic group category in 2010 for ethnic African Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tcpms&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 CENSUS PLANNING MEMORANDA SERIES|url=https://www.census.gov/2010census/pdf/2010_Census_Race_HO_AQE.pdf|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 100 years of African-Americans leaving the south in large numbers seeking better opportunities and treatment in the west and north, a movement known as the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], there is now a reverse trend, called the [[New Great Migration]]. As with the earlier Great Migration, the New Great Migration is primarily directed toward cities and large urban areas, such as [[Atlanta]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[Houston]], [[Dallas]], [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], [[Tampa]], [[San Antonio]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Nashville]], [[Jacksonville]], and so forth.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;Greg Toppo and Paul Overberg, [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/02/02/census-great-migration-reversal/21818127/ &quot;After nearly 100 years, Great Migration begins reversal&quot;], ''USA Today'', 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A growing percentage of African-Americans from the west and north are migrating to the southern region of the U.S. for economic and cultural reasons.  New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles have the highest decline in African Americans, while Atlanta, [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], and [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] have the highest increase respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt;

Among cities of 100,000 or more, [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] had the highest percentage of black residents of any U.S. city in 2010, with 82%. Other large cities with African-American majorities include [[Jackson, Mississippi]] (79.4%), [[Miami Gardens, Florida]] (76.3%), [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]] (63%), [[Birmingham, Alabama]] (62.5%), [[Memphis, Tennessee]] (61%), [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]] (60%),  [[Montgomery, Alabama]] (56.6%), [[Flint, Michigan]] (56.6%), [[Savannah, Georgia]] (55.0%), [[Augusta, Georgia]] (54.7%), [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]] (54%, see [[African Americans in Atlanta]]), [[Cleveland, Ohio]] (53.3%), [[Newark, New Jersey]] (52.35%), [[Washington, D.C.]] (50.7%), [[Richmond, Virginia]] (50.6%), [[Mobile, Alabama]] (50.6%), [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] (50.4%), and [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] (50.4%).

However, since then, a trend towards re-segregation affected communities across the country: by 2011, 2.9 million African-American students were in such overwhelmingly minority schools, including 53% of Black students in school districts that were formerly under desegregation orders.&lt;ref&gt;Kozol, J.

As late as 1947, about one third of African Americans over 65 were considered to lack the literacy to read and write their own names. By 1969, [[illiteracy]] as it had been traditionally defined, had been largely eradicated among younger African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Public Information Office, [[U.S. Census Bureau]].

U.S. Census surveys showed that by 1998, 89 percent of African Americans aged 25 to 29 had completed a high-school education, less than whites or Asians, but more than Hispanics. On many college entrance, standardized tests and grades, African Americans have historically lagged behind whites, but some studies suggest that the [[Achievement gap in the United States|achievement gap]] has been closing. Many policy makers have proposed that this gap can and will be eliminated through policies such as [[affirmative action]], desegregation, and multiculturalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.closingtheachievementgap.org/cs/ctag/print/htdocs/home.htm|title=California|publisher=Closing the Achievement Gap|date=January 22, 2008|accessdate=April 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428123215/http://www.closingtheachievementgap.org/cs/ctag/print/htdocs/home.htm|archive-date=April 28, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the median income of African-American families was $33,255 compared to $53,356 of European Americans. In times of economic hardship for the nation, African Americans suffer disproportionately from job loss and [[underemployment]], with the black underclass being hardest hit.

Many African Americans were excluded from electoral politics in the decades following the end of Reconstruction. For those that could participate, until the [[New Deal]], African Americans were supporters of the Republican Party because it was Republican President Abraham Lincoln who helped in granting freedom to American slaves; at the time, the Republicans and Democrats represented the [[Sectionalism|sectional]] interests of the [[Northern United States|North]] and [[Southern United States|South]], respectively, rather than any specific ideology, and both [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] were represented equally in both parties.

The African-American trend of voting for Democrats can be traced back to the 1930s during the [[Great Depression]], when [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] program provided economic relief to African Americans. Roosevelt's [[New Deal coalition]] turned the Democratic Party into an organization of the working class and their liberal allies, regardless of region. The African-American vote became even more solidly Democratic when Democratic presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] pushed for civil rights legislation during the 1960s. In 1960, nearly a third of African Americans voted for Republican [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Clifford Green|author2=Daniel J.

Recent surveys of African Americans using a genetic testing service have found varied ancestries which show different tendencies by region and sex of ancestors. These studies found that on average, African Americans have 73.2–82.1% [[West African people|West African]], 16.7%–24% [[Europe]]an, and 0.8–1.2% [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] genetic ancestry, with large variation between individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bryc2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bryc 2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Katarzyna Bryc |author2=Eric Y.

According to a genome-wide study by Bryc et al. (2009), the mixed ancestry of African Americans in varying ratios came about as the result of sexual contact between West/Central Africans (more frequently females) and Europeans (more frequently males). Consequently, the 365 African Americans in their sample have a genome-wide average of 78.1% West African ancestry and 18.5% European ancestry, with large variation among individuals (ranging from 99% to 1% West African ancestry). The West African ancestral component in African Americans is most similar to that in present-day speakers from the non-[[Bantu languages|Bantu]] branches of the [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] (Niger-Kordofanian) family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bryc2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Katarzyna Bryc |author2=Adam Auton |author3=Matthew R.

Correspondingly, Montinaro et al. (2014) observed that around 50% of the overall ancestry of African Americans traces back to the Niger-Congo-speaking [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] of southwestern [[Nigeria]] and southern [[Benin]], reflecting the centrality of this West African region in the Atlantic Slave Trade. The next most frequent ancestral component found among African Americans was derived from [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], in keeping with historical records. It constitutes a little over 10% of their overall ancestry, and is most similar to the Northwest European ancestral component also carried by [[Barbadians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Montinaro2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Francesco Montinaro |author2=George B.J.

Altogether, genetic studies suggest that African Americans are a multiracial people. According to DNA analysis led in 2006 by [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]] geneticist [[Mark D. Shriver]], around 58 percent of African Americans have at least 12.5% European ancestry (equivalent to one European great-grandparent and his/her forebears), 19.6 percent of African Americans have at least 25% European ancestry (equivalent to one European grandparent and his/her forebears), and 1 percent of African Americans have at least 50% European ancestry (equivalent to one European parent and his/her forebears).&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry Louis Gates Jr.: Michelle's Great-Great-Great-Granddaddy—and Yours|url=https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/118292|author=Henry Louis Gates Jr.|date=November 8, 2009|accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Shriver, around 5 percent of African Americans also have at least 12.5% Native American ancestry (equivalent to one Native American great-grandparent and his/her forebears).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Henry Louis Gates, Jr. Reader|author=Henry Louis Gates, Jr.|publisher=Basci Civitas Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=5 Things to Know About Blacks and Native Americans|url=https://www.ebony.com/life/5-things-to-know-about-blacks-and-native-americans-119#axzz3WyEqX3XZ|date=November 20, 2012|accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that Native American ancestry among people who identify as African American is a result of relationships that occurred soon after slave ships arrived in the American colonies, and European ancestry is of more recent origin, often from the decades before the Civil War.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnana1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zimmer |first1=Carl |title=Tales of African-American History Found in DNA |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/28/science/african-american-dna.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=May 10, 2019 |date=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Y-DNA===
Africans bearing the [[Haplogroup E-V38|E-V38]] (E1b1a) likely traversed across the [[Sahara]], from [[East Africa|east]] to [[West Africa|west]], approximately 19,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shrine&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shrine |first1=Daniel |last2=Rotimi |first2=Charles |title=Whole-Genome-Sequence-Based Haplotypes Reveal Single Origin of the Sickle Allele during the Holocene Wet Phase |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=102 |issue=4 |pages=547–556 |publisher=Am J Hum Genet|pmc=5985360 |year=2018 |pmid=29526279 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.02.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haplogroup E-M2|E-M2]] (E1b1a1) likely originated in [[West Africa]] or [[Central Africa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Trombetta&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Trombetta |first1=Beniamino |title=Phylogeographic Refinement and Large Scale Genotyping of Human Y Chromosome Haplogroup E Provide New Insights into the Dispersal of Early Pastoralists in the African Continent |journal=Genome Biology and Evolution |volume=7 |issue=7 |pages=1940–1950 |publisher=Genome Biol Evol|pmc=4524485 |year=2015 |pmid=26108492 |doi=10.1093/gbe/evv118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[Y chromosome|Y-DNA]] study by Sims et al. (2007), the majority (≈60%) of African Americans belong to various subclades of the [[Haplogroup E-M2|E-M2]] (E1b1a1, formerly E3a) paternal haplogroup. This is the most common genetic paternal lineage found today among West/Central African males, and is also a signature of the historical [[Bantu migration]]s. The next most frequent Y-DNA haplogroup observed among African Americans is the [[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)|R1b]] clade, which around 15% of African Americans carry. This lineage is most common today among Northwestern European males. The remaining African Americans mainly belong to the paternal [[Haplogroup I-M170|haplogroup I]] (≈7%), which is also frequent in Northwestern Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sims2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lynn M.

===mtDNA===
According to an [[Mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]] study by Salas et al. (2005), the maternal lineages of African Americans are most similar to haplogroups that are today especially common in West Africa (&gt;55%), followed closely by West-Central Africa and Southwestern Africa (&lt;41%). The characteristic West African haplogroups [[Haplogroup L1 (mtDNA)|L1b]], [[Haplogroup L2 (mtDNA)|L2b,c,d]], and [[Haplogroup L3 (mtDNA)|L3b,d]] and West-Central African haplogroups [[Haplogroup L1 (mtDNA)|L1c]] and [[Haplogroup L3 (mtDNA)|L3e]] in particular occur at high frequencies among African Americans. As with the paternal DNA of African Americans, contributions from other parts of the continent to their maternal gene pool are insignificant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salas2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Antonio Salas |author2=Ángel Carracedo |author3=Martin Richards |author4=Vincent Macaulay |title=Charting the Ancestry of African Americans|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|date=October 2005|volume=77|issue=4|pages=676–680|doi=10.1086/491675|pmc=1275617|pmid=16175514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African Americans have a long and diverse history of [[African-American Businesses|business ownership]]. Although the first [[African-American Businesses|African-American business]] is unknown, slaves captured from West Africa are believed to have established commercial enterprises as peddlers and skilled craftspeople as far back as the 17th century. Around 1900, Booker T. Washington became the most famous proponent of African-American businesses. His critic and rival W. E. B. DuBois also commended business as a vehicle for African-American advancement.&lt;ref&gt;Juliet E.K.

===Political legacy===
[[File:Martin-Luther-King-1964-leaning-on-a-lectern.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] remains the most prominent political leader in the American civil rights movement and perhaps the most influential African-American political figure in general.]]

The gains made by African Americans in the [[civil rights movement]] and in the [[Black Power movement]] not only obtained certain rights for African Americans, but changed American society in far-reaching and fundamentally important ways. Prior to the 1950s, Black Americans in the South were subject to de jure discrimination, or [[Jim Crow laws]]. They were often the victims of extreme cruelty and violence, sometimes resulting in deaths: by the post World War II era, African Americans became increasingly discontented with their long-standing inequality. In the words of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], African Americans and their supporters challenged the nation to &quot;rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed that all men are created equal{{nbsp}}...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/38.htm|title=Martin Luther King, Jr|accessdate=May 30, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613010952/https://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/38.htm|archivedate=June 13, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The civil rights movement marked an enormous change in American social, political, economic and civic life. It brought with it [[boycott]]s, [[sit-in]]s, [[nonviolent]] demonstrations and marches, court battles, bombings and other violence; prompted worldwide media coverage and intense public debate; forged enduring civic, economic and religious alliances; and disrupted and realigned the nation's two major political parties.

Over time, it has changed in fundamental ways the manner in which blacks and whites interact with and relate to one another. The movement resulted in the removal of codified, ''de jure'' racial segregation and discrimination from American life and law, and heavily influenced other groups and movements in struggles for civil rights and social equality within American society, including the [[Free Speech Movement]], the [[Disability|disabled]], the [[Feminist movement|women's movement]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], and [[migrant workers]].

To combat this, [[Robert L. Johnson]] founded [[Black Entertainment Television]], a network that targets young African Americans and urban audiences in the United States. Over the years, the network has aired such programming as [[Hip hop music|rap]] and [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] music videos, urban-oriented movies and television series, and some public affairs programs. On Sunday mornings, BET would broadcast Christian programming; the network would also broadcast non-affiliated Christian programs during the early morning hours daily. BET is now a global network that reaches households in the United States, Caribbean, Canada, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BET Networks|publisher=Viacom|url=https://www.viacom.com/ourbrands/medianetworks/betnetworks/pages/default.aspx|accessdate=September 6, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828171159/https://www.viacom.com/ourbrands/medianetworks/betnetworks/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=August 28, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=July 2019}} The network has gone on to spawn several spin-off channels, including [[BET Her]] (originally launched as ''BET on Jazz''), which originally showcased [[jazz]] music-related programming, and later expanded to include general-interest urban programs as well as some R&amp;B, [[soul music|soul]], and [[world music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bet.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829101056/https://bet.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=18|archivedate=August 29, 2007 |title=BET J}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=July 2019}}

Another network targeting African-Americans is [[TV One (Radio One)|TV One]]. TV One's original programming was formally focused on lifestyle and entertainment-oriented shows, movies, fashion, and music programming. The network also reruns classic series from as far back as the 1970s to current series such as ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]'' and ''Sister Circle''. TV One is owned by [[Urban One]], founded and controlled by [[Cathy Hughes|Catherine Hughes]].

[[File:Soul Food at Powell's Place.jpg|thumb|A traditional [[soul food]] dinner consisting of [[fried chicken]] with [[macaroni and cheese]], [[collard greens]], breaded fried [[okra]] and [[cornbread]].]]
From their earliest presence in [[North America]], African Americans have significantly contributed literature, art, agricultural skills, cuisine, clothing styles, music, language, and social and technological innovation to American culture. The cultivation and use of many agricultural products in the United States, such as [[Sweet potato|yams]], [[peanut]]s, [[rice]], [[okra]], [[sorghum]], [[grits]], [[watermelon]], [[indigo dye]]s, and [[cotton]], can be traced to West African and African-American influences. Notable examples include [[George Washington Carver]], who created 300 products from peanuts, 118 products from sweet potatoes, and 75 products from pecans; and [[George Crum]], a local legend associates him with the creation of the potato chip in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Steve |last1=Berry |first2=Phil |last2=Norman |last-author-amp=yes |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/10965628/Crisps-buoyed-Britain-in-its-darkest-hour.html |title=Crisps buoyed Britain in its darkest hour |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=July 14, 2014 |accessdate=November 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.enchantedlearning.com/inventors/black.shtml|title=African-American Inventors|accessdate=May 30, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613230925/https://www.enchantedlearning.com/inventors/black.shtml|archivedate=June 13, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Soul food]] is a variety of cuisine popular among African Americans. It is closely related to the [[cuisine of the Southern United States]]. The descriptive terminology may have originated in the mid-1960s, when ''[[wikt:soul|soul]]'' was a common definer used to describe African-American culture (for example, [[soul music]]). African Americans were the first peoples in the United States to make fried chicken, along with [[Scottish people|Scottish]] immigrants to the South. Although the Scottish had been frying chicken before they emigrated, they lacked the spices and flavor that African Americans had used when preparing the meal. The Scottish American settlers therefore adopted the African-American method of seasoning chicken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Advances in Deep Fat Frying of Foods|author1=Servet Gulum Sumnu |author2=Serpil Sahin |pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, fried chicken was generally a rare meal in the African-American community, and was usually reserved for special events or celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World of a Slave: Encyclopedia of the Material Life of Slaves in the United States|author1=Martha B. Katz-Hyman |author2=Kym S. Rice |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
{{Main|African-American English}}
[[African-American English]] is a [[Variety (linguistics)|variety]] ([[dialect]], [[ethnolect]], and [[sociolect]]) of [[American English]], commonly spoken by urban [[working class|working-class]] and largely [[wikt:bidialectal|bi-dialectal]] [[middle class|middle-class]] African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Walter|chapter=African American Vernacular English: phonology|editor-last=Kortmann|editor-first=Bernd|work=A Handbook of Varieties of English|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2004|volume=2|page=383|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dptsvykgk3IC|title=A Handbook of Varieties of English: CD-ROM|isbn=9783110175325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African-American English evolved during the antebellum period through interaction between speakers of 16th- and 17th-century English of Great Britain and Ireland and various West African languages. As a result, the variety shares parts of its [[grammar]] and [[phonology]] with the [[Southern American English]] dialect. Where African-American English differs from Standard American English (SAE) is in certain pronunciation characteristics, tense usage and grammatical structures that were derived from West African languages, particularly those belonging to the [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aave&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Cross-Cultural School Psychology|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0387717982|page=405|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=PaO3jsaGkeYC|accessdate=October 21, 2014|date=February 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtually all habitual speakers of African-American English can understand and communicate in Standard American English. As with all linguistic forms, AAVE's usage is influenced by various factors, including geographical, educational and socioeconomic background, as well as formality of setting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aave&quot;/&gt; Additionally, there are many literary uses of this variety of English, particularly in [[African-American literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Lisa J.|title=African American English : a linguistic introduction|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521891387|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780521891387/page/164 164]–199|edition=1. publ., 4. print.|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780521891387|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Traditional names====
{{Main|African-American names}}
[[African-American names]] are part of the cultural traditions of African Americans. Prior to the 1950s, and 1960s, most African-American names closely resembled those used within European American culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norman|first1=Teresa|title=The African-American Baby Name Book|date=1998|publisher=Berkley Books|isbn=978-0425159392|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=XPkLGtzsKv0C|accessdate=May 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babies of that era were generally given a few common names, with children using [[nickname]]s to distinguish the various people with the same name. With the rise of 1960s civil rights movement, there was a dramatic increase in names of various origins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moskowitz&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Moskowitz|first=Clara|title=Baby Names Reveal More About Parents Than Ever Before|url=https://www.livescience.com/9027-baby-names-reveal-parents.html|newspaper=Live Science|date=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, and 1980s, it had become common among African Americans to invent new names for themselves, although many of these invented names took elements from popular existing names. Prefixes such as La/Le, Da/De, Ra/Re and Ja/Je, and suffixes like -ique/iqua, -isha and -aun/-awn are common, as are inventive spellings for common names. The book ''Baby Names Now: From Classic to Cool—The Very Last Word on First Names'' places the origins of &quot;La&quot; names in African-American culture in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenkrantz&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenkrantz|first=Linda|title=Baby Names Now: From Classic to Cool—The Very Last Word on First Names|date=August 16, 2001|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|isbn=978-0312267575|url=https://archive.org/details/babynamesnow00rose|author2=Satran, Paula Redmond}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with the rise of inventive names, it is still common for African Americans to use biblical, historical, or traditional European names. Daniel, Christopher, Michael, David, James, Joseph, and Matthew were thus among the most frequent names for African-American boys in 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lack|first=Evonne|title=Popular African American Names|url=https://www.babycenter.com/0_popular-african-american-names_10329236.bc|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Conley&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conley|first=Dalton|title=Raising E and Yo...|journal=Psychology Today|date=March 10, 2010|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/201003/raising-e-and-yo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name LaKeisha is typically considered American in origin, but has elements that were drawn from both French and West/Central African roots. Names such as LaTanisha, JaMarcus, DeAndre, and Shaniqua were created in the same way. Punctuation marks are seen more often within African-American names than other American names, such as the names Mo'nique and D'Andre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman&quot;/&gt;

[[African-American music]] is one of the most pervasive African-American cultural influences in the United States today and is among the most dominant in mainstream popular music. [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]], [[funk]], [[rock and roll]], [[soul music|soul]], [[blues]], and other contemporary American musical forms originated in black communities and evolved from other black forms of music, including [[blues]], [[doo-wop]], [[Barbershop music|barbershop]], [[ragtime]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[jazz]], and [[gospel music]].

African-American-derived musical forms have also influenced and been incorporated into virtually every other [[popular music]] genre in the world, including [[Country music|country]] and [[techno]]. African-American genres are the most important ethnic vernacular tradition in America, as they have developed independent of African traditions from which they arise more so than any other immigrant groups, including Europeans; make up the broadest and longest lasting range of styles in America; and have, historically, been more influential, interculturally, geographically, and economically, than other American vernacular traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;stewart&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=Earl L.|year=1998|title=African American Music: An Introduction|isbn=978-0-02-860294-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780028602943/page/3 3]|publisher=Schirmer Books|location=New York|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780028602943/page/3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African Americans have also had an important role in American dance. [[Bill T. Jones]], a prominent modern choreographer and dancer, has included historical African-American themes in his work, particularly in the piece &quot;Last Supper at Uncle Tom's Cabin/The Promised Land&quot;. Likewise, [[Alvin Ailey]]'s artistic work, including his &quot;Revelations&quot; based on his experience growing up as an African American in the South during the 1930s, has had a significant influence on modern dance. Another form of dance, [[Stepping (African-American)|Stepping]], is an African-American tradition whose performance and competition has been formalized through the traditionally black fraternities and sororities at universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Harris|first=Samantha|title=Stepping into controversy: Some fraternity members fear film 'Stomp the Yard' portrays them as glamorized dance group, trivializes traditions|newspaper=[[The Anderson Independent-Mail]]|location=[[Anderson, South Carolina]]|date=January 25, 2007|url=https://www.independentmail.com/news/2007/jan/25/stepping-controversy-some-fraternity-members-fear-/|accessdate=January 11, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629142134/http://www.independentmail.com/news/2007/jan/25/stepping-controversy-some-fraternity-members-fear-/|archive-date=June 29, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature and academics===
Many African-American authors have written stories, poems, and essays influenced by their experiences as African Americans. [[African-American literature]] is a major genre in American literature. Famous examples include [[Langston Hughes]], [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]], [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[Zora Neale Hurston]], [[Ralph Ellison]], Nobel Prize winner [[Toni Morrison]], and [[Maya Angelou]].

== Mental health ==
The relationship between African Americans and [[mental health]] has many barriers. [[Mental health counselor|Counseling]] has been frowned upon and distant in utility and proximity to many people in the African American community. In 2004, a qualitative research study explored the disconnect with African Americans and mental health. The study was conducted as a semistructured discussion which allowed the focus group to express their opinions and life experiences. The results revealed a couple key variables that create barriers for many African American communities to seek mental health services such as the stigma, lack of four important necessities; trust, affordability, cultural understanding and impersonal services.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Vetta L.

Historically, many African American communities did not seek counseling because religion was a part of the family values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turner|first=Natalie|title=Mental Health Care Treatment Seeking Among African Americans and Caribbean Blacks: What is The Role of Religiosity/Spirituality?|journal=Aging and Mental Health|volume=23|issue=7|pages=905–911|doi=10.1080/13607863.2018.1453484|pmid=29608328|year=2018|url=https://scholarsarchive.library.albany.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&amp;context=honorscollege_sw}}&lt;/ref&gt; African American who have a faith background are more likely to seek prayer as a coping mechanism for mental issues rather than seeking professional mental health services.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; In 2015 a study concluded, African Americans with high value in religion are less likely to utilize mental health services compared to those who have low value in religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lukachko|first=Alicia|last2=Myer|first2=Ilan|last3=Hankerson|first3=Sidney|date=2015-08-01|title=Religiosity and Mental Health Service Utilization Among African-americans|journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease|language=ENGLISH|volume=203|issue=8|pages=578–582|doi=10.1097/NMD.0000000000000334|issn=0022-3018|pmc=4535188|pmid=26172387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most counseling approaches are [[Westernization|westernized]] and do not fit within the African American culture. African American families tend to resolve concerns within the family, and it is viewed by the family as a strength. On the other hand, when African Americans seek counseling, they face a social backlash and are criticized. They may be labeled &quot;crazy,&quot; viewed as weak, and their pride is diminished.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Because of this, many African Americans instead seek mentorship within communities they trust.

Terminology is another barrier in relation to African Americans and mental health. There is more stigma on the term [[psychotherapy]] versus counseling. In one study, psychotherapy is associated with mental illness whereas counseling approaches problem-solving, guidance and help.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; More African Americans seek assistance when it is called counseling and not psychotherapy because it is more welcoming within the cultural and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://link.galegroup.com.libproxy.sdsu.edu/apps/doc/A19573641/AONE?u=san96005&amp;sid=AONE&amp;xid=5286bc25|title='Don't Show Weakness:' Black Americans Still Shy Away from Psychotherapy|last=Leland|first=John|date=December 8, 2018|website=Newsweek|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Counselors are encouraged to be aware of such barriers for the well-being of African American clients. Without [[Cultural competence in healthcare|cultural competency]] training in health care, many African Americans go unheard and misunderstood.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The term ''African American'' carries important political overtones. Earlier terms used to describe Americans of African ancestry referred more to skin color than to ancestry, and were conferred upon the group by colonists and Americans of European ancestry; people with dark skins were considered inferior in fact and in law. Other terms (such as ''[[colored]]'', ''[[person of color]]'', or ''[[negro]]'') were included in the wording of various laws and legal decisions which some thought were being used as tools of [[white supremacy]] and [[oppression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/outofmouthsofsla00john|url-access=registration|title=Out of the Mouths of Slaves: African American Language and Educational Malpractice|author=Baugh, John|page=[https://archive.org/details/outofmouthsofsla00john/page/86 86]|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|isbn=978-0-292-70873-0|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Published in 1782, the book's use of this phrase predates any other yet identified by more than 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.harvard.edu/houghton/2015/04/23/exploring-the-origins-of-african-american/|title=Exploring the origins of &quot;African American&quot; Houghton Library Blog|website=blogs.harvard.edu|access-date=May 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507153324/https://blogs.harvard.edu/houghton/2015/04/23/exploring-the-origins-of-african-american/|archive-date=May 7, 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the term ''African American'' was advanced on the model of, for example, [[German-American]] or [[Irish-American]] to give descendants of American slaves and other American blacks who lived through the [[Slavery in the United States|slavery era]] a [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] and a cultural base.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt; The term was popularized in black communities around the country via word of mouth and ultimately received mainstream use after [[Jesse Jackson]] publicly used the term in front of a national audience in 1988. Subsequently, major media outlets adopted its use.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt;

Surveys show that the majority of Black Americans have no preference for ''African American'' versus ''Black American'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.gallup.com/poll/28816/black-african-american.aspx|title=Black or African American?|first=Frank|last=Newport|publisher=Gallup|date=September 28, 2007|accessdate=September 26, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906124630/https://www.gallup.com/poll/28816/Black-African-American.aspx|archivedate=September 6, 2010 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they have a slight preference for ''Black American'' in personal settings and ''African American'' in more formal settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Pepper|last2=Kemp|first2=Herb|title=What's Black About?

Many African Americans have expressed a preference for the term ''African American'' because it was formed in the same way as the terms for the many other ethnic groups currently living in the nation. Some argued further that, because of the historical circumstances surrounding the capture, enslavement and systematic attempts to de-Africanize blacks in the United States under [[Slavery#Chattel slavery|chattel slavery]], most African Americans are unable to trace their ancestry to a specific African nation; hence, the entire continent serves as a geographic marker.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

The term ''African American'' embraces pan-Africanism as earlier enunciated by prominent African thinkers such as [[Marcus Garvey]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] and [[George Padmore]]. The term ''Afro-Usonian'', and variations of such, are more rarely used.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Brennan, ''Secular Devotion: Afro-Latin Music and Imperial Jazz'', 2008, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2010/12/what_call_americans &quot;Yankees, gringos and USAnians&quot;], ''[[The Economist]]'', December 9, 2010, retrieved March 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identity===
Since 1977, in an attempt to keep up with changing social opinion, the United States government has officially classified black people (revised to ''black'' or ''African American'' in 1997) as &quot;having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;censusblack&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/c2kbr01-5.pdf|first=Jesse|last=McKinnon|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=October 22, 2007|title=The Black Population: 2000 United States Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other federal offices, such as the [[United States Census]] Bureau, adhere to the [[Office of Management and Budget]] standards on race in its data collection and tabulations efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;OMB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg/1997standards.html |title=Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity |year=1997 |publisher=Office of Management and Budget |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315191301/https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg/1997standards.html |archivedate=March 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the United States 2010 Census, a marketing and outreach plan, called ''2010 Census Integrated Communications Campaign Plan'' (ICC) recognized and defined African Americans as black people born in the United States. From the ICC perspective, African Americans are one of three groups of black people in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;US2010ICCBlkAud&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Census Integrated Communications Campaign Plan|url=https://www.census.gov/2010census/partners/pdf/2010_ICC_Plan_Final_Edited.pdf|website=2010 Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|page=225|date=August 2008|accessdate=September 6, 2012|quote=The Black audience includes all individuals of Black African descent. There are three major groups that represent the Black Audience in the United States. These groups are African Americans (Blacks born in the United States), Black Africans (Black Immigrants from Africa) and Afro-Caribbeans, which includes Haitians.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310013605/http://www.census.gov/2010census/partners/pdf/2010_ICC_Plan_Final_Edited.pdf|archive-date=March 10, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICC plan was to reach the three groups by acknowledging that each group has its own sense of community that is based on geography and ethnicity.&lt;ref name=&quot;US2010ICCBstRch&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Census Integrated Communications Campaign Plan|url=https://www.census.gov/2010census/partners/pdf/2010_ICC_Plan_Final_Edited.pdf|website=2010 Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|page=230|date=August 2008|accessdate=September 6, 2012|quote=Community, both geographic and ethnic, creates a sense of belonging and pride that is unique to the Black audience (African Americans, Afro-Caribbeans, and Black Africans).|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310013605/http://www.census.gov/2010census/partners/pdf/2010_ICC_Plan_Final_Edited.pdf|archive-date=March 10, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best way to market the census process toward any of the three groups is to reach them through their own unique communication channels and not treat the entire black population of the U.S. as though they are all African Americans with a single ethnic and geographical background. The U.S. Department of Justice Federal Bureau of Investigation categorizes black or African-American people as &quot;A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa&quot; through racial categories used in the UCR Program adopted from the Statistical Policy Handbook (1978) and published by the Office of Federal Statistical Policy and Standards, U.S. Department of Commerce, derived from the 1977 Office of Management and Budget classification.&lt;ref name=&quot;FBIpop&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/additional-ucr-publications/ucr_handbook.pdf/view|title=Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice.

Historically, &quot;race mixing&quot; between [[Black (people)|black]] and [[White American|white]] people was taboo in the United States.

===Terms no longer in common use===
Before the independence of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] until the abolition of slavery in 1865, an African-American slave was commonly known as a ''[[negro]]''. ''[[Free negro]]'' was the legal status in the territory of an African-American person who was not a slave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frazier|first=Edward Franklin|title=The Free Negro Family|year=1968|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[colored]]'' later also began to be used until the second quarter of the 20th century, when it was considered outmoded and generally gave way again to the exclusive use of ''negro''. By the 1940s, the term was commonly capitalized (''Negro''); but by the mid-1960s, it was considered disparaging. By the end of the 20th century, ''negro'' had come to be considered inappropriate and was rarely used and perceived as a [[pejorative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tottie|first=Gunnel|title=An Introduction to American English|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WWDUtK-f1tQC&amp;pg=PA200|year=2002|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-631-19792-8|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Talmadge|author2=James Stewart|title=Introduction to African American Studies|url=https://books.google.com/?id=49tXR1Ok6poC&amp;pg=PA3|year=2007|publisher=Black Classics Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-1-58073-039-6|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is rarely used by younger black people, but remained in use by many older African Americans who had grown up with the term, particularly in the southern U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/03/they-put-negro-on-there/38094/|title=They Put 'Negro' on There?|author=Chris Good|date=March 26, 2010|website=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term remains in use in some contexts, such as the [[United Negro College Fund]], an American philanthropic organization that funds scholarships for black students and general scholarship funds for 39 private historically black colleges and universities.

There are many other deliberately insulting terms. Many were in common use (e.g., ''[[nigger]]''), but had become unacceptable in normal discourse before the end of the 20th century. One exception is the use, among the black community, of the slur ''nigger'' rendered as ''[[nigga]]'', representing the pronunciation of the word in [[African American English]]. This usage has been popularized by the [[rap]] and [[hip-hop]] music cultures and is used as part of an in-group lexicon and speech. It is not necessarily derogatory and, when used among black people, the word is often used to mean &quot;homie&quot; or &quot;friend&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahman|first=Jacquelyn|date=June 2012|title=The N Word: Its History and Use in the African American Community|journal=Journal of English Linguistics|volume=40|issue=2|pages=137–171|doi=10.1177/0075424211414807|issn=0075-4242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acceptance of intra-group usage of the word ''nigga'' is still debated, although it has established a foothold among younger generations. The [[NAACP]] denounces the use of both ''nigga'' and ''nigger''.&lt;ref name=&quot;BaltSun&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2007-07-10-0707100124-story.html|title=NAACP aims to bury the 'N-word'|last=Brewington|first=Kelly|date=2007-07-10|work=The Baltimore Sun|access-date=2019-06-15|publisher=Baltimore Sun Media Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mixed-race usage of ''nigga'' is still considered taboo, particularly if the speaker is white. However, trends indicate that usage of the term in intragroup settings is increasing even among white youth due to the popularity of rap and hip hop culture.&lt;ref name=ENQ&gt;Kevin Aldridge, Richelle Thompson and Earnest Winston, [https://www.enquirer.com/editions/2001/08/05/loc_1the_n-word.html &quot;The evolving N-word&quot;], ''The Cincinnati Enquirer'', August 5, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
