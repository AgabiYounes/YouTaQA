Surrounding it on land on every side were the two rival empires of Persia and Byzantium. The countries of what now make up the Arab world were divided between the two of them—Iraq under Persian rule, Syria, Palestine, and North Africa part of the Byzantine Empire. They spoke a variety of different languages and were for the most part Christians, with some Jewish minorities. Their Arabization and Islamization took place with the vast expansion of Islam in the decades and centuries following the death of the Prophet in 632 CE. The Aramaic language, once dominant in the Fertile Crescent, survives in only a few remote villages and in the rituals of the Eastern churches. Coptic, the language of Christian Egypt before the Arab conquest, has been entirely replaced by Arabic except in the church liturgy. Some earlier languages have survived, notably Kurdish in Southwest Asia and Berber in North Africa, but Arabic, in one form or another, has in effect become the language of everyday speech as well as of government, commerce, and culture in what has come to be known as &quot;the Arab world.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabs forged the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]] (632–661), [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] (661–750), [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] (750–1517) and the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] (901–1071) caliphates, whose borders reached southern [[France]] in the west, [[China]] in the east, [[Anatolia]] in the north, and the [[Sudan]] in the south.

''A dictionary of modern written Arabic.'' Third Edition. Ithaca, N.Y.: Spoken Language Services, p. 601.&lt;/ref&gt; Both terms are mentioned around 40 times in pre-Islamic [[Sabaean language|Sabaean]] inscriptions. The term ''ʿarab'' (&quot;Arab&quot;) occurs also in the titles of the Himyarite kings from the time of [[Tubba Abu Karab As'ad|'Abu Karab Asad]] until MadiKarib Ya'fur.

The most popular Arab account holds that the word &quot;Arab&quot; came from an [[eponym]]ous father called [[Ya'rub]] who was supposedly the first to speak Arabic. [[Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdani]] had another view; he states that Arabs were called ''gharab'' (&quot;westerners&quot;) by [[Mesopotamia]]ns because Bedouins originally resided to the west of Mesopotamia; the term was then corrupted into ''arab''.

Yet another view is held by [[al-Masudi]] that the word &quot;Arab&quot; was initially applied to the [[Ishmaelites]] of the [[Arabah]] valley. In Biblical etymology, &quot;Arab&quot; (in Hebrew ''arvi'') comes both from the desert origin of the Bedouins it originally described (''arava'' means wilderness).

The root ''ʿ-r-b'' has several additional meanings in Semitic languages—including &quot;west, sunset,&quot; &quot;desert,&quot; &quot;mingle,&quot; &quot;mixed,&quot; &quot;merchant,&quot; and &quot;raven&quot;—and are &quot;comprehensible&quot; with all of these having varying degrees of relevance to the emergence of the name. It is also possible that some forms were [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathetical]] from {{transl|sem|ʿ-B-R}} &quot;moving around&quot; (Arabic {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ-B-R}} &quot;traverse&quot;), and hence, it is alleged, &quot;nomadic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uqu.edu.sa/page/ar/56829 The meaning of Arab land in the historical sources ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315055238/http://www.uqu.edu.sa/page/ar/56829 |date=15 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of the Arab States}}
Pre-Islamic Arabia refers to the Arabian Peninsula prior to the rise of Islam in the 630s. The study of Pre-Islamic Arabia is important to&amp;nbsp;[[Islamic studies]] as it provides the context for the development of Islam. Some of the settled communities in the Arabian Peninsula developed into distinctive civilizations. Sources for these civilizations are not extensive, and are limited to archaeological evidence, accounts written outside of Arabia, and Arab oral traditions later recorded by Islamic scholars. Among the most prominent civilizations was [[Dilmun]], which arose around the 4th millennium BCE and lasted to 538 BCE, and [[Thamud]], which arose around the 1st millennium BCE and lasted to about 300 CE. Additionally, from the beginning of the first millennium BCE, [[Southern Arabia]] was the home to a number of kingdoms, such as the [[Sabaean kingdom]] ({{lang-ar|سَـبَـأ|Saba'}},&lt;ref name=&quot;Cite quran|34|15|e=17|s=ns&quot;&gt;{{cite quran|34|15|e=17|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly [[Sheba]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheba-01&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsMiddEast/ArabicSaba.htm |title=Saba / Sa'abia / Sheba |accessdate=27 June 2008 |publisher=The History Files (http://www.historyfiles.co.uk) |quote=The kingdom of Saba is known to have existed in the region of Yemen. By 1000 BC caravan trains of camels journeyed from Oman in south-east Arabia to the Mediterranean. As the [[camel driver]]s passed through the [[desert]]s of Yemen, experts believe that many of them would have called in at Ma'rib. Dating from at least 1050 BC, and now barren and dry, [[Ma'rib]] was then a lush [[oasis]] teeming with [[palm tree]]s and [[introduced species|exotic]] [[plant]]s. Ideally placed, it was situated on the trade routes and with a unique [[dam]] of vast proportions. It was also one of only two main sources of [[frankincense]] (the other being [[East Africa]]), so Saba had a virtual [[monopoly]]. Ma'rib's [[wealth]] accumulated to such an extent that the city became a byword for riches beyond belief throughout the Arab world. Its people, the [[Sabeans]] – a group whose name bears the same etymological root as Saba – lived in [[South Arabia]] between the tenth and sixth centuries BC. Their main temple – [[Mahram Bilqis]], or [[temple]] of the moon god (situated about three miles (5 km) from the capital city of Ma'rib) – was so famous that it remained [[sacred]] even after the collapse of the Sabean civilisation in the sixth century BC – caused by the rerouting of the [[spice]] trail. By that point the dam, now in a poor state of repair, was finally breached. The [[irrigation]] system was lost, the people abandoned the site within a year or so, and the temple fell into disrepair and was eventually covered by sand. Saba was known by the [[Hebrews]] as Sheba ''[Note that the collapse of the dam was actually in 575 [[Common Era|CE]], as shown in the timeline in the same article in the History Files, and attested by MacCulloch (2009)].''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the coastal areas of [[Eastern Arabia]] were controlled by the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanians]] from 300 BCE.

====Origins and early history====
{{further|Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples|Proto-Arabic}}
According to Arab-[[Islamic–Jewish relations|Islamic-Jewish traditions]], [[Ishmael]] was father of the Arabs, to be the ancestor of the [[Ishmaelites]].&lt;ref&gt;
* Both Judaism and Islam see him as the ancestor of Arab peoples. {{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Lindsay|title=Encyclopedia of religion|date=2005|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|isbn=9780028657400|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0jMOAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Ishmael|language=en}}
* Ishmael is recognized by Muslims as the ancestor of several prominent [[Arab]] [[Tribes of Arabia|tribes]] and being the forefather of Muhammad. ''A–Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', Wheeler, ''Ishmael'' Muslims also believe that Muhammad was the descendant of Ishmael that would establish a great nation, as promised by [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] in the [[Old Testament]].

* Ishmael was considered the ancestor of the Northern Arabs and Muhammad was linked to him through the lineage of the patriarch Adnan. Ishmael may also have been the ancestor of the Southern Arabs through his descendant Qahtan.

The first written attestation of the ethnonym ''Arab'' occurs in an [[Akkadian language|Assyrian]] inscription of 853 BCE, where [[Shalmaneser III]] lists a King [[Gindibu]] of ''mâtu arbâi'' (Arab land) as among the people he defeated at the [[Battle of Qarqar]]. Some of the names given in these texts are [[Aramaic]], while others are the first attestations of [[Ancient North Arabian]] dialects. In fact several different ethnonyms are found in Assyrian texts that are conventionally translated &quot;Arab&quot;: ''Arabi, Arubu, Aribi'' and ''Urbi''. Many of the [[Qedarite]] queens were also described as queens of the ''aribi''. The [[Hebrew Bible]] occasionally refers to ''Aravi'' peoples (or variants thereof), translated as &quot;Arab&quot; or &quot;Arabian.&quot; The scope of the term at that early stage is unclear, but it seems to have referred to various desert-dwelling Semitic tribes in the [[Syrian Desert]] and Arabia.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Arab tribes came into conflict with the Assyrians during the reign of the Assyrian king [[Ashurbanipal]], and he records military victories against the powerful [[Qedar]] tribe among others.

Medieval Arab [[genealogist]]s divided Arabs into three groups:
# &quot;Ancient Arabs&quot;, tribes that had vanished or been destroyed, such as [[ʿĀd]] and [[Thamud]], often mentioned in the [[Qur'an]] as examples of God's power to vanquish those who fought his prophets.
# &quot;Pure Arabs&quot; of [[South Arabia]], descending from [[Qahtan]]. The [[Qahtanite]]s (Qahtanis) are said to have migrated from the land of [[Yemen]] following the destruction of the [[Ma'rib Dam]] (''sadd Ma'rib'').
# The &quot;Arabized Arabs&quot; (''mustaʿribah'') of Central Arabia ([[Najd]]) and North Arabia, descending from [[Ishmael]] the elder son of [[Abraham]], through [[Adnan]] (hence, [[Adnanites]]). The [[Book of Genesis]] narrates that [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] promised [[Hagar]] to beget from Ishmael twelve princes and turn him to a great nation.&lt;sup&gt;({{Bibleverse||Genesis|17:20|HE}})&lt;/sup&gt; The [[Book of Jubilees]] claims that the sons of [[Ishmael]] intermingled with the 6 sons of [[Keturah]], from [[Abraham]], and their descendants were called Arabs and [[Ishmaelites]]:

{{quote|And Ishmael and his sons, and the sons of [[Keturah]] and their sons, went together and dwelt from [[Desert of Paran|Paran]] to the entering in of [[Babylon]] in all the land towards the East facing the desert.

[[Ibn Khaldun]]'s ''[[Muqaddima]]'' distinguishes between sedentary Arab Muslims who used to be [[nomad]]ic, and Bedouin nomadic Arabs of the desert. He used the term &quot;formerly nomadic&quot; Arabs and refers to sedentary Muslims by the region or city they lived in, as in [[Demographics of Yemen|Yemenis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Levity&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.levity.com/alchemy/islam20.html |title=Levity.com, Islam |publisher=Levity.com |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christians of Italy and the Crusaders preferred the term [[Saracens]] for all the Arabs and Muslims of that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lionheart&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/lionheart.htm |title=Eyewitnesstohistory|website=Eyewitnesstohistory.com |accessdate=13 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100402073536/http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/lionheart.htm| archivedate= 2 April 2010 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christians of [[Iberia]] used the term [[Moors|Moor]] to describe all the Arabs and Muslims of that time.

Muslims of [[Medina]] referred to the [[nomad]]ic tribes of the deserts as the A'raab, and considered themselves sedentary, but were aware of their close racial bonds. The term &quot;A'raab&quot; mirrors the term Assyrians used to describe the closely related nomads they defeated in Syria. The [[Qur'an]] does not use the word {{transl|ar|ʿarab}}, only the [[Arabic nouns and adjectives#Nisba|nisba]] adjective {{transl|ar|ʿarabiy}}. The Qur'an calls itself {{transl|ar|ʿarabiy}}, &quot;Arabic&quot;, and {{transl|ar|Mubin}}, &quot;clear&quot;. The two qualities are connected for example in ayat [[Az-Zukhruf|43]].2–3, &quot;By the ''clear'' Book: We have made it an ''Arabic'' recitation in order that you may understand&quot;. The Qur'an became regarded as the prime example of the {{transl|ar|al-ʿarabiyya}}, the language of the Arabs. The term ''[[ʾiʿrāb]]'' has the same root and refers to a particularly clear and correct mode of speech. The plural noun {{transl|ar|ʾaʿrāb}} refers to the [[Bedouin]] tribes of the desert who resisted Muhammad, for example in ''[[at-Tawba]]'' 97,

{{transl|ar|al-ʾaʿrābu ʾašaddu kufrān wanifāqān}} &quot;the Bedouin are the worst in [[kufr|disbelief]] and hypocrisy&quot;.

Based on this, in early Islamic terminology, {{transl|ar|ʿarabiy}} referred to the language, and {{transl|ar|ʾaʿrāb}} to the Arab Bedouins, carrying a negative connotation due to the Qur'anic verdict just cited. But after the [[Islamic conquest]] of the eighth century, the language of the nomadic Arabs became regarded as the most pure by the grammarians following [[Abi Ishaq]], and the term {{transl|ar|kalam al-ʿArab}}, &quot;language of the Arabs&quot;, denoted the uncontaminated language of the Bedouins.

[[File:Petra, Al-Khazneh 2.jpg|thumb|Façade of [[Al Khazneh]] in [[Petra]], Jordan, built by the [[Nabateans]].]]
Proto-Arabic, or [[Ancient North Arabian]], texts give a clearer picture of the Arabs' emergence. The earliest are written in variants of [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraphic]] south Arabian ''[[South Arabian alphabet|musnad]]'' script, including the 8th century BCE [[Al-Hasa|Hasaean]] inscriptions of eastern Saudi Arabia, the 6th century BCE [[Lihyanite]] texts of southeastern Saudi Arabia and the [[Thamudic]] texts found throughout the Arabian Peninsula and [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] (not in reality connected with [[Thamud]]).

The [[Nabataeans]] were nomadic Arabs who moved into territory vacated by the [[Edomites]]&amp;nbsp;– Semites who settled the region centuries before them. Their early inscriptions were in [[Aramaic]], but gradually switched to Arabic, and since they had writing, it was they who made the first inscriptions in Arabic. The [[Nabataean alphabet]] was adopted by Arabs to the south, and evolved into modern Arabic script around the 4th century. This is attested by [[Safaitic]] inscriptions (beginning in the 1st century BCE) and the many Arabic personal names in [[Nabataean]] inscriptions. From about the 2nd century BCE, a few inscriptions from [[Qaryat al-Faw]] reveal a dialect no longer considered ''proto-Arabic'', but ''pre-classical Arabic''. Five [[Syriac language|Syriac]] inscriptions mentioning Arabs have been found at [[Sumatar Harabesi]], one of which dates to the 2nd century CE.

The [[Ghassanids]], [[Lakhmids]] and [[Kindites]] were the last major migration of pre-Islamic Arabs out of Yemen to the north. The Ghassanids increased the Semitic presence in the then Hellenized [[Syria (Byzantine province)|Syria]], the majority of Semites were Aramaic peoples. They mainly settled in the [[Hauran]] region and spread to modern [[Lebanon]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Jordan]].

[[File:Roman Empire 125 political map.svg|thumb|left|The [[imperial province]] of [[Arabia Petraea]] in 117–138 CE]]
Greeks and Romans referred to all the nomadic population of the desert in the Near East as Arabi. The Romans called Yemen &quot;[[Arabia Felix]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dionysius Periegetes|url=http://www.cartographic-images.net/Cartographic_Images/117_Dionysius_Periegetes.html|website=Cartographic-images.net|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans called the vassal nomadic states within the [[Roman Empire]] ''[[Arabia Petraea]]'', after the city of [[Petra]], and called unconquered deserts bordering the empire to the south and east [[Arabia Magna]].

The [[Lakhmids]] as a dynasty inherited their power from the [[Tanukh]]ids, the mid Tigris region around their capital [[Al-Hira]]. They ended up allying with the [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanids]] against the Ghassanids and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Lakhmids contested control of the Central Arabian tribes with the Kindites with the Lakhmids eventually destroying [[Kindah|Kinda]] in 540 after the fall of their main ally [[Himyar]]. The [[Persian people|Persian]] Sassanids dissolved the Lakhmid dynasty in 602, being under puppet kings, then under their direct control.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bailey [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ko_RafMSGLkC&amp;pg=PR59 The Cambridge history of Iran: The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian periods], Volume 1, Cambridge University Press, 1983, {{ISBN|0-521-20092-X}} p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;
The Kindites migrated from Yemen along with the Ghassanids and Lakhmids, but were turned back in Bahrain by the Abdul Qais [[Rabi`ah|Rabi'a]] tribe. They returned to Yemen and allied themselves with the Himyarites who installed them as a vassal kingdom that ruled Central Arabia from &quot;Qaryah Dhat Kahl&quot; (the present-day called Qaryat al-Faw). They ruled much of the Northern/Central Arabian peninsula, until they were destroyed by the Lakhmid king [[Al-Mundhir III ibn al-Nu'man|Al-Mundhir]], and his son [['Amr III ibn al-Mundhir|'Amr]].

After the death of [[Prophet Muhammad]] in 632, [[Rashidun army|Rashidun armies]] launched campaigns of conquest, establishing the [[Caliphate]], or Islamic Empire, one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires in history]]. It was larger and lasted longer than the previous Arab empire of [[Mavia (queen)|Queen Mawia]] or the [[Arameans|Aramean]]-Arab [[Palmyrene Empire]]. The Rashidun state was a completely new state and unlike the Arab kingdoms of its century such as the [[Himyarite]], [[Lakhmids]] or [[Ghassanids]].

In 661, the Rashidun Caliphate fell into the hands of the [[Banu Umayya|Umayyad dynasty]] and [[Damascus]] was established as the empire's capital. The Umayyads were proud of their Arab identity and sponsored the poetry and culture of pre-Islamic Arabia. They established garrison towns at [[Ramla]], [[Raqqa]], [[Basra]], [[Kufa]], [[Mosul]] and [[Samarra]], all of which developed into major cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lunde&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lunde |first=Paul |title=Islam |year=2002 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley Publishing |pages= 50–52 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7894-8797-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] established Arabic as the Caliphate's official language in 686.&lt;ref&gt;John Joseph Saunders, ''A history of medieval Islam'', Routledge, 1965, page 13&lt;/ref&gt; This reform greatly influenced the conquered non-Arab peoples and fueled the [[Arabization]] of the region. However, the Arabs' higher status among non-Arab Muslim converts and the latter's obligation to pay heavy taxes caused resentment. Caliph [[Umar II]] strove to resolve the conflict when he came to power in 717. He rectified the disparity, demanding that all Muslims be treated as equals, but his intended reforms did not take effect, as he died after only three years of rule. By now, discontent with the Umayyads swept the region and an uprising occurred in which the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] came to power and moved the capital to [[Baghdad]].

[[File:Dome of the Rock III, Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|The [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]], constructed during the reign of [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al Malik]]]]
Umayyads expanded their Empire westwards capturing North Africa from the Byzantines. Before the Arab conquest, North Africa was conquered or settled by various people including [[Punics]], Vandals and Romans. After the [[Abbasid Revolution]], the Umayyads lost most of their territories with the exception of Iberia. Their last holding became known as the [[Emirate of Córdoba]]. It wasn't until the rule of the grandson of the founder of this new emirate that the state entered a new phase as the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]]. This new state was characterized by an expansion of trade, culture and knowledge, and saw the construction of masterpieces of [[al-Andalus]] architecture and the library of [[Al-Ḥakam II]] which housed over 400,000 volumes. With the collapse of the Umayyad state in 1031 CE, [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] was divided into small kingdoms.

The Abbasids were&amp;nbsp;the descendants of&amp;nbsp;[[Al-Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib|Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib]], one of the youngest uncles of Muhammad and of the same&amp;nbsp;[[Banu Hashim]]&amp;nbsp;clan. The Abbasids led a revolt against the Umayyads and defeated them in the [[Battle of the Zab]] effectively ending their rule in all parts of the Empire with the exception of [[al-Andalus]]. In 762, the second Abbasid Caliph [[al-Mansur]] founded the city of [[Baghdad]] and declared it the capital of the Caliphate. Unlike the Umayyads, the Abbasids had the support of non-Arab subjects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lunde&quot; /&gt;

The [[Islamic Golden Age]] was inaugurated by the middle of the 8th century by the ascension of the Abbasid Caliphate and the transfer of the capital from [[Damascus]] to the newly founded city of [[Baghdad]]. The Abbassids were influenced by the [[Qur'an]]ic injunctions and [[hadith]] such as &quot;The ink of the scholar is more holy than the blood of martyrs&quot; stressing the value of knowledge. During this period the [[Muslim world]] became an intellectual centre for science, philosophy, medicine and education as the Abbasids championed the cause of knowledge and established the &quot;[[House of Wisdom]]&quot; ({{Lang-ar|بيت الحكمة}}) in Baghdad. Rival dynasties such as the [[Fatimid]]s of [[Egypt]] and the [[Umayyad]]s of [[al-Andalus]] were also major intellectual centres with cities such as [[Cairo]] and [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] rivaling [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Vartan&quot;&gt;Vartan Gregorian, &quot;Islam: A Mosaic, Not a Monolith&quot;, Brookings Institution Press, 2003, pg 26–38 {{ISBN|0-8157-3283-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Abbasids ruled for 200 years before they lost their central control when [[Wilayah|Wilayas]] began to fracture in the 10th century; afterwards, in the 1190s, there was a revival of their power, which was ended by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], who [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|conquered Baghdad]] in 1258 and killed the Caliph [[Al-Musta'sim]]. Members of the Abbasid royal family escaped the massacre and resorted to Cairo, which had broken from the Abbasid rule two years earlier; the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] generals taking the political side of the kingdom while Abbasid Caliphs were engaged in civil activities and continued patronizing science, arts and literature.

=====Fatimid Caliphate (909–1171)=====

[[File:A side view of the front gate of Al Azhar mosque..jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Al-Azhar Mosque]], commissioned by the Fatimid Caliph [[Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah|Al-Mu'izz]] for the newly established capital city of [[Cairo]] in 969]]
The Fatimid caliphate was founded by [[Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah|al-Mahdi Billah]], a descendant of [[Fatimah]], the daughter of Muhammad, in the early 10th century. Egypt was the political, cultural, and religious centre of the Fatimid empire. The Fatimid state took shape among the [[Kutama]] Berbers, in the West of the North African littoral, in Algeria, in 909 conquering [[Raqqada]], the [[Aghlabid]] capital. In 921 the Fatimids established the Tunisian city of [[Mahdia]] as their new capital. In 948 they shifted their capital to [[Mansouria, Tunisia|Al-Mansuriya]], near [[Kairouan]] in Tunisia, and in 969 they conquered Egypt and established [[Cairo]] as the capital of their caliphate.

Intellectual life in Egypt during the Fatimid period achieved great progress and activity, due to many scholars who lived in or came to Egypt, as well as the number of books available. Fatimid Caliphs gave prominent positions to scholars in their courts, encouraged students, and established libraries in their palaces, so that scholars might expand their knowledge and reap benefits from the work of their predecessors.&lt;ref name=&quot;imamreza.net&quot;&gt;Shorter Shi'ite Encyclopaedia, By: Hasan al-Amin, {{cite web |url=http://www.imamreza.net/eng/imamreza.php?id=574 |title=Fatimid Dynasty in Egypt |accessdate=5 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616060639/http://imamreza.net/eng/imamreza.php?id=574 |archivedate=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fatimids were also known for their exquisite arts. Many traces of [[Fatimid architecture]] exist in Cairo today; the most defining examples include [[Al-Hakim Mosque]] and the [[Al-Azhar University]].

It was not until the 11th century that the [[Maghreb]] saw a large influx of ethnic Arabs. Starting with the 11th century, the Arab bedouin [[Banu Hilal]] tribes migrated to the West. Having been sent by the [[Fatimids]] to punish the Berber [[Zirids]] for abandoning [[Shia Islam|Shias]], they travelled westwards. The Banu Hilal quickly defeated the Zirids and deeply weakened the neighboring [[Hammadid]]s. According to some modern historians. their influx was a major factor in the arabization of the Maghreb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=umyHqvAErOAC&amp;pg=PA668&amp;lpg=PA668&amp;dq=arabization+tribes+maghreb+banu+hilal#v=onepage&amp;q=arabization%20tribes%20maghreb%20banu%20hilal&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of African History 3-Volume Set|last=Shillington|first=Kevin|date=4 July 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135456702|location=|pages=668|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MVQlDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=arabization+tribes+maghreb+banu+hilal#v=onepage&amp;q=arabization%20tribes%20maghreb%20banu%20hilal&amp;f=false|title=Poems for the Millennium, Volume Four: The University of California Book of North African Literature|last=Joris|first=Pierre|last2=Tengour|first2=Habib|date=2012|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=9780520269132|location=|pages=42|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Berbers ruled the region until the 16th century (under such powerful dynasties as the [[Almoravids]], the [[Almohads]], [[Hafsids]], etc.), the arrival of these tribes eventually helped Arabize much of it ethnically, in addition to the linguistic and political impact on local non-Arabs.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

====Ottoman Empire====
{{Main|Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Caliphate}}
[[File:030Arab.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Arab Army]] in the [[Arabian Desert]] carrying the [[Flag of the Arab Revolt]]]]
From 1517 to 1918, much of the Arab world was under the suzerainty of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottomans defeated the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] in Cairo, and ended the Abbasid Caliphate. Arabs did not feel the change of administration because the Ottomans modeled their rule after the previous Arab administration systems.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In 1911, Arab intellectuals and politicians from throughout the Levant formed [[al-Fatat]] (&quot;the Young Arab Society&quot;), a small Arab nationalist club, in Paris. Its stated aim was &quot;raising the level of the Arab nation to the level of modern nations.&quot; In the first few years of its existence, al-Fatat called for greater autonomy within a unified Ottoman state rather than Arab independence from the empire. Al-Fatat hosted the [[Arab Congress of 1913]] in Paris, the purpose of which was to discuss desired reforms with other dissenting individuals from the Arab world. However, as the Ottoman authorities cracked down on the organization's activities and members, al-Fatat went underground and demanded the complete independence and unity of the Arab provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Choueiri166&quot;&gt;Choueiri, pp.166–168.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War I]], when the [[Ottoman Empire]] was overthrown by the [[British Empire]], former Ottoman colonies were divided up between the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[France|French]] as [[League of Nations mandate]]s.

===Modern period===
[[File:Arab World maps.png|thumb|A map of the Arab world]]
Arabs in modern times live in the Arab world, which comprises 22 countries in Western Asia, North Africa, and parts of the Horn of Africa. They are all modern states and became significant as distinct political entities after the fall and [[defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire (1908–1922)]].

==Identity==
{{Further|Arab identity}}
Arab identity is defined independently of [[religion|religious]] identity, and pre-dates the [[spread of Islam]], with historically attested [[Arab Christians|Arab Christian]] kingdoms and [[Jewish tribes of Arabia|Arab Jewish tribes]]. Today, however, most Arabs are Muslim, with a minority adhering to other faiths, largely [[Christianity in the Middle East|Christianity]], but also [[Druze]] and [[Bahá'í Faith|Baha'i]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t7Ao8dYsCskC&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| title=The Arabs in Israel|accessdate=4 March 2014|author=Ori Stendel|page=45|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1898723240| year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PmgkD3Hel5IC&amp;lpg=PA309&amp;pg=PA297#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Between Heaven and Hell: Islam, Salvation, and the Fate of Others|author=Mohammad Hassan Khalil|accessdate=1 March 2014|page=297|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199945412|date=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NE 565ad-Lakhmid.jpg|thumb|The Near East in 565, showing the Ghassanids, Lakhmids, Kindah and [[Hejaz]]]]
Today, the main unifying characteristic among Arabs is [[Arabic]], a [[Central Semitic languages|Central Semitic language]] from the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic language family]]. [[Modern Standard Arabic]] serves as the [[Standard language|standardized]] and [[literary language|literary]] variety of Arabic used in writing. The Arabs are first mentioned in the mid-ninth century BCE as a tribal people dwelling in the central Arabian Peninsula subjugated by [[Upper Mesopotamia]]-based state of Assyria. The Arabs appear to have remained largely under the vassalage of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–605 BCE), and then the succeeding [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] (605–539 BCE), Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] (539–332 BCE), [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]]/[[Seleucid Empire]] and [[Parthian Empire]].

Arab tribes, most notably the [[Ghassanids]] and [[Lakhmids]] begin to appear in the south Syrian deserts and southern Jordan from the mid 3rd century CE onwards, during the mid to later stages of the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Sasanian Empire]]. Also, before them the [[Nabataeans]] of Jordan and arguably the [[Royal family of Emesa|Emessans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowman|first1=Alan|last2=Garnsey|first2=Peter|last3=Cameron|first3=Averil|title=The Cambridge Ancient History: Volume 12, The Crisis of Empire, AD 193–337|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521301992|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MNSyT_PuYVMC&amp;pg=PA502&amp;dq=Emesa+dynasty+arab#v=onepage&amp;q=Emesa%20dynasty%20arab%20city&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Osroene|Edessans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowman|first1=Alan|last2=Garnsey|first2=Peter|last3=Cameron|first3=Averil|title=The Cambridge Ancient History: Volume 12, The Crisis of Empire, AD 193–337|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521301992|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MNSyT_PuYVMC&amp;pg=PA508&amp;dq=Abgar+arab#v=snippet&amp;q=%22arab%20principality%20of%20edessa%22&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hatra]]ns&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowman|first1=Alan|last2=Garnsey|first2=Peter|last3=Cameron|first3=Averil|title=The Cambridge Ancient History: Volume 12, The Crisis of Empire, AD 193–337|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521301992|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MNSyT_PuYVMC&amp;pg=PA500&amp;lpg=PA500&amp;dq=Hatran+arabs#v=onepage&amp;q=Hatran%20arabs&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; all appear to have been an Aramaic speaking ethnic Arabs who came to rule much of the pre-Islamic [[fertile crescent]] often as vassals of the two rival empires, the Sasanian (Persian) and the Byzantine (Eastern Roman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XjxyBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=arabs+ruled+the+fertile+crescent+as+vassals+of+persians+and+romans#v=onepage&amp;q=arabs%20ruled%20the%20fertile%20crescent%20as%20vassals%20of%20persians%20and%20romans&amp;f=false|quote=The Fertile Crescent, on the edges of northern Arabia, formed part of the frontier between the two rival empires of the day, the Sasanian (Persian) and the Byzantine (Eastern Roman).

{{Further|Tribes of Arabia}}
[[File:Map of Arabia 600 AD.svg|thumb|Approximate locations of certain [[tribes of Arabia]], including those descended from [[Adnan]], [[Hawazin]] and [[Quraysh]] at the dawn of Islam, 600 CE]]
Arabs in the narrow sense are the indigenous Arabians who trace their roots back to the [[tribes of Arabia]] and their immediate descendant groups in the Levant and North Africa. Within the people of the Arabian Peninsula, distinction is made between:
&quot;Perishing Arabs&quot; ({{lang-ar|الـعـرب الـبـائـدة}}) are ancient tribes of whose history little is known. They include [[ʿĀd]] ({{lang-ar|عَـاد}}),&lt;ref name=&quot;Cite quran|54|21|e=26|s=ns&quot;&gt;{{cite quran|54|21|e=26|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thamud|Thamûd]] ({{lang-ar|ثَـمُـود}},&lt;ref name=&quot;Cite quran|7|73|e=157|s=ns&quot;&gt;{{cite quran|7|73|e=157|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tasm, Jadis, Imlaq and others. Jadis and Tasm perished because of genocide. 'Aad and Thamud perished because of their decadence, as recorded in the Qur'an. Archaeologists have recently uncovered inscriptions that contain references to ''Iram dhāṫ al-'Imād'' ({{lang-ar|إِرَم ذَات الـعِـمَـاد}}, [[Iram of the Pillars]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Cite quran|54|21|e=26|s=ns&quot;/&gt; which was a major city of the 'Aad. Imlaq is the singular form of 'Amaleeq and is probably synonymous to the biblical [[Amalek]]. &quot;Pure Arabs&quot; ({{lang-ar|الـعـرب الـعـاربـة}}) or [[Qahtanites]] from [[Yemen]], taken to be descended from [[Ya'rub|Ya'rub ibn Yashjub ibn Qahtan]] and further from [[Hud (prophet)|Hud]]. &quot;Arabized Arabs&quot; ({{lang-ar|الـعـرب الـمـسـتـعـربـة}}) or [[Adnanites]], taken to be the descendants of [[Ishmael]] son of Abraham.

Arabians are most prevalent in the Arabian Peninsula, but are also found in large numbers in Mesopotamia ([[Arab tribes in Iraq]]), the Levant and Sinai ([[Negev Bedouin]], [[Tarabin bedouin]]), as well as the Maghreb (Eastern Libya, South Tunisia and South Algeria) and the Sudan region.[[File:Pre Islamic Arabia.PNG|thumb|left|Arabian tribes before the spread of Islam]]
This traditional division of the Arabs of Arabia may have arisen at the time of the [[First Fitna]]. Of the [[Arabian tribes that interacted with Muhammad]], the most prominent was the [[Quraysh]]. The Quraysh subclan, the [[Banu Hashim]], was the clan of Muhammad. During the early Muslim conquests and the [[Islamic Golden Age]], the political rulers of Islam were exclusively members of the Quraysh.

The Arab presence in Iran did not begin with the [[Arab conquest of Persia]] in 633 CE. For centuries, Iranian rulers had maintained contacts with Arabs outside their borders, dealt with Arab subjects and client states (such as those of Iraq and Yemen), and settled Arab tribesmen in various parts of the Iranian plateau. It follows that the &quot;Arab&quot; conquests and settlements were by no means the exclusive work of Arabs from the [[Hejaz]] and the tribesmen of inner Arabia. The Arab infiltration into Iran began before the Muslim conquests and continued as a result of the joint exertions of the civilized Arabs (ahl al-madar) as well as the desert Arabs (ahl al-wabar).&lt;ref name=IranicaDaniel&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Daniel |first=E. L. | title= Arab settlements in Iran | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica | accessdate=9 April 2011|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/arab-iii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest group of [[Iranian Arabs]] are the [[Ahwazi Arabs]], including [[Banu Ka'b]], [[Bani Turuf]] and the [[Musha'sha'iyyah]] sect. Smaller groups are the [[Khamseh]] nomads in [[Fars Province]] and the [[Arabs in Khorasan]].

The Arabs of the [[Levant]] are traditionally divided into [[Qays and Yaman tribes]]. This tribal division is likewise taken to date to the Umayyad period.

The Bedouins of western Egypt and eastern Libya are traditionally divided into [[Saʿada and Murabtin]], the Saʿada having higher social status. This may derive from a historical feudal system in which the Murabtin were vassals to the Saʿada
In [[Sudan]], there are numerous Arabic-speaking tribes, including the [[Shaigya]], [[Ja'alin]] and [[Shukria tribe|Shukria]], who are ancestrally related to the [[Nubian people|Nubians]]. These groups are collectively known as [[Sudanese Arabs]]. In addition, there are other Afroasiatic-speaking populations, such as [[Copts]] and [[Beja people|Beja]].
[[File:Chief of Mascara.jpg|thumb|Commander and Amir of [[Mascara, Algeria|Mascara]], [[Banu Hilal]]]]
The medieval [[Arab slave trade]] in the Sudan drove a wedge between the Arabic-speaking groups and the indigenous [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] populations. [[Slavery in contemporary Africa|Slavery]] substantially persists today along these lines.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Bruce S., ''A History of Race in Muslim West Africa, 1600–1960''. Cambridge University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It has contributed to ethnic conflict in the region, such as the [[Sudanese conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile]], [[Northern Mali conflict]], or the [[Boko Haram insurgency]].

The Arabs of the Maghreb are descendants of Arabian tribes of [[Banu Hilal]], the [[Banu Sulaym]] and the [[Maqil]] native of [[Middle East]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = François Decret, Les invasions hilaliennes en Ifrîqiya – Clio – Voyage Culturel|url = https://www.clio.fr/BIBLIOTHEQUE/les_invasions_hilaliennes_en_ifriqiya.asp|website = www.clio.fr|accessdate = 28 September 2015|last = Clio}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of other tribes native to [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Yemen]] and [[Iraq]]. Arabs and [[Arabic]]-speakers inhabit plains and cities. The [[Banu Hilal]] spent almost a century in [[Egypt]] before moving to [[Libya]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Algeria]], and another century later some moved to [[Morocco]], it is logical to think that they are mixed with inhabitants of [[Egypt]] and with [[Libya]].&lt;ref&gt;Histoire des Berbères et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique septentrionale par Ibn Khaldoun&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
The total number of Arabic speakers living in the [[Arab League|Arab nations]] is estimated at 366 million by the [[CIA Factbook]] (as of 2014). The estimated number of Arabs in countries outside the Arab League is estimated at 17.5 million, yielding a total of close to 384 million.

According to the [[Charter of the Arab League]] (also known as the ''Pact of the League of Arab States''), the League of Arab States is composed of independent Arab states that are signatories to the Charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pact of the League of Arab States, March 22, 1945|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/arableag.asp|publisher=Yale Law School|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although all Arab states have Arabic as an official language, there are many non-Arabic-speaking populations native to the Arab world. Among these are [[Berbers]], [[Toubou people|Toubou]], [[Nubians]], [[Jews]], [[Kurds]], [[Armenians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tadmouri2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ghazi O.

Iraq, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Oman have a Persian speaking minority. The same countries also have Hindi-Urdu speakers and [[Filipinos]] as sizable minority. Balochi speakers are a good size minority in Oman. Additionally, countries like Bahrain, UAE, Oman and Kuwait have significant non-Arab and non-Muslim minorities (10–20%) like [[Hindus]] and [[Christians]] from [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]] and the [[Philippines]].

[[File:The Syrian colony, Washington Street.jpg|thumb|Syrian immigrants in [[New York City]], as depicted in 1895]]
[[Arab diaspora]] refers to descendants of the [[Arab people|Arab]] [[Emigration|immigrants]] who, voluntarily or as refugees, emigrated from their native lands in non-Arab countries, primarily in [[East Africa]], [[South America]], [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Australia]] and parts of [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Caribbean]], and [[West Africa]]. According to the [[International Organization for Migration]], there are 13 million first-generation Arab migrants in the world, of which 5.8 million reside in Arab countries. Arab expatriates contribute to the circulation of financial and human capital in the region and thus significantly promote regional development. In 2009, Arab countries received a total of 35.1 billion USD in [[remittance]] in-flows and remittances sent to [[Jordan]], [[Egypt]] and [[Lebanon]] from other Arab countries are 40 to 190 per cent higher than trade revenues between these and other Arab countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egypt.iom.int/Doc/IOM%20Intra%20regional%20labour%20mobility%20in%20Arab%20region%20Facts%20and%20Figures%20(English).pdf Intra-Regional Labour Mobility in the Arab World], International Organization for Migration (IOM) Cairo&lt;/ref&gt; The 250,000 strong Lebanese community in [[West Africa]] is the largest non-African group in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lebanese in west Africa: Far from home |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/baobab/2011/05/lebanese_west_africa|newspaper=The Economist|date=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tenacity and risk – the Lebanese in West Africa |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8479134.stm|newspaper=BBC News|date=10 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arab traders have long operated in [[Southeast Asia]] and along the East Africa's [[Swahili coast]].

Another important and unifying characteristic of Arabs is a common [[language]]. [[Arabic]] is a [[Semitic language]] of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic Family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.academia.edu/18470301|title=Al-Jallad.

Arabic has developed into at least two distinct forms. [[Classical Arabic]] is the form of the [[Arabic language]] used in literary texts from [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] times (7th to 9th centuries). It is based on the medieval dialects of [[Tribes of Arabia|Arab tribes]]. [[Modern Standard Arabic]] (MSA) is the direct descendant used today throughout the [[Arab world]] in writing and in formal speaking, for example, prepared speeches, some radio broadcasts, and non-entertainment content,{{sfn|Bin-Muqbil|2006|p=14}} while the [[Lexis (linguistics)|lexis]] and [[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]] of [[Modern Standard Arabic]] are different from [[Classical Arabic]]. Colloquial Arabic, an informal spoken language, varies by dialect from region to region; various forms of the language are in use today and provide an important force for Arab cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arabs facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Arabs|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/anthropology-and-archaeology/people/arabs|website=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most obvious symbol of Arabian mythology is the [[Jinn]] or genie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=jinni {{!}} Arabian mythology|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/jinni|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jinns are supernatural beings of varying degrees of power. They possess free will (that is, they can choose to be good or evil) and come in two flavors. There are the Marids, usually described as the most powerful type of Jinn. These are the type of genie with the ability to grant wishes to humans. However, granting these wishes is not free. The Quran says that the ''jinn'' were created from &quot;mārijin min nar&quot; (''smokeless fire'' or ''a mixture of fire''; scholars explained, this is the part of the flame, which mixed with ''the blackness of fire'').&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin W.

[[Al-Jahiz]] (born 776, in [[Basra]] – December 868/January 869) was an Arab prose writer and author of works of literature, [[Mu'tazili]] theology, and politico-religious polemics. A leading scholar in the Abassid Caliphate, his canon includes two hundred books on various subjects, including [[Arabic grammar]], [[zoology]], poetry, lexicography, and [[rhetoric]]. Of his writings, only thirty books survive. Al-Jāḥiẓ was also one of the first Arabian writers to suggest a complete overhaul of the language's grammatical system, though this would not be undertaken until his fellow linguist [[Ibn Maḍāʾ]] took up the matter two hundred years later.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shawqi Daif]], Introduction to Ibn Mada's ''Refutation of the Grammarians'', pg. 48.

The three main regions, also known as the [[Maghreb]], the [[Mashriq]], and the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Khaleej]] have many similarities, but also many unique traditions. These kitchens have been influenced by the climate, cultivating possibilities, as well as trading possibilities. The kitchens of the Maghreb and [[Levant]] are relatively young kitchens which were developed over the past centuries. The kitchen from the Khaleej region is a very old kitchen. The kitchens can be divided into the [[Urban area|urban]] and [[Rural area|rural]] kitchens.

[[Arab cuisine]] mostly follows one of three culinary traditions – from the Maghreb, the Levant or the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf states]]. In the Maghreb countries ([[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Libya]]) traditional main meals are [[tajine]]s or dishes using [[couscous]]. In the [[Levant]] ([[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]]) main meals usually start with [[Meze|mezze]] – small dishes of dips and other items which are eaten with bread. This is typically followed by skewers of grilled lamb or chicken. Gulf cuisine, tends to be more highly spiced with more use of rice. Sometimes a lamb is roasted and served whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;Food and recipes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Food and recipes|url=http://al-bab.com/special-topics/food-and-recipes|website=al-bab.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arabic art]] takes on many forms, though it is [[jewelry]], [[textile]]s and [[architecture]] that are the most well-known. It is generally split up by different eras, among them being [[History of the Arabic alphabet|early Arabic]], [[early medieval]], [[late medieval]], [[Arabic|late Arabic]], and finally, current Arabic.

Arabic writing is done from right to left, and was generally written in dark inks, with certain things embellished with special colored inks (red, green, gold). In early Arabic and [[Early Middle Ages|early Medieval]], writing was typically done on parchment made of animal skin. The ink showed up very well on it, and occasionally the parchment was dyed a separate color and brighter ink was used (this was only for special projects).

an extension of the earlier phase, it left also heavy impact on the [[Islamic architecture|architecture]] of other nations. Arab Architecture also encompasses a wide range of both secular and religious styles from the [[History of Islam|foundation of Islam]] to the present day.

[[Arabic music]], while independent and flourishing in the 2010s, has a long history of interaction with many other regional musical styles and genres.

By the 1970s several other singers had followed suit and a strand of [[Arabic pop]] was born. Arabic pop usually consists of Western styled songs with Arabic instruments and lyrics.

[[Arabic Philosophy|Arabic philosophy]] refers to philosophical thought in the Arab world. Schools of Arabic thought include [[Avicennism]] and [[Averroism]]. The first great Arab thinker is widely regarded to be [[al-Kindi]] (801–873 A.D.), a [[Neo-Platonic]] philosopher, [[mathematician]] and [[scientist]] who lived in [[Kufa]] and [[Baghdad]] (modern day [[Iraq]]). After being appointed by the [[Abbasid Caliphs]] to translate [[Greeks|Greek]] scientific and [[philosophical]] texts into [[Arabic]], he wrote a number of original treatises of his own on a range of subjects, from [[metaphysics]] and [[ethic]]s to [[mathematic]]s and [[pharmacology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arabic philosophy|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Arabic-philosophy|website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of his [[Philosophy|philosophical]] output focuses on [[Theology|theological]] subjects such as the nature of [[God]], the [[soul]] and [[Prophecy|prophetic]] knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arabic Philosophy – General – The Basics of Philosophy|url=http://www.philosophybasics.com/general_eastern_arabic.html|website=Philosophybasics.com|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctrines of the Arabic philosophers of the 9th–12th century who influenced medieval [[Scholasticism]] in Europe. The Arabic tradition combines [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]] with other ideas introduced through [[Islam]]. Influential thinkers include the Persians [[al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna]]. The Arabic philosophic literature was translated into [[Hebrew]] and [[Latin]], this contributed to the development of modern European philosophy. The Arabic tradition was developed by [[Moses Maimonides]] and [[Ibn Khaldun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Street|first1=Tony|title=Arabic and Islamic Philosophy of Language and Logic|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arabic-islamic-language/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|date=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arabic and Islamic Philosophy – Bibliography – PhilPapers|url=https://philpapers.org/browse/arabic-and-islamic-philosophy|website=philpapers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a century after Muhammed's death (632 CE), an empire ruled by Arabs was established. It encompassed a large part of the planet, stretching from southern Europe to [[North Africa]] to [[Central Asia]] and on to [[India]]. In 711 CE, Arab Muslims invaded southern Spain; [[al-Andalus]] was a center of Arabic scientific accomplishment. Another center emerged in [[Baghdad]] from the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]], who ruled part of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] during a historic period later characterized as the &quot;[[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age]]&quot; (∼750 to 1258 CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/rediscovering-arabic-science|title=Rediscovering Arabic Science {{!}} Muslim Heritage|website=Muslimheritage.com|access-date=18 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220185540/http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/rediscovering-arabic-science|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Battani]] (c. 858 – 929; born [[Harran]], [[Bilad al-Sham]]) was an Arab astronomer, astrologer and mathematician of the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. His work is considered instrumental in the development of science and astronomy. One of Al-Battani's best-known achievements in astronomy was the determination of the solar year as being 365 days, 5 hours, 46 minutes and 24 seconds which is only 2 minutes and 22 seconds off.&lt;ref name=MacTutor&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Al-Battani|title=Abu Abdallah Mohammad ibn Jabir Al-Battani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) used experimentation to obtain the results in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021), an important development in the [[history of scientific method|history of the scientific method]]. He combined [[observation]]s, [[experiment]]s and [[Rationality|rational]] arguments to support his intromission theory of [[visual perception|vision]], in which [[Ray (optics)|rays]] of [[light]] are emitted from objects rather than from the eyes. He used similar arguments to show that the ancient [[Emission theory (vision)|emission theory of vision]] supported by [[Ptolemy]] and [[Euclid]] (in which the eyes emit the rays of light used for seeing), and the ancient [[intromission theory]] supported by [[Aristotle]] (where objects emit physical particles to the eyes), were both wrong.&lt;ref&gt;[[D.

The birth of the University institution can be traced to this development, as several universities and educational institutions of the Arab world such as the [[University of Al Quaraouiyine]], [[Al Azhar University]], and [[University of Ez-Zitouna|Al Zaytuna University]] are considered to be the oldest in the world. Founded by [[Fatima al-Fihri|Fatima al Fihri]] in 859, the University of Al Quaraouiyine in [[Fez]] is the oldest existing, continually operating and the first [[Academic degree|degree]] awarding educational institution in the world according to [[UNESCO]] and [[Guinness World Records]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/3000/oldest-university|title=Oldest university|website=Guinnessworldrecords.com|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medina of Fez|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/170|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is sometimes referred to as the oldest university.&lt;ref&gt;Verger, Jacques: &quot;Patterns&quot;, in: Ridder-Symoens, Hilde de (ed.): ''A History of the University in Europe.

Under [[Ottoman rule]], cultural life and science in the [[Arab world]] declined. In the 20th and 21st centuries, Arabs who have won important science prizes include [[Ahmed Zewail]] and [[Elias Corey]] ([[Nobel Prize]]), [[Michael DeBakey]] and [[Alim Louis Benabid|Alim Benabid]] ([[Lasker Award]]), [[Omar M.

=== Wedding and marriage ===
{{main|Arabic wedding}}
[[File:Tatouage au Henné, Maroc.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henna]] tattoo in [[Morocco]]]]
[[Arabic wedding]]s have changed greatly in the past 100 years. Original traditional Arabic weddings are supposed to be very similar to modern-day [[Bedouin]] weddings and rural weddings, and they are in some cases unique from one region to another, even within the same [[Arab world|country]]. The practice of [[Marriage|marrying]] of relatives is a common feature of [[Arab culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding the Arab culture : a practical cross-cultural guide to working in the Arab world|last=Jehad.|first=Al-Omari|date=1 January 2008|publisher=How To Books|isbn=978-1848036468|oclc=408662262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Arab world]] today between 40% and 50% of all marriages are [[consanguineous]] or between close family members, though these figures may vary among Arab nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middleeasthealthmag.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi?http://www.middleeasthealthmag.com/may2012/feature2.htm|title=Middle East Health Magazine|website=Middleeasthealthmag.com|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid24294299&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bener A, Dafeeah EE, Samson N |title=Does consanguinity increase the risk of schizophrenia?

There are four principal West Eurasian autosomal DNA components that characterize the populations in the Arab world: the Arabian, Levantine, Coptic and Maghrebi components.

The Arabian component is the main autosomal element in the [[Persian Gulf]] region. It is most closely associated with local Arabic-speaking populations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haber2013&quot;/&gt; The Arabian component is also found at significant frequencies in parts of the Levant and Northeast Africa.&lt;ref name=Haber2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Henn2012&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Brenna M.

The Levantine component is the main autosomal element in the [[Near East]] and [[Caucasus]]. It peaks among [[Druze people|Druze]] populations in the Levant. The Levantine component diverged from the Arabian component about 15,500–23,700 ypb.&lt;ref name=Haber2013/&gt;

The Coptic component is the main autosomal element in [[Northeast Africa]]. It peaks among [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] [[Copts]] in [[Sudan]], and is also found at high frequencies among other Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations in the [[Nile Valley]] and the Horn of Africa.&lt;ref name=Dobon2015&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Begoña Dobon |author2=Hisham Y.
