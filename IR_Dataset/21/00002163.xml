In [[Greek mythology]], '''Aeolus'''&lt;ref&gt;Chaucer's ''Eolus'' ([http://www.columbia.edu/dlc/garland/deweever/E/eolus.htm de Weever, Jacqueline (1996). ''Chaucer Name Dictionary'', ''s.v.'' &quot;Eolus&quot;. (Garland Publishing)] Retrieved on 2009-10-06&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPAc-en|iː|ˈ|oʊ|l|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc|Αἴολος}}, ''Aiolos'' {{IPA-el|a͜ɪ́olos|}}, [[Greek language|Modern Greek]]: {{IPA-el|ˈe.o.los||Ell-Aiolos.ogg}} &quot;quick-moving, nimble&quot;) is a name shared by three mythical characters. These three personages are often difficult to tell apart, and even the ancient mythographers appear to have been perplexed about which Aeolus was which. [[Diodorus Siculus]] made an attempt to define each of these three (although it is clear that he also became muddled), and his opinion is followed here.&lt;ref name=&quot;dgrbm&quot;&gt;{{Citation

* The first [[Aeolus (son of Hellen)|Aeolus]] was a son of [[Hellen]] and [[eponym]]ous founder of the Aeolian race.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Pseudo-Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022&amp;layout=&amp;loc=1.7.3 ''Bibliotheca'' 1.7.3]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second [[Aeolus (son of Poseidon)|Aeolus]] was a son of [[Poseidon]], who led a colony to islands in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 238 &amp; 242&lt;/ref&gt;
* The third [[Aeolus (son of Hippotes)|Aeolus]] was a son of [[Hippotes]] who is mentioned in ''[[Odyssey]]'' and the ''[[Aeneid]]'' as the Keeper of the [[Anemoi|Winds]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' 10.2&lt;/ref&gt;

All three men named Aeolus appear to be connected genealogically, although the precise relationship, especially regarding the second and third Aeolus, is often ambiguous as their identities seem to have been merged by many ancient writers.

Aeolus was also the name of the following minor characters:
* Aeolus was a defender of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] against the [[Seven Against Thebes]]. He was killed by [[Parthenopeus|Parthenopaeus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Statius]], ''[[Thebaid (Greek poem)|Thebaid]]'' 9.765&lt;/ref&gt;
* Aeolus was a [[Troy|Trojan]], companion of [[Aeneas]] in [[Italy]], where he was killed by [[Turnus]], King of the [[Rutuli]]ans. Aeolus was father of [[Clytius]] and [[Misenus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' 6.163 ff., 9.774 &amp; 12.542&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Otherwise unknown to fame&quot;, he survived both the Greeks and Achilles at Troy, and [[Richard F. Thomas]] pointed out textual parallels between this passage and the ''[[Illiad]]'', book 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GvxODgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA278 |last=Thomas |first=Richard F. |authorlink=Richard F.
