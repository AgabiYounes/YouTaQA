{{About|a fictional communication device||Ansible (disambiguation)}}
An '''ansible''' is a category of fictional device or technology capable of near-instantaneous or [[faster-than-light communication|superluminal communication]]. It can send and receive messages to and from a corresponding device over any distance or obstacle whatsoever with no delay, even between star systems. As a name for such a device, the word &quot;ansible&quot; first appeared in a 1966 novel by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]. Since that time, the term has been broadly used in the works of numerous science fiction authors, across a variety of settings and continuities.&lt;ref name=Sheidlower/&gt;

== Coinage by Ursula Le Guin ==
[[Ursula K. Le Guin]] [[neologism|coined]] the word &quot;ansible&quot; in her 1966 novel ''[[Rocannon's World]]''.&lt;ref name=Sheidlower/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bernardo/&gt; The word was a contraction of &quot;answerable&quot;, as the device would allow its users to receive answers to their messages in a reasonable amount of time, even over [[interstellar communication|interstellar]] distances.&lt;ref name=Quinion/&gt;

Although Le Guin invented the name &quot;ansible&quot; for this type of device, fleshed out with specific details in her fictional works, the broader concept of instantaneous or [[faster-than-light communication]] had previously existed in science fiction. For example, similar communication functions were included in a device called an [[interocitor]] in the 1952 novel ''[[This Island Earth (novel)|This Island Earth]]'' by [[Raymond F. Jones]], and [[This Island Earth|the 1955 film]] based on that novel, and in the &quot;Dirac Communicator&quot;, which first appeared in [[James Blish]]'s short story &quot;Beep&quot; (1954), which was later expanded into the novel ''[[The Quincunx of Time]]'' (1973).&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, Peter &quot;Dirac Communicator&quot; in [[John Clute|Clute, John]] and Nicholls, Peter eds. (1995) ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]''. New York: St. Martin's Griffin p.337. {{isbn|0-312-13486-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Le Guin's works ==
In her subsequent works, Le Guin continued to develop the concept of the ansible:

* ''[[The Dispossessed]]'', Le Guin's award-winning 1974 novel in the [[Hainish Cycle]], tells of the invention of the ansible.&lt;ref name=LeGuin1974/&gt;

* In ''[[The Word for World Is Forest]]'', Le Guin explains that in order for communication to work with any pair of ansibles, at least one &quot;must be on a large-mass body, the other can be anywhere in the cosmos.&quot;

* In ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'', it is stated that the ansible &quot;doesn't involve radio waves, or any form of energy. The principle it works on, the constant of [[simultaneity]], is analogous in some ways to [[gravity]]&amp;nbsp;... One point has to be fixed, on a planet of certain mass, but the other end is portable.&quot;

Any ansible may be used to communicate through any other, by setting its coordinates to those of the receiving ansible. They have a limited [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] which only allows for at most a few hundred characters of text to be communicated in any transaction of a dialog session, and are attached to a keyboard and small display to perform text messaging.

== Use by later authors ==
Since Le Guin's conception of the ansible, the name of the device has been borrowed by numerous authors. While Le Guin's ansible was said to communicate &quot;instantaneously&quot;,&lt;ref name=LeGuin1974/&gt; the name has also been adopted for devices capable of communication at finite speeds that are faster than light.

=== Orson Scott Card's works ===
[[Orson Scott Card]], in his 1977 novelette and 1985 novel ''[[Ender's Game]]'' and [[Ender's Game (series)|its sequels]], used the term &quot;ansible&quot; as an unofficial name for the philotic parallax instantaneous communicator, a machine capable of communicating across infinite distances with no time delay.&lt;ref name=Card1977/&gt; In ''Ender's Game'', a character stated that &quot;somebody dredged the name ''ansible'' out of an old book somewhere.&quot;&lt;ref name=Card1977/&gt;

In the universe of the [[Ender's Game (series)|''Ender's Game'' series]], the ansible's functions involved a fictional subatomic particle, the philote.&lt;ref name=Card1991/&gt; The two [[quark]]s inside a [[pion|pi meson]] can be separated by an arbitrary distance, while remaining connected by &quot;philotic rays&quot;.&lt;ref name=Card1991/&gt; This concept is similar to [[quantum teleportation]] due to [[quantum entanglement|entanglement]]; however, in reality, [[quark confinement]] prevents quarks from being separated by any observable distance.

Card's version of the ansible was also featured in the video game ''[[Advent Rising]]'', for which Card helped write the story, and in the movie ''[[Ender's Game (film)|Ender's Game]]'', which was based on the book.&lt;ref name=EnderScript/&gt;

=== Other writers ===
Numerous other writers have included faster-than-light communication devices in their fictional works. Notable examples include:
* [[Vernor Vinge]], in the 1988 short story &quot;The Blabber&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vinge&quot;/&gt;
* [[Elizabeth Moon]], in the 1995 novel ''[[Winning Colors (novel)|Winning Colors]]''&lt;ref name=Moon1995/&gt;
* [[Philip Pullman]], in the 2000 novel ''[[The Amber Spyglass]]'', part of the ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' trilogy.
* [[Jason Jones (programmer)|Jason Jones]], in the 1995 computer game ''[[Marathon 2: Durandal]]''&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt;
* [[L.A. Graf]], in the 1996 ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' novel ''Time's Enemy''&lt;ref name=Graf1996/&gt;
* [[Neal Asher]], in his Polity series of novels including ''[[Gridlinked]]'' (2001), in which the [[runcible]], named in homage to the ansible, is an interstellar wormhole generator/teleporter
* [[Dan Simmons]], in the 2003 novel ''[[Ilium (novel)|Ilium]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;Simmons&quot;/&gt;
* [[Kim Stanley Robinson]], in the 2012 novel ''[[2312 (novel)|2312]]''&lt;ref name=Robinson2012/&gt;
* [[Becky Chambers (author)|Becky Chambers]], in the 2014 novel ''[[The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet]]''
* [[J._M._McDermott|Joe M. McDermott]], in the 2017 novel ''The Fortress at the End of Time''&lt;ref name=McDermott2017/&gt;
* [[Remigiusz Mróz]], in the 2014 space-opera ''[[The Chorus of Forgotten Voices]]'' ''(Chór zapomnianych głosów)''
