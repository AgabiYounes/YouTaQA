'''Armadillos''' (meaning &quot;little armoured one&quot; in Spanish) are [[New World]] [[placental]] [[mammal]]s in the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Cingulata]]. The [[Chlamyphoridae]] and [[Dasypodidae]] are the only surviving [[family (biology)|families]] in the order, which is part of the superorder [[Xenarthra]], along with the [[anteater]]s and [[sloth]]s. Nine [[extinct taxon|extinct]] [[genus|genera]] and 21 extant [[species]] of armadillo have been described, some of which are distinguished by the number of bands on their armour. All species are native to the [[Americas]], where they inhabit a variety of different environments. 
 
Armadillos are characterized by a leathery [[armour (anatomy)|armour]] shell and long sharp claws for digging. They have short legs, but can move quite quickly. The average length of an armadillo is about {{convert|75|cm|in|abbr=on}}, including tail. The [[giant armadillo]] grows up to {{convert|150|cm|in|abbr=on}} and weighs up to {{convert|54|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, while the [[pink fairy armadillo]] has a length of only {{convert|13|–|15|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}. When threatened by a predator, Tolypeutes species frequently roll up into a ball.

==Etymology==
The word ''armadillo'' means &quot;little armoured one&quot; in Spanish. The [[Aztecs]] called them ''āyōtōchtli'' {{IPA-nah|aːjoːˈtoːt͡ʃt͡ɬi|}}, [[Nahuatl]] for &quot;turtle-rabbit&quot;: ''āyōtl'' {{IPA-nah|ˈaːjoːt͡ɬ|}} (turtle) and ''tōchtli'' {{IPA-nah|ˈtoːt͡ʃt͡ɬi|}} (rabbit).&lt;ref name=Karttunen1983&gt;{{cite book |last=Karttunen |first=Frances E. |authorlink=Frances E.

==Evolution==
Recent genetic research suggests that an extinct group of giant armoured mammals, the [[glyptodont]]s, should be included within the lineage of armadillos, having diverged some 35 million years ago, much more recently than previously assumed.&lt;ref name =AMNH2016&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/explore/news-blogs/research-posts/study-finds-relationship-between-glyptodonts-modern-armadillos|title=Study finds relationship between glyptodonts, armadillos|publisher=AMNH|accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
Like all of the Xenarthra lineages, armadillos originated in South America. Due to the continent's former isolation, they were confined there for most of the [[Cenozoic]]. The recent formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] allowed a few members of the family to migrate northward into southern North America by the early [[Pleistocene]], as part of the [[Great American Interchange]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodburne2010&quot;/&gt; (Some of their much larger [[Cingulata|cingulate]] relatives, the [[pampathere]]s and chlamyphorid [[glyptodont]]s, made the same journey.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodburne2010&quot;/&gt;

Today, all extant armadillo species are still present in South America. They are particularly diverse in [[Paraguay]] (where 11 species exist) and surrounding areas. Many species are endangered. Some, including four species of ''[[Dasypus]]'', are widely distributed over the Americas, whereas others, such as [[Yepes's mulita]], are restricted to small ranges. Two species, the [[northern naked-tailed armadillo]] and [[nine-banded armadillo]], are found in Central America; the latter has also reached the United States, primarily in the south-central states (notably Texas), but with a range that extends as far east as [[North Carolina]] and [[Florida]], and as far north as southern [[Nebraska]] and southern [[Indiana]].&lt;ref name=ExpRange/&gt; Their range has consistently expanded in North America over the last century due to a lack of natural predators.

==Characteristics ==
===Size===
Armadillos are small to medium-sized mammals. The smallest species, the pink fairy armadillo, is roughly [[chipmunk]]-sized at {{convert|85|g|oz|abbr=on}} and {{convert|13|-|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} in total length. The largest species, the giant armadillo, can be the size of a small [[pig]] and weigh up to {{convert|54|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, and can be {{convert|150|cm|in|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name=NatGeo/&gt;
 
===Diet and predation===
They are prolific diggers. Many species use their sharp claws to dig for food, such as [[Larva|grubs]], and to dig dens. The nine-banded armadillo prefers to build burrows in moist soil near the creeks, streams, and [[arroyo (creek)|arroyos]] around which it lives and feeds. The diets of different armadillo species vary, but consist mainly of [[insect]]s, grubs, and other [[invertebrate]]s. Some species, however, feed almost entirely on ants and termites.
[[File:Mani armadilli.png|thumb|right|Paws of a hairy and a giant armadillo]]
Armadillos have very poor eyesight, and use their keen sense of smell to hunt for food.&lt;ref name=NatGeo/&gt; They use their claws for digging and finding food, as well as for making their homes in burrows. They dig their burrows with their claws, making only a single corridor the width of the animal's body. They have five clawed toes on their hind feet, and three to five toes with heavy digging claws on their fore feet. Armadillos have numerous cheek teeth which are not divided into [[premolar]]s and [[molar (tooth)|molar]]s, but usually have no [[incisor]]s or [[canine (tooth)|canine]]s. The [[dentition]] of the nine-banded armadillo is P 7/7, M 1/1 = 32.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeman&amp;Genoways&quot;/&gt;

===Body temperature===
In common with other xenarthrans, armadillos, in general, have low [[Thermoregulation|body temperature]]s of {{convert|33|-|36|C}} and low [[basal metabolic rate]]s (40–60% of that expected in placental mammals of their mass). This is particularly true of types that specialize in using termites as their primary food source (for example, ''[[Priodontes]]'' and ''[[Tolypeutes]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;McNab&quot;/&gt;

===Skin===
The armour is formed by [[plate (anatomy)|plates]] of [[dermal bone]] covered in relatively small, overlapping epidermal scales called &quot;[[scute]]s&quot;, composed of bone with a covering of horn. Most species have rigid shields over the shoulders and hips, with a number of bands separated by flexible skin covering the back and flanks. Additional armour covers the top of the head, the upper parts of the limbs, and the tail. The underside of the animal is never armoured, and is simply covered with soft skin and fur.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoM&quot;/&gt;

This armour-like skin appears to be the main defense of many armadillos, although most escape predators by fleeing (often into thorny patches, from which their armour protects them) or digging to safety. Only the South American three-banded armadillos (''Tolypeutes'') rely heavily on their armour for protection. 

===Defensive behavior===
When threatened by a [[predator]], ''Tolypeutes'' species frequently roll up into a ball. Other armadillo species cannot roll up because they have too many plates. The North American nine-banded armadillo tends to jump straight in the air when surprised, so consequently often collides with the undercarriage or fenders of passing vehicles to its demise.&lt;ref name=LOC/&gt;

===Movement===
Armadillos have short legs, but can move quite quickly.  The nine-banded armadillo is noted for its movement through water&lt;ref name=McDonough2013/&gt; which is accomplished via two different methods: it can walk underwater for short distances, holding its breath for as long as six minutes; also, to cross larger bodies of water, it is capable of increasing its buoyancy by swallowing air, inflating its stomach and intestines.&lt;ref name=Vijayaraghavan/&gt;

===Reproduction===
[[Gestation]] lasts from 60 to 120 days, depending on species, although the nine-banded armadillo also exhibits [[delayed implantation]], so the young are not typically born for eight months after mating. Most members of the genus ''Dasypus'' give birth to four [[monozygotic]] young (that is, identical quadruplets),&lt;ref name=Bagatto2000/&gt; but other species may have typical litter sizes that range from one to eight. The young are born with soft, leathery skin which hardens within a few weeks. They reach sexual maturity in three to twelve months, depending on the species. Armadillos are solitary animals that do not share their burrows with other adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoM&quot; /&gt;

==Armadillos and humans==

===In science===
====Disease====
Armadillos are often used in the study of [[leprosy]], since they, along with mangabey monkeys, rabbits, and mice (on their footpads), are among the few known species that can contract the disease systemically. They are particularly susceptible due to their unusually low body temperature, which is hospitable to the leprosy bacterium, ''[[Mycobacterium leprae]]''. (The leprosy bacterium is difficult to culture and armadillos have a body temperature of {{convert|34|C}}, similar to human skin.) &lt;ref name=&quot;Truman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Truman|first1=Richard|title=Leprosy in wild armadillos|journal=Leprosy Review|date=2005|volume=76|issue=3|pages=198–208|url=http://www.lepra.org.uk/platforms/lepra/files/lr/sept05/lep198-208.pdf|accessdate=4 May 2017|pmid=16248207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans can acquire a leprosy infection from armadillos by handling them or consuming armadillo meat.&lt;ref name=NYT2011/&gt; Armadillos are a presumed [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] and [[natural reservoir]] for the disease in Texas and Louisiana and Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Zoonotic Leprosy in the Southeastern United States|first1=Rahul|last1=Sharma|first2=Pushpendra|last2=Singh|first3=W.J.|last3=Loughry|first4=J. Mitchell|last4=Lockhart|first5=W. Barry|last5=Inman|first6=Malcolm S.|last6=Duthie|first7=Maria T.|last7=Pena|first8=Luis A.|last8=Marcos|first9=David M.|last9=Scollard|first10=Stewart T.|last10=Cole|first11=Richard W.|last11=Truman|date=1 December 2015|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|volume=21|issue=12|pages=2127–2134|doi=10.3201/eid2112.150501|pmid=26583204|pmc=4672434}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Truman 2011&quot;/&gt; Prior to the [[European colonization of the Americas|arrival of Europeans in the late 15th century]], leprosy was unknown in the New World. Given that armadillos are native to the New World, at some point they must have acquired the disease from old-world humans.&lt;ref name=NYT2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Truman 2011&quot; /&gt;

The armadillo is also a [[natural reservoir]] for [[Chagas disease]].&lt;ref name=Yaeger1988/&gt;

====Reproduction====
The nine-banded armadillo also serves science through its unusual reproductive system, in which four genetically identical offspring are born, the result of one original egg.&lt;ref name=&quot;ufl&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;valdosta&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamlett1933&quot;/&gt; Because they are always genetically identical, the group of four young provides a good subject for scientific, behavioral, or medical tests that need consistent biological and genetic makeup in the test subjects. This is the only reliable manifestation of [[polyembryony]] in the class [[Mammalia]], and exists only within the genus ''Dasypus'' and not in all armadillos, as is commonly believed. Other species that display this trait include parasitoid wasps, certain flatworms, and various aquatic invertebrates.&lt;ref name=&quot;valdosta&quot; /&gt;

====Education====
Armadillos (mainly ''Dasypus'') are common [[roadkill]] due to their habit of jumping 3–4&amp;nbsp;ft vertically when startled, which puts them into collision with the underside of vehicles. Wildlife enthusiasts are using the northward march of the armadillo as an opportunity to educate others about the animals, which can be a burrowing nuisance to property owners and managers.&lt;ref name=&quot;ufl&quot; /&gt;

===As musical instruments===
{{main article|Charango}}
Armadillo shells have traditionally been used to make the back of the ''[[charango]]'', an [[Andean music|Andean]] [[lute]] instrument.

=== As food ===
In certain parts of [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], armadillo meat is eaten; it is a popular ingredient in [[Oaxaca|Oaxaca, Mexico]]. During the [[Great Depression]], Americans were known to eat armadillo, known begrudgingly as &quot;Hoover hogs,&quot; a nod to the belief that [[Herbert Hoover]] was responsible for the economic despair facing the nation at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://armadillo-online.org/food.html|title=Armadillos as Food|website=armadillo-online.org|access-date=2019-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2004/summer/hoover-2.html|title=The Ordeal of Herbert Hoover, Part 2|date=2016-08-15|website=National Archives|language=en|access-date=2019-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
