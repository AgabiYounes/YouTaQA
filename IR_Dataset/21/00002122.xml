&lt;!-- &quot;Astrology&quot; is an uncountable noun, and it is used as such throughout the lead. It is not meant to suggest a connection between unrelated astrological systems (e.g. Chinese and Mayan), each of which could be referred to as &quot;astrology&quot;. --&gt;

'''Astrology''' is a [[pseudoscience]] that claims to divine information about human affairs and terrestrial events by studying the movements and relative positions of celestial objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Oxford University Press| title = astrology| encyclopedia = Oxford Dictionary of English| accessdate = 11 December 2015| url = https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/astrology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Merriam-Webster Inc.| title = astrology| encyclopedia = Merriam-Webster Dictionary| accessdate = 11 December 2015| url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/astrology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy |first1=Nicholas |last1=Bunnin |first2=Jiyuan |last2=Yu |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2008 |p=57 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LdbxabeToQYC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=dictionary+philosophy+astrology#v=onepage&amp;q=dictionary%20philosophy%20astrology&amp;f=false|isbn=9780470997215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thagard&quot; /&gt; Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium BCE, and has its roots in [[Calendrical calculation|calendrical]] systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koch-Westenholz 1995 Foreword, 11&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Koch-Westenholz |first=Ulla |title=Mesopotamian astrology: an introduction to Babylonian and Assyrian celestial divination |year=1995 |publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press |location=Copenhagen |isbn=978-87-7289-287-0 |pages=Foreword, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and some—such as the [[Hindu astrology|Hindus]], [[Chinese astrology|Chinese]], and the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]—developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations.

Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and the [[Hindu astrology|Indians]], [[Chinese astrology|Chinese]], and [[Maya civilization|Maya]] developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. In the West, astrology most often consists of a system of [[horoscope]]s purporting to explain aspects of a person's [[personality]] and predict future events in their life based on the positions of the sun, moon, and other celestial objects at the time of their birth. The majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cosmic&quot; /&gt;{{rp|83}}

Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium [[BCE]], with roots in [[Calendrical calculation|calendrical]] systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koch-Westenholz 1995 Foreword, 11&quot;/&gt; A form of astrology was practised in the first dynasty of [[Mesopotamia]] (1950–1651 BCE). ''Vedāṅga Jyotiṣa'' is one of earliest known Hindu texts on [[astronomy]] and '''astrology''' (''[[Jyotisha]]''). The text is dated between 1400 BCE to final centuries BCE by various scholars according to astronomical and linguistic evidences. Chinese astrology was elaborated in the [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046–256 BCE). [[Hellenistic astrology]] after 332 BCE mixed [[Babylonian astrology]] with Egyptian [[Decans|Decanic astrology]] in [[Alexandria]], creating [[horoscopic astrology]]. [[Alexander the Great|Alexander the Great's]] conquest of [[Asia]] allowed astrology to spread to [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. In Rome, astrology was associated with '[[Chaldea]]n wisdom'. After the conquest of Alexandria in the 7th century, astrology was taken up by Islamic scholars, and Hellenistic texts were translated into Arabic and Persian. In the 12th century, Arabic texts were imported to Europe and [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]]. Major astronomers including [[Tycho Brahe]], [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Galileo]] practised as court astrologers. Astrological references appear in literature in the works of poets such as [[Dante Alighieri]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], and of playwrights such as [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[William Shakespeare]].

Throughout most of its history, astrology was considered a scholarly tradition. It was accepted in political and academic contexts, and was connected with other studies, such as [[astronomy]], [[alchemy]], [[meteorology]], and medicine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kassell&quot;/&gt; At the end of the 17th century, new scientific concepts in astronomy and physics (such as [[heliocentrism]] and [[classical mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]]) called astrology into question. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and common belief in astrology has largely declined.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brit&quot;/&gt;

Scattered evidence suggests that the oldest known astrological references are copies of texts made in the ancient world. The [[Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa]] is thought to be compiled in [[Babylon]] around 1700 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Hobson, ''THE EXACT TRANSMISSION OF TEXTS IN THE FIRST MILLENNIUM B.C.E.'', Published PhD Thesis. Department of Hebrew, Biblical and Jewish Studies. University of Sydney. 2009 [http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/5404/1/r-hobson-2009-thesis.pdf PDF File]&lt;/ref&gt;  A scroll documenting an early use of [[electional astrology]] is doubtfully ascribed to the reign of the [[Sumer]]ian ruler [[Gudea of Lagash]] (c. 2144 – 2124 BCE). This describes how the gods revealed to him in a dream the constellations that would be most favourable for the planned construction of a temple.&lt;ref&gt;From scroll A of the ruler Gudea of Lagash, I 17 – VI 13. O. Kaiser, ''Texte aus der Umwelt des Alten Testaments'', Bd. 2, 1–3. Gütersloh, 1986–1991. Also quoted in A. Falkenstein, 'Wahrsagung in der sumerischen Überlieferung', ''La divination en Mésopotamie ancienne et dans les régions voisines''. Paris, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is controversy about whether these were genuinely recorded at the time or merely ascribed to ancient rulers by posterity. The oldest undisputed evidence of the use of astrology as an integrated system of knowledge is therefore attributed to the records of the first dynasty of [[Mesopotamia]] (1950–1651 BCE). This astrology had some parallels with [[Hellenistic]] Greek (western) astrology, including the zodiac, a norming point near 9 degrees in Aries, the trine aspect, planetary exaltations, and the dodekatemoria (the twelve divisions of 30 degrees each).&lt;ref name=&quot;Rochberg-Halton&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Elements of the Babylonian Contribution to Hellenistic Astrology | author=Rochberg-Halton, F. | journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society | year=1988 | volume=108 | issue=1 | pages=51–62 | jstor=603245 | doi=10.2307/603245| url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/39e64e915709d33838cfaf59b5d27802b1efa0d7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Babylonians viewed celestial events as possible signs rather than as causes of physical events.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rochberg-Halton&quot;/&gt;

The system of [[Chinese astrology]] was elaborated during the [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046–256 BCE) and flourished during the [[Han Dynasty]] (2nd century BCE to 2nd century CE), during which all the familiar elements of traditional Chinese culture – the Yin-Yang philosophy, theory of the five elements, Heaven and Earth, Confucian morality – were brought together to formalise the philosophical principles of Chinese medicine and divination, astrology and alchemy.&lt;ref name=Kistemaker /&gt;{{rp|3,4}}

==== Ancient objections ====

[[File:Cicero - Musei Capitolini.JPG|thumb|upright|The Roman orator [[Cicero]] objected to astrology]]

[[Cicero]] stated the twins objection (that with close birth times, personal outcomes can be very different), later developed by [[Saint Augustine]].&lt;ref&gt;Long, 2005. p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that since the other planets are much more distant from the earth than the moon, they could have only very tiny influence compared to the moon's.&lt;ref&gt;Long, 2005. pp.&amp;nbsp;173–174.&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued that if astrology explains everything about a person's fate, then it wrongly ignores the visible effect of inherited ability and parenting, changes in health worked by medicine, or the effects of the weather on people.&lt;ref&gt;Long, 2005. p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plotinus]] argued that since the fixed stars are much more distant than the planets, it is laughable to imagine the planets' effect on human affairs should depend on their position with respect to the zodiac. He also argues that the interpretation of the moon's [[conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]] with a planet as good when the moon is full, but bad when the moon is waning, is clearly wrong, as from the moon's point of view, half of its surface is always in sunlight; and from the planet's point of view, waning should be better, as then the planet sees some light from the moon, but when the moon is full to us, it is dark, and therefore bad, on the side facing the planet in question.&lt;ref&gt;Long, 2005. p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Favorinus]] argued that it was absurd to imagine that stars and planets would affect human bodies in the same way as they affect the tides,&lt;ref&gt;Long, 2005. p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; and equally absurd that small motions in the heavens cause large changes in people's fates. [[Sextus Empiricus]] argued that it was absurd to link human attributes with myths about the signs of the zodiac.&lt;ref&gt;Long, 2005. p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carneades]] argued that belief in fate denies [[free will]] and [[morality]]; that people born at different times can all die in the same accident or battle; and that contrary to uniform influences from the stars, tribes and cultures are all different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Lament, Death, and Destiny | publisher=Peter Lang | author=Hughes, Richard | year=2004 | page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hellenistic Egypt ===
{{Main|Hellenistic astrology}}

In 525 BCE, [[Egypt]] was conquered by the Persians. The 1st century BCE Egyptian [[Dendera Zodiac]] shares two signs – the Balance and the Scorpion – with Mesopotamian astrology.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, 1994. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the occupation by [[Alexander the Great]] in 332 BCE, Egypt became [[Hellenistic]]. The city of [[Alexandria]] was founded by Alexander after the conquest, becoming the place where [[Babylonian astrology]] was mixed with Egyptian [[Decans|Decanic astrology]] to create [[Horoscopic astrology]]. This contained the Babylonian zodiac with its system of planetary [[exaltation (astrology)|exaltation]]s, the triplicities of the signs and the importance of eclipses. It used the Egyptian concept of dividing the zodiac into thirty-six decans of ten degrees each, with an emphasis on the rising decan, and the Greek system of planetary Gods, sign rulership and [[four elements]].&lt;ref&gt;Holden, 1996. pp.&amp;nbsp;11–13.&lt;/ref&gt; 2nd century BCE texts predict positions of planets in zodiac signs at the time of the rising of certain decans, particularly Sothis.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, 1994. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[astrologer]] and astronomer [[Ptolemy#Astrology|Ptolemy]] lived in Alexandria. Ptolemy's work the ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'' formed the basis of Western astrology, and, &quot;...enjoyed almost the authority of a Bible among the astrological writers of a thousand years or more.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, 1940. 'Introduction' p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greece and Rome ===

The conquest of [[Asia]] by [[Alexander the Great]] exposed the Greeks to ideas from [[Syria]], Babylon, Persia and central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Campion, 2008. p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 280 BCE, [[Berossus]], a priest of [[Marduk|Bel]] from Babylon, moved to the Greek island of [[Kos]], teaching astrology and Babylonian culture.&lt;ref&gt;Campion, 2008. p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1st century BCE, there were two varieties of astrology, one using [[horoscope]]s to describe the past, present and future; the other, [[theurgic]], emphasising the [[soul|soul's]] ascent to the stars.&lt;ref&gt;Campion, 2008. pp.&amp;nbsp;173–174.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek influence played a crucial role in the transmission of astrological theory to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].&lt;ref name=B32&gt;Barton, 1994. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first definite reference to astrology in Rome comes from the orator [[Cato the Elder|Cato]], who in 160 BCE warned farm overseers against consulting with Chaldeans,&lt;ref&gt;Barton, 1994. p.&amp;nbsp;32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; who were described as Babylonian 'star-gazers'.&lt;ref name=Campion227&gt;Campion, 2008. pp.&amp;nbsp;227–228.&lt;/ref&gt; Among both Greeks and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], Babylonia (also known as [[Chaldea]]) became so identified with astrology that 'Chaldean wisdom' became [[synonym]]ous with [[divination]] using planets and stars.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, 1983. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2nd-century Roman poet and satirist [[Juvenal]] complains about the pervasive influence of Chaldeans, saying, &quot;Still more trusted are the Chaldaeans; every word uttered by the astrologer they will believe has come from [[Jupiter (mythology)|Hammon's]] fountain.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Juvenal]], Satire 6: ''[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/juvenal_satires_06.htm The Ways of Women]'' (translated by G. G. Ramsay, 1918, retrieved 5 July 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first astrologers to bring [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] astrology to Rome was [[Thrasyllus of Mendes|Thrasyllus]], astrologer to the [[emperor]] [[Tiberius]],&lt;ref name=&quot;B32&quot;/&gt; the first emperor to have had a court astrologer,&lt;ref&gt;Barton, 1994. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; though his predecessor [[Augustus]] had used astrology to help legitimise his [[Imperialism|Imperial]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, 1994. p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval world ===

==== Hindu ====
{{main|Hindu astrology}}

The main texts upon which classical Indian astrology is based are early medieval compilations, notably the ''[[Bṛhat Parāśara Horāśāstra|{{IAST|Bṛhat Parāśara Horāśāstra}}]]'', and ''[[Sārāvalī]]'' by {{IAST|Kalyāṇavarma}}.
The ''Horāshastra'' is a composite work of 71 chapters, of which the first part  (chapters 1–51) dates to the 7th to early 8th centuries and the second part (chapters 52–71) to the later 8th century. The ''Sārāvalī'' likewise dates to around 800 CE.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Pingree]], ''{{IAST|Jyotiḥśāstra}}'' (J. Gonda (Ed.) ''A History of Indian Literature'', Vol VI Fasc 4), p.81&lt;/ref&gt; English translations of these texts were published by N.N. Krishna Rau and V.B. Choudhari in 1963 and 1961, respectively.

==== Medieval objections ====

[[File:Isidor von Sevilla.jpeg|thumb|upright|right|The medieval theologian [[Isidore of Seville]] criticised the predictive part of astrology]]

In the seventh century, [[Isidore of Seville]] argued in his ''[[Etymologiae]]'' that astronomy described the movements of the heavens, while astrology had two parts: one was scientific, describing the movements of the sun, the moon and the stars, while the other, making predictions, was theologically erroneous.&lt;ref name=Wood5&gt;Wood, 1970. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Isidore&gt;{{cite book | title=Etymologiae | author=Isidore of Seville | year=c. 600 | pages=L, 82, col. 170}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[John Gower]] in the fourteenth century defined astrology as essentially limited to the making of predictions.&lt;ref name=Wood5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=3197718&amp;pageno=9 | title=Confessio Amantis | author=Gower, John | year=1390 | pages=VII, 670–84 | quote=Assembled with Astronomie / Is ek that ilke Astrologie / The which in juggementz acompteth / Theffect, what every sterre amonteth, / And hou thei causen many a wonder / To tho climatz that stonde hem under.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of the stars was in turn divided into natural astrology, with for example effects on tides and the growth of plants, and judicial astrology, with supposedly predictable effects on people.&lt;ref name=Wood6&gt;Wood, 1970. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Allen148&gt;{{cite book | title=Star-crossed Renaissance | publisher=Duke University Press | author=Allen, Don Cameron | year=1941 | page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourteenth century sceptic [[Nicole Oresme]] however included astronomy as a part of astrology in his ''Livre de divinacions''.&lt;ref name=Wood8&gt;Wood, 1970. pp. 8–11&lt;/ref&gt; Oresme argued that current approaches to prediction of events such as plagues, wars, and weather were inappropriate, but that such prediction was a valid field of inquiry. However, he attacked the use of astrology to choose the timing of actions (so-called interrogation and election) as wholly false, and rejected the determination of human action by the stars on grounds of free will.&lt;ref name=Wood8/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coopland&gt;{{cite book | title=Nicole Oresme and the Astrologers: A Study of his Livre de Divinacions | publisher=Harvard University Press; Liverpool University Press | author=Coopland, G.

In the late 1400s, [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] forcefully attacked astrology in ''Disputationes contra Astrologos'', arguing that the heavens neither caused, nor heralded earthly events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dijksterhuis |first1=Eduard Jan |title=The mechanization of the world picture |date=1986 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; His contemporary, [[Pietro Pomponazzi]], a &quot;rationalistic and critical thinker&quot; was much more sanguine about astrology and critical of Pico's attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Martin |first1=Craig |title=Pietro Pomponazzi |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pomponazzi/ |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Renaissance]] scholars commonly practised astrology. [[Gerolamo Cardano]] cast the horoscope of king [[Edward VI of England]], while [[John Dee]] was the personal astrologer to queen [[Elizabeth I of England]]. [[Catherine de Medici]] paid [[Michael Nostradamus]] in 1566 to verify the prediction of the death of her husband, king [[Henry II of France]] made by her astrologer Lucus Gauricus. Major astronomers who practised as court astrologers included [[Tycho Brahe]] in the royal court of Denmark, [[Johannes Kepler]] to the [[Habsburgs]], [[Galileo Galilei]] to the [[Medici]], and [[Giordano Bruno]] who was burnt at the stake for heresy in Rome in 1600.&lt;ref name=Campion47&gt;Campion, 1982. p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between astrology and astronomy was not entirely clear. Advances in astronomy were often motivated by the desire to improve the accuracy of astrology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Pico+and+the+historiography+of+Renaissance+astrology.-a0251858267|title=Pico and the historiography of Renaissance astrology|work=Explorations in Renaissance Culture|author=Rabin, Sheila J.|date=2010|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English astrology had reached its zenith by the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cummins A (2012) The Starry Rubric: Seventeenth-Century English Astrology and Magic, p. 3. France:Hadean Press&lt;/ref&gt; Astrologers were theorists, researchers, and social engineers, as well as providing individual advice to everyone from monarchs downwards. Among other things, astrologers claimed to be able to advise on the best time to take a journey or harvest a crop, diagnose and prescribe for physical or mental illnesses, and predict natural disasters. This underpinned a system in which everything — people, the world, the universe — was understood to be interconnected, and astrology co-existed happily with [[religion]], [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[science]].&lt;ref&gt;Cummins A (2012) The Starry Rubric: Seventeenth-Century English Astrology and Magic, p. 43–45.

=== Enlightenment period and onwards ===
[[File:Seven spiritualists 1906.jpg|thumb|[[Middle-class]] Chicago women discuss spiritualism (1906)]]
During [[the Enlightenment]], intellectual sympathy for astrology fell away, leaving only a popular following supported by cheap almanacs.&lt;ref name=Porter&gt;{{cite book | title=Enlightenment: Britain and the Creation of the Modern World | publisher=Penguin | author=Porter, Roy | year=2001 | pages=151–152 | isbn=978-0-14-025028-2 | quote=he did not even trouble readers with formal disproofs!}}&lt;/ref&gt; One English almanac compiler, Richard Saunders, followed the spirit of the age by printing a derisive ''Discourse on the Invalidity of Astrology'', while in France [[Pierre Bayle|Pierre Bayle's]] ''Dictionnaire'' of 1697 stated that the subject was puerile.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; The [[Anglo-Irish]] [[satire|satirist]] [[Jonathan Swift]] ridiculed the [[Whiggism|Whig]] political astrologer [[John Partridge (astrologer)|John Partridge]].&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt;

== Principles and practice ==
Advocates have defined astrology as a symbolic language, an [[art]] form, a [[science]], and a method of divination.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopædia Britannica, Encyclopædia Britannica,' v.5, 1974, p. 916&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, Thomas: 'The Origin of Culture and Civilization,'' Phenix &amp; Phenix Literary Publicists, 2005, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; Though most cultural astrology systems share common roots in ancient philosophies that influenced each other, many use methods that differ from those in the West. These include Hindu astrology (also known as &quot;Indian astrology&quot; and in modern times referred to as &quot;Vedic astrology&quot;) and Chinese astrology, both of which have influenced the world's cultural history.

=== Western ===
[[Western astrology]] is a form of [[divination]] based on the construction of a [[horoscope]] for an exact moment, such as a person's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Philip P. Wiener |title=Dictionary of the history of ideas |year=1974 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |isbn=978-0-684-13293-8 |url=http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=DicHist/uvaBook/tei/DicHist1.xml;brand=default;}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses the tropical zodiac, which is aligned to the [[Equinox|equinoctial points]].&lt;ref&gt;James R. Lewis, 2003. ''The Astrology Book: the Encyclopedia of Heavenly Influences''. Visible Ink Press. Online at Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Western astrology is founded on the movements and relative positions of celestial bodies such as the Sun, Moon and planets, which are analysed by their movement through [[Astrological sign|signs]] of the [[zodiac]] (twelve spatial divisions of the [[ecliptic]]) and by their [[Astrological aspect|aspects]] (based on geometric angles) relative to one another. They are also considered by their placement in [[House (astrology)|houses]] (twelve spatial divisions of the sky).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hone |first=Margaret |title=The Modern Text-Book of Astrology |year=1978 |publisher=L. N. Fowler |location=Romford |isbn=978-0-85243-357-7 |pages=21–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astrology's modern representation in western popular media is usually reduced to [[sun sign astrology]], which considers only the zodiac sign of the Sun at an individual's date of birth, and represents only 1/12 of the total chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Riske |first=Kris |title=Llewellyn's Complete Book of Astrology |year=2007 |publisher=Llewellyn Publications |location=Minnesota, USA |isbn=978-0-7387-1071-6 |pages=5–6; 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The horoscope visually expresses the set of relationships for the time and place of the chosen event. These relationships are between the seven 'planets', signifying tendencies such as war and love; the twelve signs of the zodiac; and the twelve houses. Each planet is in a particular sign and a particular house at the chosen time, when observed from the chosen place, creating two kinds of relationship.&lt;ref name=Kremer&gt;{{cite journal | title=Horoscopes and History. by J.

Along with [[tarot divination]], astrology is one of the core studies of [[Western esotericism]], and as such has influenced systems of [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] belief not only among Western esotericists and [[Hermeticism|Hermeticists]], but also belief systems such as [[Wicca]] that have borrowed from or been influenced by the Western esoteric tradition. [[Tanya Luhrmann]] has said that &quot;all magicians know something about astrology,&quot; and refers to a [[table of correspondences]] in [[Starhawk|Starhawk's]] ''[[The Spiral Dance]]'', organised by [[planets in astrology|planet]], as an example of the astrological lore studied by magicians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Luhrmann&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Persuasions of the witch's craft: ritual magic in contemporary England | publisher=Harvard University Press | author=Luhrmann, Tanya | year=1991 | pages=147–151 | isbn=978-0-674-66324-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chinese astrology]] has a close relation with [[Chinese philosophy]] (theory of the three harmonies: heaven, earth and man) and uses concepts such as [[yin and yang]], the [[Wu Xing|Five phases]], the 10 [[Celestial stem]]s, the 12 [[Earthly Branches]], and [[Chinese units of measurement|shichen]] (時辰 a form of timekeeping used for religious purposes).

[[St. Augustine]] (354{{ndash}}430) believed that the determinism of astrology conflicted with the Christian doctrines of man's free will and responsibility, and God not being the cause of evil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Magic and Divination at the Courts of Burgundy and France: Text and Context of Laurens Pignon's &quot;Contre les Devineurs&quot; (1411) | publisher=Brill | author=Veenstra, J.R. | year=1997 | isbn=978-90-04-10925-4|pages=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he also grounded his opposition philosophically, citing the failure of astrology to explain twins who behave differently although conceived at the same moment and born at approximately the same time.&lt;ref name=Hess&gt;{{cite book |last=Hess |first=Peter M.J. |title=Catholicism and science |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood |location=Westport |isbn=978-0-313-33190-9 |page=11 |edition=1st |author2=Allen, Paul L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval ===
[[File:Avicenna.jpg|thumb|upright|A drawing of Avicenna]]
Some of the practices of astrology were contested on theological grounds by medieval Muslim astronomers such as [[Al-Farabi]] (Alpharabius), [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) and [[Avicenna]]. They said that the methods of astrologers conflicted with orthodox religious views of [[Ulema|Islamic scholars]], by suggesting that the Will of God can be known and predicted in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Saliba |first=George | authorlink=George Saliba | year=1994b | title=A History of Arabic Astronomy: Planetary Theories During the Golden Age of Islam | publisher=[[New York University Press]] | isbn=978-0-8147-8023-7 | pages=60, 67–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Avicenna's 'Refutation against astrology', ''Risāla fī ibṭāl aḥkām al-nojūm'', argues against the practice of astrology while supporting the principle that planets may act as agents of divine causation. Avicenna considered that the movement of the planets influenced life on earth in a deterministic way, but argued against the possibility of determining the exact influence of the stars.&lt;ref&gt;Catarina Belo, Catarina Carriço Marques de Moura Belo, ''Chance and determinism in Avicenna and Averroës'', p. 228. Brill, 2007. {{ISBN|90-04-15587-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, Avicenna did not deny the core dogma of astrology, but denied our ability to understand it to the extent that precise and fatalistic predictions could be made from it.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Saliba]], ''Avicenna'': 'viii. Mathematics and Physical Sciences'. Encyclopædia Iranica, Online Edition, 2011, available at http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-viii&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya]] (1292–1350), in his ''Miftah Dar al-SaCadah'', also used [[physics|physical]] arguments in astronomy to question the practice of judicial astrology.&lt;ref name=Livingston&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah: A Fourteenth Century Defense against Astrological Divination and Alchemical Transmutation | first=John W. | last=Livingston | journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society | volume=91 | issue=1 | year=1971 | pages=96–103 | doi=10.2307/600445| jstor=600445}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recognised that the [[star]]s are much larger than the [[planet]]s, and argued: &lt;blockquote&gt;And if you astrologers answer that it is precisely because of this distance and smallness that their influences are negligible, then why is it that you claim a great influence for the smallest heavenly body, Mercury?

=== Demarcation ===

Under the criterion of [[falsifiability]], first proposed by the [[philosopher of science]] [[Karl Popper]], astrology is a pseudoscience.&lt;ref name=PopperStanford&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |authors=Stephen Thornton, Edward N. Zalta (older edition)|title=Karl Popper|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper regarded astrology as &quot;pseudo-empirical&quot; in that &quot;it appeals to observation and experiment,&quot; but &quot;nevertheless does not come up to scientific standards.&quot;&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;{{cite book |last=Popper |first=Karl |title=Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-28594-0 |edition=Reprinted‌}}

In contrast to Popper, the philosopher [[Thomas Kuhn]] argued that it was not lack of falsifiability that makes astrology unscientific, but rather that the process and concepts of astrology are non-empirical.&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wright |first=Peter |title=Astrology and Science in Seventeenth-Century England |journal=Social Studies of Science |year=1975 |pages=399–422 | doi = 10.1177/030631277500500402 |pmid=11610221 |volume=5|issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|401}} Kuhn thought that, though astrologers had, historically, made predictions that categorically failed, this in itself does not make astrology unscientific, nor do attempts by astrologers to explain away failures by claiming that creating a horoscope is very difficult. Rather, in Kuhn's eyes, astrology is not science because it was always more akin to [[medieval medicine]]; astrologers followed a sequence of rules and guidelines for a seemingly necessary field with known shortcomings, but they did no research because the fields are not amenable to research,&lt;ref name=Kuhn /&gt;{{rp|8}} and so &quot;they had no puzzles to solve and therefore no science to practise.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wright /&gt;{{rp|401;}}&lt;ref name=Kuhn&gt;{{cite book |last=Kuhn |first=Thomas |title=Proceedings of the International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science [held at Bedford College, Regent's Park, London, from July 11th to 17th 1965] |year=1970 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-09623-2 |edition=Reprint |editor=[[Imre Lakatos]] |editor2=[[Alan Musgrave]] |url=https://archive.org/details/criticismgrowth00laka }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} While an astronomer could correct for failure, an astrologer could not. An astrologer could only explain away failure but could not revise the astrological [[hypothesis]] in a meaningful way. As such, to Kuhn, even if the stars could influence the path of humans through life astrology is not scientific.&lt;ref name=Kuhn /&gt;{{rp|8}}

The philosopher [[Paul Thagard]] asserts that astrology cannot be regarded as falsified in this sense until it has been replaced with a successor. In the case of predicting behaviour, psychology is the alternative.&lt;ref name=Thagard /&gt;{{rp|228}} To Thagard a further criterion of demarcation of science from pseudoscience is that the state-of-the-art must progress and that the community of researchers should be attempting to compare the current theory to alternatives, and not be &quot;selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations.&quot;&lt;ref name=Thagard /&gt;{{rp|227–228}} Progress is defined here as explaining new phenomena and solving existing problems, yet astrology has failed to progress having only changed little in nearly 2000 years.&lt;ref name=Thagard /&gt;{{rp|228}}&lt;ref name=Hurley /&gt;{{rp|549}} To Thagard, astrologers are acting as though engaged in [[normal science]] believing that the foundations of astrology were well established despite the &quot;many unsolved problems,&quot; and in the face of better alternative theories (psychology). For these reasons Thagard views astrology as pseudoscience.&lt;ref name=Thagard /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hurley&gt;{{cite book |last=Hurley|first=Patrick|title=A concise introduction to logic |year=2005 |publisher=Wadsworth |location=Belmont, Calif.|isbn=978-0-534-58505-1|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|228}}

For the philosopher Edward W. James, astrology is irrational not because of the numerous problems with mechanisms and falsification due to experiments, but because an analysis of the astrological literature shows that it is infused with fallacious logic and poor reasoning.&lt;ref name=EdwardJ /&gt;{{rp|34}}

{{quote|What if throughout astrological writings we meet little appreciation of coherence, blatant insensitivity to evidence, no sense of a hierarchy of reasons, slight command over the contextual force of critieria, stubborn unwillingness to pursue an argument where it leads, stark naivete concerning the efficacy of explanation and so on?

In 1955, the astrologer and psychologist Michel Gauquelin stated that though he had failed to find evidence that supported indicators like [[Astrological signs|zodiacal signs]] and [[Astrological aspects|planetary aspects]] in astrology, he did find positive correlations between the [[Diurnal motion|diurnal positions]] of some [[Planets in astrology|planets]] and success in professions that astrology traditionally associates with those planets.&lt;ref name=Pont&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pont |first=Graham |title=Philosophy and Science of Music in Ancient Greece |journal=Nexus Network Journal |year=2004 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=17–29 |doi=10.1007/s00004-004-0003-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gauquelin-1955&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Gauquelin |first=Michel |title=L'influence des astres: étude critique et expérimentale |year=1955 |publisher=Éditions du Dauphin |location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known of Gauquelin's findings is based on the positions of Mars in the [[natal chart]]s of successful athletes and became known as the ''[[Mars effect]]''.&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll|first=Robert Todd|title=The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions |year=2003 |publisher=Wiley |location=Hoboken, NJ |isbn=978-0-471-27242-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|213}} A study conducted by seven French scientists attempted to replicate the claim, but found no statistical evidence.&lt;ref name=Carroll /&gt;{{rp|213–214}} They attributed the effect to selective bias on Gauquelin's part, accusing him of attempting to persuade them to add or delete names from their study.&lt;ref name=Benski&gt;{{cite book |last=Benski |first=Claude|others=with a commentary by [[Jan Willem Nienhuys]] |title=The &quot;Mars Effect: A French Test of over 1,000 Sports Champions |year=1995 |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, NY |isbn=978-0-87975-988-9|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoffrey Dean has suggested that the effect may be caused by self-reporting of birth dates by parents rather than any issue with the study by Gauquelin. The suggestion is that a small subset of the parents may have had changed birth times to be consistent with better astrological charts for a related profession.  The number of births under astrologically undesirable conditions was also lower, indicating that parents choose dates and times to suit their beliefs. The sample group was taken from a time where belief in astrology was more common. Gauquelin had failed to find the Mars effect in more recent populations, where a nurse or doctor recorded the birth information.&lt;ref name=CritThink/&gt;{{rp|116}}

Dean, a scientist and former astrologer, and psychologist Ivan Kelly conducted a large scale scientific test that involved more than one hundred [[cognitive]], [[behavioural]], [[physiology|physical]], and other variables—but found no support for astrology.&lt;ref name=FailToPredict&gt;{{cite news |last=Matthews |first=Robert |title=Astrologers fail to predict proof they are wrong |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1439101/Astrologers-fail-to-predict-proof-they-are-wrong.html |accessdate=13 July 2012 |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=17 August 2003 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Geoffrey /&gt; Furthermore, a [[meta-analysis]] pooled 40 studies that involved 700 astrologers and over 1,000 birth charts. Ten of the tests—which involved 300 participants—had the astrologers pick the correct chart interpretation out of a number of others that were not the astrologically correct chart interpretation (usually three to five others). When date and other obvious clues were removed, no significant results suggested there was any preferred chart.&lt;ref name=Geoffrey&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is Astrology Relevant to Consciousness and Psi? |author=Dean G. |author2=Kelly, I.

=== Lack of mechanisms and consistency ===
Testing the validity of astrology can be difficult, because there is no consensus amongst astrologers as to what astrology is or what it can predict.&lt;ref name=Cosmic /&gt;{{rp|83}} Most professional astrologers are paid to predict the future or describe a person's personality and life, but most horoscopes only make vague untestable statements that can apply to almost anyone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cosmic&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eysenck1982&quot;/&gt;{{rp|83}}

Many astrologers claim that astrology is scientific,&lt;ref name=ChrisFrench&gt;{{cite news |last=Chris |first=French |title=Astrologers and other inhabitants of parallel universes |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/feb/07/astrologers-parallel-universes |publisher=The Guardian |work=7 February 2012 |accessdate=8 July 2012 |location=London |date=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some have proposed conventional [[Causality|causal agents]] such as [[electromagnetism]] and [[gravity]].&lt;ref name=ChrisFrench/&gt; Scientists reject these mechanisms as implausible&lt;ref name=ChrisFrench /&gt; since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances.&lt;ref name=Shermer&gt;{{cite book |last=editor |first=Michael Shermer |title=The Skeptic encyclopedia of pseudoscience |year=2002 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, Cal. |isbn=978-1-57607-653-8 |page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western astrology has taken the earth's [[Precession#Axial precession (precession of the equinoxes)|axial precession (also called precession of the equinoxes)]] into account since Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]'', so the &quot;first point of Aries&quot;, the start of the astrological year, continually moves against the background of the stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Tester, S. J. | title=A History of Western Astrology | year=1999 | publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer |page= 161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tropical zodiac has no connection to the stars, and as long as no claims are made that the constellations themselves are in the associated [[Astrological sign|sign]], astrologers avoid the concept that precession seemingly moves the constellations.&lt;ref name=Charpak /&gt; Charpak and Broch, noting this, referred to astrology based on the tropical zodiac as being &quot;...empty boxes that have nothing to do with anything and are devoid of any consistency or correspondence with the stars.&quot;&lt;ref name=Charpak/&gt; Sole use of the tropical zodiac is inconsistent with references made, by the same astrologers, to the [[Age of Aquarius]], which depends on when the vernal point enters the constellation of Aquarius.&lt;ref name=Zarka /&gt;

Astrologers usually have only a small knowledge of astronomy, and often do not take into account basic principles—such as the precession of the equinoxes, which changes the position of the sun with time. They commented on the example of [[Élizabeth Teissier]], who claimed that, &quot;The sun ends up in the same place in the sky on the same date each year&quot;, as the basis for claims that two people with the same birthday, but a number of years apart, should be under the same planetary influence. Charpak and Broch noted that, &quot;There is a difference of about twenty-two thousand miles between Earth's location on any specific date in two successive years&quot;, and that thus they should not be under the same influence according to astrology. Over a 40-year period there would be a difference greater than 780,000 miles.&lt;ref name=Charpak&gt;{{cite book |last1=Charpak |first1=Georges |last2=Broch |first2=Henri |year=2004 |origyear=2002 |title=Debunked!: ESP, Telekinesis, and Other Pseudoscience |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DpnWcMzeh8oC&amp;pg=PA6#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false |others=Translated by Bart K.

=== Western politics and society ===

In the West, political leaders have sometimes consulted astrologers. For example, the British intelligence agency [[MI5]] employed [[Louis de Wohl]] as an astrologer after claims surfaced that [[Adolf Hitler]] used astrology to time his actions. The War Office was &quot;...interested to know what Hitler's own astrologers would be telling him from week to week.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JrdVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5bADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6779,6948658&amp;dq=hitler-astrologer&amp;hl=en | title=The Strange Story Of Britain's &quot;State Seer&quot; | newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=30 August 1952 | accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, de Wohl's predictions were so inaccurate that he was soon labelled a &quot;complete charlatan,&quot; and later evidence showed that Hitler considered astrology &quot;complete nonsense.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/mar/04/nationalarchives.secondworldwar | title=Star turn: astrologer who became SOE's secret weapon against Hitler | newspaper=The Guardian | date=4 March 2008 | accessdate=21 July 2012 | location=London | first=Richard | last=Norton-Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[John Hinckley|John Hinckley's]] [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|attempted assassination]] of US President [[Ronald Reagan]], first lady [[Nancy Reagan]] commissioned astrologer [[Joan Quigley]] to act as the secret White House astrologer.

There was a boom in interest in astrology in the late 1960s. The sociologist [[Marcello Truzzi]] described three levels of involvement of &quot;Astrology-believers&quot; to account for its revived popularity in the face of scientific discrediting. He found that most astrology-believers did not claim it was a scientific explanation with predictive power. Instead, those superficially involved, knowing &quot;next to nothing&quot; about astrology's 'mechanics', read newspaper astrology columns, and could benefit from &quot;tension-management of anxieties&quot; and &quot;a cognitive belief-system that transcends science.&quot;&lt;ref name=Truzzi&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Occult Revival as Popular Culture: Some Random Observations on the Old and the Nouveau Witch | author=Truzzi, Marcello | journal=The Sociological Quarterly | year=1972 | volume=13 | issue=1 | pages=16–36 | jstor=4105818 | doi=10.1111/j.1533-8525.1972.tb02101.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those at the second level usually had their horoscopes cast and sought advice and predictions. They were much younger than those at the first level, and could benefit from knowledge of the language of astrology and the resulting ability to belong to a coherent and exclusive group. Those at the third level were highly involved and usually cast horoscopes for themselves. Astrology provided this small minority of astrology-believers with a &quot;''meaningful'' view of their universe and [gave] them an ''understanding'' of their place in it.&quot;{{efn|Italics in original.}} This third group took astrology seriously, possibly as a ''sacred canopy'', whereas the other two groups took it playfully and irreverently.&lt;ref name=Truzzi/&gt;

In 1953, the sociologist [[Theodor W. Adorno]] conducted a study of the astrology column of a Los Angeles newspaper as part of a project examining mass culture in capitalist society.&lt;ref name=Nederman&gt;{{cite journal|title=Popular Occultism and Critical Social Theory: Exploring Some Themes in Adorno's Critique of Astrology and the Occult|journal=Sociological Analysis|date=Winter 1981|volume=42|author1=Cary J.

The fourteenth-century English poets [[John Gower]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] both referred to astrology in their works, including Gower's ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' and Chaucer's ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''.&lt;ref name=Wedel/&gt; Chaucer commented explicitly on astrology in his ''Treatise on the Astrolabe'', demonstrating personal knowledge of one area, judicial astrology, with an account of how to find the ascendant or rising sign.&lt;ref name=WoodAstrolabe&gt;Wood, 1970. pp.12–21&lt;/ref&gt;

Gower, too, saw artistic possibilities in the new astrological learning, and promptly used these in his retelling of the Alexander legend—but he confined himself, for the most part, to a bald rehearsal of facts and theories. It is, accordingly, as a part of the long encyclopaedia of natural science that he inserted into his ''Confessio Amantis'', and in certain didactic passages of the ''Vox Clamantis'' and the ''Mirour de l'Omme'', that Astrology figures most largely in his works&amp;nbsp;...

In the sixteenth century, John Lyly's 1597 play, ''The Woman in the Moon'', is wholly motivated by astrology,&lt;ref name=DeLacy&gt;{{cite journal | title=Astrology in the Poetry of Edmund Spenser | author=De Lacy, Hugh | journal=The Journal of English and Germanic Philology |date=October 1934 | volume=33 | issue=4 | pages=520–543 | jstor=27703949}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Christopher Marlowe]] makes astrological references in his plays ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'' and ''[[Tamburlaine]]'' (both c. 1590),&lt;ref name=DeLacy/&gt; and [[Sir Philip Sidney]] refers to astrology at least four times in his [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] ''[[The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia]]'' (c. 1580).&lt;ref name=DeLacy/&gt; [[Edmund Spenser]] uses astrology both decoratively and causally in his poetry, revealing &quot;...unmistakably an abiding interest in the art, an interest shared by a large number of his contemporaries.&quot;&lt;ref name=DeLacy/&gt; [[George Chapman|George Chapman's]] play, ''[[The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron|Byron's Conspiracy]]'' (1608), similarly uses astrology as a causal mechanism in the drama.&lt;ref name=Camden&gt;{{cite journal | title=Astrology in Shakespeare's Day | author=Camden Carroll, Jr. | journal=Isis |date=April 1933 | volume=19 | issue=1 | pages=26–73 | jstor=225186 | doi=10.1086/346721}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare's]] attitude towards astrology is unclear, with contradictory references in plays including ''[[King Lear]]'', ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', and ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]''.&lt;ref name=Camden/&gt; Shakespeare was familiar with astrology and made use of his knowledge of astrology in nearly every play he wrote,&lt;ref name=Camden/&gt; assuming a basic familiarity with the subject in his commercial audience.&lt;ref name=Camden/&gt; Outside theatre, the physician and mystic [[Robert Fludd]] practised astrology, as did the quack doctor Simon Forman.&lt;ref name=Camden/&gt; In Elizabethan England, &quot;The usual feeling about astrology&amp;nbsp;... [was] that it is the most useful of the sciences.&quot;&lt;ref name=Camden/&gt;

In seventeenth century Spain, [[Lope de Vega]], with a detailed knowledge of astronomy, wrote plays that ridicule astrology. In his pastoral romance ''La Arcadia'' (1598), it leads to absurdity; in his novela ''Guzman el Bravo'' (1624), he concludes that the stars were made for man, not man for the stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Attitude of Lope de Vega toward Astrology and Astronomy | author=Halstead, Frank G. | journal=Hispanic Review | volume=7 |issue=3 |date=July 1939 |pages=205–219 |jstor=470235 | doi=10.2307/470235}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón de la Barca]] wrote the 1641 comedy ''Astrologo Fingido'' (The Pretended Astrologer); the plot was borrowed by the French playwright [[Thomas Corneille]] for his 1651 comedy ''Feint Astrologue''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Calderon's Astrologo Fingido in France |author=Steiner, Arpad | journal=Modern Philology | volume=24 |issue=1 |date=August 1926 |pages=27–30 |jstor=433789 | doi=10.1086/387623}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous piece of music influenced by astrology is the orchestral suite ''[[The Planets]]''. Written by the British composer [[Gustav Holst]] (1874–1934), and first performed in 1918, the framework of ''The Planets'' is based upon the astrological symbolism of the planets.&lt;ref&gt;Campion, Nicholas.:''A History of Western Astrology: Volume II: The Medieval and Modern Worlds''. (Continuum Books, 2009) pp.&amp;nbsp;244–245 {{ISBN|978-1-84725-224-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the seven movements of the suite is based upon a different planet, though the movements are not in the order of the planets from the Sun. The composer [[Colin Matthews]] wrote an eighth movement entitled ''Pluto, the Renewer'', first performed in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=6045052 | title='Pluto the Renewer' is no swan song | publisher=National Public Radio (NPR) | date=10 September 2006 | accessdate=13 June 2013 | author=Adams, Noah}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, another British composer, [[Constant Lambert]], wrote a ballet on astrological themes, called ''[[Horoscope (ballet)|Horoscope]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashtonarchive.com/ballets/1938.htm |title=Frederick Ashton and His Ballets 1938 |publisher=Ashton Archive |year=2004 |accessdate=2 August 2016 |author=Vaughan, David |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050514074649/http://www.ashtonarchive.com/ballets/1938.htm |archivedate=14 May 2005 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the New Zealand composer [[Edwin Carr (composer)|Edwin Carr]] wrote ''The Twelve Signs: An Astrological Entertainment'' for orchestra without strings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sounz.org.nz/works/show/10611 | title=The Twelve Signs: An Astrological Entertainment | publisher=Centre for New Zealand Music | accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Camille Paglia]] acknowledges astrology as an influence on her work of literary criticism ''[[Sexual Personae]]'' (1990).&lt;ref&gt;Paglia, Camille. ''Sex, Art, and American Culture: Essays''. Penguin Books, 1992, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Astrology features strongly in [[Eleanor Catton]]'s ''[[The Luminaries]]'', recipient of the [[2013 Man Booker Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Catton |first1=Eleanor |authorlink=Eleanor Catton |title=Eleanor Catton on how she wrote The Luminaries |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/11/eleanor-catton-luminaries-how-she-wrote-booker-prize |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=10 December 2015|date=2014-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
