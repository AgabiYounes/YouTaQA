'''''Asterix''''' or '''''The Adventures of Asterix''''' ({{lang-fr|Astérix}} or ''Astérix le Gaulois'' {{IPA-fr|asteʁiks lə ɡolwa|}}; lit. &quot;Asterix the [[Gauls|Gaul]]&quot;) is a [[bande dessinée]] series about [[Gaul]]ish [[warrior]]s, who have adventures and fight the [[Roman Empire]] during the era of [[Julius Caesar]]. The series first appeared in the [[Franco-Belgian comics]] magazine ''[[Pilote]]'' on 29 October 1959. It was written by [[René Goscinny]] and illustrated by [[Albert Uderzo]] until the death of Goscinny in 1977. Uderzo then took over the writing until 2009, when he sold the rights to publishing company [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]]. In 2013, a new team consisting of [[Jean-Yves Ferri]] (script) and [[Didier Conrad]] (artwork) took over. {{As of|2019}}, 38 volumes have been released, with the most recent released in October 2019.

==Description==
Each Asterix comic starts with the following introduction: &lt;blockquote&gt;''The year is 50 BC. Gaul is entirely occupied by the Romans. Well, not entirely... One small village of indomitable Gauls still holds out against the invaders. And life is not easy for the Roman legionaries who garrison the fortified camps of Totorum, Aquarium, Laudanum and Compendium...'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/country/masti/myweb/intro.htm|title=Richie's World&gt;The World of Asterix&gt;Introduction|website=www.angelfire.com|access-date=2019-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix|title=Asterix (Comic Book)|website=TV Tropes|access-date=2019-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;The series follows the adventures of a village of [[Gauls]] as they resist [[Roman Republic|Roman]] occupation in 50 [[BCE]]. They do so by means of a magic potion, brewed by their [[druid]] Getafix (Panoramix in the French version), which temporarily gives the recipient superhuman strength. The protagonists, the title character [[Asterix (character)|Asterix]] and his friend [[Obelix]], have various adventures. The &quot;-ix&quot; ending of both names (as well as all the other pseudo-Gaulish &quot;-ix&quot; names in the series) alludes to the &quot;-rix&quot; suffix (meaning &quot;king&quot;) present in the names of many real Gaulish chieftains such as [[Vercingetorix]], [[Orgetorix]], and [[Dumnorix]].

In many of the stories, they travel to foreign countries, though other tales are set in and around their village. For much of the history of the series (Volumes 4 through 29), settings in Gaul and abroad alternated, with even-numbered volumes set abroad and odd-numbered volumes set in Gaul, mostly in the village.

The ''Asterix'' series is one of the most popular Franco-Belgian comics in the world, with the series being translated into 111 languages and dialects {{asof|2009|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1931169,00.html|title=Asterix at 50: The Comic Hero Conquers the World|date=November 19, 2009|newspaper=Time|first=Leo|last=Cendrowicz|access-date=7 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908022648/http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1931169,00.html|archive-date=8 September 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the series has led to the adaptation of its books into [[List of Asterix films|13 films]]: nine animated, and four live action (one of which, ''[[Asterix &amp; Obelix: Mission Cleopatra]]'', was [[Lists of highest-grossing films in France|a major box office success in France]]).

&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Prior to creating the ''Asterix'' series, Goscinny and Uderzo had previously had success with their series ''[[Oumpah-pah]]'', which was published in ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Comic creator&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lambiek.net/home.htm|title=René Goscinny|publisher=Comic creator |accessdate=9 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100324201421/http://lambiek.net/home.htm| archivedate= 24 March 2010 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Astérix'' was originally serialised in ''[[Pilote]]'' magazine, debuting in the first issue on 29 October 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pilote-1959&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last =BDoubliées | title =Pilote année 1959 | url =http://bdoubliees.com/journalpilote/series1/asterix.htm | language =French | access-date =28 April 2007 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20110525075208/http://www.bdoubliees.com/journalpilote/series1/asterix.htm | archive-date =25 May 2011 | url-status =live | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 the first book was put together, titled ''[[Asterix the Gaul]]''. From then on, books were released generally on a yearly basis. Their success was exponential; the first book sold 6,000 copies in its year of publication; a year later, the second sold 20,000. In 1963, the third sold 40,000; the fourth, released in 1964, sold 150,000. A year later, the fifth sold 300,000; 1966's ''Asterix and the Big Fight'' sold 400,000 upon initial publication. The ninth ''Asterix'' volume, when first released in 1967, sold 1.2 million copies in two days.

Uderzo's first preliminary sketches portrayed Asterix as a huge and strong traditional Gaulish warrior. But Goscinny had a different picture in his mind, visualizing Asterix as a shrewd, compact warrior who would possess intelligence and wit more than raw strength. However, Uderzo felt that the downsized hero needed a strong but dim companion, to which Goscinny agreed. Hence, Obelix was born.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kessler Peter&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1= Kessler |first1= Peter |title=Asterix Complete Guide |edition= First |date=2 November 1995 |publisher=Hodder Children's Books  |isbn=978-0-340-65346-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the growing popularity of ''Asterix'' with the readers, the financial backing for the publication ''Pilote'' ceased. ''Pilote'' was taken over by [[Dargaud|Georges Dargaud]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kessler Peter&quot;/&gt;

When Goscinny died in 1977, Uderzo continued the series by popular demand of the readers, who implored him to continue. He continued to issue new volumes of the series, but on a less-frequent basis. Many critics and fans of the series prefer the earlier collaborations with Goscinny.&lt;ref name=&quot;beeb&quot;/&gt; Uderzo created his own publishing company, Les Editions [[Albert-René]], which published every album drawn and written by Uderzo alone since then.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kessler Peter&quot;/&gt; However, [[Dargaud]], the initial publisher of the series, kept the publishing rights on the 24 first albums made by both Uderzo and Goscinny. In 1990, the Uderzo and Goscinny families decided to sue Dargaud to take over the rights. In 1998, after a long trial, Dargaud lost the rights to publish and sell the albums. Uderzo decided to sell these rights to Hachette instead of Albert-René, but the publishing rights on new albums were still owned by Albert Uderzo (40%), Sylvie Uderzo (20%) and Anne Goscinny (40%).{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

In December 2008, Uderzo sold his stake to Hachette, which took over the company.&lt;ref&gt;Lezard, Nicholas (January 16, 2009), [https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jan/16/asterix-sylvie-uderzo-le-monde Asterix has sold out to the Empire] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819074148/https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jan/16/asterix-sylvie-uderzo-le-monde |date=19 August 2016 }},&quot; [[The Guardian]] (retrieved June 21, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter published in the French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' in 2009, Uderzo's daughter, Sylvie, attacked her father's decision to sell the family publishing firm and the rights to produce new ''Astérix'' adventures after his death. She said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... the co-creator of ''Astérix'', France's comic strip hero, has betrayed the Gaulish warrior to the modern-day Romans – the men of industry and finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Shirbon | first=Estelle | work=[[Reuters]] | date=14 January 2009 | accessdate=16 January 2009 | title=Asterix battles new Romans in publishing dispute | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSTRE50D46K20090114 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525025049/http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSTRE50D46K20090114 | archive-date=25 May 2009 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7831375.stm | title=Divisions emerge in Asterix camp | date=15 January 2009 | accessdate=16 January 2009 | work=[[BBC News Online]] | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090119011222/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7831375.stm| archivedate= 19 January 2009 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, René Goscinny's daughter, Anne, also gave her agreement to the continuation of the series and sold her rights at the same time. She is reported to have said that &quot;''Asterix'' has already had two lives: one during my father's lifetime and one after it.

In January 2015, after the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|murders]] of seven cartoonists at the satirical Paris weekly ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'', ''Astérix'' creator Albert Uderzo came out of retirement to draw two ''Astérix'' pictures honouring the memories of the victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/charlie-hebdo-asterix-creator-albert-uderzo-comes-out-of-retirement-to-draw-je-suis-charlie-cartoon-9968835.html|title=Asterix creator comes out of retirement to declare 'Moi aussi je suis un Charlie'|date=2015-01-09|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719011653/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/charlie-hebdo-asterix-creator-albert-uderzo-comes-out-of-retirement-to-draw-je-suis-charlie-cartoon-9968835.html|archive-date=19 July 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Asterix Conquers Rome]]'' is a comics adaptation of the animated film ''[[The Twelve Tasks of Asterix]]''. It was released in 1976, and was the 23rd volume to be published, but it has been rarely reprinted and is not considered to be [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] to the series. The only English translations ever to be published were in the ''[[Asterix Annual 1980]]'' and never an English standalone volume. A picture-book version of the same story was published in English translation as ''The Twelve Tasks of Asterix'' by Hodder &amp; Stoughton in 1978.

In 1996, a tribute album in honour of Albert Uderzo was released titled &quot;[[Uderzo Croqué par ses Amis]]&quot;, a volume containing 21 short stories with Uderzo in Ancient Gaul. This volume was published by [[Soleil Productions]] and has not been translated into English

In 2007, Les Editions Albert René released a tribute volume titled ''[[Astérix et ses Amis]]'', a 60-page volume of one-to-four-page short stories. It was a tribute to Albert Uderzo on his 80th birthday by 34 European cartoonists. The volume was translated into nine languages. {{as of|2016}}, it has not been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asterix.com/edition/albums-hors-collection/asterix-et-ses-amis.html |title=Les albums hors collection - Astérix et ses Amis - Hommage à Albert Uderzo |publisher=Asterix.com |accessdate=31 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607234005/http://www.asterix.com/edition/albums-hors-collection/asterix-et-ses-amis.html |archive-date=7 June 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the French publisher Hachette, along with Anne Goscinny and Albert Uderzo decided to make the special issue album ''[[The XII Tasks of Asterix]]'' for the 40th anniversary of the film ''The Twelve Tasks of Asterix''. There was no English edition.

==Synopsis and characters==
{{Main|List of Asterix characters}}
The main setting for the series is an unnamed coastal village (rumoured to be inspired by [[Erquy]]) in [[Armorica]] (present-day [[Brittany]]), a province of [[Gaul]] (modern France), in the year 50 BC. Julius Caesar has conquered nearly all of Gaul for the Roman Empire. The little Armorican village, however, has held out because the villagers can gain temporary superhuman strength by drinking a magic potion brewed by the local village druid, [[Getafix]]. His chief is [[Vitalstatistix]].

The main protagonist and hero of the village is [[Asterix (character)|Asterix]], who, because of his shrewdness, is usually entrusted with the most important affairs of the village. He is aided in his adventures by his rather corpulent and slower thinking friend, Obelix, who, because he fell into the druid's cauldron of the potion as a baby, has permanent superhuman strength (because of this, Getafix steadily refuses to allow Obelix to drink the potion, as doing so would have a dangerous and unpredictable result). Obelix is usually accompanied by [[List of Asterix characters#Dogmatix|Dogmatix]], his little dog. (Except for Asterix and Obelix, the names of the characters change with the language. For example, Obelix's dog's name is &quot;Dogmatix&quot; in English, but &quot;Idéfix&quot; in the original French edition.)

Asterix and Obelix (and sometimes other members of the village) go on various adventures both within the village and in far away lands. Places visited in the series include parts of [[Gaul]] ([[Lutetia]], [[Corsica]] etc.), neighbouring nations ([[Belgium]], [[Spain]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Germany]] etc.), and far away lands ([[North America]], [[Middle East]], [[India]] etc.).

The series employs [[science-fiction]] and [[fantasy]] elements in the more recent books; for instance, the use of [[extraterrestrials]] in ''[[Asterix and the Falling Sky]]'' and the city of [[Atlantis]] in ''[[Asterix and Obelix All at Sea]]''.

==Humour==
The humour encountered in the ''Asterix'' comics often centers around [[pun]]s, [[caricature]]s, and [[tongue-in-cheek]] [[stereotype]]s of contemporary European nations and [[List of regions in France|French regions]]. Much of the humour in the initial Asterix books was French-specific, which delayed the translation of the books into other languages for fear of losing the jokes and the spirit of the story. Some translations have actually added local humour: In the Italian translation, the Roman legionaries are made to speak in 20th-century Roman dialect, and Obelix's famous ''Ils sont fous ces romains'' (&quot;These Romans are crazy&quot;) is translated properly as ''Sono pazzi questi romani'', humorously alluding to the Roman abbreviation ''[[SPQR]]''. In another example: [[Hiccups]] are written [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeically]] in French as ''hips'', but in English as &quot;hic&quot;, allowing Roman legionaries in more than one of the English translations to [[declension|decline]] their hiccups absurdly in Latin (''hic, haec, hoc''). The newer albums share a more universal humour, both written and visual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7049642.stm |title=The vital statistics of Asterix |date=18 October 2007 |work=BBC News|accessdate=10 March 2010 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100208100111/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7049642.stm| archivedate= 8 February 2010 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Character names===
[[File:Exposition Astérix à la BnF (10307420605).jpg|thumb|Various ''Astérix'' character figurines at an exposition]]
All the fictional characters in ''Asterix'' have names which are puns on their roles or personalities, and which follow certain patterns specific to nationality. Certain rules are followed (most of the time) such as Gauls (and their neighbours) having an &quot;-ix&quot; suffix for the men and ending in &quot;-a&quot; for the women; for example, Chief [[Vitalstatistix]] (so called due to his portly stature) and his wife [[Impedimenta]] (often at odds with the chief). The male Roman names end in &quot;-us&quot;, echoing Latin nominative male singular form, as in [[List of Asterix characters#Romans|Gluteus Maximus]], a muscle-bound athlete whose name is literally the [[gluteus maximus|butt]] of the joke. Gothic names (present-day Germany) end in &quot;-ic&quot;, after Gothic chiefs such as [[Alaric I|Alaric]] and [[Theoderic]]; for example [[Rhetoric]] the interpreter. Greek names end in &quot;-os&quot; or &quot;-es&quot;; for example, [[Thermos]] the restaurateur. British names end in &quot;-ax&quot; and are often puns on the [[taxation]] associated with the later [[United Kingdom]]; examples include [[Value added tax|Valuaddedtax]] the druid, and [[Selective employment tax|Selectivemploymentax]] the mercenary. Other nationalities are treated to [[Pidgin]] translations from their language, like Huevos y Bacon, a Spanish chieftain (whose name, meaning [[eggs and bacon]], is often guidebook Spanish for tourists), or literary and other popular media references, like [[List of Asterix characters#Caricatures|Dubbelosix]] (a sly reference to [[James Bond]]'s codename &quot;007&quot;).

Most of these jokes, and hence the names of the characters, are specific to the translation; for example, the druid named [[Getafix]] in English translation is ''Panoramix'' in the original French and ''Miraculix'' in German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asterix.com/the-a-to-z-of-asterix/characters/getafix.html|publisher=Asterix the official website|title=A to Z of Asterix: Getafix|access-date=8 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111204808/http://www.asterix.com/the-a-to-z-of-asterix/characters/getafix.html|archive-date=11 January 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, occasionally the wordplay has been preserved: Obelix's dog, known in the original French as ''Idéfix'' (from ''[[Idée fixe (psychology)|idée fixe]]'', a &quot;fixed idea&quot; or obsession), is called ''Dogmatix'' in English, which not only renders the original meaning strikingly closely (&quot;dogmatic&quot;) but in fact adds another layer of wordplay with the syllable &quot;Dog-&quot; at the beginning of the name.

The name ''Asterix'', [[French language|French]] ''Astérix'', comes from ''{{lang|fr|astérisque}}'', meaning &quot;[[asterisk]]&quot;, which is the typographical symbol '''*''' indicating a footnote, from the Greek word αστήρ (''aster''), meaning a &quot;star&quot;. His name is usually left unchanged in translations, aside from accents and the use of local [[alphabet]]s. For example, in [[Esperanto]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] it is ''Asteriks'' (in Turkish he was first named ''Bücür'' meaning &quot;shorty&quot;, but the name was then standardised). Two exceptions include [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], in which he is known as ''Ástríkur'' (&quot;Rich of love&quot;), and [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], where he is known as {{lang|si|සූර පප්පා}} (''Soora Pappa''), which can be interpreted as &quot;[[Hero]]&quot;.

For explanations of some of the other names, see [[List of Asterix characters|List of ''Asterix'' characters]].

===Ethnic stereotypes===
Many of the ''Asterix'' adventures take place in other countries away from their homeland in Gaul. In every album that takes place abroad, the characters meet (usually modern-day) stereotypes for each country, as seen by the French.

* Italics (Italians) are the inhabitants of Italy. In the adventures of Asterix, the term &quot;Romans&quot; is used by non-Italics to refer to all inhabitants of Italy, who at that time had extended their dominion over a large part of the Mediterranean basin. But as can be seen in ''[[Asterix and the Chariot Race]]'', in the Italic peninsula this term is used only to the people from the capital, with many Italics preferring to identify themselves as Umbrians, Etruscans, Venetians, etc. Various topics from this country are explored, as in this example, Italian gastronomy (pasta, pizza, wine), art, famous people (Pavarotti, Berlusconi, Mona Lisa), and even the controversial issue of political corruption.
* Goths (Germans) are disciplined and militaristic, they are composed of many factions that fight amongst each other (which is a reference to Germany before [[Otto von Bismarck]], and to East and West Germany after the Second World War), and they wear the [[Pickelhaube]] helmet common during the [[German Empire]].
* Helvetians (Swiss) are neutral, eat [[fondue]], and are obsessed with cleaning, accurate time-keeping, and banks.
* The Britons (English) are [[phlegmatic]], and speak with early 20th-century aristocratic slang (similar to [[Bertie Wooster]]). They stop for [[Tea (drink)|Tea]] every day (making it with hot water and a drop of milk until Asterix brings them actual [[tea]] leaves), drink lukewarm beer ([[Bitter (beer)|Bitter]]), eat tasteless foods with mint sauce ([[Rosbif]]), and live in streets containing rows of identical houses.
* Hibernians (Irish) inhabit Hibernia, the Latin name of Ireland and they fight against the Romans alongside the Britons to defend the British Isles.
* Iberians (Spanish) are filled with [[pride]] and have rather choleric tempers. They produce [[olive oil]], provide very slow aid for chariot problems on the Roman roads and (due to Asterix's actions) adopt [[bullfighting]] as a tradition.
* When the Gauls visited North America in ''[[Asterix and the Great Crossing]]'', Obelix punches one of the attacking [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] with a [[knockout]] blow. The warrior first hallucinates [[American eagle|American-style emblematic eagles]]; the second time, he sees stars in the formation of the [[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]]; the third time, he sees stars shaped like the [[United States military aircraft national insignia|United States Air Force roundel]]. Asterix's inspired idea for getting the attention of a [[L'Anse aux Meadows|nearby Viking ship]] (which could take them back to Gaul) is to hold up a torch; this refers to the [[Statue of Liberty]] (which was a gift from France).
* Corsicans are proud, patriotic, and easily aroused but lazy, making decisions by using [[political corruption|pre-filled]] [[ballot box]]es. They harbour [[Feud|vendettas]] against each other, and always take their [[siesta]]. 
* Greeks are [[chauvinism|chauvinists]] and consider Romans, Gauls, and all others to be [[barbarians]]. They eat stuffed grape leaves ([[dolma]]), drink [[retsina]], and are [[tourism in Greece|hospitable to tourists]]. Most seem to be related by blood, and often [[nepotism|suggest some cousin]] appropriate for a job.
* Normans ([[Vikings]]) drink endlessly, they don't know what fear is (which they're trying to discover), and in their home territory ([[Scandinavia]]), the night lasts for 6 months.
* Cimbres (Danes) are very similar to the Normans. But while Asterix and Obelix were unable to communicate with them, they are perfectly able to understand the Cimbres. Their names end in &quot;-ten&quot;, perhaps similar to those of the Normans, whose names end in &quot;-sen&quot;.
* Belgians speak with a funny accent, snub the Gauls, and always eat sliced roots deep-fried in bear fat. They also tell [[Belgian joke]]s.
* Lusitanians (Portuguese) are short in stature and polite (Uderzo said all the Portuguese who he had met were like that).
* [[Sumer]]ians, [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Hittites]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadians]], and [[Babylonia]]ns are perpetually at war with each other and attack strangers because they confuse them with their enemies, but they later apologize when they realize that the strangers are not their enemies. This is likely a criticism of the constant conflicts among the Middle Eastern peoples.
* The Jews are all depicted as [[Yemenite Jews]], with dark skin, black eyes, and beards, a tribute to [[Marc Chagall]], the famous painter whose painting of [[King David]] hangs at the [[Knesset]] (Israeli Parliament).
* [[Numidian]]s, contrary to the [[Berbers|Berber]] inhabitants of ancient Numidia (located in North Africa), are obviously Africans from [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. The names end in &quot;-tha&quot;, similar to the historical king [[Jugurtha]] of Numidia.
* The Picts (Scots) wear typical dress with a [[kilt]] (skirt), have the habit of drinking &quot;malt water&quot; ([[whisky]]) and throwing logs ([[caber toss]]ing) as a popular sport and their names all start with &quot;Mac-&quot;.
* Sarmatians (Russians), inhabit the North [[Black Sea]] area, which represents present-day Russia. Their names end in &quot;-ov&quot;, like many Russian surnames.

When the Gauls see foreigners speaking their foreign languages, these have different representation in the cartoon [[speech bubble]]s:

*Iberian: Same as Spanish, with inversion of exclamation marks ('¡') and question marks (&quot;¿&quot;)
*Goth language: Gothic script (incomprehensible to the Gauls, except Getafix)
*Viking (Normans and Cimbres): &quot;Ø&quot; and &quot;Å&quot; instead of &quot;O&quot; and &quot;A&quot; (incomprehensible to the Gauls)
*Amerindian: Pictograms and sign language (generally incomprehensible to the Gauls)
*Egyptians and Kushites: [[Hieroglyphics]] with explanatory footnotes (incomprehensible to the Gauls)
*Greek: Straight letters, carved as if in stone
*Sarmatian: In their speech balloons, some letters (E, F, N, R ...) are written in a mirror-reversed form, which evokes the modern [[Cyrillic alphabet]].

In the Netherlands, several volumes were translated into [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]], a Germanic language spoken in the province of [[Friesland]]; into [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]], a regional language spoken not only in [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Dutch Limburg]] but also in [[Limburg (Belgium)|Belgian Limburg]] and [[North Rhine-Westphalia|North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany]]; and into [[Tweants dialect|Tweants]], a dialect in the region of [[Twente]] in the eastern province of [[Overijssel]]. Hungarian-language books have been published in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] for the [[Magyars|Hungarian]] minority living in [[Serbia]]. Although not translated into a fully autonomous dialect, the books differ slightly from the language of the books issued in Hungary. In [[Sri Lanka]], the cartoon series was adapted into [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] as ''Sura Pappa''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asterix.com&quot;/&gt;

Most volumes have been translated into [[Latin]] and [[Attic Greek|Ancient Greek]], with accompanying teachers' guides, as a way of teaching these ancient languages.

===English translation===
{{Main|English translations of Asterix}}
Before Asterix became famous, translations of some strips were published in British comics including ''Valiant'', ''Ranger'', and ''Look &amp; Learn'', under names ''Little Fred and Big Ed''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://comictrip.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/asterix-le-breton-little-fred-big-ed-part-1/ |title=Astérix le Breton: Little Fred &amp; Big Ed (part 1) |website=ComicOrama en Français|date=  2015-04-21|accessdate= 11 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170601033832/https://comictrip.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/asterix-le-breton-little-fred-big-ed-part-1/|archive-date=1 June 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Beric the Bold'', set in Roman-occupied Britain.

The first 33 Asterix books were translated into English by [[Derek Hockridge]] and [[Anthea Bell]], who were widely praised for maintaining the spirit and humour of the original French versions. Derek Hockridge died in 2013, so Anthea Bell translated books 34 to 36 by herself, before retiring in 2016 for health reasons. She died in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/18/anthea-bell-magnificent-translator-of-asterix-and-kafka-dies-aged-82|title=Anthea Bell, 'magnificent' translator of Asterix and Kafka, dies aged 82|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=2018-10-18|newspaper=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181019144919/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/18/anthea-bell-magnificent-translator-of-asterix-and-kafka-dies-aged-82|archive-date=19 October 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adriana Hunter]] is the present translator.
