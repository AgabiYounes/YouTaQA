'''Abdulaziz al-Omari''' ({{lang-ar|عبد العزيز العمري}}, {{transl|ar|''ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz al-ʿUmarī''}}, also [[transliteration|transliterated]] as '''Alomari''' or '''al-Umari'''; May 28, 1979&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=John J. Lumpkin |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/abdul_aziz_al_omari.htm |title=Abdul Aziz al Omari |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=2012-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118061734/http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/abdul_aziz_al_omari.htm |archive-date=2012-01-18 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; – September 11, 2001) was a Saudi [[airport security]] guard and imam who was one of five [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|hijackers]] of [[American Airlines Flight 11]] as part of the [[September 11 attacks]].

Omari arrived in the [[United States]] in June 2001, on a tourist visa, obtained through the [[Visa policy of the United States|Visa Express]] program. On September 11, 2001, Omari boarded [[American Airlines Flight 11]] and assisted in the hijacking of the plane, which was crashed into the North Tower of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]], as part of the coordinated attacks.

==Early life and education==
Little is known about al-Omari's life, and it is unclear whether some information refers to Omari or another person by that name. He had used the birth date May 28, 1979.

==Career==
He is alleged to have often served as an [[Imam (Sunni Islam)|imam]] at his mosque in Saudi Arabia and is believed by American authorities{{who|date=September 2011}} to have been a student of Saudi cleric [[Sulaiman Al-Alwan]], whose mosque is located in [[Al-Qassim Province]].

According to [[Walid bin Attash]], Omari was one of a group of future hijackers who provided security at [[Kandahar]] airport after their basic training at an al-Qaeda camp. During the [[Kuala Lumpur al-Qaeda Summit|2000 Al Qaeda Summit]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], American authorities state that immigration records show that a person named Abdulaziz al-Omari was visiting the country, although they say they are not sure that this was the same person.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

In the autumn of 2001, after the [[September 11 attacks]], al Jazeera television broadcast a tape they claim was made by Omari. The speaker made a farewell suicide video. In it he read, &quot;I am writing this with my full conscience and I am writing this in expectation of the end, which is near. . . God praise everybody who trained and helped me, namely the leader Sheikh [[Osama bin Laden]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Unger2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Unger|first1=Craig|authorlink=Craig Unger|title=House of Bush, House of Saud|date=19 March 2004|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780743266239|page=230|url=http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/House-of-Bush-House-of-Saud/Craig-Unger/9780743266239|accessdate=10 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810193434/http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/House-of-Bush-House-of-Saud/Craig-Unger/9780743266239|archivedate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] director [[Robert Mueller]] and the [[9/11 Commission]], Omari entered the United States through a [[Dubai]] flight on June 29, 2001, with [[Salem al-Hazmi]], landing in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/2002_hr/092602mueller.html |title=Statement of Robert S.

He apparently stayed with several other hijackers in [[Paterson, New Jersey]], before moving to his own place at 4032 57th Terrace, [[Vero Beach, Florida]]. On his rental agreement form for that house, Omari gave two license-plates authorized to park in his space, one of which was registered to Atta.&lt;ref name=PATERSON&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/atta/resources/documents/fbiaffidavit11.htm FBI Affidavit: Page 11] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318141730/http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/atta/resources/documents/fbiaffidavit11.htm |date=2007-03-18 }} ABC&lt;/ref&gt;

Omari obtained a fake United States ID card from All Services Plus in [[Passaic County, New Jersey]], which was in the business of selling fake documents, including another to [[Khalid al-Mihdhar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/08/nyregion/a-plea-deal-then-freedom-in-terror-case-where-prosecutors-kept-evidence-a-secret.html?pagewanted=all |title=A Plea Deal, Then Freedom, in Terror Case Where Prosecutors Kept Evidence a Secret |author=Miller, Jonathan |date=2003-03-08 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=2008-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612165109/https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/08/nyregion/a-plea-deal-then-freedom-in-terror-case-where-prosecutors-kept-evidence-a-secret.html?pagewanted=all |archive-date=2018-06-12 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was married and had a daughter. 

===Attacks===
[[Image:Atta in airport.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Atta (blue shirt) and Omari at [[Portland International Jetport]] on 9/11]]
{{Main|American Airlines Flight 11}}
On September 10, 2001, [[Mohamed Atta]] picked up Omari from the Milner Hotel in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], and the two drove [[Vehicles of the hijackers in the September 11 attacks#Mohamed Atta's Nissan Altima|their rented Nissan]] to a [[Choice Hotels|Comfort Inn]] in [[Portland, Maine|South Portland, Maine]], where they spent the night in room 232. In the afternoon he and Atta visited the Longfellow House in Portland, where they took part in a guided tour. Omari emphatically shook the guide's hand three times to thank her at the end of the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/926057150|title=Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in Portland : the fireside poet of Maine|last=Babin, John William,|first=|publisher=|others=Levinsky, Allan M.,|year=|isbn=1-62619-499-8|location=Charleston, SC|pages=134f|oclc=926057150}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially reported that Adnan and Ameer Bukhari were the two hijackers who had rented and driven the car.&lt;ref name=REPORTED&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200109/13/eng20010913_80131.html |title=Two Brothers among Hijackers: CNN Report |date=13 September 2001 |newspaper=[[People's Daily Online]] |access-date=21 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early hours of September 11, they boarded a commuter flight back to Boston to connect to [[American Airlines Flight 11]]. American 11 was hijacked 15 minutes after the flight departed by Omari and four other hijackers, which allowed trained pilot Mohamed Atta to crash the Boeing 767 into the North Tower of the World Trade Center as part of an attack that killed thousands of people.

==Legacy==

===Mistaken identity===
Controversy over Omari's identity erupted shortly after the attacks. At first, the FBI had named [[Abdul Rahman al-Omari]], a pilot for [[Saudi Arabian Airlines]], as the pilot of Flight 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1000934272326780760 |title=Media Mistook Four Saudi Pilots For Hijackers in U.S. Attacks |first=Chad |last=Terhune |first2=Will |last2=Pinkston |first3=Douglas A. |last3=Blackmon |author3-link=Douglas A. Blackmon |date=20 September 2010 |access-date=21 April 2019 |newspaper=[[WSJ]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was quickly shown that this person was still alive, and the FBI issued an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0109/21/tpt.00.html |title=America's New War: Tracking the Terrorists |date=21 September 2001 |access-date=21 April 2019 |work=[[CNN]] |publisher=[[Time Warner Company]] |first=Susan |last=Candiotti |author-link=Susan Candiotti}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also quickly determined that [[Mohamed Atta]] was the pilot among the hijackers. The FBI then named Abdulaziz al-Omari as a hijacker.

A man with the same name as those given by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] turned up alive in [[Saudi Arabia]], saying that he had studied at the [[University of Denver]] and his [[passport]] was stolen there in 1995. The name, origin, birth date, and occupation were released by the FBI, but the picture was not of him. &quot;I couldn't believe it when the FBI put me on their list&quot;, he said. &quot;They gave my name and my date of birth, but I am not a suicide bomber. I am here. I am alive. I have no idea how to fly a plane. I had nothing to do with this.&quot;&lt;ref name=NOFLY&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F2071FF63D5F0C758DDDA00894D9404482 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first=Kevin |last=Sack |author-link=Kevin Sack |title=AFTER THE ATTACKS: MISSED CUES; Saudi May Have Been Suspected in Error, Officials Say |date=16 September 2001 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219082529/https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F2071FF63D5F0C758DDDA00894D9404482 |archive-date=19 December 2005 |page=7 |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |access-date=4 February 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Suicide hijacker' is an airline pilot alive and well in Jeddah |last=Fisk |first=Robert |author-link=Robert Fisk |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/story.jsp?story=94438 |date=24 June 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040624055254/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/story.jsp?story=94438 |archive-date=24 June 2004 |access-date=21 April 2019 |newspaper=[[Independent (newspaper)|Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1559151.stm |title=Middle East &amp;#124; Hijack 'suspects' alive and well |work=[[BBC News]] |date=23 September 2001 |access-date=6 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150730151931/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1559151.stm |archive-date=30 July 2015 |publisher=[[BBC]] |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
