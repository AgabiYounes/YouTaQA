The '''Atlanta Falcons''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The Falcons compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the league's [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) [[NFC South|South]] division.  The Falcons joined the NFL in 1965&lt;ref name=&quot;AtlantaFalcons1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Rise Up: Team History|url=http://media.atlantafalcons.com/assets/History.pdf|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|work=2017 Atlanta Falcons Media Guide|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an [[expansion team]], after the NFL offered then-owner [[Rankin Smith]] a franchise to keep him from joining the rival [[American Football League]] (AFL).

In their 53 years of existence (through 2018), the Falcons have compiled a record of 368–466–6 ({{nowrap|358–452–6}} in the regular season and {{nowrap|10–14}} in the playoffs), winning division championships in [[1980 Atlanta Falcons season|1980]], [[1998 Atlanta Falcons season|1998]], [[2004 Atlanta Falcons season|2004]], [[2010 Atlanta Falcons season|2010]], [[2012 Atlanta Falcons season|2012]], and [[2016 Atlanta Falcons season|2016]]. The Falcons have appeared in two [[Super Bowl]]s, the first during the 1998 season in [[Super Bowl XXXIII]], where they lost to the [[1998 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] {{nowrap|34–19,&lt;ref name=&quot;atlantafalcons2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Hubbuch|first=Bart|title=Queens-born owner models Falcons after hometown team|url=https://nypost.com/2012/01/07/queens-born-owner-models-falcons-after-hometown-team|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|date=January 7, 2012|accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and the second was 18 years later, a {{nowrap|34–28}} overtime loss to the [[2016 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] in [[Super Bowl LI]].

The Falcons' current home field is [[Mercedes-Benz Stadium]], which opened for the [[2017 Atlanta Falcons season|2017]] season; the team's headquarters and practice facilities are located at a {{convert|50|acre|adj=on|spell=in}} site in [[Flowery Branch, Georgia|Flowery Branch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atlanta Falcons Corporate Headquarters and Training Facility|url=http://www.claycorp.com/p/369/atlanta-falcons-corporate-headquarters-training/|website=claycorp.com|accessdate=May 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; northeast of Atlanta in [[Hall County, Georgia|Hall County]].

{{details|History of the Atlanta Falcons}}

===Professional football comes to Atlanta===
Professional football first came to Atlanta in [[1962 American Football League season|1962]], when the [[American Football League]] (AFL) staged two preseason contests, with one featuring the [[1962 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] vs. the [[1962 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]] and the second pitting the [[1962 Dallas Texans season|Dallas Texans]] against the [[1962 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]]. Two years later, the [[American Football League|AFL]] held another exhibition, this time with the [[1964 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] taking on the [[1964 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]].

In 1965, after the [[Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium]] (then known simply as Atlanta Stadium) was built, the city of Atlanta felt the time was right to start pursuing professional football.&lt;ref name=sivmsur&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1965/07/12/606341/the-mayor-surrenders-atlanta |journal=Sports Illustrated |last=Minter |first=Jim |title=The mayor surrenders Atlanta |date=July 12, 1965 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One independent group which had been active in NFL exhibition promotions in Atlanta applied for franchises in both the AFL and NFL, acting entirely on its own with no guarantee of stadium rights. Another group reported it had deposited earnest money for a team in the AFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nflteamhistory.com/nfl_teams/atlanta_falcons/team_history.html|title=Atlanta Falcons Team History|publisher=Nflteamhistory.com|accessdate=September 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517201016/http://www.nflteamhistory.com/nfl_teams/atlanta_falcons/team_history.html|archive-date=May 17, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With everyone running in different directions, some local businessmen ([[Cox Communications|Cox Broadcasting]]) worked out a deal and were awarded an AFL franchise on {{nowrap|June 8, &lt;!--1965,--&gt;}} contingent upon acquiring exclusive stadium rights from city {{nowrap|officials.&lt;ref name=atlgeta&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=32pQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3hAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5649%2C1275283 |work=Milwaukee Sentinel |agency=Associated Press |title=Atlanta gets AFL berth |date=June 9, 1965 |page=3, part 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nhodsbr&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OOhMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uzUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7296%2C4341116 |work=Rome News-Tribune |location=(Georgia) |agency=Associated Press |title=No-holds-barred war set by grid leagues |date=June 9, 1965 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} NFL [[History of the NFL Commissioner|Commissioner]] [[Pete Rozelle]], who had been moving slowly in Atlanta matters, was spurred by the AFL interest and headed on the next plane down to Atlanta to block the rival league's claim on the city {{nowrap|of Atlanta.&lt;ref name=&quot;AtlantaFalcons1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=sivmsur/&gt;&lt;ref name=nhodsbr/&gt;}} He forced the city to make a choice between the two leagues; by June 30, the city picked Rankin Smith and the NFL.&lt;ref name=sivmsur/&gt;&lt;ref name=nwwfst&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2MMVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QREEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1613%2C78312 |work=Milwaukee Sentinel |agency=Associated Press |title=NFL wins 'war' for Atlanta stadium |date=July 1, 1965 |page=2, part 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AFL's original expansion plans in June 1965 were for two new teams {{nowrap|in [[1966 American Football League season|1966]],&lt;ref name=msafltadd&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3mpQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3hAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7400%2C1110883 |work=Milwaukee Sentinel |agency=UPI |title=AFL to add 2 teams in '66 |date=June 8, 1965 |page=3, part 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sr &gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WWtWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uegDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7320%2C2064194 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=American Football League will expand in 1966 |date=June 8, 1965 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} in Atlanta and {{nowrap|Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=pfldojap&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xShQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0AwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5397%2C1442669 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |last=Hackleman|first=Jim |title=Pro football leagues duel over juicy Atlanta plum |date=June 20, 1965 |page=4, sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} It later evolved into the [[1966 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] in 1966 and the [[1968 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]] in [[1968 American Football League season|1968]]. The NFL had planned to add two teams in {{nfly|1967}}; the competition with the AFL for Atlanta forced the first to be added a year early in {{nfly|1966}}. The odd number of teams (15) resulted in one idle team (bye) each week, with each team playing 14 games over 15 weeks (similar to {{nfly|1960}}: 12 games over 13 weeks). The second expansion team, the [[1967 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]], joined the NFL as planned in 1967 as its 16th franchise.

The Atlanta Falcons franchise began on June 30, 1965, when Rozelle granted ownership to 40-year-old [[Rankin Smith Sr.]], an Executive Vice President of Life Insurance Company of Georgia. He paid $8.5 million, the highest price in NFL history at the time for a franchise.&lt;ref name=&quot;AtlantaFalcons1&quot;/&gt; Rozelle and Smith made the deal in about five minutes and the Atlanta Falcons brought the largest and most popular sport to the city of Atlanta. The Atlanta expansion team became the fifteenth NFL franchise, and they were awarded the first overall pick in the [[1966 NFL Draft]] as well as the final pick in each of the first five rounds.&lt;ref name=HOF1966&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/story.jsp?story_id=1998|title=1966 NFL Draft|accessdate =September 27, 2008 |publisher=Pro Football Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt; They selected consensus [[1965 College Football All-America Team|All-American]] [[linebacker]] [[Tommy Nobis]] from the [[1965 Texas Longhorns football season|University of Texas]], making him the first-ever Falcon. The league also held the [[1966 NFL Expansion Draft|expansion draft]] six weeks later in which Atlanta selected unprotected players from the fourteen existing franchises. Although the Falcons selected many good players in those drafts, they still were not able to win right away.&lt;ref name=&quot;AtlantaFalcons1&quot;/&gt;

The Atlanta team received its nickname on August 29, 1965. Miss Julia Elliott, a school teacher from [[Griffin, Georgia|Griffin]], was singled out from many people who suggested &quot;Falcons&quot; as the nickname for the new franchise. She wrote: &quot;the Falcon is proud and dignified, with great courage and fight. It never drops its prey. It is deadly and has a great sporting tradition.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.atlantafalcons.com/footer/faq.html|publisher=Atlanta Falcons|accessdate=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Franchise nicknames|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/nicknames.aspx|publisher=Pro Football Hall of Fame|date=January 1, 2005|accessdate=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1966–1977: Early struggles===
The Falcons' inaugural season was in [[1966 Atlanta Falcons season|1966]], and their first preseason game was on August 1, a loss to the [[1966 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]]. Under head coach [[Norb Hecker]], Atlanta lost their first nine regular season games in 1966; their first victory came on the road against the struggling [[1966 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] on November 20 in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. Two weeks later, Atlanta won at [[1966 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]], and beat [[1966 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|St. Louis]] in Atlanta the next week for their first home win.  The team finished the 1960s with twelve wins in four seasons.

The Falcons had their first [[Monday Night Football]] game in Atlanta during the [[1970 Atlanta Falcons season|1970]] season, a 20–7 loss to the [[1970 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]]. The only two winning seasons in their first twelve years were {{nowrap|[[1971 Atlanta Falcons season|1971]] (7–6–1)}} and {{nowrap|[[1973 Atlanta Falcons season|1973]] (9–5).}}

===1978–1989===
[[File:1987 Atlanta Falcons Pocket Schedule.jpg|thumb|right|The Falcons' defense taking on [[1985 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] quarterback [[John Elway]] during a [[1985 Atlanta Falcons season|1985]] game.]]
In the [[1978 Atlanta Falcons season|1978]] season, the Falcons qualified for the playoffs for the first time and won the Wild Card game against the [[1978 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] 14–13. The following week, they lost to the [[1978 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 27–20 in the Divisional Playoffs.

In the [[1980 Atlanta Falcons season|1980]] season, after a nine-game winning streak, the Falcons posted a franchise then-best record of 12–4 and captured their first NFC West division title. The next week, their dream season ended at home with a loss to the Cowboys 30–27 in the divisional playoffs. In the strike-shortened [[1982 Atlanta Falcons season|1982]] season, the Falcons made the playoffs but lost to the [[1982 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], 30–24. Falcons coach [[Leeman Bennett]] was fired after the loss. The team then had losing seasons for the next eight years.

===1989–1996===
In the [[1989 NFL Draft]], the Falcons selected cornerback [[Deion Sanders]] in the first round, who helped them for the next four years, setting many records for the franchise. &quot;Neon Deion&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Prime Time&quot;) had a flashy appeal and helped bring media attention to one of the league's most anonymous franchises. Sanders was also famous for playing on major league baseball teams ([[New York Yankees]] and the [[Atlanta Braves]]) while simultaneously playing in the NFL.

[[File:Atlanta Falcons at Los Angeles Rams 1991-12-08 - 01 (Atlanta Falcons crop).jpg|thumb|right|The Falcons playing against the [[Los Angeles Rams]] during a 1991 away game.]]

After defeating the [[1991 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] in the NFC Wild Card game, the Falcons' [[1991 Atlanta Falcons season|1991]] season ended in a divisional playoff loss to the [[1991 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]]. In the [[1991 NFL Draft]], the Falcons selected quarterback [[Brett Favre]] as the 33rd overall pick. During his rookie season, he played in two games where he amassed a record of four passing attempts with no receptions and two interceptions. The following February, Favre was traded to the [[1992 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]].

In [[1992 Atlanta Falcons season|1992]], the Atlanta Falcons opened a new chapter in their history moving into the newly constructed Georgia Dome, where the team has defeated all 31 other NFL teams at least once during its time there.

===1997–2000: The Dan Reeves era===
In 1998, under recently acquired head coach [[Dan Reeves]], quarterback [[Chris Chandler]] and running back [[Jamal Anderson]] the &quot;Dirty Bird&quot; Falcons had their greatest season to date. On November 8, they beat the [[New England Patriots]] 41–10, ending a streak of 22 losses at cold-weather sites. The team finished with a franchise-best 14–2 regular season record and the NFC West division championship. On January 17, 1999, the Falcons upset the top-seeded Vikings at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] in the [[NFC Championship Game]] 30–27, in an exciting overtime victory. However, in their first-ever Super Bowl appearance, they lost 34–19 to the defending champion [[Denver Broncos]] in [[Super Bowl XXXIII]].

In the second game of the Falcons 1999 season, running back [[Jamal Anderson]], who had been a key player in the Falcons' 1998 success, suffered a season-ending knee injury. The Falcons finished the season with a very disappointing 5–11 regular season record.&lt;ref name=&quot;AtlantaFalcons1&quot;/&gt; In 2000, the Falcons suffered through another horrendous season finishing 4–12 and once again missing the playoffs.

===2001–2006===
In the [[2001 NFL draft]], the Falcons orchestrated a trade with the [[San Diego Chargers]], acquiring the first overall pick (which was used on quarterback [[Michael Vick]]) in exchange for wide receiver-return specialist [[Tim Dwight]] and the fifth overall pick (used on running back [[LaDainian Tomlinson]]).

The Falcons finished the [[2001 Atlanta Falcons season|2001 season]] with a record of 7–9 and missed the playoffs. [[Jessie Tuggle]] retired following 14 seasons in Atlanta. On December 6, 2001, [[Arthur M. Blank]] reached a preliminary agreement with the Falcons' Taylor Smith to purchase the team. In a special meeting prior to [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] in New Orleans on February 2, 2002, NFL owners voted unanimously to approve the purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2001/12/17/weekinbiz.html | title=Arthur Blank buys Falcons from Smith family | date=December 17, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2002 season saw the Falcons return to the playoffs with a regular season record of 9–6–1, tying the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. It was Vick's first year as the starter, and the team, with newly acquired running back Warrick Dunn, delivered the Green Bay Packers their first home playoff loss ever. A 20-6 loss to the [[Donovan McNabb]]-led Philadelphia Eagles the following week, however, ended the Falcons' season.

On March 19, 2003, the Falcons presented their new logo.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewFalconsLogo2003&quot;&gt;{{cite press release|title=Falcons unveil new logo|url=http://www.atlantafalcons.com/news/press_releases.cfm?cont_id=171010|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=AtlantaFalcons.com|date=March 19, 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030623173517/http://www.atlantafalcons.com/news/press_releases.cfm?cont_id=171010 |archivedate=June 23, 2003|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AtlantaFalcons1&quot; /&gt; During the 2003 preseason Vick broke his leg and missed the first twelve games of the season. After losing 7 straight games, the decision was made to release head coach Dan Reeves. [[Wade Phillips]] acted as interim coach for the final 3 games. Although the Falcons won 3 of their last 4 games after the return of Vick, they ended up with a 5–11 record that year. In 2004, a new head coach, [[Jim L. Mora]], was hired and Vick returned for the [[2004 Atlanta Falcons season|full season]]. The Falcons went 11–5, winning their third division title and earning a first-round bye into the playoffs. In the divisional playoffs, the Falcons defeated the [[2004 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]], 47–17, in the [[Georgia Dome]], advancing to the [[NFC Championship Game]], which they lost to the [[2004 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]], 27–10.

The [[2005 Atlanta Falcons season|Falcons]] again fell short of achieving back-to-back winning seasons in {{nfly|2005}}, going 8–8. In {{nfly|2006}}, Michael Vick became the first quarterback in league history to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a season, with 1,039. After finishing the season 7–9, however, coach Jim Mora was dismissed and [[Bobby Petrino]], the [[University of Louisville]]'s football coach, replaced him. Before the [[2007 NFL season|2007]] season began, Vick was suspended indefinitely by the NFL after pleading guilty to charges involving dog fighting in the state of Virginia. On December 10, 2007, Vick received a 23-month prison sentence and was officially cut from the Atlanta roster.

===2007===
{{main|2007 Atlanta Falcons season}}
For the 2007 season, the [[2007 Atlanta Falcons season|Falcons]] were forced to start [[Joey Harrington]] at quarterback. On December 11, 13 games into his first NFL season as head coach, [[Bobby Petrino]] resigned without notice to coach at the [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|University of Arkansas]], leaving the beleaguered players only a note in the locker room. Secondary Coach [[Emmitt Thomas]] was named interim coach for the final three games of the season on December 12. The Falcons ended the year with a dismal 4–12 record.

===2008–2014: The Mike Smith era===
[[File:Mike Smith (American football coach) 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Mike Smith (American football coach)|Mike Smith]]]]
After the tumultuous and disappointing 2007 season, the Falcons made a number of moves, hiring a new General Manager and head coach, drafting a new starting quarterback, and signing a starting running back.

On January 13, 2008, the Falcons named former Patriots director of college football scouting [[Thomas Dimitroff]] General Manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantafalcons.com/team/staff/Thomas-Dimitroff/5de3ec5a-4fb3-4766-aa9a-3907a563b09c|title=Atlanta Falcons: Thomas Dimitroff|work=atlantafalcons.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 23, [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] defensive coach and former linebackers coach for the 2000 Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens [[Mike Smith (American football coach)|Mike Smith]] was named the Falcons' new head coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantafalcons.com/team/coaches/Mike-Smith/a22e3d7e-3e0b-4143-93b8-42f545b0b0c7|title=Coaches|website=AtlantaFalcons.com|access-date=September 29, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313170557/http://www.atlantafalcons.com/team/coaches/Mike-Smith/a22e3d7e-3e0b-4143-93b8-42f545b0b0c7|archive-date=March 13, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chargers back-up RB [[Michael Turner (American football)|Michael Turner]] agreed to a 6-year deal, $30 million deal on March 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rotoworld.com/recent/nfl/2641/michael-turner|title=Recent news on Michael Turner – Unsigned Free Agent – Rotoworld.com|work=rotoworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 26, [[Matt Ryan (American football)|Matt Ryan]] (quarterback from [[Boston College]]) was drafted third overall in the [[2008 NFL draft]] by the Falcons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2008/draft.htm |title=2008 NFL Draft Listing |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2008====

====2011====
{{main|2011 Atlanta Falcons season}}
The Falcons made a surprise trade up with the [[Cleveland Browns]] in the [[2011 NFL draft]] to select [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] wide receiver [[Julio Jones]] sixth overall. In exchange, the Falcons gave up their first-, second- and fourth-round draft picks in 2011, and their first and fourth draft picks in 2012. Jones, along with teammates [[Tony Gonzalez]] and [[Roddy White]], have since been dubbed Atlanta's &quot;Big Three&quot; (based on their total number of reception yards).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/blog/nfl-rapidreports/21177209/atlantas-jacquizz-rodgers-emerging-as-falcons-top-back|title=Atlanta's Jacquizz Rodgers emerging as Falcons top back|last=Singer|first=Mike|date=November 28, 2012|work=CBSSports.com|accessdate=January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 30, 2011, [[Sports Illustrated]] senior writer [[Peter King (sportswriter)|Peter King]], who correctly predicted the 2011 Super Bowl, made his predictions for the 2011 season and picked the Falcons to defeat the San Diego Chargers in the 2012 Super Bowl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1190002/index.htm?eref=mySI&amp;eref=sisf | work=CNN | title=Galleries | date=September 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Falcons finished the season at 10–6, securing the fifth seed after a Week 17 beatdown of Tampa Bay in which the Falcons pulled their starters after leading 42–0 just 23 minutes into the game.

The Falcons then went on to play the [[New York Giants]] in a 2011 NFC Wild Card Game at [[MetLife Stadium]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]. The first half was a defensive struggle, with the first points coming off of a safety by the Falcons, giving Atlanta a 2–0 lead. In the 2nd quarter, though, [[Eli Manning]] connected with [[Hakeem Nicks]] for a short touchdown pass to make it 7–2 Giants heading into the 2nd half. Then the Giants took control, as Manning threw for two more TD passes to [[Mario Manningham]] and Nicks and the defense completed its shutout of the Falcons to give the [[New York Giants]] the win, 24–2, and the Falcons their third straight playoff loss with [[Matt Ryan (American football)|Matt Ryan]] and [[Mike Smith (American football coach)|Mike Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201201080nyg.htm |title=Wild Card - Atlanta Falcons at New York Giants - January 8th, 2012 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the season Defense Coordinator [[Brian VanGorder]] accepted a coaching job at [[Auburn University]], and the offensive coordinator [[Mike Mularkey]] took the head coaching job in Jacksonville.

====2012====
{{main|2012 Atlanta Falcons season}}
Atlanta exploded out of the gate, going a franchise best 8–0 and remaining the last unbeaten team in the NFL that year. Their hopes to get an undefeated season came to an end with a 27–31 loss to the division rival Saints. Julio Jones had a remarkable second year, grabbing 10 touchdowns and 1,198 yards. The Falcons finished the season 13–3, and clinched the number one seed in the NFC playoffs.

The Falcons played the [[Seattle Seahawks]] in their first playoff game. Although they went down 28–27 with only 31 seconds left on the clock, [[Matt Ryan (American football)|Matt Ryan]] led the team to their first playoff victory, 30–28. It was the only playoff victory in the Mike Smith era.

The Atlanta Falcons then advanced to face the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. The Falcons seized control of the game early with a [[Matt Bryant]] field goal, a trio of Matt Ryan touchdown passes caught by [[Julio Jones]] and [[Tony Gonzalez]] coupled with outstanding defensive play. By the end of the half, the score was 24–14. The tides of the game began to shift in the second half as the 49ers rallied back with a pair of [[Frank Gore]] touchdown runs. Atlanta's offense attempted to reply but were ultimately shut down by the 49er defense. A few series later, late in the 4th quarter with little time remaining, Atlanta found themselves in a 4th and 4 situation at the 10-yard line. The Falcons needed just 10 more yards to secure victory and advance to their first Super Bowl berth in 14 years. Matt Ryan fired a pass to [[Roddy White]] which was ultimately broken up by inside linebacker [[NaVorro Bowman]], resulting in a 28–24 defeat.

====2013====
{{main|2013 Atlanta Falcons season}}
Following the success of the previous season, the Falcons were an expected Super Bowl contender. However, injuries hampered the team's performance and the team finished the season 4–12. With that, the streak of consecutive winning seasons came to an end and [[Mike Smith (American football coach)|Mike Smith]] had his first losing season as a head coach. [[Tony Gonzalez]], in his final season in the NFL, was selected to the [[2014 Pro Bowl]] as a starter representing Team Rice. Following the conclusion of the 2012 season, director of player personnel [[Les Snead]] departed the team to join the [[St. Louis Rams]] and [[David Caldwell (American football executive)|Dave Caldwell]], assistant to general manager [[Thomas Dimitroff]], left the team to join the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]]. Scott Pioli, former GM of the [[New England Patriots]], was announced as the Falcons' new assistant GM. Mike Smith was given a one-year extension on his contract as head coach. The Falcons had the 6th overall pick in the [[2014 NFL draft]] with which they selected [[Jake Matthews (American football)|Jake Matthews]], who played as offensive tackle for [[Texas A&amp;M]].

====2014====
{{main|2014 Atlanta Falcons season}}
Despite having another rough season, the Falcons still had an opportunity to qualify for the playoffs at the end of the regular season. The Falcons hosted the [[Carolina Panthers]] in their regular season finale, with the winners clinching the [[NFC South]] division. Unfortunately, the Falcons lost in a 34–3 blowout as [[Matt Ryan (American football)|Matt Ryan]] threw two interceptions that were returned for touchdowns and got sacked six times.

In February 2015, the team was investigated by the NFL for alleged use of artificial crowd noise in the Georgia Dome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schefter|first=Adam|title=NFL investigating Atlanta Falcons for fake crowd noise at Georgia Dome|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12262464/nfl-investigating-atlanta-falcons-fake-crowd-noise-georgia-dome|publisher=ESPN|date=February 1, 2015|accessdate=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Falcons lost a [[2016 NFL Draft]] selection as a result of the league's investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Patra|first=Kevin|title=Atlanta Falcons lose 2016 pick for pumping fake noise|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000482500/article/atlanta-falcons-lose-2016-pick-for-pumping-fake-noise|publisher=National Football League|date=March 30, 2015|accessdate=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan Quinn's first season saw a 5–0 start, the team's best start in four years. They would then struggle throughout the rest of the season by losing 8 of their last 11 games, resulting in an 8–8 record. They did, however, give the Panthers their only regular season loss. The Falcons used their first-round pick in the [[2016 NFL Draft]] on safety [[Keanu Neal]] from the [[University of Florida]].

====2016====
{{main|2016 Atlanta Falcons season}}
In the Falcons' 25th and final season in the Georgia Dome, Atlanta lost their Week 1 game to the Buccaneers 24–31. The Falcons would then win their next four including one over the Panthers, when the franchise set new records. Matt Ryan threw for 503 yards, and Julio Jones caught 12 passes for 300 yards. With a 41–13 thrashing of the [[San Francisco 49ers]] in Week 15, the Falcons improved to 9–5 and secured their first winning season since 2012. One week later, the Falcons defeated the Panthers in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] and clinched their first NFC South division title since 2012. In their last regular season game at the Georgia Dome, the Falcons defeated the [[New Orleans Saints]], and secured an 11–5 record and a first round bye.

In the divisional round of the playoffs, Atlanta defeated the Seahawks 36–20 in the Georgia Dome, and hosted their last game at the Dome against the [[Green Bay Packers]] in the [[NFC Championship Game]] on January 22, 2017. The Falcons defeated the Packers 44–21 to advance to [[Super Bowl LI]] as the NFC champions. Atlanta was up 28–3 late in the third quarter, and the [[New England Patriots]] scored 31 unanswered points, with the last 6 in the first-ever overtime in the Super Bowl. The Patriots' 25-point comeback was the largest in Super Bowl history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patriots’ Tom Brady earns 4th Super Bowl MVP trophy with epic comeback |url=http://sports.nbcsports.com/2017/02/05/patriots-tom-brady-earns-4th-super-bowl-mvp-trophy-with-epic-comeback/|website=NBC Sports|accessdate=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Falcons scored 540 points in the regular season, the seventh-most in NFL history, tied with the [[Greatest Show on Turf]] (the [[2000 St. Louis Rams season|2000 St. Louis Rams]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Falcons tied Greatest Show on Turf for record 7th most points scored ever|url=http://www.thefalcoholic.com/2017/1/2/14144812/falcons-greatest-show-on-turf-rams-7th-most-points-scored-ever-break-record-thats-a-lot-of-points|website=The Falcoholic|accessdate=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Falcons defense gave up 406 points, 27th in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Atlanta Falcons Statistics &amp; Players|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/atl/2016.htm|website=[[Pro-Football-Reference.com]]|accessdate=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2017====
{{Main|2017 Atlanta Falcons season}}
The Falcons moved into their new home, the [[Mercedes-Benz Stadium]], this season. Their first game ever played at the new stadium was a preseason loss to the [[Arizona Cardinals]]. The first regular season game at the new stadium was a rematch of the 2016–17 NFC Championship, with Atlanta defeating Green Bay 34–23. Their first loss of the season was a 23–17 home defeat to the [[Buffalo Bills]] in week 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/atl/2017_games.htm |title=2017 Atlanta Falcons Schedule &amp; Game Results |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team returned to the playoffs with a 10-6 record (albeit with a third-place finish in the NFC South). The Falcons defeated the Los Angeles Rams 26-13 in the Wild Card round, but their 2017 season came to an end a week later in the Divisional Playoff round at the hands of the eventual Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles 15-10.

==Stadiums==
{{main|Mercedes-Benz Stadium}}
The Falcons have called three stadiums home in their 51 years of existence, and its third home in their history opened in the late summer of 2017. The first was the [[Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium]], sharing with the [[Atlanta Braves]] [[Major League Baseball]] team until 1991. In 1992, the [[Georgia Dome]] was built, and the Falcons played there from its opening to the 2016 season. The Dome has been frequently used for [[college football]], including [[Georgia State Panthers football|Georgia State]] football and college bowl games such as the [[Peach Bowl]].

In an effort to replace the aging Georgia Dome and potentially host a future [[Super Bowl]], team owner Arthur Blank proposed a deal with the city of Atlanta to build a new state-of-the-art stadium not far from where the Georgia Dome is located. Blank will contribute $800 million and the city of Atlanta will contribute an additional $200 million via bonds backed by the city's hotel/motel tax towards the construction of a retractable roof stadium. Blank will contribute additional money for cost overruns if it is needed. The team will provide up to $50 million towards infrastructure costs that weren't included in the construction budget and to retire the remaining debt on the Georgia Dome. In addition, Blank's foundation and the city will each provide $15 million for development in surrounding neighborhoods. Though the total cost of the stadium was initially estimated to be around $1 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9028345/atlanta-falcons-city-officials-agree-financing-terms-new-1-billion-stadium|title=Atlanta Falcons, city officials agree on financing terms for new $1 billion stadium|publisher=ESPN.go.com|date=March 7, 2013|accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the total cost was revised to $1.5 billion according to Blank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saporta|first1=Maria|title=New Falcons stadium cost 'rises up' -- again -- another $100 million|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2015/04/13/new-falcons-stadium-cost-rises-up-again-another.html|website=Atlanta Business Chronicle|publisher=American City Business Journals|accessdate=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, the Atlanta City Council voted 11–4 in favor of building the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxatlanta.com/story/21667196/atlanta-city-council-could-vote-on-new-falcons-stadium#axzz2tZQLx7YR|title=Atlanta City Council approves Falcons stadium funding|publisher=myfoxatlanta.com|date=March 18, 2013|accessdate=February 17, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222100730/http://www.myfoxatlanta.com/story/21667196/atlanta-city-council-could-vote-on-new-falcons-stadium#axzz2tZQLx7YR|archive-date=February 22, 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The retractable roof [[Mercedes-Benz Stadium]] broke ground in May 2014, and became the third home stadium for the Falcons and the first for the new [[Atlanta United FC]] [[Major League Soccer]] club upon opening in 2017.

In the center of the helmet was a center black stripe surrounded by two gold stripes and two white stripes. These colors represented the two college rival schools in the state of Georgia; rival schools [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] (white and gold) and the [[Georgia Bulldogs]] (red and black). Although the gold was removed after several seasons, the white remains to this day. They wore white pants and either black or white jerseys. At first, the falcon crest logo was also put on the jersey sleeves, but it was replaced by a red and white stripe pattern four years later. They switched from black to red jerseys in 1971, and the club began to wear silver pants in 1978. The facemasks on the helmets were initially gray, becoming white in 1978, and then black in 1984; the team has worn black facemasks since then.

A prototype white helmet was developed for the team prior to the [[1974 Atlanta Falcons season|1974 season]], but was never worn.

In [[1990 Atlanta Falcons season|1990]], the uniform design changed to black helmets, silver pants, and either black or white jerseys. The numbers on the white jerseys were black, but were changed to red in [[1997 Atlanta Falcons season|1997]]. (The red numerals could be seen on the away jerseys briefly in 1990.)

Both the logo and uniforms changed in [[2003 Atlanta Falcons season|2003]]. The logo was redesigned with red and silver accents to depict a more powerful, aggressive falcon, which now more closely resembles the capital letter ''F''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewFalconsLogo2003&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uniform History|url=https://www.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/pdf/media-guides/ATL-Media-Guide.pdf#page=377|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|work=2019 Atlanta Falcons Media Guide|date=August 13, 2019|access-date=September 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Falcons still wore black helmets, the new uniforms featured jerseys and pants with red trim down the sides. The uniform design consisted of either black or white jerseys, and either black or white pants. During that same year, a red alternate jersey with black trim was also introduced. The Falcons also started wearing black cleats with these uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Falcons unveil new uniforms at fan rally|url=http://atlantafalcons.com/news/press_releases.cfm?cont_id=177215|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=AtlantaFalcons.com|date=April 24, 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030705011150/http://atlantafalcons.com/news/press_releases.cfm?cont_id=177215|archive-date=July 5, 2003|access-date=August 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[2004 Atlanta Falcons season|2004]], the red jerseys became the primary jerseys, and the black ones became the alternate, both worn with white pants. In select road games, the Falcons wear black pants with white jerseys. The Falcons wore an all-black combination for home games against their archrivals, the [[New Orleans Saints]], winning the first two contests (24–21 in {{nfly|2004}} and 36–17 in {{nfly|2005}}), but losing 31–13 in {{nfly|2006}}. The Falcons wore the all black combination against the New Orleans Saints for four straight seasons starting in 2004, With the last time being in 2007, losing 34–14. They wore the combination again in 2006, against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in Week 2. The Falcons won that game, 14–3. The Falcons also wore their all-black uniform in 2007 against the New York Giants, and in 2008 against the Carolina Panthers and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (for the second time). After that, the black pants and uniforms were retired and the white pants were now used full-time with the regular uniforms.

In the 1980s, the Falcons wore their white uniforms at home most of the time because of the heat. When the Falcons started playing in a dome, the team switched to their dark uniforms for home games but have worn their white uniforms at home a few times since switching to the dome. It was announced at the 2009 state of the franchise meeting that the Falcons would wear 1966 throwback uniforms for a couple games during the 2009 season. The Atlanta Falcons wore 1966 throwback jerseys for two home games in 2009 – against the Carolina Panthers on September 20 and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on November 29. The Falcons won both of those games. They donned the throwbacks again for 2 games in 2010, against Baltimore and San Francisco, winning both of those games as well. The throwbacks were used twice in 2011 and 2012; both times were against the Panthers and Saints. However, the throwbacks were retired following a 2013 NFL rule requiring only one helmet shell per team.

The Falcons unveiled an all-red [[NFL Color Rush|Color Rush]] uniform on September 13, 2016; however, due to the fact that the Falcons and the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] had similar all-red Color Rush uniforms, the Falcons were unable to wear their Color Rush uniform until the 2017 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NFL AND NIKE REVEAL COLOR RUSH UNIFORMS|url=https://www.atlantafalcons.com/news/nfl-and-nike-reveal-color-rush-uniforms-17676181|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=AtlantaFalcons.com|date=September 13, 2016|access-date=June 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tabeek|first=Matthew|title=LOOK: THREE STRAIGHT HOME GAMES WITH THREE DIFFERENT UNIFORM COMBINATIONS FOR FALCONS|url=https://www.atlantafalcons.com/news/look-three-straight-home-games-with-three-different-uniform-combination-19907987|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=AtlantaFalcons.com|date=December 4, 2017|access-date=June 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2016, the Falcons unveiled a mixed throwback uniform set. The uniform tops, pants and socks closely resembled their 1960s kits. But due to the NFL's one-shell rule that prevented them from resurrecting the red helmets, the Falcons instead wore the black helmets with the original logo decal similar to the design they wore in the 1990s.

It was revealed in January 2020 that the Falcons will change uniforms for the [[2020 NFL season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shook|first=Nick|title=Atlanta Falcons to have new uniforms for 2020 season|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001096746/article/atlanta-falcons-to-have-new-uniforms-for-2020-season|publisher=NFL Enterprises|website=NFL.com|date=January 14, 2020|access-date=January 22, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In every season except for their debut season, the Falcons have shared a division with the [[New Orleans Saints]] (first the NFC West, and now the NFC South). Over this time, a heated rivalry has developed between the two cities' franchises, as they were the only two NFL teams in the [[Deep South]] for quite some time. The series is the oldest and most iconic rivalry in the NFC South.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/page/hotread140903 |title=Tomlinson: Falcons-Saints rivalry runs deep |last=Tomlinson |first=Tommy |date=2014-09-02 |website=ESPN.com |language=en |access-date=2019-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atlanta leads the series 52–48.

Sanders, Humphrey, and Gonzalez are the only players in the Hall of Fame that have been inducted based substantially on their service with the Falcons. Andersen spent eight of his 25 NFL seasons with the Falcons, previously being the team's all-time scoring leader, but he also played his first 13 NFL seasons with the New Orleans Saints, leading that team's career scoring list.

===Ring of Honor===
The Atlanta Falcons organization does not officially retire jersey numbers, but considers certain players' jerseys worthy of being honored. The Falcons Ring of Honor, which is featured in the rafters of the Georgia Dome, honors individual players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantafalcons.com/history/ring-of-honor/|title=Atlanta Falcons – Ring of Honor|work=atlantafalcons.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[The CW]] owned-and-operated station [[WUPA]] became the official television station of the Falcons, gaining rights to its preseason games, which are produced by [[CBS Sports]].&lt;ref name=&quot;falcons-wupa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Falcons Announce New Local TV Partner|url=https://www.atlantafalcons.com/news/falcons-announce-new-local-tv-partner-12681760|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=AtlantaFalcons.com|date=February 27, 2014|access-date=June 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
