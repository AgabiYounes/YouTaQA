 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DiFranco's music has been classified as [[folk rock]] and [[alternative rock]], although it has additional influences from [[punk rock|punk]], [[funk]], [[hip hop]] and [[jazz]]. She has released all her albums on her own record label, [[Righteous Babe]], giving her significant creative freedom.

DiFranco supports many social and political movements by performing benefit concerts, appearing on benefit albums and speaking at rallies. Through the Righteous Babe Foundation DiFranco has backed grassroots cultural and political organizations supporting causes including [[abortion rights]] and [[LGBT]] visibility. She counts American folk singer and songwriter Pete Seeger among her mentors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/01/28/ani-difranco-things-pete-seeger-taught-me/|title=Ani DiFranco: Things Pete Seeger Taught Me|last=DiFranco|first=Ani|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
DiFranco was born in [[Buffalo, New York]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://celebritybabynamesblog.com/2007/01/24/baby-girl-for-rock-musician-ani-difranco/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224094142/http://celebritybabynamesblog.com/2007/01/24/baby-girl-for-rock-musician-ani-difranco/|date=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; on September 23, 1970, the daughter of Elizabeth (Ross) and Dante Americo DiFranco (died 2004), who had met while attending the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003709/Ani-DiFranco.html |title=Ani DiFranco Biography – Discography, Music, Lyrics, Album, CD, Career, Famous Works, and Awards |publisher=Musicianguide.com |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.righteousbabe.com/ani/dante/index.asp]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224222447/http://www.righteousbabe.com/ani/dante/index.asp|date=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BN&amp;p_theme=bn&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=1041E247A98F4F42&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=News Archives: The Buffalo News |publisher=Nl.newsbank.com |date=July 26, 2004 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was of Italian descent, and her mother was from Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicvice.com/reviews/ani_difranco_montreal_november_2008.html |title=Ani DiFranco at Metropolis, Montreal -concert review |publisher=Music Vice |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; DiFranco started playing [[The Beatles|Beatles]] covers at local bars and [[busking]] with her guitar teacher, Michael Meldrum,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.righteousbabe.com/store/prod_albums.asp?id=473]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708233831/http://www.righteousbabe.com/store/prod_albums.asp?id=473|date=July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of nine. By 14 she was writing her own songs. She played them at bars and coffee houses throughout her teens. DiFranco graduated from the [[Buffalo Academy for Visual and Performing Arts]] high school at 16 and began attending classes at [[Buffalo State College]]. She was living by herself, having moved out of her mother's apartment after she became an [[emancipated minor]] when she was 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eric-goldscheider.com/id83.html |title=Ani DiFranco |publisher=Eric-goldscheider.com |date=December 4, 2003 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
DiFranco started her own record company, [[Righteous Babe Records]], in 1989 at age 19.&lt;ref name=&quot;MilwaukeeJS2006&quot;/&gt; She released her [[Ani DiFranco (album)|self-titled debut album]] in the winter of 1990, shortly after relocating to New York City. There, she took poetry classes at [[The New School]], where she met poet [[Sekou Sundiata]], who was to become a friend and mentor. She toured steadily for the next 15 years, pausing only to record albums. Appearances at Canadian folk festivals and increasingly larger venues in the U.S. reflected her increasing popularity on the North American folk and roots scene. Throughout the early and mid-1990s DiFranco toured solo and also as a duo with Canadian drummer [[Andy Stochansky]].

In September 1995, DiFranco participated in a concert at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in Cleveland Ohio, inaugurating the opening of the [[Woody Guthrie]] Archives in New York City. She later released a CD on Righteous Babe of the concert ''Til We Outnumber Em'' featuring artists such as DiFranco, [[Billy Bragg]], [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]], [[Arlo Guthrie]], [[Indigo Girls]], [[Dave Pirner]], [[Tim Robbins]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]] with 100 percent of proceeds going to the Woody Guthrie Foundation and Archives and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum educational department.&lt;ref&gt;Robicheau, Paul. Ellis Paul's got Woody Guthrie under his skin. Boston Globe, September 20, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, bassist [[Sara Lee (musician)|Sara Lee]] joined the touring group, whose live rapport is showcased on the 1997 album ''[[Living in Clip]]''. DiFranco would later release Lee's solo album ''Make It Beautiful'' on Righteous Babe. In 1998, Stochansky left to pursue a solo career as a singer-songwriter. A new touring ensemble consisting of Jason Mercer on bass, Julie Wolf on keyboards, and Daren Hahn on drums, augmented at times by a horn section, accompanied DiFranco on tour between 1998 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lankford Jr.|first=Ronnie|title=review, So Much Shouting|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/so-much-shouting-so-much-laughter-mw0000227692|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s were a period of heightened exposure for DiFranco, as she continued playing ever larger venues around the world and attracted international attention of the press, including cover stories in ''Spin'', ''Ms.'', and ''Magnet'', among others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Righteous Babe|authorlink=Righteous Babe|title=covers gallery|url=http://righteousbabe.myshopify.com/products/cover-shots|publisher=RBR web site|accessdate=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as appearances on MTV and VH1. Her playfully ironic cover of the Bacharach/David song &quot;Wishin' and Hopin{{'&quot;}} appeared under the opening titles of the film ''[[My Best Friend's Wedding]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|title=review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/my-best-friends-wedding-original-soundtrack-mw0000023914|work=my best friends wedding soundtrack|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She guest starred on a 1998 episode of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sitcom ''[[King of the Hill]]'', as the voice of [[Peggy Hill|Peggy]]'s feminist guitar teacher, Emily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/151761/ani-difranco-does-king-of-the-hill/|title=Ani DiFranco Does 'King of The Hill'|first=MTV News|last=Staff|publisher=MTV News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 11, 2001, DiFranco was in Manhattan and later penned the poem &quot;Self Evident&quot; about the experience. The poem was featured in the book ''It's a Free Country: Personal Freedom in America After September 11''. The poem's title also became the name of DiFranco's first book of poetry released exclusively in Italy by Minimum Fax. It was later also featured in ''Verses'', a book of her poetry published in the U.S. by Seven Stories press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ani|first=DiFranco|title=Verses|year=2007|publisher=Seven Stories Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781583228234|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ho9r6AGkZfMC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=sekou+sundiata+and+ani+difranco#v=onepage&amp;q=sekou%20sundiata%20and%20ani%20difranco&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; DiFranco has written and performed many spoken-word pieces throughout her career and was showcased as a poet on the HBO series ''Def Poetry'' in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.righteousbabe.com/blogs/news/6238300-ani-to-appear-on-russell-simmons-presents-def-poetry-on-august-29th|title=ANI TO APPEAR ON RUSSELL SIMMONS PRESENTS DEF POETRY ON AUGUST 29TH. – righteousbabe|website=righteousbabe.com|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I think religion serves a lot of different purposes in people's lives, and I can recognize the value of that, you know, the value of ceremony, the value of community, or even just having a forum to get together and talk about ideas, about morals – that's a cool concept. But then, of course, institutional religions are so problematic.}}

DiFranco's guitar playing is often characterized by a signature [[staccato]] style,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://folkmusic.about.com/od/artistsaz/p/AniD_profile.htm |title=Facts about Ani |publisher=Folkmusic.about.com |date=November 14, 2013 |accessdate=December 4, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019093248/http://folkmusic.about.com/od/artistsaz/p/AniD_profile.htm |archive-date=October 19, 2013 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westnet.com/consumable/1997/06.11/revani.html |title=Ani DiFranco, Living in Clip by Jon Steltenpohl |publisher=Westnet.com |accessdate=December 4, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211034955/http://www.westnet.com/consumable/1997/06.11/revani.html |archivedate=December 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; rapid [[fingerpicking]] and many alternate tunings. She delivers many of her lines in a speaking style notable for its rhythmic variation. Her lyrics, which often include [[alliteration]], [[metaphor]], [[word play]] and a more or less gentle [[irony]], have also received praise for their sophistication.{{fact|date=July 2019}}

Although DiFranco's music has been classified as both [[folk rock]] and [[alternative rock]], she has reached across genres since her earliest albums incorporating first punk, then funk, hiphop, and jazz influences.

While primarily an acoustic guitarist she has used a variety of [[musical instrument|instruments]] and styles: [[brass instrument]]ation was prevalent in 1998's ''[[Little Plastic Castle]]''; a simple [[walking bass]] in her 1997 cover of [[Hal David]] and [[Burt Bacharach]]'s &quot;[[Wishin' and Hopin']]&amp;thinsp;&quot;; [[string instrument|strings]] on the 1997 live album ''[[Living in Clip]]'' and 2004's ''[[Knuckle Down]]''; and electronics and synthesizers in 1999's ''To the Teeth'' and 2006's ''[[Reprieve (album)|Reprieve]]''.

DiFranco has stated that &quot;folk music is not an acoustic guitar&amp;nbsp;– that's not where the heart of it is. I use the word 'folk' in reference to [[Punk rock|punk music]] and [[Hip hop music|rap music]]. It's an attitude, it's an awareness of one's heritage, and it's a community. It's subcorporate music that gives voice to different communities and their struggle against authority.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeffreypepperrodgers.com/difranco.htm |title=Ani DiFranco and Utah Phillips article |publisher=Jeffreypepperrodgers.com |accessdate=2014-04-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140130090622/http://jeffreypepperrodgers.com/difranco.htm |archivedate=January 30, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical collaborations, cover versions, and samples===
DiFranco has collaborated with a wide range of artists. In 1997 she appeared on Canadian songwriter [[Bruce Cockburn]]'s ''Charity of Night'' album. In 1998 she produced fellow folksinger [[Dan Bern]]'s album ''[[Fifty Eggs]]''.

She developed a deep association with folksinger and social activist [[Utah Phillips]] throughout the mid-1990s, sharing her stage and her audience with the older musician until his death in 2008 and resulting in two collaborative albums: ''[[The Past Didn't Go Anywhere]]'' (1996) and ''[[Fellow Workers]]'' (1999, with liner notes by [[Howard Zinn]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zinn|title=Fellow Workers Liner Notes|url=http://zinnedproject.org/materials/fellow-workers-liner-notes-by-howard-zinn/|publisher=Zinn Education Project|accessdate=July 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Past'' is built around Phillips's storytelling, an important part of his art that had not previously been documented on recordings; on the album, DiFranco provides musical settings for his speaking voice.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The followup, ''Fellow Workers'', was recorded live in [[Daniel Lanois]]'s Kingsway Studio in New Orleans and features Phillips fronting DiFranco's touring band for a collection of songs and stories.

[[Prince (musician)|Prince]] recorded two songs with DiFranco in 1999, &quot;Providence&quot; on her ''To the Teeth'' album, and &quot;Eye Love U, But Eye Don't Trust U Anymore&quot; on Prince's ''[[Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic]]'' album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://princetext.tripod.com/i_startrib99.html |title=Prince in Print |publisher=Princetext.tripod.com |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funk and soul jazz musician [[Maceo Parker]] and rapper Corey Parker have both appeared on DiFranco's albums&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To The Teeth, album|url=http://www.righteousbabe.com/products/to-the-teeth|publisher=Righteous Babe Web Site|accessdate=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and featured appearances by her on theirs. Parker and Di Franco toured together in 1999.

She has appeared on several compilations of the songs of [[Pete Seeger]] and frequented his [[Clearwater Festival|Hudson Clearwater Revival Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toshi Reagon and Ani DiFranco|url=http://vimeo.com/64338104|work=Vimeo, video gallery|publisher=Hudson River Sloop Clearwater|accessdate=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 she appeared on Brazilian artist [[Lenine (musician)|Lenine]]'s album ''Falange Canibal''. In 2002 her rendition of [[Greg Brown (folk musician)|Greg Brown]]'s &quot;The Poet Game&quot; appeared on ''Going Driftless: An Artist's Tribute to Greg Brown''. Also in 2002 she recorded a duet with [[Jackie Chan]] of the [[Irving Gordon]] song &quot;[[Unforgettable (Irving Gordon song)|Unforgettable]]&quot; for a record of unlikely collaborations, ''When Pigs Fly: Songs You Never Thought You'd Hear''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ani DiFranco &amp; Jackie Chan – &quot;Unforgettable&quot; (Nat King Cole Cover)|url=http://quitmumbling.com/2011/04/uncovered-ani-difranco-jackie-chan-unforgettable-nat-king-cole/|publisher=Quit Mumbling|accessdate=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 she appeared on [[Dar Williams]]' record ''My Better Self'', dueting on William's cover of [[Pink Floyd]]'s &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;. She performed with [[Cyndi Lauper]] on &quot;Sisters of Avalon&quot; a track from Lauper's 2005 ''[[The Body Acoustic]]'' album. In 2006 she produced [[Hamell on Trial]]'s album ''Songs for Parents Who Enjoy Drugs''. In 2008 she appeared on [[Todd Sickafoose]]'s album ''Tiny Resisters''. In 2010 she co-produced a track with [[Margaret Cho]] called &quot;Captain Cameltoe&quot; for the comedian's ''Cho Dependant'' album. In 2011 she appeared on [[Rob Wasserman]]'s album ''Note of Hope'', an exploration of the writings of [[Woody Guthrie]] with musical accompaniment, though the track in which she appeared, &quot;Voice&quot;, was actually recorded 13 years earlier. Also in 2011 she duetted with [[Greg Dulli]] on the [[Twilight Singers]] record ''Dynamite Steps''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ani DiFranco credits|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ani-difranco-mn0000046794/credits|publisher=All Music Guide|accessdate=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artists have covered and sampled DiFranco's work throughout the years. Her spoken word poem &quot;Self Evident&quot; was covered by [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] founder [[Chuck D]]'s group called Impossebulls. [[Alana Davis]] had some commercial success with DiFranco's song &quot;[[32 Flavors]]&quot;.

Samples from the track &quot;Coming Up&quot; were used by [[DJ Spooky]] in his album ''Live Without Dead Time'', produced for [[AdBusters]] Magazine in 2003.

In 2010, DiFranco played [[Persephone]] on [[Anaïs Mitchell]]'s album [[Hadestown (album)|Hadestown]].

===Lyrical content===
Although much of DiFranco's material is autobiographical, it is often also strongly political. Many of her songs are concerned with contemporary social issues such as [[racism]], [[sexism]], [[sexual abuse]], [[homophobia]], [[reproductive rights]], poverty, and war. In 2008, she donated a song to [[Aid Still Required]]'s CD to assist with the restoration of the devastation done to Southeast Asia from the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 tsunami]].
The combination of personal and political is partially responsible for DiFranco's early popularity among politically active college students, particularly those of the left wing, some of whom set up fan pages on the [[World Wide Web|web]] to document DiFranco's career as early as 1994. DiFranco's rapid rise in popularity in the mid-1990s was fueled mostly by personal contact and word of mouth rather than [[mainstream media]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

===Label independence===
Ani cites her anti-corporate ethos for the main reason she decided to start her own label. This has allowed her a considerable degree of creative freedom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burlingham|first=Bo|title=Don't call Her an Entrepreneur|url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/20040901/difranco.html|publisher=INC. Magazine|accessdate=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; over the years, including, for example, providing all instrumentals and vocals and recording the album herself at her home on an analog 8-track [[reel to reel]], and handling much of the artwork and packaging design for her 2004 album ''[[Educated Guess]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.righteousbabe.com/ani/educated_guess/more_info.asp]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716183146/http://www.righteousbabe.com/ani/educated_guess/more_info.asp|date=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has referenced this independence from major labels in song more than once, including &quot;The Million You Never Made&quot; (''[[Not a Pretty Girl]]''), which discusses the act of turning down a lucrative contract, &quot;The Next Big Thing&quot; (''[[Not So Soft]]''), which describes an imagined meeting with a label head-hunter who evaluates the singer based on her looks, and &quot;Napoleon&quot; (''[[Dilate (Ani DiFranco album)|Dilate]]''), which sympathizes sarcastically with an unnamed friend who did sign with a label.

The business grew organically starting in 1990 with the first cassette tape. Connections were made when women in colleges started duplicating and sharing tapes. Offers to play at colleges started coming in and her popularity grew largely by word of mouth and through women's groups or organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Keast |first=James |url=http://exclaim.ca/Features/Timeline/ani_difranco-lil_folksinger_that_could |title=Ani DiFranco – The L'il Folksinger That Could • Timeline • |work=Exclaim! |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zango and Goldenrod, two music distributors specializing in women's music, started carrying DiFranco's music. In general they sold music to independent music stores and women's book stores. In 1995 Righteous Babe Records signed with [[Koch International]] for DiFranco's release of ''Not a Pretty Girl''. Her records could then be found in large and small record stores alike.

DiFranco has occasionally joined with [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] in discussing publicly the problems associated with major record companies. Righteous Babe Records employs a number of people in her hometown of Buffalo. In a 1997 open letter to ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/~marg/ani/letter.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114013744/http://www.columbia.edu/~marg/ani/letter.html|date=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; she expressed displeasure that what she considers a way to ensure her own artistic freedom was seen by others solely in terms of its financial success.

==Activism==
From the earliest days of her career, Ani DiFranco has lent her voice and her name to a broad range of social movements, performing benefit concerts, appearing on benefit albums, speaking at rallies, and offering info table space to organizations at her concerts and the virtual equivalent on her website, among other methods and actions. In 1999 she created her own not-for-profit organization; as the Buffalo News has reported, &quot;Through the Righteous Babe Foundation, DiFranco has backed various grassroots cultural and political organizations, supporting causes ranging from abortion rights to gay visibility.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=HEAREY|first=OWEN|title='Righteous Babe' announces she is pregnant DiFranco honored at NOW convention|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060722/CITYANDREGION/307229989|accessdate=July 30, 2013|newspaper=Buffalo News|date=July 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first Gulf War, DiFranco participated in the anti-war movement. In early 1993 she played Pete Seeger's Clearwater Folk Festival for the first time. In 1998 she was a featured performer in the Dead Man Walking benefit concert series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vedder, Tom Waits, Ani DiFranco Set For &quot;Dead Man&quot; Benefit|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428080/vedder-tom-waits-ani-difranco-set-dead-man-benefit.jhtml|publisher=MTV|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; raising money for Sister [[Helen Prejean]]'s &quot;Not in Our Name&quot; anti-death penalty organization. DiFranco's commitment to opposing the death penalty is longstanding; she has also been a long time supporter of the [[Southern Center for Human Rights]].

During the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. presidential election]], she actively supported and voted for [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] candidate [[Ralph Nader]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hackwriters.com/difranco04.htm |title=Ani DiFranco in Bloom - James Campion interviews the folk diva |publisher=hackwriters.com |accessdate=2014-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5925399/eddie_vedder_patti_smith_go_green_at_nyc_nader_rally/print |title=Music News: Latest and Breaking Music News |magazine=Rolling Stone |accessdate=2014-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/politics/feature/2000/11/06/letters/index1.html |title=The Nader letters |work=Salon |date=2000-11-06 |accessdate=2014-04-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607011642/http://dir.salon.com/story/politics/feature/2000/11/06/letters/index1.html |archivedate=June 7, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; though in an open letter she made clear that if she lived in a [[swing state]], she would vote for [[Al Gore]] to prevent [[George W. Bush]] from being elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2000/11/06/letters_7/|title=The Nader letters|last=Salon Staff|work=Salon|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 DiFranco visited Burma in order to learn about the Burmese resistance movement and the country's fight for democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=alzner|first=susan|title=documentary photography|url=http://www.susanalzner.com/gallery.html?folio=Documentary&amp;gallery=Burma%20and%20Thailand%20with%20Ani%20DiFranco%20and%20Damien%20Rice|publisher=susan alzner photography|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her travels she met with then-detained resistance leader [[Aung San Suu Kyi]]. Her song &quot;In The Way&quot; was later featured on ''[[For the Lady]]'', a benefit CD that donated all proceeds to the [[United States Campaign for Burma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=saks|first=carla|title=press release|url=http://uscampaignforburma.org/news/press-releases/22-archived-press-releases/2474-for-the-lady-bene-t-album-to-be-released-october-26th-on-rhino-records.html|publisher=US Campaign for Burma|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2004 presidential primaries, she supported liberal, anti-war Democrat [[Dennis Kucinich]]. Congressman Kucinich appeared on stage with her at several concerts and she spoke positively about him from the stage at many more of her concerts.  After the primary season ended, and [[John Kerry]] was the clear Democratic candidate, DiFranco launched a &quot;Vote Dammit!&quot; tour of swing states encouraging audience members to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buchel|first=John|title=Ani DiFranco challenges fans to vote|url=http://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2004/09/17/ani_difranco_challen.php|accessdate=July 30, 2013|newspaper=The Badger Herald|date=September 17, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 she lobbied Congress against the proliferation of nuclear power in general and the placement of nuclear waste dumps on Indian land in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mariotte |first=Michael |title=JULY 25: Senate Call-in Day!

In 2002 Righteous Babe Records established the &quot;Aiding Buffalo's Children&quot; program in conjunction with members of the local community to raise funds for Buffalo's public school system. To kick off the program, DiFranco donated &quot;a day's pay&quot;—the performance fee from her concert that year at Shea's Performing Arts Center— to ABC and challenged her fans to do the same. Aiding Buffalo's Children has since been folded into the Community Foundation of Greater Buffalo, contributing to a variety of charitable funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shultz|first=Erin|title=Music and Her Message: DiFranco at Shea's|url=http://www.ubspectrum.com/arts/music-and-her-message-difranco-at-shea-s-1.1393961|accessdate=July 30, 2013|newspaper=The Spectrum|date=April 10, 2002|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212090049/http://www.ubspectrum.com/arts/music-and-her-message-difranco-at-shea-s-1.1393961#.UfghPdLVCSo|archivedate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 when Hurricane Katrina devastated DiFranco's newly adopted home town of New Orleans she collected donations from fans around the world through The Righteous Babe Store website for the Katrina Piano Fund,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pinsonneault|first=Julie|title=Bearing Witness &quot;New Orleans favorite Ani DiFranco endured 9/11 while in New York City and Hurricane Katrina while in New Orleans.|url=http://www.bestofneworleans.com/gambit/bearing-witness/Content?oid=1245650|accessdate=July 30, 2013|newspaper=Gambit|date=April 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; helping musicians replace instruments lost in the hurricane, raising over $47,500 for the cause.

In 2010, after the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]], she performed at the &quot;For Our Coast&quot; benefit concert joining [[Marianne Faithfull]], [[C.&amp;nbsp;C. Adcock]] and others at the Acadiana Center for the Arts Theater in Lafayette, raising money for Gulf Aid Acadiana, and the Gulf Aid show with [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Mos Def]], and others at Mardi Gras World River City in New Orleans, both shows raising money to help protect the wetlands, clean up the coast and to assist the fishermen and their families affected by the spill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|title=Lenny Kravitz Headlining Gulf Aid To Benefit Oil Spill Recovery|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1638853/lenny-kravitz-headlining-concert-benefit-gulf-coast.jhtml|publisher=MTV|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization provides free [[marching band]] instruction to children in the New Orleans area in addition to academic tutoring and mentoring.

DiFranco joined about 500,000 people at the March for Women's Lives in DC in April 2004. As an honored guest she marched in the front row for the three-mile route, along with [[Margaret Cho]], [[Janeane Garofalo]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Gloria Steinem]] and others. Later in the day, Ani played a few songs on the main stage in front of the Capitol, including &quot;Your Next Bold Move&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=March for Wemons lives photos|url=http://righteousbabe.myshopify.com/products/ani-marches-and-sings-in-washington-d-c|publisher=righteousbabe.com|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scot Fisher, Righteous Babe label president and DiFranco's longtime manager, has been a longtime advocate of the preservation movement in Buffalo. In 1999 he and DiFranco purchased a decaying church on the verge of demolition in downtown Buffalo and began the lengthy process of restoring it. In 2006 the building opened its doors again, first briefly as &quot;The Church&quot; and then as &quot;Babeville,&quot; housing two concert venues, the record label's business office, and Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Conaway|first=James|title=An exchange with Ani DiFranco|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/magazine/2004/november-december/an-exchange-with-ani-difranco.html|work=Preservation|publisher=preservationnation.org|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DiFranco is also a member of the Toronto-based charity Artists Against Racism for which she participated in a radio PSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artistsagainstracism.org/radio-2/|title=Radio - Artists Against Racism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 29, 2013, DiFranco issued an apology, announcing that she was cancelling the retreat, stating that
{{quote|{{notatypo|i}} am not unaware of the mechanism of white privilege or the fact that {{notatypo|i}} need to listen more than talk when it comes to issues of race. {{notatypo|if}} {{notatypo|nottoway}} is simply not an acceptable place for me to go and try to do my work in the eyes of many, then let me just concede before more divisive words are spilled.&amp;nbsp;...

{{notatypo|i}} think many positive and life-affirming connections would have been made at this conference, in all of its complexity of design. {{notatypo|i}} do not wish to reinvent the righteous retreat at this point to eliminate the stay at the Nottoway Plantation.

{{notatypo|at}} this point I wish only to cancel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.righteousbabe.com/blogs/news/11177617-righteous-retreat-cancelled |title=Righteous Retreat Cancelled |publisher=righteousbabe |date=2013-11-18 |accessdate=2014-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230232933/http://www.righteousbabe.com/blogs/news/11177617-righteous-retreat-cancelled |archive-date=December 30, 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The singer's statements were called &quot;remarkably unapologetic&quot; on ''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;huffingtonpost.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jezebel.com&quot;/&gt; and &quot;a variety of excuses and justifications&quot; by ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebony.com&quot;/&gt; Additionally, a piece at ''[[The Guardian]]'' said the announcement made &quot;much of the idea that this was all a mistake, with no indication of remorse.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian.com&quot;/&gt;

DiFranco issued a second statement and apology on January 2, 2014, following continued criticism.  In it, she wrote &quot;...&amp;nbsp;{{notatypo|i}} would like to say {{notatypo|i}} am sincerely sorry. {{notatypo|it}} is obvious to me now that you were right&amp;nbsp;– all those who said we can't in good conscience go to that place and support it or look past for one moment what it deeply represents. {{notatypo|i}} needed a wake up call and you gave it to me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.righteousbabe.com/blogs/news/11257877-from-ani |title=from Ani |publisher=righteousbabe |date=2013-11-18 |accessdate=2014-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102194345/http://www.righteousbabe.com/blogs/news/11257877-from-ani |archive-date=January 2, 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
