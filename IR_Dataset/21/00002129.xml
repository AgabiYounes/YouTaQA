The '''Arizona Diamondbacks''', often shortened as the '''D-backs''', are an American [[professional baseball]] team based in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. They compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member of the [[National League]] (NL) [[National League West|West division]]. The team plays its home games at [[Chase Field]], formerly known as ''Bank One Ballpark''. The Diamondbacks have won one [[World Series]] championship (defeating the [[New York Yankees]] in [[2001 World Series|2001]]) – becoming the fastest [[expansion team]] in Major League history to win a championship, which it did in only the fourth season since [[1998 Major League Baseball expansion|the franchise's inception]].

==Franchise history==
{{Main article|History of the Arizona Diamondbacks}}
{{See also|1998 Major League Baseball expansion}}

On March 9, 1995, Phoenix was awarded an expansion franchise to begin play for the {{mlby|1998}} season. A $130 million franchise fee was paid to Major League Baseball and on January 16, 1997, the Diamondbacks were officially voted into the National League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baseball Expansion Teams Put in Leagues|date=January 17, 1997|newspaper=Southeastern Missourian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Diamondbacks' first major league game was played against the [[Colorado Rockies]] on March 31, [[1998 Arizona Diamondbacks season|1998]], at Bank One Ballpark. The [[Baseball park|ballpark]] was renamed Chase Field in 2005, as a result of [[Bank One Corporation]]'s merger with [[JPMorgan Chase|JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.]]

Since their debut, the Diamondbacks have won five NL West division titles, one NL pennant, one Wild Card game, and the [[2001 World Series]].

==Logos==
The Diamondbacks' original colors were [[purple]], [[black]], [[teal (color)|teal]] and [[copper (color)|copper]].&lt;ref name=&quot;purplesedonared&quot;&gt;{{cite press release|title=D-backs shed their skin after unveiling new uniforms, colors on runway|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/content/printer_friendly/ari/y2006/m11/d08/c1737471.jsp|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=Dbacks.com|date=November 8, 2006|access-date=July 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190711034345/http://mlb.mlb.com/content/printer_friendly/ari/y2006/m11/d08/c1737471.jsp|archive-date=July 11, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first logo was an italicized block letter &quot;A&quot; with a diamond pattern, and the crossbar represented by a snake's tongue. Prior to their inaugural season, they released their baseball caps. The home cap had a cream color crown with a purple visor and button. The road cap was black and had a turquoise visor and button. Their alternate cap had a turquoise crown with a purple visor and button. Depending on the cap, the &quot;A&quot; logo on the front of the cap had different color variations.

In the Diamondbacks' second season, they introduced a new logo which was a copper color snake in the shape of a letter &quot;D&quot;. It was used on a solid black cap, which in the beginning, was worn as a road cap.

The franchise unveiled new uniforms and colors of Sedona red, Sonoran sand and black on November 8, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilbert|first=Steve|title=D-backs unveil new colors, new look|url=http://m.dbacks.mlb.com/news/article/1737540/|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=Dbacks.com|date=November 8, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221160830/http://m.dbacks.mlb.com/news/article/1737540/|archive-date=February 21, 2015|access-date=July 11, 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[red]] shade is named for the [[sandstone]] [[canyon]] at [[Red Rock State Park]] near [[Sedona, Arizona|Sedona]], while the [[beige]] (sand) shade is named for the [[Sonoran Desert]].&lt;ref name=&quot;purplesedonared&quot;/&gt; A sleeve patch was added featuring a lowercase &quot;d&quot; and &quot;b&quot; configured to look like a snake's head.&lt;ref name=&quot;purplesedonared&quot;/&gt; The team also kept the &quot;D&quot; logo, but was slightly altered and put on an all red cap to be used as their game cap. They also kept the &quot;A&quot; logo with the new colors applied to it, with a solid black cap used as the alternate cap. A similar color scheme is currently used by the [[Arizona Coyotes]] of the [[National Hockey League]].

Prior to the 2016 season, the Diamondbacks reincorporated teal into its color scheme while keeping Sedona Red, Sonoran Sand and black. They also unveiled eight different uniform combinations, including two separate home white and away grey uniforms. One major difference between the two sets is that the non-teal uniforms feature a snakeskin pattern on the shoulders, while the teal-trimmed uniforms include a charcoal/grey snakeskin pattern on the back. Arizona also kept the throwback pinstriped sleeveless uniforms from their 2001 championship season for use during Thursday home games.&lt;ref name=&quot;DbacksUnis2016&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilbert|first=Steve|title=D-backs wow with cutting-edge new uniforms|url=https://www.mlb.com/dbacks/news/arizona-diamondbacks-unveil-new-uniforms/c-158802040|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|website=Dbacks.com|date=December 3, 2015|access-date=July 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190711032508/https://www.mlb.com/dbacks/news/arizona-diamondbacks-unveil-new-uniforms/c-158802040|archive-date=July 11, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Uniforms|url=https://www.mlb.com/dbacks/history/uniforms/2016|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=Dbacks.com|date=December 3, 2015|access-date=July 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190711034347/https://www.mlb.com/dbacks/history/uniforms/2016|archive-date=July 11, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Axisa|first=Mike|title=LOOK: Diamondbacks unveil seven new uniforms for 2016|url=https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/look-diamondbacks-unveil-seven-new-uniforms-for-2016/|publisher=CBSSports.com|date=December 4, 2015|accessdate=September 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909142925/https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/look-diamondbacks-unveil-seven-new-uniforms-for-2016/|archive-date=September 9, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with the 2020 season, the Diamondbacks made slight redesigns to their current uniforms. The snakeskin patterns were removed while the teal-trimmed grey uniforms were retired. The team also reverted to a standard grey uniform after wearing a darker shade on the previous set. Two home white uniforms remain in use: the primary Sedona Red and the alternate teal. They would also wear two black uniforms: one with the primary &quot;A&quot; logo on the left chest and the other with &quot;Los D-Backs&quot; trimmed in teal. Three cap designs were also unveiled: the primary &quot;A&quot; cap, the teal-trimmed &quot;snake&quot; cap (paired exclusively on the teal alternates), and the sand-trimmed &quot;snake&quot; cap (paired exclusively on the Sedona Red alternates). The [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] swoosh logo is also placed on the right chest near the shoulder.&lt;ref name=&quot;GilbertDbacks&quot; /&gt;

==Radio and television==
The primary television play-by-play voice for the team's first nine seasons of play was [[Thom Brennaman]], who also broadcasts baseball and [[college football]] games nationally for [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox Television]]. Brennaman was the TV announcer for the [[Chicago Cubs]] and [[Cincinnati Reds]] (along with his father [[Marty Brennaman]]) before being hired by Diamondbacks founder Jerry Colangelo in 1996, two years before the team would begin play.

In October 2006, Brennaman left the Diamondbacks to call games with his father for the Reds beginning in 2007, signing a four-year deal (his FOX duties remained unchanged).

The English language flagship radio station is [[KTAR (AM)|KTAR]]. [[Greg Schulte]] is the regular radio play-by-play voice, a 25-year veteran of sports radio in the Phoenix market, also well known for his previous work on [[Phoenix Suns]], [[Arizona Cardinals]] and [[Arizona State University]] (ASU) broadcasts.

[[Jeff Munn]] is a backup radio play-by-play announcer; he served as the regular public address announcer at [[Chase Field]] in the early days of the franchise. He is well known to many Phoenix area sports fans, having also served as the public address announcer for the Suns at America West Arena (now [[Talking Stick Resort Arena]]) in the 1990s. He is also the play-by-play radio voice for ASU women's basketball.

On November 1, 2006, the team announced that the TV voice of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] since 2002, [[Daron Sutton]], would be hired as the Diamondbacks primary TV play-by-play voice. Sutton was signed to a five-year contract with a team option for three more years. Sutton is considered one of the best of the younger generation of baseball broadcasters. His signature chants include &quot;let's get some runs&quot; when the D-backs trail in late innings. Sutton's father is [[Major League Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] pitcher and current [[Atlanta Braves]] broadcaster [[Don Sutton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mlb3&quot;&gt;{{cite press release|title=Sutton to broadcast Diamondbacks games on D-backs TV network, FOX Sports Net Arizona through 2011|url=http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20061101&amp;content_id=1729190&amp;vkey=pr_ari&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=ari|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=Dbacks.com|date=November 1, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015234953/http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20061101&amp;content_id=1729190&amp;vkey=pr_ari&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=ari|archive-date=October 15, 2007|access-date=July 11, 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Diamondbacks and Chicago Cubs first baseman [[Mark Grace]] and former Major League [[knuckleball]] pitcher [[Tom Candiotti]] were the Diamondbacks primary color analysts for the 2006 and 2007 seasons. Former Diamondbacks third baseman [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]] also did color commentary on occasion, as did former [[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]] and [[NBC]] broadcast legend [[Joe Garagiola, Sr.]], a longtime Phoenix-area resident and father of [[Joe Garagiola, Jr.]], the first GM of the Diamondbacks (as head of the Maricopa County Sports Authority in the early 1990s, Garagiola, Jr. was one of the primary people involved in Phoenix obtaining a Major League Baseball franchise).

The Diamondbacks announced in July 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=FSN Arizona to become exclusive TV home for the D-backs starting next season|url=http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/content/printer_friendly/ari/y2007/m07/d13/c2084028.jsp|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=Dbacks.com|date=July 13, 2007|access-date=July 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322095205/http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/content/printer_friendly/ari/y2007/m07/d13/c2084028.jsp|archive-date=March 22, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; that for the 2008 season, all regionally broadcast Diamondbacks TV games will be shown exclusively on [[Fox Sports Arizona]], and a few could possibly be shown on the national [[Fox Major League Baseball|Fox MLB]] telecasts. Fox Sports Arizona (or FS Arizona) is currently seen in 2.8&amp;nbsp;million households in Arizona and New Mexico. The previous flagship station, since the inaugural 1998 season, was [[KTVK]], a popular over-the-air independent station (and former longtime [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate) in Phoenix.

From 2009 to 2012, Mark Grace and Daron Sutton were tagged as the main broadcasters of the Diamondbacks with pre-game and postgame shows on Fox Sports Arizona, being hosted by former big-league closer [[Joe Borowski (baseball)|Joe Borowski]].

On June 21, 2012, Daron Sutton was suspended indefinitely, amid rumors of insubordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Piecoro|first=Nick|title=Arizona Diamondbacks SS Stephen Drew's ankle holds up|url=http://archive.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/20120627arizona-diamondbacks-ss-stephen-drews-ankle-holds-up.html|newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=June 27, 2012|accessdate=November 9, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208165857/http://archive.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/20120627arizona-diamondbacks-ss-stephen-drews-ankle-holds-up.html|archive-date=December 8, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then on August 24, the team announced that Mark Grace had requested an indefinite leave of absence after being arrested for his second DUI in less than two years &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boivin|first=Paola|title=Arizona Diamondbacks hit hard again in the public eye|url=http://archive.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/articles/20120824arizona-diamondbacks-hit-hard-again-public-eye.html|newspaper=The Arizona Republic|date=August 24, 2012|accessdate=November 9, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208144030/http://archive.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/articles/20120824arizona-diamondbacks-hit-hard-again-public-eye.html|archive-date=December 8, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Grace was later indicted on four DUI counts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Merrill|first=Laurie|title=Mark Grace indicted on 4 DUI counts|url=http://www.azcentral.com/community/scottsdale/articles/20121025mark-grace-indicted-dui-counts.html|newspaper=The Arizona Republic|accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;). For the remainder of the 2012 season, Sutton was replaced by Greg Schulte (Jeff Munn replaced Schulte on the radio broadcast) and Grace was replaced by Luis Gonzalez. At the end of the 2012 season, the team announced that neither Sutton nor Grace would be returning for the 2013 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Piecoro|first=Nick|title=Diamondbacks announce Mark Grace and Daron Sutton will not return to the broadcast booth|url=http://archive.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/articles/20121004arizona-diamondbacks-daron-sutton-mark-grace.html|newspaper=The Arizona Republic|date=October 4, 2012|accessdate=December 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304083432/http://archive.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/articles/20121004arizona-diamondbacks-daron-sutton-mark-grace.html|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 18, 2012, the team announced that [[Bob Brenly]] would be returning as a broadcaster to replace Grace, and that he would be joined by then-[[ESPN]] personality [[Steve Berthiaume]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Piecoro|first=Nick|title=Arizona Diamondbacks name Steve Berthiaume, Bob Brenly as TV announcing team|url=http://archive.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/articles/20121018arizona-diamondbacks-announcers-bob-brenly-steve-berthiaume.html|newspaper=The Arizona Republic|date=October 18, 2012|accessdate=November 9, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005002119/http://archive.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/articles/20121018arizona-diamondbacks-announcers-bob-brenly-steve-berthiaume.html|archive-date=October 5, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish broadcasts===
The flagship Spanish language radio station is [[KHOV-FM]] 105.1 with Oscar Soria, Rodrigo Lopez, and Richard Saenz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Broadcasters|url=https://www.mlb.com/dbacks/team/broadcasters|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=Dbacks.com|language=en|access-date=July 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190708172035/https://www.mlb.com/dbacks/team/broadcasters|archive-date=July 8, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Games were televised in Spanish on [[KPHE-LD|KPHE-LP]]—with Oscar Soria and Jerry Romo as the announcers—but this arrangement ended prior to the 2009 season due to the team switching fully to [[Fox Sports Arizona]] and the lack of carriage of KHPE-LP on the Cox cable system.&lt;ref name=&quot;azc1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Piecoro|first=Nick|title=No Spanish TV broadcasts for D-Backs|url=http://archive.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/articles/2009/01/22/20090122spt-dbackstv.html|newspaper=The Arizona Republic|date=January 22, 2009|accessdate=December 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065628/http://archive.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/articles/2009/01/22/20090122spt-dbackstv.html|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
