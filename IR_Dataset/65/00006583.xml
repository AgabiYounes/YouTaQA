'''Chinese cuisine''' is an important part of [[Chinese culture]], which includes cuisine originating from the diverse regions of [[China]], as well as from Chinese people in other parts of the world. Because of the [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese diaspora]] and historical power of the country, Chinese cuisine has influenced many other cuisines in [[Asia]], with modifications made to cater to local palates. Chinese food staples such as [[rice]], [[soy sauce]], [[noodles]], [[tea]], and [[tofu]], and utensils such as [[chopsticks]] and the [[wok]], can now be found worldwide.

The preference for [[seasoning]] and [[Chinese cooking techniques|cooking techniques]] of Chinese provinces depend on differences in [[history of Chinese cuisine|historical background]] and [[List of ethnic groups in China|ethnic groups]]. Geographic features including mountains, rivers, forests and deserts also have a strong effect on the local available ingredients, considering that the climate of China varies from [[Tropical savanna climate|tropical]] in the south to [[Subarctic climate|subarctic]] in the northeast. [[Chinese aristocrat cuisine|Imperial, royal and noble preference]] also plays a role in the change of Chinese cuisines. Because of imperial expansion and trading, ingredients and cooking techniques from other cultures are integrated into Chinese cuisines over time.

The most praised &quot;Four Major Cuisines&quot; are [[Sichuan cuisine|Chuan]], [[Shandong cuisine|Lu]], [[Cantonese cuisine|Yue]] and [[Huaiyang cuisine|Huaiyang]], representing West, North, South and East China cuisine correspondingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Four Major Cuisines in China|url=http://www.cits.net/china-travel-guide/four-major-cuisines-in-china.html|website=CITS|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern &quot;Eight Cuisines&quot; of China are [[Anhui cuisine|Anhui]] ({{zh|labels=no|c=徽菜 |p=Huīcài}}), [[Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese]] ({{zh|labels=no|s=粤菜 |p=Yuècài}}), [[Fujian cuisine|Fujian]] ({{zh|labels=no|s=闽菜 |p=Mǐncài}}), [[Hunan cuisine|Hunan]] ({{zh|labels=no|c=湘菜 |p=Xiāngcài}}), [[Jiangsu cuisine|Jiangsu]] ({{zh|labels=no|s=苏菜 |p=Sūcài}}), [[Shandong cuisine|Shandong]] ({{zh|labels=no|s=鲁菜 |p=Lǔcài}}), [[Sichuan cuisine|Sichuan]] ({{zh|labels=no|c=川菜 |p=Chuāncài}}), and [[Zhejiang cuisine|Zhejiang]] ({{zh|labels=no|c=浙菜 |p=Zhècài}}) cuisines.&lt;ref name=&quot;beautyfujian&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130731165745/http://beautyfujian.com/Fujian/Fujian_Cuisine.html &quot;Fujian Cuisine.] [http://beautyfujian.com/ Beautyfujian.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710001538/http://beautyfujian.com/ |date=10 July 2011 }}. Accessed June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Color, smell and taste are the three traditional aspects used to describe Chinese food,&lt;ref&gt;This standard starts from [[Tang dynasty]] in the 6th century by [[Bai Juyi]] from the ''Preface of [[Lychee]] Diagram'': After leaving branch...for four and five days, the color, smell and taste (of lychee) will be gone. ({{zh|labels=no|t=《荔枝圖序》：「若離本枝……四五日外，色、香、味盡去矣」。}}）&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the meaning, appearance and nutrition of the food. Cooking should be appraised with respect to the ingredients used, knifework, cooking time and seasoning.

Chinese society greatly valued [[gastronomy]], and developed an extensive study of the subject based on its [[traditional Chinese medicine|traditional medical beliefs]].  Chinese culture initially centered around the [[Central Plain (China)|North China Plain]]. The first domesticated crops seem to have been the [[foxtail millet|foxtail]] and [[broomcorn millet|broomcorn]] varieties of [[millet]], while [[rice]] was cultivated in the south. By 2000 BC, wheat had arrived from western Asia. These grains were typically served as warm [[noodle]] soups instead of baked into bread as in Europe. Nobles hunted various wild game and consumed [[Lamb and mutton|mutton]], pork and [[Dog meat#Mainland China|dog]] as these animals were domesticated. Grain was stored against famine and flood and meat was preserved with salt, vinegar, curing, and fermenting. The flavor of the meat was enhanced by cooking it in animal fats though this practice was mostly restricted to the wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibiblio.org/chineseculture/contents/food/p-food-c01s01.html|title=The Cultural Heritage of China :: Food &amp; Drink :: Cuisine :: Introduction|last=Wertz|first=Richard R.|website=www.ibiblio.org|access-date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of [[Confucius]] in the [[Warring States period|late Zhou]], gastronomy had become a high art. Confucius discussed the principles of dining: &quot;The rice would never be too white, the meat would never be too finely cut... When it was not cooked right, man would not eat. When it was cooked bad, man would not eat. When the meat was not cut properly, man would not eat. When the food was not prepared with the right sauce, man would not eat. Although there are plenty of meats, they should not be cooked more than staple food. There is no limit for alcohol, before a man gets drunk.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Analects]]'', Book 10 ''Xiang Dang'' (鄉黨), Chapter 6, Verse 8: 食不厭精，膾不厭細。……失飪不食。……割不正，不食。不得其醬，不食。肉雖多，不使勝食氣。惟酒無量，不及亂。&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Qin Shi Huang|Shi Huangdi]]'s [[Qin dynasty]], the empire expanded into the south. By the time of the [[Han dynasty]], the different regions and cuisines of China's people were linked by major [[canal]]s and leading to a greater complexity in the different regional cuisines. Not only is food seen as giving &quot;[[qi]]&quot;, energy, but food is also about maintaining yin and yang.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = China to Chinatown|url = http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/C/bo3536662.html|website = University of Chicago Press|accessdate = 10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy behind it was rooted in the ''[[I Ching]]'' and [[Chinese traditional medicine]]: food was judged for color, aroma, taste, and texture and a good meal was expected to balance the [[Chinese herbology#Four Natures|Four Natures]] ('[[Yin and yang|hot]]', warm, cool, and '[[Yin and yang|cold]]') and the [[Chinese herbology#Five flavors|Five Tastes]] (pungent, sweet, sour, bitter, and salty). [[Salt in Chinese history#Salt in Chinese cuisine|
Salt was used as a preservative]] from early times, but in cooking was added in the form of soy sauce, and not at the table.{{sfnb|Anderson|1988| p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=BAcknxN_S8QC&amp;pg=PA207#v=onepage&amp;q=%22salt%20by%20itself%20was%20never%20used%22&amp;f=false 267]}} The predominance of [[chopsticks]] and spoons as eating utensils also necessitated that most food be prepared in bite-sized pieces or (as with fish) be so tender that it could be easily picked apart.

By the Later Han period (2nd century), writers{{who|date=August 2013}} frequently complained of lazy aristocrats who did nothing but sit around all day eating [[Smoking (cooking)|smoked]] meats and roasts.

During the Han dynasty, the Chinese developed methods of food preservation for military rations during campaigns such as drying meat into [[jerky]] and cooking, roasting, and drying grain.{{sfnb|Anderson|1988| p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=BAcknxN_S8QC&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 52]}}
Chinese legends claim that the roasted, flat bread [[shaobing]] was brought back from the ''[[Western Regions|Xiyu]]'' (the Western Regions, a name for [[Central Asia]]) by the Han dynasty General [[Ban Chao]], and that it was originally known as hubing ({{lang|zh|胡餅}}, lit. &quot;barbarian bread&quot;). The shaobing is believed to be descended from the hubing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fermentations and Food Science, Volume 6|first=H. T.|last=Huang|edition=

During the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] non-Han people like the [[Xianbei]] of [[Northern Wei]] introduced their cuisine to northern China, and these influences continued up to the [[Tang dynasty]], popularizing meat like mutton and dairy products like goat milk, yogurts, and [[Kumis]] among even Han people. It was during the Song dynasty that [[Han Chinese]] developed an aversion to dairy products and abandoned the dairy foods introduced earlier.{{sfnb|Anderson|1988| p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=BAcknxN_S8QC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=yogurt+fish+wei&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ylUrVMKRBMSnyATJjIHQBQ&amp;ved=0CCsQ6wEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q=yogurt%20fish%20wei&amp;f=false 80]}}

The Han Chinese rebel Wang Su who received asylum in the Xianbei Northern Wei after fleeing from Southern Qi, at first could not stand eating dairy products like goat's milk and meat like mutton and had to consume tea and fish instead, but after a few years he was able to eat yogurt and lamb, and the Xianbei Emperor asked him which of the foods of China (Zhongguo) he preferred, fish vs mutton and tea vs yogurt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Culture and Power in the Reconstitution of the Chinese Realm, 200-600|volume=Volume 200 of Harvard East Asian monographs|editor1-first=Scott|editor1-last=Pearce|editor2-first=Audrey G.|editor2-last=Spiro|editor3-first=Patricia Buckley|editor3-last=Ebrey|edition=illustrated|year=2001|publisher=Harvard Univ Asia Center|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PASE4LVLzQ0C&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=yogurt+fish+wei#v=onepage&amp;q=yogurt%20fish%20wei&amp;f=false|page=22|isbn=0674005236|accessdate=24 April 2014| ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=China Between Empires|volume= |first=Mark Edward|last=Lewis|edition= |year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ch04UBWfplQC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=wang+su+yoghurt#v=onepage&amp;q=wang%20su%20yoghurt&amp;f=false|page=126|isbn=978-0674026056|accessdate=24 April 2014| ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fermentations and Food Science, Volume 6|first=H.

The great migration of Chinese people south during the invasions preceding and during the [[Song dynasty]] increased the relative importance of [[northern and southern China|southern Chinese]] staples such as rice and [[congee]]. [[Su Shi|Su Dongpo]] has improved the red braised pork as [[Dongpo pork]].&lt;ref&gt;《東坡續集》卷十：《豬肉頌》：“洗凈鐺，少著水，柴頭罨煙燄不起。待他自熟莫催他，火候足時他自美。黃州好豬肉，價賤如泥土。貴者不肯食，貧者不解煮。早晨起來打兩碗，飽得自家君莫管。”&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties introduced [[Mongolian cuisine|Mongolian]] and [[Manchu cuisine]], warm northern dishes that popularized [[hot pot]] cooking. During the [[Islam during the Yuan dynasty|Yuan dynasty]] many [[Muslim Chinese|Muslim communities]] emerged in China, who practiced a porkless cuisine now preserved by [[Chinese Islamic cuisine|Hui restaurants]] throughout the country.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} [[Yunnan cuisine]] is unique in China for its cheeses like [[Rubing]] and [[Rushan cheese]] made by the [[Bai people]], and its yogurt, the yogurt may have been due to a combination of Mongolian influence during the Yuan dynasty, the Central Asian settlement in Yunnan, and the proximity and influence of India and Tibet on Yunnan.{{sfnb|Anderson|1988| p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=BAcknxN_S8QC&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 91, 178]}}

As part of the last leg of the [[Columbian Exchange]], Spanish and Portuguese traders began introducing foods from the New World to China through the port cities of [[Guangzhou|Canton]] and [[Macau]]. Mexican [[chili pepper]]s became essential ingredients in [[Sichuan cuisine]] and calorically-dense potatoes and corn became staple foods across the northern plains.

During the Qing Dynasty, Chinese gastronomes such as [[Yuan Mei]] focused upon a primary goal of extracting the maximum flavor of each ingredient. As noted in his culinary work the ''[[Suiyuan shidan]]'', however, the fashions of cuisine at the time were quite varied and in some cases were flamboyantly ostentatious,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Things to Avoid 3: Meals for the Ears (戒耳餐)|website=Translating the Suiyuan Shidan|url=https://wayoftheeating.wordpress.com/2014/05/22/things-to-avoid-3-meals-for-the-ears/|accessdate=8 March 2015|date=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially when the display served also a formal ceremonial purpose, as in the case of the [[Manchu Han Imperial Feast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Things to Avoid 12: Cliché (戒落套)|website=Translating the Suiyuan Shidan|url=https://wayoftheeating.wordpress.com/2014/09/05/things-to-avoid-12-cliche/|accessdate=8 March 2015|date=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the pace of life increases in modern China, fast food like [[fried noodles]], [[fried rice]] and ''[[gaifan]]'' (dish over rice) become more and more popular.

==Regional cuisines==
[[File:Cuisines of China.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Map showing major regional cuisines of China]]

{{main|Chinese regional cuisine}}
There are a variety of styles of cooking in China, but Chinese chefs have classified eight regional cuisines according to their distinct tastes and local characteristics. A number of different styles contribute to Chinese cuisine but perhaps the best known and most influential are [[Guangdong cuisine|Cantonese cuisine]], [[Shandong cuisine]], [[Jiangsu cuisine]] (specifically [[Huaiyang cuisine]]) and [[Sichuan cuisine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Yao&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kas.ku.edu/archived-site/chinese_food/regional_cuisine.html &quot;Regions of Chinese food-styles/flavors of cooking.&quot;] [http://www.kas.ku.edu/ University of Kansas], Kansas Asia Scholars. Accessed June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; These styles are distinctive from one another due to factors such as availability of resources, climate, [[Geography of China|geography]], [[History of China|history]], cooking techniques and lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/07/chinas-culinary-diversity-in-one-map/278138/ &quot;China's Culinary Diversity in One Map&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; One style may favour the use of garlic and [[shallot]]s over chili and spices, while another may favour preparing [[seafood]] over other meats and [[fowl]]. [[Jiangsu cuisine]] favours cooking techniques such as [[braising]] and [[stewing]], while [[Sichuan cuisine]] employs [[baking]]. [[Zhejiang cuisine]] focuses more on serving fresh food and is more like Japanese food. [[Fujian cuisine]] is famous for its delicious seafood and soups and the precise use of scintillating spices. [[Hunan cuisine]] is famous for its hot and sour taste. [[Anhui cuisine]] incorporates wild food for an unusual taste and is wilder than Fujian cuisine. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chuankang |first1=Cheng |title=THE CULTURE OF CHINESE DIET:REGIONAL DIFFERENTIATION AND DEVELOPING TRENDS |journal=Acta Geographica Sinica |date=15 May 1994 |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=226–235 |url=http://www.geog.com.cn/EN/Y1994/V61/I3/226 |language=zh |issn=0375-5444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the raw materials and ingredients used, the method of preparation and cultural differences, a variety of foods with different flavors and textures are prepared in different regions of the country. Many traditional regional cuisines rely on basic methods of [[Food preservation|preservation]] such as [[Drying (food)|drying]], [[Salting (food)|salting]], [[pickling]] and [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]].&lt;ref name=Hsieh /&gt;

In addition, the &quot;rice theory&quot; attempts to describe cultural differences between north and south China; in the north, noodles are more consumed due to wheat being widely grown whereas in the south, rice is more preferred as it has historically been more cultivated there.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title= 'Rice theory' explains north-south China cultural differences|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/05/140508141743.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese ancestors successfully planted [[millet]], [[rice]], and other grains about 9,000 and 8,000 years ago. As for [[wheat]], another staple, it took another three or four thousand years. For the first time, grains provided people with a steady supply of food. Because of the lack of food, Chinese people have to adapt to the new eating habits. The meat was scarce at that time, so people cooked with small amounts of meat and rice or noodles. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ma |first1=Guansheng |title=Food, eating behavior, and culture in Chinese society |journal=Journal of Ethnic Foods |date=December 2015 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=195–199 |doi=10.1016/j.jef.2015.11.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rice===
[[Rice]] is a major [[staple food]] for people from rice farming areas in southern China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ma|first=Guansheng|date=December 2015|title=Food, eating behavior, and culture in Chinese society|journal=Journal of Ethnic Foods|volume=2|issue=4|pages=195–199|doi=10.1016/j.jef.2015.11.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steamed rice]], usually [[white rice]], is the most commonly eaten form. People in southern China also like to use rice to make congee as breakfast. Rice is also used to produce [[Beer in China|beer]], [[baijiu]] and [[vinegar]]s.   [[Glutinous rice]] (&quot;sticky rice&quot;) is a variety of rice used in specialty dishes such as lotus leaf rice and glutinous rice balls.

===Wheat===
In wheat-farming areas in [[northern and southern China|Northern China]], people largely rely on [[flour]]-based food, such as [[Chinese noodle|noodles]], ''[[Bing (bread)|bing]]'' (bread), ''[[jiaozi]]'' (a kind of Chinese [[dumpling]]s), and ''[[mantou]]'' (a type of steamed buns).&lt;ref name=Yao&gt;Yao, Zhang. ''China Everyday!''. Page One Pub. 2007. {{ISBN|978-981-245-330-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noodles===
{{main|Chinese noodles}}
[[Chinese noodles]] come dry or fresh in a variety of sizes, shapes and textures and are often served in soups or fried as toppings. Some varieties, such as Shou Mian (寿面, literally noodles of longevity), is an avatar of long life and good health according to Chinese traditions.&lt;ref name=Yao /&gt; Noodles can be served hot or cold with different toppings, with broth, and occasionally dry (as is the case with mi-fen).  Noodles are commonly made with rice flour or wheat flour, but other flours such as [[Soy flour|soybean]] are also used in minor groups.

==Soybean products==
[[File:Tofu - assorted products 01.jpg|thumb|Several kinds of soybean products are sold in a farmer's market in [[Haikou]], China.]]
[[File:Stired-fried_Razor_Clams_with_Black_Beans_and_Pepper.jpg|thumb|Stir-fried [[razor shell]] with ''[[douchi]]'' (fermented black soybeans) in [[Shandong Peninsula|Jiaodong]] style.]]
[[Tofu]] is made of [[soybean]]s and is another popular food product that supplies protein. The production process of tofu varies from region to region, resulting in different kinds of tofu with a wide range of texture and taste.&lt;ref name=Hsieh&gt;J. Li &amp; Y. Hsieh. ''Traditional Chinese Food Technology and Cuisine''. Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition. 2004;13(2): 147–155.&lt;/ref&gt; Other products such as [[soy milk]], [[soy paste]], [[soy oil]], and fermented [[soy sauce]] are also important in Chinese cooking.

There are many kinds of soybean products, including [[tofu skin]], smoked tofu, dried tofu, and fried tofu.

[[Stinky tofu]] is fermented tofu. Like [[blue cheese]] or [[durian]], it has a very distinct, potent and strong smell, and is an acquired taste. Hard stinky tofu is often deep-fried and paired with soy sauce or salty spice. Soft stinky tofu are usually used as a spread on steamed buns.

[[Doufuru]] is another type of fermented tofu that has a salty taste. Doufuru can be pickled together with soy beans, [[red yeast rice]] or chili to create different color and flavor. This is more of a pickled type of tofu and is not as strongly scented as stinky tofu.  Doufuru has the consistency of slightly soft blue cheese, and a taste similar to Japanese [[miso paste]], but less salty. Doufuru can be used as a spread on steamed buns, or paired with [[Congee|rice congee]].

==Vegetables==
Apart from vegetables that can be commonly seen, some unique [[vegetables]] used in Chinese cuisine include [[baby corn]], [[bok choy]], [[snow pea]]s, [[China|Chinese]] [[eggplant]], [[China|Chinese]] [[broccoli]], and straw [[mushroom]]s.  Other vegetables including [[bean sprout]]s, pea vine tips, [[watercress]], [[lotus root]]s, water chestnuts, and [[bamboo shoot]]s are also used in different cuisines of China.

Because of different climate and soil conditions, cultivars of green beans, peas, and mushrooms can be found in rich variety.

A variety of dried or pickled vegetables are also processed, especially in drier or colder regions where fresh vegetables were hard to get out of season.

==Herbs and seasonings==

[[Seasoning]]s such as fresh [[ginger]] root, [[garlic]], [[scallion]], [[cilantro]] and [[sesame]] are widely used in many regional cuisines. [[Sichuan peppercorn]]s, [[star anise]], [[cinnamon]], [[fennel]], [[cloves]] and [[white pepper]]s are also used in different regions.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/real_food/article4262148.ece |title=Top 10 basic ingredients for Chinese cooking. |accessdate=30 May 2010 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530060727/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/real_food/article4262148.ece |archivedate=30 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }} [''The Times''].

To add extra flavors to dishes, many Chinese cuisines also contain dried Chinese mushrooms, dried baby shrimp, dried tangerine peel,&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/02/garden/chinese-restaurants-are-adding-herbs-for-flavor-and-health.html Chinese Restaurants Are Adding Herbs for Flavor and Health] – ''[[The New York Times]]&lt;/ref&gt; and dried Sichuan chillies.

When it comes to [[sauces]], China is home to soy sauce, which is made from fermented soybeans and wheat. A number of sauces are also based on fermented soybeans, including [[hoisin sauce]], ground bean sauce and yellow bean sauce. There are also different sauces preferred by regional cuisines, [[oyster sauce]], [[fish sauce]] and furu (fermented tofu) are also widely used. Vinegar also has a variety with different flavors: clear rice vinegar, [[Zhenjiang Vinegar|Chinkiang black rice vinegar]], Shanxi vinegar, Henghe vinegar etc.

Generally, seasonal fruits serve as the most common form of dessert consumed after dinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lin|first=Kathy|title=Chinese Food Cultural Profile|url=http://ethnomed.org/clinical/nutrition/chinese_food_cultural_profile|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dim sum]] (點心), originally means small portion of food, can refer to dessert, pastries. Later to avoid the disambiguation, tian dian (甜點) and gao dian (糕點) are used to describe desserts and pastries.

Chinese desserts are sweet foods and dishes that are served with tea, usually during the meal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pei-Mei's Chinese Cook Book Volume 2|last=Fu Pei-Mei|publisher=Askmar Publishing|year=2010|isbn=978-1-935842-05-7|location=Menlo Park, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://languageoffood.blogspot.com/2009/10/dessert.html|title=The Language of Food: Dessert|last=Jurafsky|first=Dan|date=6 October 2009|website=The Language of Food|access-date=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or at the end of meals in Chinese cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/chineseculture/contents/food/p-food-c01s01.html|title=Food &amp; Drink: Cuisine|last=Wertz|first=Richard R.|date=2016|website=The Cultural Heritage of China|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides served as a dim sum along with tea, pastries are used for celebration of traditional festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language =Chinese|url=http://s.visitbeijing.com.cn/html/bjtc-15_gd.shtml|title=Daoxiangcun - Introduction of Beijing Local Special Product|publisher=Visit Beijing|accessdate=11 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous one is [[moon cake]], used to celebrate the [[Mid-Autumn Festival]].

A wide variety of [[Chinese desserts]] are available, mainly including steamed and boiled sweet snacks. [[Bing (Chinese flatbread)|Bing]] is an umbrella term for all breads in Chinese, also including pastries and sweets. These are baked wheat flour based confections, with different stuffings including [[red bean paste]], [[jujube]] and various of others. Su (酥) is another kind of pastry made with more amount of oil, making the confection more friable. Chinese candies and sweets, called ''táng'' (糖) &lt;ref name=&quot;kaleidoscope&quot;&gt;[http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/8Kaleidoscope5550.html &quot;Chinese Desserts.&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702152953/http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/8Kaleidoscope5550.html |date=2 July 2011 }} [http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/ Kaleidoscope - Cultural China] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711102415/http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/ |date=11 July 2011 }}. Accessed June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; are usually made with cane sugar, malt sugar, honey, nuts and fruit. [[Kueh|Gao or Guo]] are rice based snacks that are typically steamed&lt;ref name=&quot;kaleidoscope&quot;/&gt; and may be made from glutinous or normal rice.

Another cold dessert is called ''baobing'', which is [[shaved ice]] with sweet syrup.&lt;ref name=&quot;kaleidoscope&quot;/&gt; Chinese jellies are known collectively in the language as ''ices''. Many jelly desserts are traditionally set with agar and are flavored with fruits, though [[gelatin]] based jellies are also common in contemporary desserts.

Chinese dessert soups are typically sweet and served hot.&lt;ref name=&quot;kaleidoscope&quot;/&gt;

There are also western pastries in China, like [[mille-feuille]], [[crème brûlée]] and [[cheesecake]], but they are generally not as popular because the Chinese preference of dessert is mildly sweet and less oily.
[[File:Baozi Chengdu.JPG|thumb|''[[Baozi|Bāozi]]'' are steamed buns containing savory or sweet combinations of meat, vegetables, and mushrooms, traditionally associated with breakfast.]]
Many types of street foods, which vary from region to region, can be eaten as snacks or light dinner. [[Prawn cracker]]s are an often-consumed snack in Southeast China.

===Dairy products===
Chinese in earlier dynasties evidently drank milk and ate dairy products, although not necessarily from cows, but perhaps ''[[koumiss]]'' (fermented mare's milk) or goat's milk.

Many Chinese have until recently avoided milk, partly because pasturage for milk producers in a monsoon rice ecology is not economic,&lt;ref&gt;Jack Goody, ''Cooking, Cuisine, and Class:  A Study in Comparative Sociology'' (Cambridge; New York: Cambridge University Press, 1982), p. 107; Chang, ed., ''Food in Chinese Culture: Anthropological and Historical Perspectives'', 7, 25, 105-06.&lt;/ref&gt; and partly because of the high rate of [[Lactose intolerance#Epidemiology|lactose intolerance among the Chinese population]]. As such the use of dairy products in Chinese cuisine has historically been rare, with regional exceptions such as the &quot;[[double skin milk]]&quot; dessert in Guangdong Province or the Rubing (milk cake) cheese in [[Yunnan]]. Today [[ice cream]] is commonly available and popular throughout China.&lt;ref name=&quot;kaleidoscope&quot;/&gt;

}}

Cold dishes are usually served before the main meal. Besides salad and pickles as appetizers, they can range from jelly, beancurd, noodle salad, cooked meat and sausages, to jellyfish or cold soups.

[[Chinese sausage]]s vary from region to region. The most common sausage is made of pork and pork fat. Flavor is generally salty-sweet in Southern China. In other parts of China, sausages are salted to be preserved. Chinese sausage is prepared in many different ways, including oven-roasting, stir-fry, and steaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parkinson|first=Rhonda|title=How To Cook Chinese Sausage|url=http://chinesefood.about.com/od/cookingfaqs/f/chinese-sausage.htm|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soups==
{{Main|Chinese soup}}
[[File:Tougan shrimp soup.jpg|thumb|''Dōngguā xiārén fěnsī tāng'' (winter melon, shrimp and cellophane noodle soup)]]
{{see also|List of Chinese soups}}
In some part of South China, soups are served between the cold dishes and the main dishes. In other parts of China, soups are served between the main dish and staple foods, before desserts or fruit salad. There are many traditional Chinese soups, such as [[wonton]] soup, herbal chicken soup, [[hot and sour soup]], winter melon soup and so on.

==Drinks==
Tea plays an important role in Chinese dining culture. [[Baijiu]] and [[huangjiu]] as strong alcoholic beverages are preferred by many people as well. Wine is not so popular as other drinks in China that are consumed whilst dining, although they are usually available in the menu.

===Tea===
[[File:Longjing tea 3.jpg|thumb|[[Longjing tea]], also known as Dragon Well tea, is a variety of roasted green tea from [[Hangzhou]], [[Zhejiang]] Province, China, where it is produced mostly by hand and has been renowned for its high quality, earning the [[China Famous Tea]] title.]]
{{Main|Chinese tea}}

As well as with dim sum, many Chinese drink their tea with snacks such as nuts, plums, dried fruit (in particular [[jujube]]), small sweets, melon seeds, and [[Myrica rubra|waxberry]].&lt;ref name=Yao /&gt; China was the earliest country to cultivate and drink tea, which is enjoyed by people from all social classes.&lt;ref name=Hong&gt;Q. Hong &amp; F. Chunjian. ''Origins of Chinese Tea and Wine''. Asiapac Books Pte Ltd. 2005.{{ISBN|9812293698}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tea processing began after the [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] and [[Han Dynasty|Han Dynasties]].&lt;ref name=Hong /&gt;

The different types of Chinese tea include black, white, green, yellow, oolong, and dark tea. Chinese tea is often classified into several different categories according to the species of plant from which it is sourced, the region in which it is grown, and the method of production used. Some of these types are [[green tea]], [[oolong tea]], black tea, scented tea, [[white tea]], and [[compressed tea]]. There are four major [[tea plantation]] regions: [[Jiangbei District, Ningbo|Jiangbei]], [[Jiangnan]], [[Huanan County|Huanan]] and the southwestern region.&lt;ref name=Hong /&gt; Well known types of green tea include [[Longjing tea|Longjing]], [[Huangshan]], [[Mao Feng]], [[Bilochun]], [[Putuofeng Cha]], and [[Liu'an Guapian]].&lt;ref name=Chang&gt;Zonglin Chang Xukui Li. ''Aspect of Chinese Culture''. 2006.{{ISBN|7302126321}}, {{ISBN|978-7-302-12632-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; China is the world's largest exporter of green tea.&lt;ref name=Chang /&gt;

One of the most ubiquitous accessories in modern China, after a wallet or purse and an umbrella, is a double-walled insulated glass thermos with tea leaves in the top behind a strainer.

===Alcoholic beverages===
{{Main|Chinese alcoholic beverages}}
The importance of ''[[baijiu]]'' (&lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; &quot;white liquor&quot;) in China (99.5% of its alcoholic market) makes it the most-consumed alcoholic spirit in the world.&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist''. &quot;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2013/06/daily-chart-9 Daily Chart: High Spirits]&quot;. 17 June 2013. Accessed 9 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It dates back to the introduction of distilling during the [[Song dynasty]];&lt;ref name=Yao/&gt; can be made from wheat, corn, or rice; and is usually around 120 proof (60% ABV). The most ubiquitous brand is the cheap [[Er guo tou]], but [[Mao Tai]] is the premium ''baijiu''. Other popular brands Kang, Lu Zhou Te Qu, and Wu Liang Ye.&lt;ref name=Yao /&gt;

''[[Huangjiu]]'' (&lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; &quot;yellow liquor&quot;) is not distilled and is a strong [[rice wine]] (10–15% ABV).&lt;ref name=Yao /&gt; Popular brands include [[Shaoxing Lao Jiu]], [[Shaoxing Hua Diao]], and [[Te Jia Fan]].&lt;ref name=Yao /&gt;

===Herbal drinks===
{{Main|Chinese herb tea}}
Chinese herb tea, also known as ''medicinal herbal tea'', is a kind of tea made from Chinese medicinal [[herb]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zhong yao cai cha liao shi dian|last=Wulin|first=Ji|last2=紀戊霖|date=2010-02-03|publisher=Yuan hua fa xing chu ban fa xing|isbn=9789866612794|location=Tai bei xian xin dian shi|oclc=815400238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other beverages===
Soy milk, almond milk, walnut milk and coconut milk are also drunk during the meal in different regions. In some parts of China, [[Crataegus|hawthorn]] and [[jujube]] juice are preferred.  A small shot of fruit vinegar is served as an appetizer in [[Shanxi]].

==Chinese cuisines outside China==
[[File:Billyzhajiang1.jpg|thumb|''[[Zhajiangmian|Zhájiàng Miàn]]'' (noodles with bean paste) is a traditional northern Chinese dish. It has spread to South Korea where it is known as ''[[Jajangmyeon]]''.]]
Where there are historical immigrant Chinese populations, the style of food has evolved and been adapted to local tastes and ingredients, and modified by the local cuisine, to greater or lesser extents. This has resulted in a deep Chinese influence on other national cuisines such as [[Cambodian cuisine]], [[Filipino cuisine]], [[Thai cuisine]] and [[Vietnamese cuisine]]. There are also a large number of forms of [[fusion cuisine]], often popular in the country in question. Some, such as [[ramen]] ([[Japanese Chinese cuisine]]) have become popular internationally.

Deep fried meat combined with [[sweet and sour]] sauce as a cooking style receives an enormous preference outside of China. Therefore, many similar international Chinese cuisines are invented based on sweet and sour sauce, including Sweet and sour chicken (Europe and North America), Manchurian chicken (India) or ''[[tangsuyuk]]'' (South Korea). The [[Hawaiian pizza]] was inspired by Chinese sweet and sour flavors.

Apart from the host country, the dishes developed in overseas Chinese cuisines are heavily dependent on the cuisines derived from the origin of the Chinese immigrants. In [[Korean Chinese cuisine]], the dishes derive primarily from [[Shandong cuisine]] while [[Filipino Chinese cuisine]] is strongly influenced by [[Fujian cuisine]]. The large population having Chinese ancestors in the United States operates many restaurants, has developed distinctive dishes (such as [[chop suey]]) based originally on Cantonese cuisine, while those are not popular among Chinese-American people.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Coe, ''Chop Suey: A Cultural History of Chinese Food in the United States'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yong Chen, ''Chop Suey, USA: The Story of Chinese Food in America'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the report released by China's largest on-demand service platform in 2018, there are over 600,000 Chinese restaurants overseas. The report also pointed out that [[hotpot]] is the most popular food in the foreign market. [[Sichuan cuisine]] and some Chinese snacks and fast food followed in second and third place, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2018年年報_美团点评-W(03690)_公告正文 |url=http://data.eastmoney.com/notices/detail/03690/AN201904111318506320,JUU3JUJFJThFJUU1JTlCJUEyJUU3JTgyJUI5JUU4JUFGJTg0LVc=.html |website=data.eastmoney.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dining etiquette==
[[File:Song Dynasty silver chopsticks, cup, and spoon.JPG|thumb|Silverware from the Song dynasty (10th – 13th centuries): Chopsticks, bowl and spoon]]
{{Main|Customs and etiquette in Chinese dining}}

===Greetings===
As a guest at a meal, we should greet the host and other guests after arriving at the banquet. 

===Seating===
The Chinese dining etiquette has that youths should not sit at the table before the elders. If the guest of honor or most senior member is not seated, other people are not allowed to be seated.

===Eating===
Youths should not start eating before the elders start eating. When eating with a bowl, one should not hold it with its bottom part, because it resembles the act of begging. [[Chopsticks]] are the main eating utensils for Chinese food, which can be used to cut and pick up food.&lt;ref name=&quot;chopsticks2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|language =Chinese|url=https://think.sina.cn/shise/doc--ifyarrcf4119650.d.html|title=Why Chinese use chopsticks while Westerners use knives and forks?|publisher=Sina Zhishi|date=2017-02-16|accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; When someone taking a break from eating at the table, they should not put the chopstick into the rice vertically, because it resembles the Chinese traditional funeral tribute, which involves putting chopstick inside a bowl of rice vertically. It is considered inappropriate to use knives on the dining table.&lt;ref name=&quot;chopsticks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|language =Chinese|url=https://kknews.cc/zh-sg/news/vyy3v2.html|title=Why the length of chopsticks are 7 cun 6 fen?|publisher=KK News|date=2016-09-02|accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, do not wave your chopsticks around in the air too much or play with them. When you pick up food, you should first take it from the plate in front of you. It is not polite to stare at a plate. Focus on food and your companions. Watching TV, using mobile phones or doing other activities while eating is considered a bad habit. If an older person puts food in your bowl, you should thank them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cooper |first1=Eugene |title=Chinese Table Manners: You Are How You Eat |journal=Human Organization |date=1986 |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=179–184 |issn=0018-7259|jstor=44126118 |doi=10.17730/humo.45.2.4034u85x3058m025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to [[Chinese art]]==
Chinese dishes stress the three main points of appearance, smell, and taste. A really well-cooked Chinese food would need to achieve all three of them. Also, there is teaching of food carving &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cchatty.com/article/Food-carving/ |title=Chinese food carving |publisher=cchatty |date= |accessdate=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Chinese culture, typically using vegetables as materials to carve the sculpture for animals and spiritual beings.

==Relation to Chinese philosophy==
In Chinese philosophy, food is frequently used as the message that the author is trying to convey. A Chinese philosophy [[I Ching]] says, “Gentlemen use eating as a way to attain happiness. They should be aware of what they say, and refrain from eating too much.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{zh|s=《易》曰：君子以飲食宴樂。又曰：君子慎言語，節飲食。|p=“Yì” yuē: Jūnzǐ yǐ yǐnshí yàn lè.|labels=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to Chinese religion==
In [[Chinese folk religion]], [[Ancestor veneration in China|ancestor veneration]] is conducted by offering food to ancestors and Chinese festivals involve the consumption and preparation of specific foods which have symbolic meanings attached to them. Specific religions in China have their own cuisines such as the [[Taoist diet]], [[Buddhist cuisine]] and [[Chinese Islamic Cuisine]]. The [[Kaifeng Jews]] in [[Henan]] province once had their own Chinese Jewish cuisine but the community has largely died out in the modern era and not much is known about the specifics of their cuisine but they did influence foods eaten in their region and some of their dishes remain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flavorandfortune.com/dataaccess/article.php?ID=864 Kaifeng, Capital and Culinary], Flavor and Fortune&lt;/ref&gt;
