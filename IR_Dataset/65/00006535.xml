'''Celery''' (''Apium graveolens'') is a marshland plant in the family [[Apiaceae]] that has been cultivated as a [[vegetable]] since antiquity. Celery has a long fibrous stalk tapering into leaves. Depending on location and cultivar, either its stalks, leaves or [[hypocotyl]] are eaten and used in cooking.  Celery seed is also used as a spice and its extracts have been used in [[herbal medicine]].

==Description==
Celery leaves are [[pinnation|pinnate]] to bipinnate with rhombic leaflets {{convert|3|–|6|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|–|4|cm|abbr=on}} broad. The flowers are creamy-white, {{convert|2|–|3|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter, and are produced in dense compound [[umbel]]s. The seeds are broad ovoid to globose, {{convert|1.5|–|2|mm|abbr=on}} long and wide. Modern [[cultivar]]s have been selected for solid [[petiole (botany)|petioles]], leaf stalks.&lt;ref name=Vilmorin/&gt; A celery stalk readily separates into &quot;strings&quot; which are bundles of angular [[collenchyma]] cells exterior to the [[vascular bundle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teaching plant anatomy through creative laboratory exercises|last=Peterson|first=R.

'''Wild celery''', ''Apium graveolens'' var. ''graveolens'', grows to {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall.
It occurs around the globe. The first cultivation is thought to have happened in the [[Mediterranean]] region, where the natural habitats were salty and wet, or [[marsh]]y soils near the coast where celery grew in agropyro-rumicion-[[plant community|plant communities]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Oberdorfer2001&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pflanzensoziologische Exkursionsflora für Deutschland und angrenzende Gebiete|last=Erich|first=Oberdorfer|year=2001|publisher=E.

North of the Alps, wild celery is found only in the [[Life zones of central Europe#Life zones|foothill zone]] on soils with some salt content. It prefers moist or wet, nutrient rich, muddy soils. It cannot be found in Austria and is increasingly rare in Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;ExFloraÖLS&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exkursionsflora für Österreich, Liechtenstein und Südtirol : Bestimmungsbuch für alle in der Republik Österreich, im Fürstentum Liechtenstein und in der Autonomen Provinz Bozen / Südtirol (Italien) wildwachsenden sowie die wichtigsten kultivierten Gefässpflanzen (Farnpflanzen und Samenpflanzen) mit Angaben über ihre Ökologie und Verbreitung|last=Fischer|first=Manfred A.|last2=Günter|first2=Gottschlich|year=2008|publisher=Oberösterreichisches Landesmuseum|isbn=9783854741879|oclc=886822563|language=de|page=849}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
First attested in English in 1664, the word &quot;celery&quot; derives from the [[French language|French]] ''céleri'', in turn from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''seleri'', the plural of ''selero'', which comes from [[Late Latin]] ''selinon'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dselinon | title= selinon| editor-first1= Charlton T.  |editor-last1= Lewis|editor-first2=Charles |editor-last2= Short| work=A Latin Dictionary| publisher=Perseus Digital Library, Tufts University}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the {{lang-grc|σέλινον|selinon}}, &quot;celery&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dse%2Flinon | title=σέλινον| editor-first1= Henry George |editor-last1=Liddell|editor-first2=Robert |editor-last2=Scott| work=A Greek-English Lexicon| publisher=Perseus Digital Library, Tufts University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=celery |title= celery| website=Etymonline.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest attested form of the word is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] ''se-ri-no'', written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= celery| url= http://www.palaeolexicon.com/ShowWord.aspx?Id=16927| website=Palaeolexicon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
[[File:Celery cross section.jpg|thumb|Cross-section of a 'Pascal' celery rib, the petiole]]
Celery was described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in Volume One of his ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carl Linnaeus | title=Species Plantarum: Tomus I | publisher=Holmiae. (Laurentii Salvii). | year=1753|language=la}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation==
The plants are raised from seed, sown either in a hot bed or in the open garden according to the season of the year, and, after one or two thinnings and transplantings, they are, on attaining a height of {{convert|15|–|20|cm|abbr=on}}, planted out in deep trenches for convenience of blanching, which is effected by earthing up to exclude light from the stems.

In the past, celery was grown as a vegetable for winter and early spring; it was perceived as a cleansing [[Medication#For nutrition|tonic]], welcomed to counter the [[scurvy|deficiencies]] of a winter diet based on salted meats without fresh vegetables. By the 19th century, the season for celery had been extended, to last from the beginning of September to late in April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = William Robinson and W. P. Thomson | title = The Vegetable Garden | url = https://archive.org/details/vegetablegarden00thomgoog | edition = 3rd | date = 1920 | page = 227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
In North America, commercial production of celery is dominated by the cultivar called 'Pascal' celery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vilmorin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first=Roger L. |last=de Vilmorin |year=1950 |title=Pascal celery and its origin |journal=Journal of the New York Botanical Garden |volume=51 |issue=602 |pages=39–41 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/31503357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardeners can grow a range of cultivars, many of which differ from the wild species, mainly in having stouter leaf stems. They are ranged under two classes, white and red.
The stalks grow in tight, straight, parallel bunches, and are typically marketed fresh that way, without roots and just a little green leaf remaining.

The stalks are eaten raw, or as an ingredient in salads, or as a flavoring in soups, stews, and pot roasts.

===Europe===
In Europe, another popular variety  is [[celeriac]] (also known as ''celery root''), ''Apium graveolens'' var. ''rapaceum'', grown because its [[hypocotyl]] forms a large bulb, white on the inside. The bulb can be kept for months in winter and mostly serves as a main ingredient in soup. It can also be shredded and used in salads.
The leaves are used as seasoning; the small, fibrous stalks find only marginal use.&lt;ref name=&quot;molly&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Molly| last=Watson|url=http://localfoods.about.com/od/fall/tp/aboutceleryroot.htm|title=All About Celery Root (Celeriac)|publisher=localfoods.about.com|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eatseasons&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eattheseasons.com/Archive/celery_root.htm|year=2010|title=eat celery root|publisher=eattheseasons.com|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schuchert&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.mpiz-koeln.mpg.de/pr/garten/schau/ApiumgraveolensLvarrapaceum/Celeriac.html |title=Celeriac (''Apium graveolens'' L. var.

===Asia===
[[File:Chinese celery.jpg|thumb|Leaf celery, also known as Chinese celery]]
[[Leaf celery]] (Chinese celery, ''Apium graveolens var. secalinum'') is a cultivar from East Asia that grows in marshlands.  Leaf celery is most likely the oldest cultivated form of celery.  Leaf celery has characteristically thin skin stalks and a stronger taste and smell compared to other cultivars.  It is used as a flavoring in soups and sometimes pickled as a side dish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newman|first1=Jacqueline|title=Chinese Celery |journal=Vegetables and Vegetarian Foods|date=Fall 2006 |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=15–34 |url=http://www.flavorandfortune.com/dataaccess/article.php?ID=576|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wild===
The wild form of celery is known as &quot;smallage&quot;. It has a furrowed stalk with wedge-shaped leaves, the whole plant having a coarse, earthy taste, and a distinctive smell. The stalks are not usually eaten (except in soups or stews in [[French cuisine]]), but the leaves may be used in salads, and its seeds are those sold as a spice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.practicallyedible.com/edible.nsf/pages/smallage | title=Smallage | publisher=Practically Edible: The World's Biggest Food Encyclopedia | accessdate=2009-05-03 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010115914/http://www.practicallyedible.com/edible.nsf/pages/smallage | archivedate=2008-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With cultivation and blanching, the stalks lose their acidic qualities and assume the mild, sweetish, aromatic taste particular to celery as a salad plant.

Because wild celery is rarely eaten, yet susceptible to the same diseases as more well-used cultivars, it is often removed from fields to help prevent transmission of viruses like [[celery mosaic virus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wellman|first1=F|title=Control of Southern Celery Mosaic in Florida by Removing Weeds That Serve as Sources of Mosaic Infection |journal=United States Department of Agriculture |date=February 1937|volume=54|issue=8|pages=1–16|url=https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/CAT86200543/PDF|accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harvesting and storage==
[[File:Celery Cells (400x).jpg|thumb|Celery tissue under 400x magnification of a light microscope]]
Harvesting occurs when the average size of celery in a field is marketable; due to extremely uniform crop growth, fields are harvested only once. The [[Petiole (botany)|petioles]] and leaves are removed and harvested; celery is packed by size and quality (determined by color, shape, straightness and thickness of petiole, stalk and midrib{{clarify|reason=to distinguish meanings of petiole, stalk, midrib, and rib|date=April 2013}} length and absence of disease, cracks, splits, insect damage and rot).  During commercial harvesting, celery is packaged into cartons which contain between 36 and 48 stalks and weigh up to {{convert|27|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Takele|first1=Etaferahu|title=Celery Production: Sample Costs and Profitability Analysis|url=https://coststudyfiles.ucdavis.edu/uploads/cs_public/b7/6c/b76c57ff-2878-4dd3-b800-3240ebcdd59d/celery-8028.pdf|website=UC Davis|publisher=University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources|accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under optimal conditions, celery can be stored for up to seven weeks from {{convert|0|to|2|C|F}}. Inner stalks may continue growing if kept at temperatures above {{convert|0|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.  Shelf life can be extended by packaging celery in anti-fogging, micro-perforated shrink wrap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rizzo|first1=V|title=Effects of packaging on shelf life of fresh celery|journal=Journal of Food Engineering|date=January 2009|volume=90|issue=1|pages=124–128|doi=10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2008.06.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freshly cut petioles of celery are prone to decay, which can be prevented or reduced through the use of sharp blades during processing, gentle handling, and proper sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://postharvest.ucdavis.edu/Produce/ProduceFacts/Veg/celery.shtml | title = Celery: Recommendations for Maintaining Postharvest Quality | publisher = Post-harvest technology research and information center | accessdate = 2008-03-04 | last = Cantwell | first = M | author2 = Suslow, T. | date = 2002-06-10 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080423234215/http://postharvest.ucdavis.edu/Produce/ProduceFacts/Veg/celery.shtml | archivedate = 2008-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Celery stalk may be preserved through [[pickling]] by first removing the leaves, then boiling the stalks in water before finally adding vinegar, salt, and vegetable oil.

===Sulfites===
In the past, restaurants used to store celery in a container of water with powdered vegetable preservative, but it was found that the [[sulfite]]s in the preservative caused allergic reactions in some people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Feldman D, Schwan K | title = How Does Aspirin Find a Headache? | publisher = HarperCollins | date = 2005 | isbn =  978-0-06-074094-8 | page = 208}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] banned the use of sulfites on fruits and vegetables intended to be eaten raw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Fortin ND | title = Food Regulation: Law, Science, Policy and Practice | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | date = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-470-12709-4 | page = 288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:CelerySeedEssOil.png|thumb|upright|Celery seed (''Apium graveolens'') essential oil]]

Celery is eaten around the world as a vegetable. In North America the crisp [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] (leaf stalk) is used. In Europe the [[hypocotyl]] is used as a root vegetable. The leaves are strongly flavored and are used less often, either as a flavoring in soups and stews or as a dried herb. Celery, onions, and bell peppers are the [[holy trinity (cuisine)|&quot;holy trinity&quot;]] of [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Louisiana Creole]] and [[Cajun cuisine]]. Celery, onions, and carrots make up the French [[mirepoix (cuisine)|mirepoix]], often used as a base for sauces and soups. Celery is a staple in many soups, such as chicken noodle soup.  

[[phthalide|Phthalides]] occur naturally in celery.&lt;ref&gt;https://scindeks-clanci.ceon.rs/data/pdf/2406-2979/2018/2406-29791801028M.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leaves===
Celery leaves are frequently used in cooking to add a mild spicy flavor to foods, similar to, but milder than black pepper. Celery leaves are suitable dried as a sprinkled on seasoning for use with baked, fried or roasted fish, meats and as part of a blend of fresh seasonings suitable for use in soups and stews. They may also be eaten raw, mixed into a salad or as a garnish.

===Seeds===
In temperate countries, celery is also grown for its seeds. Actually very small fruit, these &quot;seeds&quot; yield a valuable [[essential oil]] that is used in the perfume industry. The oil contains the [[chemical compound]] [[apiole]]. Celery seeds can be used as flavoring or spice, either as whole seeds or ground.

===Celery salt===
The seeds can be ground and mixed with salt, to produce [[celery salt]]. Celery salt can be made from an extract of the roots or using dried leaves. Celery salt is used as a seasoning, in cocktails (notably to enhance the flavor of [[Bloody Mary (cocktail)|Bloody Mary]] cocktails), on the [[Chicago-style hot dog]], and in [[Old Bay Seasoning]].

===Herbalism===
[[File:Celery seed.jpg|thumb|Celery seeds]]

Celery seeds have been used widely in Eastern herbal traditions such as [[Ayurveda]].&lt;ref name=UMM&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/herb/celery-seed|title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine Guide &gt; Herb &gt; Celery seed|publisher=University of Maryland Medical Center|accessdate=2018-02-15|date=2015-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] wrote that celery seeds could relieve pain in around AD 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Celsus/home.html|title=LacusCurtius • Celsus — De Medicina|website=penelope.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Celery juice fad===

In 2019, a fad in drinking celery water was reported in the United States, based on &quot;[[Detoxification (alternative medicine)|detoxification]]&quot; claims from blogger Anthony Williams who says he receives advanced health information from spirits he [[Mediumship#Channeling|communicates with]]. The health claims have no scientific basis, but the fad caused a sizable spike in celery prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/style/celery-juice-craze.html|title=Why Is Everyone Drinking Celery Juice as if It Will Save Them From Dying?|first=Marisa|last=Meltzer|date=June 27, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Uguen-Csenge |first1=Eva |title=Celery prices soar as juice shops struggle to meet demand from latest health fad |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/celery-price-cost-juice-health-trend-1.5076439 |accessdate=9 January 2020 |work=[[CBC News]] |date=29 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celery is used in [[weight loss]] diets, where it provides low-calorie [[dietary fiber]] bulk. Celery is often incorrectly thought to be a &quot;[[negative-calorie food]]&quot;, the digestion of which burns more calories than the body can obtain. In fact, eating celery provides positive net calories, with digestion consuming only a small proportion of the calories taken in.&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Why Calories Count: From Science to Politics|author1=Nestle, M.|author2=Nesheim, M.C.|date=2012|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520262881|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaioR5Ac5fQC|page=189|accessdate=2014-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allergies==
Celery is among a small group of foods (headed by [[peanut]]s) that appear to provoke the most severe allergic reactions; for people with celery allergy, exposure can cause potentially fatal [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic shock]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8337856&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8337856 |year=1993 |last1=Celestin |first1=J |last2=Heiner |first2=DC |title=Food-induced anaphylaxis |volume=158 |issue=6 |pages=610–1 |pmc=1311786 |journal=The Western Journal of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[allergen]] does not appear to be destroyed at cooking temperatures.

Celery root—commonly eaten as [[celeriac]], or put into drinks—is known to contain more allergen than the stalk. Seeds contain the highest levels of allergen content. [[Exercise-induced anaphylaxis]] may be exacerbated.

An allergic reaction also may be triggered by eating foods that have been processed with machines that have previously processed celery, making avoiding such foods difficult.

In contrast with peanut allergy being most prevalent in the US, celery allergy is most prevalent in [[Central Europe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12958180&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1096/fj.02-0872fje |title=Cross-reactive N-glycans of Api g 5, a high molecular weight glycoprotein allergen from celery, are required for immunoglobulin E binding and activation of effector cells from allergic patients |year=2003 |last1=Bublin |first1=M. |journal=The FASEB Journal |pmid=12958180 |last2=Radauer |first2=C |last3=Wilson |first3=IB |last4=Kraft |first4=D |last5=Scheiner |first5=O |last6=Breiteneder |first6=H |last7=Hoffmann-Sommergruber |first7=K |volume=17 |issue=12 |pages=1697–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[European Union]], foods that contain or may contain celery, even in trace amounts, must be clearly marked as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Food labelling and packaging in international trade | work=General labelling standards for the UK and EU | url=http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1080034063&amp;type=RESOURCES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celery contains [[phenolic acid]], which is an [[antioxidant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=Yao|title=Phenolic Composition and Antioxidant Activities of 11 Celery Cultivars|journal=Journal of Food Science|date=2010|volume=75|issue=1|pages=C9–C13|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44620405|doi=10.1111/j.1750-3841.2009.01392.x|pmid=20492156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Apiin]] and [[apigenin]] can be extracted from celery and parsley. [[Lunularin]] is a dihydrostilbenoid found in common celery.

The main chemicals responsible for the aroma and taste of celery are [[butylphthalide]] and [[sedanolide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Relative recovery and identification of carbonyl compounds from celery essential oil | author = Wilson, Charles Welthy III | journal = Journal of Food Science | year = 1970 | volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = 766–768 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2621.1970.tb01989.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Selinos didrachm ANS 685 670331.jpg|thumb|left|[[Selinunte]] [[didrachm]] coin bearing a ''selinon'' (celery) leaf, circa 515–470&amp;nbsp;BC.]]
Daniel Zohary and Maria Hopf&lt;ref&gt;D. Zohary and M. Hopf, ''Domestication of Plants in the Old World'', (3rd ed. 2000) p.202.&lt;/ref&gt; note that celery leaves and [[inflorescence]]s were part of the garlands found in the tomb of pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]] (died 1323&amp;nbsp;BC), and celery [[mericarp]]s dated to the seventh century BC were recovered in the [[Heraion of Samos]]. However, they note &quot;since ''A. graveolens'' grows wild in these areas, it is hard to decide whether these remains represent wild or cultivated forms.&quot; Only by classical times is it certain that celery was cultivated.

M. Fragiska mentions an archeological find of celery dating to the 9th century BC, at [[Kastanas]]; however, the literary evidence for [[ancient Greece]] is far more abundant. In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', the horses of the [[Myrmidons]] graze on wild celery that grows in the marshes of [[Troy]], and in ''[[Odyssey]]'', there is mention of the meadows of violet and wild celery surrounding the cave of [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]].&lt;ref name=Fragiska&gt;{{cite journal |first=Fragiska |last=Megaloudi |year=2005 |title=Wild and Cultivated Vegetables, Herbs and Spices in Greek Antiquity (900&amp;nbsp;B.C. to 400&amp;nbsp;B.C.) |journal=Environmental Archaeology |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=73–82 |doi=10.1179/146141005790083858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Capitulary'' of Charlemagne, compiled ca. 800, ''[[apium]]'' appears, as does ''olisatum'', or [[alexanders]], among medicinal herbs and vegetables the Frankish emperor desired to see grown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oldcook.com/en/medieval-capitulary_charlemagne|title=Oldcook : Capitulary of Charlemagne, De villis vel curtis imperialibus|website=www.oldcook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; At some later point in medieval Europe celery displaced alexanders.

The name &quot;celery&quot; retraces the plant's route of successive adoption in European cooking, as the English &quot;celery&quot; (1664) is derived from the French ''céleri'' coming from the [[Lombard language|Lombard term]], ''seleri'', from the Latin ''selinon'', borrowed from Greek.&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'', ''s.v.'' &quot;Celery&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Celery's late arrival in the English kitchen is an end-product of the long tradition of seed selection needed to reduce the sap's bitterness and increase its sugars. By 1699, [[John Evelyn]] could recommend it in his ''Acetaria. A Discourse of [[Salad|Sallets]]'': &quot;Sellery, apium Italicum, (and of the Petroseline Family) was formerly a stranger with us (nor very long since in Italy) is an hot and more generous sort of Macedonian [[Parsley|Persley]] or Smallage... and for its high and grateful Taste is ever plac'd in the middle of the Grand Sallet, at our Great Men's tables, and Praetors feasts, as the Grace of the whole Board&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Evelyn, J.|year=2005 |orig-year=1699|title=Acetaria: A Discourse of Sallets|publisher=B. Tooke; The Women's Auxiliary of Brooklyn Botanic Garden; Project Gutenberg|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celery makes a minor appearance in colonial American gardens; its culinary limitations are reflected in the observation by the author of ''A Treatise on Gardening, by a Citizen of Virginia'' that it is &quot;one of the species of [[parsley]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ann Leighton, ''American Gardens in the Eighteenth Century'', 1976, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Its first extended treatment in print was in [[Bernard M'Mahon]]'s ''American Gardener's Calendar'' (1806).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://lichen.csd.sc.edu/vegetable/vegetable.php?vegName=Celery |title=David Shields, &quot;American Heritage Vegetables&quot; |access-date=2016-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001235331/http://lichen.csd.sc.edu/vegetable/vegetable.php?vegName=Celery |archive-date=2015-10-01 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the mid-19th century, continued selections for refined crisp texture and taste brought celery to American tables, where it was served in celery vases to be salted and eaten raw. Celery was so popular in the United States in the 1800s and early 1900s that the [[New York Public Library]]'s [http://menus.nypl.org/ historical menu archive] shows that it was the third most popular dish in New York City menus during that time, behind only coffee and tea. In those days celery cost more than caviar, as it was difficult to cultivate. There were also many varieties of celery back then that are no longer around because they are difficult to grow and do not ship well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |title=When Celery Was More Special Than Caviar |url=http://www.sporkful.com/when-celery-was-more-special-than-caviar/ |website=Sporkful podcast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural depictions===

A [[Chthonic|chthonian]] symbol among the ancient Greeks, celery was said to have sprouted from the blood of [[Cabeiri|Kadmilos]], father of the [[Cabeiri]], chthonian divinities celebrated in [[Samothrace]], [[Lemnos]], and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] {{Citation needed|reason=I think this comes from Clement, Exhortation to the Greeks 2. 16 but I don't have the tools to verify |date=February 2020}}. The spicy odor and dark leaf color encouraged this association with the cult of death. In classical Greece, celery leaves were used as garlands for the dead, and the wreaths of the winners at the [[Isthmian Games]] were first made of celery before being replaced by crowns made of [[pine]]. According to [[Pliny the Elder]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny's Natural History|Pliny, ''Natural History'']] XIX.46.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]], the garland worn by the winners of the sacred [[Nemean Games]] was also made of celery.&lt;ref name=Fragiska/&gt; The Ancient Greek colony of [[Selinunte|Selinous]] ({{lang-grc|Σελινοῦς}}, ''Selinous''), on [[Sicily]], was named after wild parsley that grew abundantly there; Selinountian coins depicted a parsley leaf as the symbol of the city.
