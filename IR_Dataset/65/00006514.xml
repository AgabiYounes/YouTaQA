'''County Dublin''' ({{lang-ga|Contae Bhaile Átha Cliath}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/pdf/10.09.23_BRAINSE.pdf|title=Logainm.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Contae Átha Cliath'') is one of the [[Counties of Ireland|thirty-two traditional counties of Ireland]]. Prior to 1994 it was also an administrative county covering the whole county outside of [[Dublin City Council]]. In 1994, as part of a reorganisation of local government within Dublin the boundaries of Dublin City were redrawn, Dublin County Council was abolished and three new administrative county councils were established: [[Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown]], [[Fingal]] and [[South Dublin]].

While it is no longer used as an administrative division for local government, it retains a strong identity in popular culture. It is in the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Leinster]], and is named after the city of [[Dublin]], the [[capital city]] of Ireland. County Dublin was one of the first parts of Ireland to be [[shire]]d by [[John, King of England]] following the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]]. 

According to the 2016 census, the total population of County Dublin was 1,345,402, approximately 27% of the Republic of Ireland's population.&lt;ref name=census2016&gt;[http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?maintable=EP001&amp;PLanguage=0 Population and Actual and Percentage Change 2011 to 2016 by Sex, Province County or City, CensusYear and Statistic], Central Statistics Office. Retrieved 16 Jul 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The county is a [[NUTS 3 statistical regions of the Republic of Ireland|NUTS 3]] region,&lt;ref&gt;Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the establishment of a common classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) ([https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:02003R1059-20180118 OJ L 154 21.6.2003, p. 1]).&lt;/ref&gt; and is part of the NUTS 2 region of Eastern and Midland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://emra.ie/ |title=Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly |website=Eastern &amp; Midland Regional Assembly |access-date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local government and politics==

===Local authorities===
There are four [[Local government|local authorities]] whose remit collectively encompasses the geographic area of the county and city of Dublin. These are [[Dublin City Council]], [[South Dublin County Council]], [[Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council]] and [[Fingal County Council]].

Prior to the [[Act of the Oireachtas|enactment]] of the [[Local Government (Dublin) Act 1993]], the county was a unified whole even though it was administered by two local authorities – [[Dublin County Council]] and [[Dublin Corporation]]. Since the enactment of the [[Local Government Act 2001]] in particular, the geographic area of the county has been divided between three entities at the level of &quot;county&quot; and a further entity at the level of &quot;city&quot;. They rank equally as first level [[local administrative unit]]s of the [[NUTS 3 statistical regions of the Republic of Ireland|NUTS 3]] Dublin Region for [[Eurostat]] purposes. There are 34 [[NUTS of the Republic of Ireland#Local administrative units|LAU 1]] entities in the Republic of Ireland. Each [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] is responsible for certain local [[Public services|services]] such as sanitation, planning and development, libraries, the collection of motor taxation, local roads and [[social housing]].

Dublin County Council (which did not include the [[county borough]] of Dublin) was abolished in 1994 and the area divided among the administrative counties of [[Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown]], [[Fingal]] and [[South Dublin]] each with its [[county town|county seat]]. To these areas may be added the area of Dublin city which collectively comprise the Dublin Region&lt;ref name=&quot;r1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZSI394Y1993.html|title=Local Government Act, 1991 (Regional Authorities) (Establishment) Order, 1993|accessdate=31 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211080238/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZSI394Y1993.html|archive-date=11 February 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''{{lang|ga|Réigiúin Átha Cliath}}'') and come under the remit of the Dublin Regional Authority.

The area lost its administrative county status in 1994, with Section 9 Part 1(a) of the ''Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993'' stating that &quot;the county shall cease to exist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Act of the Oireachtas]]: [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0031/print.html#sec9 Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993 (Section 9 Part 1(a))]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0031/print.html#sec2 Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993 Section 2] specifies: ''&quot;the county&quot;, in relation to any time before the establishment day, means the administrative county of Dublin.''&lt;/ref&gt; In discussing the legislation to dissolve Dublin County Council, [[Avril Doyle]] [[Teachta Dála|TD]] said, &quot;The Bill before us today effectively abolishes County Dublin, and as one born and bred in these parts of Ireland I find it rather strange that we in this House are abolishing County Dublin. I am not sure whether Dubliners realise that that is what we are about today, but in effect that is the case.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dáil Éireann]]: [http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0435/D.0435.199311030007.html Parliamentary Debates (3 November 1993)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The county is part of the [[Dublin (European Parliament constituency)|Dublin]] constituency for the purposes of [[Elections in the European Union|European elections]]. For elections to [[Dáil Éireann]], the area of the county is currently (2016) divided into eleven constituencies: [[Dublin Bay North (Dáil constituency)|Dublin Bay North]], [[Dublin Bay South (Dáil constituency)|Dublin Bay South]], [[Dublin Central (Dáil constituency)|Dublin Central]], [[Dublin Fingal (Dáil constituency)|Dublin Fingal]], [[Dublin Mid-West (Dáil constituency)|Dublin Mid-West]], [[Dublin North-West (Dáil constituency)|Dublin North-West]], [[Dublin Rathdown (Dáil constituency)|Dublin Rathdown]], [[Dublin South-Central (Dáil constituency)|Dublin South-Central]], [[Dublin South-West (Dáil constituency)|Dublin South-West]], [[Dublin West (Dáil constituency)|Dublin West]], and [[Dún Laoghaire (Dáil constituency)|Dún Laoghaire]]. Together they return 44 deputies ([[Teachta Dála|TDs]]) to the Dáil.

Despite the legal status of the Dublin Region, the term &quot;County Dublin&quot; is still in common usage. Many organisations and sporting teams continue to organise on a &quot;County Dublin&quot; or &quot;Dublin Region&quot; basis. The area formerly known as &quot;County Dublin&quot; is now defined in legislation solely as the &quot;Dublin Region&quot; under the ''Local Government Act, 1991 (Regional Authorities) (Establishment) Order, 1993'',&lt;ref name=&quot;r1&quot; /&gt; and this is the terminology officially used by the four Dublin administrative councils in press releases concerning the former county area. The term ''[[Greater Dublin Area]]'', which might consist of some or all of the Dublin Region along with counties of [[County Kildare|Kildare]], [[County Meath|Meath]] and [[County Wicklow|Wicklow]], has no legal standing.

===Dublin Region===
[[File:Ireland location map Dublin region.svg|thumb|alt=|The Dublin region of Ireland with each constituent county/city council highlighted.]]
The '''Dublin Region''' is a [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS]] Level III [[List of regions of the Republic of Ireland|region]] of Ireland. The region is one of eight regions of the Republic of Ireland for the purposes of [[Eurostat]] statistics. Its NUTS code is IE061.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cso.ie/en/methods/revnuts23/|title=Revision to the Irish NUTS2 and NUTS3 regions|publisher=cso.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is co-extensive with the old county. The regional capital is [[Dublin|Dublin City]] which is also the national capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;IrishRegionOffice&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ireo.eu/|title=Home Page|website=Irish Regions European Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest [[Ordnance Survey Ireland]] &quot;Discovery Series&quot; (Third Edition 2005) 1:50,000 map of the Dublin Region, Sheet 50, shows the boundaries of the city and three surrounding counties of the region. Extremities of the Dublin Region, in the north and south of the region, appear in other sheets of the series, 43 and 56 respectively.

==Economy==
The economy of County Dublin was identified as being the powerhouse behind the [[Celtic Tiger]], a period of strong economic growth of the state. This resulted in the economy of the county expanding by almost 100% between the early 1990s and 2007. This growth resulted from incoming high-value industries, such as financial services and [[software manufacturing]], as well as low-skilled retail and domestic services, which caused a shift away from older manufacturing-industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;IrishRegionOffice&quot;/&gt; This change saw high unemployment in the 1980s and early 1990s which resulted in damage to the capitals social structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;IrishRegionOffice&quot;/&gt;

According to CSO figures, the region had a GDP of €87.238 bn and a GDP per capita of €68,208 in 2014 (the second highest was Cork at €50,544 per capita).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/er/cirgdp/countyincomesandregionalgdp2014/|title=County Incomes and Regional GDP 2014 - CSO - Central Statistics Office|website=www.cso.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Separately, Eurostat figures for 2012 suggested the region then had a GDP of €72.384 bn and a GDP per capita of €57,200 – the highest on the island of Ireland (the second highest being Cork with €48,500).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitViewTableAction.do |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416165655/http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitViewTableAction.do |archivedate=16 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of early 2017, the unemployment rate for the Dublin region was estimated at 6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/er/qnhs/quarterlynationalhouseholdsurveyquarter42016/ | publisher = Central Statistics Office |work = Quarterly National Household Survey | title = Table 9 Persons aged 15 years and over classified by NUTS2 and NUTS3 regions and ILO Economic Status|date = 21 February 2017 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
{{See also|Transport in Dublin}}
County Dublin is the main transport node of Ireland,&lt;ref name=&quot;IrishRegionOffice&quot;/&gt; and contains one international airport, [[Dublin Airport]]. It is also served by two main seaports, Dún Laoghaire port and [[Dublin Port]], which is just located outside of the city center.  The two main train stations are [[Dublin Heuston]] and [[Dublin Connolly]], both of which serve intercity trains.

==Demographics==
According to the 2006 census, County Dublin had a population of 1,187,176, which constitutes 30% of the national population. This was an increase of 9.5% on 2002 figures. Its population density was 1,218/km². The population of Dublin City, was 506,211.&lt;ref name=&quot;IrishRegionOffice&quot;/&gt;
