The '''Cleveland Browns''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in [[Cleveland]]. Named after original coach and co-founder [[Paul Brown]], they compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC North|North]] division. The Browns play their home games at [[FirstEnergy Stadium]], which opened in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Florjancic|first=Matt|title=Browns Stadium to become 'FirstEnergy Stadium'|url=http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/news/article-1/Browns-Stadium-to-become-FirstEnergy-Stadium/eebc8394-ae91-4d2d-b7e9-6bf1413e9809|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=ClevelandBrowns.com|date=January 15, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117050526/http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/news/article-1/Browns-Stadium-to-become-FirstEnergy-Stadium/eebc8394-ae91-4d2d-b7e9-6bf1413e9809|archivedate=January 17, 2013|accessdate=November 27, 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Naymik|first=Mark|title=Browns owner Jimmy Haslam has spell over football fans and politicians alike|url=http://www.cleveland.com/naymik/index.ssf/2013/03/browns_owner_jimmy_haslam_has.html|newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=March 8, 2013|accessdate=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with administrative offices and training facilities in [[Berea, Ohio]].

The franchise was founded in 1945 by Brown and businessman [[Arthur B. McBride]] as a charter member of the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC). The Browns dominated the AAFC, compiling a 47–4–3 record in the league's four seasons and winning its championship in each.&lt;ref name=&quot;pigskinacademy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pigskinacademy.com/Cleveland_Browns.html |title=Cleveland Browns-Team history|publisher=pigskinacademy.com|accessdate=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the AAFC folded after the 1949 season, the Browns joined the NFL along with the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and the [[Baltimore Colts (1947–1950)|original Baltimore Colts]]. The team won a championship in [[1950 NFL season|their inaugural NFL season]], as well as in the [[1954 NFL season|1954]], [[1955 NFL season|1955]], and [[1964 NFL season|1964]] seasons, and in a feat unequaled in any of the North American major professional sports, played in their league championship game in each of the Browns' first ten years of existence. From 1965 to 1995, they qualified to play in the [[NFL playoffs]] 14 times, but did not win another championship or play in the [[Super Bowl]] during that period.

In 1995, owner [[Art Modell]], who had purchased the Browns in 1961, announced plans to move the team to [[Baltimore]]. After threats of legal action from the city of Cleveland and fans, [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|a compromise]] was reached in early 1996 that allowed Modell to establish the [[Baltimore Ravens]] as a new franchise while retaining the contracts of all Browns personnel. The Browns' [[intellectual property]], including team name, logos, training facility, and history, were kept [[Trust law|in trust]] and the franchise was regarded by the NFL as suspended, with a new team to be established by 1999 either by [[expansion team|expansion]] or relocation. The Browns were announced as an expansion team in 1998 and resumed play in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Art Modell's decision to move Cleveland Browns haunted him for rest of life |url=http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2012/09/art_modell_never_really_recove.html |author=Cabot, Mary Kay |newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]] |date=September 6, 2012 |accessdate=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since resuming operations in 1999, the Browns have struggled to find success. They have had only two winning seasons (in [[2002 NFL season|2002]] and [[2007 NFL season|2007]]), one playoff appearance (2002), and no playoff wins, winning only around a third of their games in total. The franchise has also been noted for a lack of stability with head coaches (10 full time and two interim since 1999), and [[quarterback]]s (30 different starters since 1999), along with the [[List of NFL franchise post-season droughts|longest active playoff drought]] in the NFL at 17 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hogan will be Browns' 28th starting quarterback since 1999 |url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2017/10/11/kevin-hogan-will-be-browns-28th-starting-quarterback-since-1999/ |author=Smith, Michael David |publisher=NBC Sports |date=October 11, 2017 |accessdate=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

{{Main|History of the Cleveland Browns}}
{{details|List of Cleveland Browns seasons}}

The history of the Cleveland Browns American football team began in 1944 when taxi-cab magnate Arthur B. &quot;Mickey&quot; McBride secured a Cleveland franchise in the newly formed [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC). [[Paul Brown]] was the team's namesake and first coach. The Browns began play in 1946 in the AAFC. The Browns won each of the league's four championship games before the league dissolved in 1949. The team then moved to the more established National Football League (NFL), where it continued to dominate. Between 1950 and 1955, Cleveland reached the NFL championship game every year, winning three times.

McBride and his partners sold the team to a group of Cleveland businessmen in 1953 for a then-unheard-of $600,000. Eight years later, the team was sold again, this time to a group led by New York advertising executive [[Art Modell]]. Modell fired Brown before the 1963 season, but the team continued to win behind running back [[Jim Brown]]. The Browns won the championship in 1964 and reached the title game the following season, losing to the Green Bay Packers.

When the AFL and NFL merged before the 1970 season, Cleveland became part of the new American Football Conference (AFC). While the Browns made it back to the playoffs in 1971 and 1972, they fell into mediocrity through the mid-1970s. A revival of sorts took place in 1979 and 1980, when quarterback Brian Sipe engineered a series of last-minute wins and the Browns came to be called the &quot;Kardiac Kids&quot;. Under Sipe, however, the Browns did not make it past the first round of the playoffs. Quarterback Bernie Kosar, whom the Browns drafted in 1985, led the team to three AFC Championship games in the late 1980s but lost each time to the [[Denver Broncos]]. 

In 1995, Modell announced he was relocating the Browns to Baltimore, sowing a mix of outrage and bitterness among Cleveland's dedicated fan base. Negotiations and legal battles led to an agreement where Modell would be allowed to take his personnel to Baltimore as an expansion franchise, called the [[Baltimore Ravens]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Modell deal details&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Sandomir|first=Richard|title=How Compromise Built Cleveland a New Stadium|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/12/sports/pro-football-how-compromise-built-cleveland-a-new-stadium.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=June 17, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68Um3PzfT?url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/12/sports/pro-football-how-compromise-built-cleveland-a-new-stadium.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|archivedate=June 17, 2012|date=February 12, 1996|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; but would leave Cleveland the Browns' colors, logos and heritage for a reactivated Browns franchise that would take the field no later than 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;Modell cleared to move&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Sandomir |first=Richard |title=N.F.L.

After three years of inactivity while [[Cleveland Stadium]] was demolished and [[FirstEnergy Stadium]] was built on its site, the Browns was reactivated and started play again in 1999 under new owner [[Al Lerner]]. The Browns struggled throughout the 2000s and 2010s, posting a record of 95–224–1 ({{winpct|95|224|1}}) since their 1999 return. The Browns have only posted two winning seasons and one playoff appearance ([[2002 Cleveland Browns season|2002]]) since returning to the NFL. The team's struggles have been magnified since 2012, when the Lerner family sold the team to businessman [[Jimmy Haslam]]. In six seasons under Haslam’s ownership, the Browns went through four head coaches and four general managers, none of whom had found success. In 2016 and 2017 under head coach [[Hue Jackson]], the Browns went 1–31 ({{winpct|1|31}}) (including a winless 0–16 season in 2017), the worst two-year stretch in NFL history, and received the number one overall draft pick in both of those years.

==Logos and uniforms==
{{Main|Cleveland Browns logos and uniforms}}

===Logos===
The Browns are the only National Football League team without a helmet logo. The logoless helmet serves as the Browns' official logo. The organization has used several promotional logos throughout the years; players' numbers were painted on the helmets from [[1957 NFL season|1957]] to [[1960 NFL season|1960]]; and an unused &quot;CB&quot; logo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.sportslogos.net/logos/7/155/full/5225.gif |title=Image of Cleveland Browns &quot;CB&quot; helmet |date= |accessdate=June 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grzegorek |first=Vince |url=http://www.clevescene.com/64-and-counting/archives/2010/02/09/the-hunt-for-the-great-orange-brown-and-white-whale-unraveling-the-mystery-of-the-1965-cb-cleveland-browns-helmet-logo |title=The Hunt for the Great Orange, Brown, and White Whale: Unraveling the Mystery of the 1965 &quot;CB&quot; Cleveland Browns Helmet Logo &amp;#124; '64 and Counting: Scene's Sports Blog |publisher=Cleveland Scene |date=February 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; But for much of their history, the Browns' helmets have been an unadorned [[burnt orange]] color with a top stripe of dark brown (officially called &quot;[[seal brown]]&quot;) divided by a white stripe.

The team has had various promotional logos throughout the years, such as the &quot;[[Brownie Elf]]&quot; mascot or a Brown &quot;B&quot; in a white football. While Art Modell did away with the Brownie Elf in the mid-1960s, believing it to be too childish, its use has been revived under the current ownership. The popularity of the Dawg Pound section at First Energy Stadium has led to a brown and orange dog being used for various Browns functions. But overall, the orange, logo-less helmet continues as the primary trademark of the Cleveland Browns.

On February 24, 2015, the team unveiled its new logos and word marks, the only differences being minor color changes to the helmet with the helmet design remaining largely as is.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewBrownsLogos2015&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BrownsLogosSneakPeek&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Patra|first=Kevin|title=Cleveland Browns unveil new logos|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000473731/article/cleveland-browns-unveil-new-logos |publisher=[[National Football League]] |date=February 24, 2015 |accessdate=August 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uniforms===
The original designs of the jerseys, pants, and socks remained mostly the same, but the helmets went through many significant revisions throughout the years. The Browns uniforms saw their first massive change prior to the 2015 season.

'''Jerseys:'''
# Brown - brown (officially &quot;[[seal brown]]&quot;) with orange colored numbers and writing, and an orange-white-orange stripe sequence on the sleeves.
# White (away) - white with orange numbers and writing, with a brown-orange-brown stripe sequence.
# Orange - orange with white numerals and writing, and a brown-white-brown stripe sequence.

'''Pants:'''
# Brown - brown pants with an orange-white-orange stripe sequence down two-thirds the length of the pants. The other third is the word &quot;BROWNS,&quot; written in orange.
# White - white pants with a brown-orange-brown stripes. &quot;BROWNS&quot; is written in brown.
# Orange - orange pants with a brown-white-brown stripe sequence. &quot;BROWNS&quot; is written in brown.

'''Socks:'''
# Solid brown.
# Solid white.
# Solid orange.

'''Helmet:''' Solid white (1946–1949); solid white for day games and solid orange for night games (1950–1951); orange with a single white stripe (1952–1956); orange with a single white stripe and brown numerals on the sides (1957–1959); orange with a brown-white-brown stripe sequence and brown numerals on the sides (1960); orange with a brown-white-brown stripe sequence (1961–1995 and 1999–present).

Over the years, the Browns have had on-and-off periods of wearing white for their home games, particularly in the 1970s and 80s, as well as in the early 2000s after the team returned to the league. Until recently, when more NFL teams have started to wear white at home at least once a season, the Browns were the only non-[[subtropical]] team north of the [[Mason-Dixon line]] to wear white at home on a regular basis.

Secondary numerals (called &quot;TV numbers&quot;) first appeared on the jersey sleeves in 1961. Over the years, there have been minor revisions to the sleeve stripes, the first occurring in 1968 (brown jerseys worn in early season) and 1969 (white and brown jerseys) when stripes began to be silk screened onto the sleeves and separated from each other to prevent color bleeding. However, the basic five-stripe sequence has remained intact (with the exception of the 1984 season). A recent revision was the addition of the initials &quot;AL&quot; to honor team owner [[Al Lerner]] who died in 2002; this was removed in 2013 upon Jimmy Haslam assuming ownership of the team.

Orange pants with a brown-white-brown stripe sequence were worn from 1975 to 1983 and become symbolic of the &quot;Kardiac Kids&quot; era. The orange pants were worn again occasionally in 2003 and 2004.

Other than the helmet, the uniform was completely redesigned for the 1984 season. New striping patterns appeared on the white jerseys, brown jerseys and pants. Solid brown socks were worn with brown jerseys and solid orange socks were worn with white jerseys. Brown numerals on the white jerseys were outlined in orange. White numerals on the brown jerseys were double outlined in brown and orange. (Orange numerals double outlined in brown and white appeared briefly on the brown jerseys in one pre-season game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kFlAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=v1YMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1066,2673152|title=Browns' Home Jerseys Will Be Modified|newspaper=Youngstown Vindicator|date=August 8, 1984|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) However, this particular uniform set was not popular with the fans, and in 1985 the uniform was returned to a look similar to the original design. It remained that way until 1995.

In 1999, the expansion Browns adopted the traditional design with two exceptions: first, the TV numbers, previously on the sleeves, were moved to the shoulders; and second, the orange-brown-orange pants stripes were significantly widened.

Experimentation with the uniform design began in 2002. An alternate orange jersey was introduced that season as the NFL encouraged teams to adopt a third jersey, and a major design change was made when solid brown socks appeared for the first time since 1984 and were used with white, brown and orange jerseys. Other than 1984, striped socks (matching the jersey stripes) had been a signature design element in the team's traditional uniform. The white striped socks appeared occasionally with the white jerseys in 2003–2005 and 2007.

Experimentation continued in 2003 and 2004 when the traditional orange-brown-orange stripes on the white pants were replaced by two variations of a brown-orange-brown sequence, one in which the stripes were joined (worn with white jerseys) and the other in which they were separated by white (worn with brown jerseys). The joined sequence was used exclusively with both jerseys in 2005. In 2006, the traditional orange-brown-orange sequence returned.

Additionally in 2006, the team reverted to an older uniform style, featuring gray face masks; the original stripe pattern on the brown jersey sleeves (The white jersey has had that sleeve stripe pattern on a consistent basis since the 1985 season.) and the older, darker shade of brown.

The Browns wore brown pants for the first time in team history on August 18, 2008, preseason game against the [[New York Giants]]. The pants contain no stripes or markings. The team had the brown pants created as an option for their away uniform when they integrated the gray facemask in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=King|first=Steve|title=Brown out|url=http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/article.php?id=8699|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=ClevelandBrowns.com|accessdate=December 13, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822033723/http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/article.php?id=8699|archivedate=August 22, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were not worn again until the Browns &quot;family&quot; scrimmage on August 9, 2009 with white-striped socks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2009/08/scrimmage_shows_offense_still.html|title=Scrimmage shows Cleveland Browns' offense still needs work|publisher=Cleveland.com|accessdate=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Browns have continued to wear the brown pants throughout the 2009 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/nfl/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/sports/1248597145139770.xml&amp;coll=2|title=Cleveland Browns might wear brown pants for all road games during 2009 NFL season|publisher=Cleveland.com|accessdate=July 26, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623012714/http://www.cleveland.com/nfl/plaindealer/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fsports%2F1248597145139770.xml&amp;coll=2|archivedate=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Browns quarterback [[Brady Quinn]] supported the team's move to wearing the brown pants full-time, claiming that the striped pattern on the white pants &quot;prohibit[ed] mobility&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2009/08/cleveland_browns_scrimmage_ans.html|title=Cleveland Browns' scrimmage answers some Brady Quinn concerns; WR Leggett impresses|newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]]|accessdate=August 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the fans generally did not like the brown pants, and after being used for only one season, the team returned to their white shirt-on-white pants in 2010. Coach [[Eric Mangini]] told ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' the Browns won't use the brown pants anymore. &quot;It wasn't very well-received,&quot; Mangini said. &quot;I hope we can get to the point where we can wear fruit on our heads and people wouldn't notice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2010/08/eric-mangini-cleveland-browns-will-abandon-the-brown-pants-look/1|title=Eric Mangini: Cleveland Browns will abandon the brown-pants look|work=[[USA Today]] |date=August 17, 2010|accessdate=August 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the brown pants weren't officially dropped by the team, but simply not used.

The Browns chose to wear white at home for the 2011 season, and wound up wearing white for all 16 games as when they were on the road, the home team would wear their darker colored uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Florjancic|first=Matt|title=Ask Matt|url=http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/news/article-1/Ask-Matt/7d2d23e9-ca93-4b86-8174-dabec878ba30|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=ClevelandBrowns.com|date=June 16, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619083357/http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/news/article-1/Ask-Matt/7d2d23e9-ca93-4b86-8174-dabec878ba30|archivedate=June 19, 2011|accessdate=September 3, 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Browns brought back the brown pants in their home game against the [[Buffalo Bills]] on October 3, 2013 on ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'', pairing them with the brown jerseys. It marked the first time the team wore an all-brown combination in team history.&lt;ref name=&quot;cleveland&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2013/10/browns_unveil_all-brown_unifor.html |title=Browns unveil all-brown uniforms vs. Bills: What do you think? &amp;#124; cleveland.com |newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]] |accessdate=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 14, 2015, the Cleveland Browns unveiled their new uniform combinations, consisting of the team's colors of orange, brown and white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shook|first=Nick|title=Cleveland Browns unveil new uniforms|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000485371/article/cleveland-browns-unveil-new-uniforms|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=April 14, 2015|access-date=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 6 significant changes to the Browns uniforms|url=https://www.clevelandbrowns.com/news/the-6-significant-changes-to-the-browns-uniforms-15140557|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=ClevelandBrowns.com|date=April 15, 2015|access-date=September 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Browns brought back the all-brown look for the [[NFL Color Rush]] program in 2016, minus the white elements. In 2018 the uniform was worn at home three times. For the [[2019 Cleveland Browns season|2019 season]], the Browns promoted the Color Rush uniform to their primary home uniform and will wear it for six home games as well as any away game in which the home team chooses to wear white (although for the Week 3 game against the [[Los Angeles Rams]], the Browns wore all-orange socks instead of brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gribble|first=Andrew|title=From Color Rush to Primary Colors, Browns to regularly wear popular uniforms in 2019|url=https://www.clevelandbrowns.com/news/color-rush-jersey-primary-colors-2019|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=ClevelandBrowns.com|date=September 4, 2019|access-date=September 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the two remaining home games, the browns will wear their previous brown home uniforms as alternate uniforms.

==Rivalries==
The Cleveland Browns have rivalries with all three of its [[AFC North]] opponents. In addition, the team has had historical rivalries with the [[Indianapolis Colts]], [[Denver Broncos]], [[Buffalo Bills]], and [[Detroit Lions]].

The team's biggest rival in the AAFC was the [[San Francisco 49ers]], though this has cooled and in some cases turned into a friendly relationship, as the Browns now play in the AFC and the 49ers play in the NFC. Additionally, many 49ers personnel helped the Browns relaunch in 1999 as well as former team President [[Mike Holmgren]] having started his NFL career in San Francisco. Also, 49ers owners [[John York]] and [[Denise DeBartolo York]] reside in [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], {{convert|60|mi}} southeast of Cleveland. Former long-time veteran placekicker and fan favorite, [[Phil Dawson]], signed with the 49ers in 2014, along with backup quarterback [[Colt McCoy]].

===Divisional rivalries===

====Pittsburgh Steelers====
{{main|Browns–Steelers rivalry}}

Often called the &quot;Turnpike Rivalry&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kdka.com/local/Steelers.Browns.rivalry.2.564970.html |title=Steelers To Take On Browns For First Place In The AFC North |publisher=Kdka.com |date=October 14, 2010 |accessdate=June 2, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130024350/http://kdka.com/local/Steelers.Browns.rivalry.2.564970.html |archive-date=November 30, 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Browns' biggest rival has long been the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Former Browns owner [[Art Modell]] scheduled home games against the Steelers on Saturday nights from 1964 to 1970 to help fuel the rivalry. The rivalry has also been fueled by the proximity of the two teams, number of championships both teams have won, players and personnel having played and/or coached for both sides, and personal bitterness. The teams have played twice annually since 1950, making it the oldest rivalry in the [[American Football Conference|AFC]] and the fifth-oldest rivalry in the NFL. Though the Browns dominated this rivalry early in the series (winning the first eight meetings and posting a 31–9 record in the 1950s and 1960s), the Steelers went 15–5 in the 1970s and 34–6–1 since the Browns returned to the league in 1999. The Steelers have been particularly dominant in Pittsburgh, posting a 42–6 record when hosting the Browns since 1970, including to winning streaks of 16 games (1970–85, 2004-present).

The Steelers currently hold a 76–59–1 lead. The Browns and Steelers met in the [[NFL playoffs|playoffs]] in {{nfly|1994}} and {{nfly|2002}}, with the Steelers winning both meetings. Though the rivalry has cooled in Pittsburgh due to the Modell move as well as the Browns' poor play since 1999, the Steelers still remain the top rival for Cleveland.

====Cincinnati Bengals====
{{main|Bengals–Browns rivalry}}

Originally conceived due to the personal animosity between [[Paul Brown]] and [[Art Modell]], the &quot;Battle of Ohio&quot; between the Browns and the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] has been fueled by the sociocultural differences between [[Cincinnati]] and Cleveland, a shared history between the two teams, and similar team colors, as Brown used the exact shade of orange for the Bengals that he used for the Browns. (Though this has changed since then, as the Bengals now use a brighter shade of orange.) Modell, in fact, moved the Browns to the AFC after the [[AFL–NFL merger]] in order to have a rivalry with the Bengals. The rivalry has also produced two of the eight highest-scoring games in NFL history. Cincinnati has the all-time edge 51–42. While the Bengals have a 27–15 edge since the Browns returned to the NFL in 1999, the Browns-Bengals series has been more competitive than the Browns' series with their other division rivals.

====Baltimore Ravens====
{{main|Browns–Ravens rivalry}}
Created as a result of the [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|Browns' relocation to Baltimore]], the rivalry between the Browns and [[Baltimore Ravens]] was more directed at Art Modell than the team itself, and is simply considered a divisional game in Baltimore. This matchup is more bitter for Cleveland than the others due to the fact that the draft picks for 1995 to 1998 resulted in the rosters that won the [[Super Bowl XXXV|Super Bowl]] for the Ravens in 2000. Had the Browns stayed in Cleveland, these teams (drafted by general manager [[Ozzie Newsome]]) might have given the Browns the title after a 35-year drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/rav/|title=Baltimore Ravens Team Encyclopedia|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bitterness was compounded when the Ravens won their second [[Super Bowl XLVII|Super Bowl]] in 2012.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Linden|first=Andrew|date=2015|title=Blue-Collar Identity And the 'Culture of Losing': Cleveland and the 'Save Our Browns' Campaign|url=|journal=Journal of Sport History|volume=42|issue=3|pages=340–360|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ravens lead the overall series 31–11. The two teams have not met in the playoffs.

===Other rivalries===

====Detroit Lions====
The [[Detroit Lions]] rivalry began in the 1950s, when the Browns and Lions played each other in four NFL championships. The Lions won three of those championships, while the Browns won one. This was arguably one of the NFL's best rivalries in the 1950s. Since the NFL-AFL merger of 1970, the teams have met much less frequently with the Browns' move to the AFC. From 2002 to 2014, the two teams played an annual preseason game known as the &quot;Great Lakes Classic&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Lakes Classic&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.morningjournal.com/articles/2009/11/22/sports/mj1925578.txt|title=Great Lakes Classic has lacked luster since its beginning|date=November 22, 2009|accessdate=March 21, 2009|author=Schudel, Jeff|publisher=[[The Morning Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buffalo Bills====
The Bills rivalry had its roots back to the days of the AAFC, when there was a [[Buffalo Bills (AAFC)|team from Buffalo with the same name]] in that league. The Browns and AAFC Bills played six games, including a league championship game, before the Browns were selected to merge into the NFL and the Bills left out. After the current incarnation of the Bills joined the NFL, the Browns and Bills have played each other from time to time. Though the Browns and Bills are in different AFC divisions, a mellow rivalry defined by mutual respect has since developed between the teams due to the similarities between Buffalo and Cleveland and shared misfortune between the teams. Despite this &quot;rivalry&quot; being known for ugly games, such as an 8-0 Browns win played in a blizzard in 2007 and a 6-3 Browns win in 2009 in which Browns quarterback [[Derek Anderson (American football)|Derek Anderson]] only completed 2 of 17 passes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.cbsnews.com/news/browns-win-ugly-beat-buffalo-6-3/|title = Browns Win Ugly, Beat Buffalo 6-3|date = October 11, 2009|publisher = CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; there have been some competitive moments between the Bills and Browns as well, such as a playoff game in 1990 and two games with playoff-implications in 2007 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2014/11/cleveland_browns_vs_buffalo_bi_8.html|title = Cleveland Browns vs. Buffalo Bills series has seen it all: A championship, a fired coach and blizzard|first = Tim|last = Warskinskey|work = [[The Plain Dealer]]|publisher = Cleveland.com|date = November 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Browns fans' respect for the Bills is partly due to Bills founding owner [[Ralph Wilson]] being one of only two NFL owners to vote against the decision to [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|move the original Browns team to Baltimore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shapiro |first1=Leonard |title=OWNERS APPROVE MOVE OF NFL TEAM TO BALTIMORE |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1996/02/10/owners-approve-move-of-nfl-team-to-baltimore/62005513-0215-46f0-9236-2eefbaae9583/ |website=WashingtonPost.com |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=September 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Denver Broncos====
The Browns had a brief rivalry with the [[Denver Broncos]] that arose from three AFC Championship Games from 1986 to 1989. In the 1986 AFC Championship, quarterback John Elway led [[The Drive]] to secure a tie in the waning moments at Cleveland Municipal Stadium; the Broncos went on to win in 23–20 in overtime. One year later, the two teams met again in the [[1986–87 NFL playoffs|1987 AFC Championship game]] at Mile High Stadium. Denver took a 21–3 lead, but Browns' quarterback Bernie Kosar threw four touchdown passes to tie the game at 31–31 halfway through the 4th quarter. After a long drive, John Elway threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to running back Sammy Winder to give Denver a 38–31 lead. Cleveland advanced to Denver's 8-yard line with 1:12 left, but Broncos' safety Jeremiah Castille stripped Browns' running back Earnest Byner of the football at the 2-yard line—a play that has been called [[The Fumble]] by Browns' fans. The Broncos recovered it, gave Cleveland an intentional safety, and went on to win 38–33. The two teams met yet again in the 1989 AFC Championship at Mile High Stadium, which the Broncos easily won by a score of 37–21.

==Fan base==
A 2006 study conducted by ''Bizjournal'' determined that Browns [[fan (person)|fans]] are the most loyal fans in the NFL. The study, while not [[scientific]], was largely based on fan loyalty during winning and losing seasons, attendance at games, and challenges confronting fans (such as inclement weather or long-term poor performance of their team).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14686579/ |title=Cleveland No. 1 in NFL fan loyalty - NFL- nbcsports.msnbc.com |publisher=Msnbc.msn.com |accessdate=December 13, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211031008/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14686579 |archivedate=February 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study noted that Browns fans filled 99.8% of the seats at Cleveland Browns Stadium during the last seven seasons, despite a combined record of 36-76 over that span.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/specials/slideshow/13.html |title=NFL Fan Support Rankings |publisher=Bizjournals.com |accessdate=December 13, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229063926/http://www.bizjournals.com/specials/slideshow/13.html |archivedate=February 29, 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dawg Pound===
{{main|Dawg Pound}}
Perhaps the most visible Browns fans are those that can be found in the [[Dawg Pound]]. Originally the name for the bleacher section located in the open (east) end of old [[Cleveland Stadium|Cleveland Municipal Stadium]], the current incarnation is likewise located in the east end of [[FirstEnergy Stadium (Cleveland)|FirstEnergy Stadium]] and still features hundreds of orange and brown clad fans sporting various canine-related paraphernalia. The fans adopted that name in 1984 after members of the Browns defense used it to describe the team's defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;pfojix&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/browns/2006-02-16-dawg-pound_x.htm|title=Judge finds nobody beats out Cleveland for 'Dawg Pound'|work=Usatoday.com|publisher=Gannett Company|date=February 16, 2006|accessdate=December 13, 2008|first=Larry|last=Newmeister}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retired cornerback [[Hanford Dixon]], who played his entire career for the Browns (1981–1989), is credited with naming the Cleveland Browns defense 'The Dawgs' in the mid-1980s. Dixon and teammates Frank Minnifield and Eddie Johnson would bark at each other and to the fans in the bleachers at the Cleveland Stadium to fire them up. It was from Dixon's naming that the ''Dawg Pound'' subsequently took its title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/article.php?id=6887 |title=Cleveland Browns &amp;#124; Rookies get a history lesson |publisher=Clevelandbrowns.com |accessdate=December 13, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206075303/http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/article.php?id=6887 |archivedate=December 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fans adopted that name in the years after.&lt;ref name=&quot;pfojix&quot;/&gt; Due to this nickname, since the team's revival the Browns have used a bulldog as an alternate logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportslogos.net/logos/list_by_team/155/Cleveland_Browns/|title=Cleveland Browns Logos |publisher=Sportslogos.net |accessdate=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Browns Backers===
The most prominent organization of Browns fans is the ''Browns Backers Worldwide'' (BBW). The organization has approximately 305,000 members&lt;ref name=&quot;zprxmw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Browns Backers Worldwide|url=https://fans.clevelandbrowns.com|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=ClevelandBrowns.com|access-date=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Browns Backers clubs can be found in every major city in the United States, and in a number of military bases throughout the world, with the largest club being in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. In addition, the organization has a sizable foreign presence in places as far away as [[Egypt]], Australia, Japan, Sri Lanka, and [[McMurdo Station]] in [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Deneen|title=Lakewood Native Takes Browns Backers to South Pole|url=http://www.lakewoodobserver.com/read/2006/01/11/lakewood-native-takes-browns-backers-to|work=The Lakewood Observer|date=January 11, 2006|accessdate=November 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to The Official Fan Club of the Cleveland Browns, the two largest international fan clubs are in [[Alon Shvut]], West Bank and [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara]], Canada, with Alon Shvut having 129 members and Niagara having 310.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/fans/backers/results.php?id=INT |title=Cleveland Browns |publisher=Clevelandbrowns.com |accessdate=December 13, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206075318/http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/fans/backers/results.php?id=INT |archivedate=December 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cleveland Browns mascot Chomps with the National Guard.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Browns mascot Chomps (shown greeting [[U.S. National Guard]] members at [[FirstEnergy Stadium (Cleveland)|FirstEnergy Stadium]].)]]

Following former Browns owner Randy Lerner's acquisition of English [[Association football|soccer]] club [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], official Villa outlets started selling Cleveland Browns goods such as jerseys and NFL footballs. This has raised interest in England and strengthened the link between the two sporting clubs. Aston Villa supporters have set up an organization known as the [[Aston]] (Villa) Browns Backers of [[Birmingham]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Famous fans===
The Cleveland Browns were the favorite team of [[Elvis Presley]].&lt;ref&gt;June Moore (with assistance from Kathy Westmoreland): ''Kathy Westmoreland: Elvis' voice of an angel'', Ju'Mel Publishing, USA, Juni 2010, S. 159 / {{ISBN|978-0-9827845-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weeklyworldnews.com/headlines/5025/top-20-surprising-elvis-facts/|title= TOP 20 surprising Elvis Facts|publisher=Weeklyworldnews.com|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was because his friend [[Gene Hickerson]] - with whom he had played football in their common youth in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] - was contracted by the Browns in 1957 and played there during his entire career until 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcoughlin.wordpress.com/2011/10/24/gene-hickerson-elvis-took-his-calls/|title= Gene Hickerson: Elvis Took His Calls|publisher=Dan Coughlin|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also defender [[Bobby Franklin (American football)|Bobby Franklin]], who had played from 1960 to 1966 for the Browns, was a friend of Presley.

The Cleveland Browns have the fourth largest number of players enshrined in the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] with a total of 17 enshrined players elected based on their performance with the Browns, and nine more players or coaches elected who spent at least one year with the Browns franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hall of Famers by Franchise |work=Pro Football Hall of Fame |url=http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/teams.html |accessdate=April 2, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317093424/http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/teams.html |archivedate=March 17, 2007 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; No Browns players were inducted in the inaugural induction class of 1963. [[Otto Graham]] was the first Browns player to be enshrined as a member of the class of 1965, and the most recent Browns player to be included in the Pro Football Hall of Fame is [[Mac Speedie]], who was a member of the class of 2020. All of the Browns' Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees thus far have been from the pre-1996 incarnation; no members of the Hall of Fame played for the Browns after 1999.
