The '''Cessna Aircraft Company''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|s|n|ə|}}&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--taken from [[Clyde Cessna]], not independently checked--&gt;{{cite book |title=Duden Aussprachewörterbuch |edition=6 |year=2006 |publisher=Bibliographisches Institut &amp; F.A. Brockhaus AG |location=Mannheim |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an American [[general aviation]] [[aircraft manufacturing]] corporation headquartered in [[Wichita, Kansas]]. Best known for small, piston-powered aircraft, Cessna also produced [[business jet]]s. For many years the company was one of the highest-volume producers of general aviation aircraft in the world. The company was founded in 1927.  It was purchased by [[General Dynamics]] in 1985, then by [[Textron|Textron, Inc.]], in 1992. In March 2014, when Textron purchased the [[Beechcraft]] and [[Hawker Aircraft]] businesses, Cessna ceased operations as a subsidiary company and joined the others as one of the three distinct brands produced by [[Textron Aviation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Textron14March2014TextronCompletesAcquisitionOfBeechcraft&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Textron Completes Acquisition of Beechcraft|url=http://investor.textron.com/news/news-releases/press-release-details/2014/Textron-Completes-Acquisition-of-Beechcraft/default.aspx|location=Providence, RI|publisher=[[Textron]]|agency=[[Business Wire]]|date=March 14, 2014|access-date=March 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Clyde Cessna]], a farmer in [[Rago, Kansas]], built his own aircraft and flew it in June 1911.  He was the first person to do so between the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Cessna started his wood-and-fabric aircraft ventures in [[Enid, Oklahoma]], testing many of his early planes on the salt flats. When bankers in Enid refused to lend him more money to build his planes, he moved to [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EnidNewsCentennialSnapshot&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Centennial Snapshot|url=http://www.enidnews.com/news/local_news/centennial-snapshot/article_bc936555-7131-5a3d-a92a-31fb0c2241ce.html|accessdate=February 6, 2007|publisher=[[Enid News &amp; Eagle]]|date=January 25, 2007|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cessna Aircraft was formed when Clyde Cessna and [[Victor Roos]] became partners in the Cessna-Roos Aircraft Company in 1927. Roos resigned just one month into the partnership, selling back his interest to Cessna.&lt;ref name=&quot;FlyingApril1962CessnaSingle-Engine Fleet&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Schlaeger|first1=Gerald J.|date=April 1962|title=Cessna Single-Engine Fleet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W9hDaNOiAXEC|magazine=[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|volume=70|issue=4|page=34|issn=0015-4806|access-date=June 23, 2016|via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterward, Roos's name was dropped from the company name.&lt;ref name=&quot;CessnaHistory1927-1939&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Cessna History 1927–1939|url=http://cessna.com/CessnaHistory/His/History-1927-1939.html|url-status=dead|publisher=Cessna|accessdate=May 25, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227150253/http://cessna.com/CessnaHistory/His/History-1927-1939.html|archivedate=February 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cessna DC-6]] earned certification on the same day as the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash of 1929]], October 29, 1929.&lt;ref name=&quot;CessnaHistory1927-1939&quot;/&gt;

In 1932, the Cessna Aircraft Company closed its doors due to the [[Great Depression]].

However, the [[Cessna CR-3]] custom racer took its first flight in 1933. The plane won the 1933 American Air Race in Chicago and later set a new world speed record for engines smaller than 500 cubic inches by averaging {{convert|237|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;CessnaHistory1927-1939&quot;/&gt;

Cessna's nephews, [[Dwane Wallace]] and his brother Dwight, bought the company from Cessna in 1934. They reopened it and began the process of building it into what would become a global success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillips&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Edward H.|title=Wings of Cessna: Model 120 to the Citation III|date=1986|publisher=Flying Books|isbn=0-911139-05-2|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cessna C-37]] was introduced in 1937 as Cessna's first seaplane when equipped with [[Edo Aircraft Corporation|Edo]] floats.&lt;ref name=&quot;CessnaHistory1927-1939&quot;/&gt; In 1940, Cessna received their largest order to date, when they signed a contract with the U.S. Army for 33 specially equipped [[Cessna T-50]]s. Later in 1940, the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] placed an order for 180 T-50s.&lt;ref name=&quot;CessnaHistory1940-1949&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Cessna History 1940–1949|url=http://www.cessna.com/CessnaHistory/His/History-1940-1949.html|url-status=dead|publisher=Cessna|accessdate=May 25, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417202932/http://www.cessna.com/CessnaHistory/His/History-1940-1949.html|archivedate=April 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cessna returned to commercial production in 1946, after the revocation of wartime production restrictions (L-48), with the release of the [[Cessna 120|Model 120]] and [[Cessna 140|Model 140]]. The approach was to introduce a new line of all-metal aircraft that used production tools, dies and jigs rather than the hand-built process [[tube-and-fabric construction]] used before the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;CessnaHistory1940-1949&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FlyingAug1945ReturnOfThePrivatePlane&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Ross|first1=John C.|date=August 1945|title=Return of the Private Plane|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SnmI9wL9KPIC|department=Civil Aviation|magazine=[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|volume=37|issue=2|page=78|issn=0015-4806|access-date=June 23, 2016|via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cessna 140|Model 140]] was named by the US Flight Instructors Association as the &quot;Outstanding Plane of the Year&quot;, in 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;CessnaHistory1940-1949&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Cessna172-CatalinaTakeOff.JPG|thumb|right|[[Cessna 172]]]]
Cessna introduced the [[Cessna 172]] in 1956. It became the most produced airplane in history.&lt;ref name=&quot;CessnaHistory1950-1959&quot;/&gt;

In 1960, Cessna affiliated itself with [[Reims Aviation]] of [[Reims]], France.&lt;ref name=&quot;CessnaHistory1960-1969&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Cessna History 1960–1969|url=http://www.cessna.com/CessnaHistory/His/History-1960-1969.html|publisher=Cessna|accessdate=May 25, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318220824/http://www.cessna.com/CessnaHistory/His/History-1960-1969.html|archivedate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, Cessna produced its 50,000th airplane, a Cessna 172.&lt;ref name=&quot;CessnaHistory1960-1969&quot;/&gt;

Cessna's first business jet, the [[Cessna Citation I]], performed its maiden flight on September 15, 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;CessnaHistory1960-1969&quot;/&gt;

===Chinese production controversy===
[[File:Cessna 162 Skycatcher N5201K 1010.JPG|thumb|right|[[Cessna 162 Skycatcher]]]]
On November 27, 2007, Cessna announced the then-new [[Cessna 162]] would be built in the People's Republic of China by [[Shenyang Aircraft Corporation]], which is a subsidiary of the China Aviation Industry Corporation I (AVIC I), a Chinese [[Government-owned corporation|government-owned]] consortium of aircraft manufacturers. Cessna reported that the decision was made to save money and also that the company had no more plant capacity in the United States at the time. Cessna received much negative feedback for this decision, with complaints centering on the recent quality problems with Chinese production of other consumer products, China's human rights record, exporting of jobs, and China's less than friendly political relationship with the United States. The customer backlash surprised Cessna and resulted in a company public relations campaign. In early 2009, the company attracted further criticism for continuing plans to build the 162 in China while laying off large numbers of workers in the United States. In the end, the Cessna 162 was not a commercial success, and only a small number were delivered before production was cancelled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Textron27Nov2007CessnaChoosesChinasShenyangAircraft&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Cessna Chooses China's Shenyang Aircraft Corporation as Manufacturing Partner for Model 162 SkyCatcher|url=http://investor.textron.com/news/news-releases/press-release-details/2007/Brian-P-Allison-named-Vice-President--General-Manager-ROTHENBERGER-USA-/default.aspx|location=Beijing|publisher=[[Textron]]|date=November 27, 2007|access-date=April 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AVwebSkycatcherToBeMadeInChina&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Niles|first1=Russ|title=Skycatcher To Be Made in China|url=http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/Cessna_Skycatcher_MadeInChina_196672-1.html|accessdate=February 10, 2008|publisher=AVweb|date=November 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cessna7Dec2007MakingTheCaseForBuildingTheSkyCatcherInChina&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aniello|first1=Tom|title=Making the case for building the SkyCatcher in China|url=http://www.cessnaSkycatcher.com/home/124.html|website=Cessna SkyCatcher|publisher=Cessna|accessdate=April 21, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106070032/http://www.cessnaskycatcher.com/home/124.html|archivedate=January 6, 2008|date=December 7, 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AVwebGermanysRemosAircraftExpandingChallengesCessna&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grady|first1=Mary|title=Germany's Remos Aircraft Expanding, Challenges Cessna|url=http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/RemosAircraft_Germany_Expanding_ChallengesCessna_196872-1.html|accessdate=April 21, 2008|publisher=AVweb|date=January 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cessna7Dec2007MakingTheCaseForBuildingTheSkyCatcherInChina&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AVwebCessnaLayoffsContinue&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grady |first=Mary |url=http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/End-Of-The-Road-For-Skycatcher221429-1.html |title=End Of The Road For Skycatcher? |publisher=Avweb |date= |accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marsh |first=Alton K. |url=http://www.aopa.org/News-and-Video/All-News/2014/February/10/Skycatcher.aspx |title=Skycatcher reaches inglorious end |publisher=AOPA |date= |accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;scrapped&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/Cessna-Scraps-Unsold-Skycatchers-228208-1.html |title=Cessna Scraps Unsold Skycatchers|last=Kauh |first=Elaine |publisher=AVweb |date= December 15, 2016|accessdate=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008–2010 economic crisis===
The company's business suffered notably during the [[late-2000s recession]], laying off more than half its workforce between January 2009 and September 2010.

[[File:cessna 525 citationjet g-sfcj arp.jpg|thumb|[[Cessna CitationJet|Cessna 525 CitationJet]]]]
On November 4, 2008, Cessna's parent company, [[Textron]], indicated that [[Cessna Citation|Citation]] production would be reduced from the original 2009 target of 535 &quot;due to continued softening in the global economic environment&quot; and that this would result in an undetermined number of lay-offs at Cessna.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVwebCessnaSlowsCitationProductionCitingGlobalEconomy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grady|first1=Mary|title=Cessna Slows Citation Production, Citing Global Economy|url=http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/CessnaSlowsCitationProduction_CitingGlobalEconomy_199121-1.html|accessdate=November 6, 2008|publisher=AVweb|date=November 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 8, 2008, at the [[Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association]] (AOPA) Expo, CEO [[Jack J. Pelton|Jack Pelton]] indicated that sales of Cessna aircraft to individual buyers had fallen, but piston and turboprop sales to businesses had not. &quot;While the economic slowdown has created a difficult business environment, we are encouraged by brisk activity from new and existing propeller fleet operators placing almost 200 orders for 2009 production aircraft,&quot; Pelton stated.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVwebItsABuyersMarket&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Niles|first1=Russ|title=It's A Buyer's Market|url=http://www.avweb.com/news/aopa/AOPAExpo2008_CessnaAircraft_BuyersMarket_199162-1.html|accessdate=November 8, 2008|publisher=AVweb|date=November 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KWCH04Nov08&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.kwch.com/Global/story.asp?S=9292651&amp;nav=menu486_2_3|title = Cessna Announces Possible Layoffs|accessdate = November 4, 2008|last = Durden|first = Chris|authorlink = |date=November 2008}}{{Dead link|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in January 2009, a total of 665 jobs were cut at Cessna's Wichita and [[Bend, Oregon]] plants. The Cessna factory at [[Independence, Kansas]], which builds the Cessna piston-engined aircraft and the [[Cessna Mustang]], did not see any layoffs, but one third of the workforce at the former [[Columbia Aircraft]] facility in Bend was laid off. This included 165 of the 460 employees who built the [[Cessna 350]] and [[Cessna 400|400]]. The remaining 500 jobs were eliminated at the main Cessna Wichita plant.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVwebEclipseMissesPayrollTVReport&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Niles|first1=Russ|title=Eclipse Misses Payroll: TV Report|url=http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/EclipseAviation_Misses_Payroll_TVreport_199202-1.html|accessdate=November 13, 2008|publisher=AVweb|date=November 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, the company laid off an additional 2,000 employees, bringing the total to 4,600. The job cuts included 120 at the Bend, Oregon, facility reducing the plant that built the Cessna 350 and 400 to fewer than half the number of workers that it had when Cessna bought it. Other cuts included 200 at the Independence, Kansas, plant that builds the single-engined Cessnas and the Mustang, reducing that facility to 1,300 workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVwebCessnaLayoffsContinue&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pew|first1=Glenn|title=Cessna Layoffs Continue|url=http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/cessna_layoff_wichita_textron_pelton_199682-1.html|accessdate=February 2, 2009|publisher=AVweb|date=January 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 29, 2009, the company suspended the [[Cessna Citation Columbus|Citation Columbus]] program and closed the Bend, Oregon, facility. The Columbus program was finally cancelled in early July 2009. The company reported, &quot;Upon additional analysis of the business jet market related to this product offering, we decided to formally cancel further development of the Citation Columbus&quot;. With the 350 and 400 production moving to Kansas, the company indicated that it would lay off 1,600 more workers, including the remaining 150 employees at the Bend plant and up to 700 workers from the Columbus program.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVwebCessnaWillSuspendColumbusProgramCloseBendFactory&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grady|first1=Mary|title=Cessna Will Suspend Columbus Program, Close Bend Factory|url=http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/CessnaWillSuspendColumbusProgramAndCloseBendFactory_200284-1.html|accessdate=April 30, 2009|publisher=AVweb|date=April 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AVwebGoodbyeColumbus-CessnaCancelsExtraLarge JetProgram&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grady|first1=Mary|title=Goodbye, Columbus–Cessna Cancels Extra-Large Jet Program|url=http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/CessnaCancelsExtraLargeColumbusJetProgram_200720-1.html|accessdate=July 16, 2009|publisher=AVweb|date=July 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early June 2009, Cessna laid off an additional 700 salaried employees, bringing the total number of lay-offs to 7,600, which was more than half the company's workers at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVwebMoreLayoffsAtCessna&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pew|first1=Glenn|title=More Layoffs At Cessna|url=http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/cessna_layoff_wichita_columbus_mustang_200511-1.html|accessdate=June 8, 2009|publisher=AVweb|date=June 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company closed its three [[Columbus, Georgia]], manufacturing facilities between June 2010 and December 2011. The closures included the new {{convert|100000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility that was opened in August 2008 at a cost of US$25M, plus the [[McCauley Propeller Systems]] plant. These closures resulted in total job losses of 600 in Georgia.

Cessna's parent company, Textron, posted a loss of US$8M in the first quarter of 2010, largely driven by continuing low sales at Cessna, which were down 44%. Half of Cessna's workforce remained laid-off and CEO Jack Pelton stated that he expected the recovery to be long and slow.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVwebCessnaDeclinesSapTextronRevenues&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Niles|first1=Russ|title=Cessna Declines Sap Textron Revenues|url=http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/CessnaDeclinesSapsTextron_202461-1.html|accessdate=April 28, 2010|publisher=AVweb|date=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, a further 700 employees were laid off, bringing the total to 8,000 jobs lost. CEO Jack Pelton indicated this round of layoffs was due to a &quot;stalled [and] lackluster economy&quot; and noted that while the number of orders cancelled for jets had been decreasing new orders had not met expectations. Pelton added &quot;our strategy is to defend and protect our current markets while investing in products and services to secure our future, but we can do this only if we succeed in restructuring our processes and reducing our costs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AvWeb22Sep10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/CessnaToCut700Jobs_203322-1.html|title = Cessna To Cut 700 Jobs|accessdate = September 23, 2010|last = Grady|first = Mary|authorlink = |date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AVwebCessnaToCut700Jobs&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grady|first1=Mary|title=Cessna To Cut 700 Jobs|url=http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/CessnaToCut700Jobs_203322-1.html|accessdate=September 23, 2010|publisher=AVweb|date=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010s ===
On May 2, 2011, CEO [[Jack J. Pelton]] retired. The new CEO, Scott A. Ernest, started on May 31, 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;CessnanVolume26Issue22&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Meet New President and CEO Scott Ernest|url=http://www.cessna.com/MungoBlobs/166/391/CSN_06_08_11com.pdf|access-date=June 28, 2011|work=Cessnan|volume=26|issue=22|publisher=Cessna|date=June 8, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928053948/http://www.cessna.com/MungoBlobs/166/391/CSN_06_08_11com.pdf|archivedate=September 28, 2011|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ernest joined Textron after 29 years at [[General Electric]], where he had most recently served as vice president and general manager, global supply chain for [[GE Aviation]]. Ernest previously worked for Textron CEO Scott Donnelly when both worked at General Electric.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheWichitaEagleKansasNativeNamedCessnaCEO&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last1=McMillin|first1=Molly|title=Kansas native named Cessna CEO|url=http://www.kansas.com/news/business/aviation/article1065224.html|access-date=July 20, 2012|newspaper=[[The Wichita Eagle]]|date=June 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) proposed a [[United States dollar|US$]]2.4&amp;nbsp;million fine against the company for its failure to follow quality assurance requirements while producing fiberglass components at its plant in [[Chihuahua City|Chihuahua, Mexico]]. Excess humidity meant that the parts did not cure correctly and quality assurance did not detect the problems. The failure to follow procedures resulted in the delamination in flight of a {{Convert|7|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} section of one [[Cessna 400]]'s wing skin from the [[Spar (aeronautics)|spar]] while the aircraft was being flown by an FAA test pilot. The aircraft was landed safely. The FAA also discovered 82 other aircraft parts that had been incorrectly made and not detected by the company's quality assurance. The investigation resulted in an emergency [[Airworthiness Directive]] that affected 13 Cessna 400s.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVwebCorvalisWingPrompts$2.4MillionProposedFine&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Pew|first1=Glenn|title=Corvalis Wing Prompts $2.4 Million Proposed Fine|url=http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/cessna_corvalis_wing_composite_fine_FAA_205442-1.html|access-date=September 24, 2011|publisher=AVweb|date=September 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since March 2012, Cessna has been pursuing building business jets in China as part of a joint venture with [[Aviation Industry Corporation of China]] (AVIC). The company stated that it intends to eventually build all aircraft models in China, saying &quot;The agreements together pave the way for a range of business jets, utility single-engine turboprops and single-engine piston aircraft to be manufactured and certified in China.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AVwebCessnaWantsToBuildJetsInChina&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/Cessna_China_Business_Jets_206365-1.html|title=Cessna Wants To Build Jets In China|access-date = March 26, 2012|last=Niles|first=Russ|publisher=AVweb|date=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Textron23March2012CessnaAndAVICJonForces&quot;&gt;{{Cite press release |author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line. --&gt; |title=Cessna and AVIC Join Forces to Develop General and Business Aviation in China|url=http://txtav.com/en/newsroom/2012/03/cessna-and-avic-join-forces-to-develop-general-and-business-aviation-in-china|location=Beijing|publisher=[[Textron Aviation]]|date=March 23, 2012|access-date=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late April 2012, the company added 150 workers in Wichita as a result of anticipated increased demand for aircraft production. Overall, they have cut more than 6000 jobs in the Wichita plant since 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVwebCessnaAdds150JobsInWichita&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Grady|first1=Mary|title=Cessna Adds 150 Jobs In Wichita|url=http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/CessnaAdds150JobsInWichita_206615-1.html|access-date=May 3, 2012|publisher=AVweb|date=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Cessna ceased operations as a company and instead became a brand of [[Textron Aviation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Textron14March2014TextronCompletesAcquisitionOfBeechcraft&quot; /&gt;

==Marketing initiatives==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cessna 172]] --&gt;
During the 1950s and 1960s, Cessna's marketing department followed the lead of Detroit automakers and came up with many unique marketing terms in an effort to differentiate its product line from their competitions'.

Other manufacturers and the aviation press widely ridiculed and spoofed many of the marketing terms, but Cessna built and sold more aircraft than any other manufacturer during the boom years of the 1960s and 1970s.

Generally, the names of Cessna models do not follow a theme, but there is logic to the numbering: the 100 series are the light singles, the 200s are the heftier, the 300s are light to medium twins, the 400s have “wide oval” cabin-class accommodation, and the 500s are jets. Many Cessna models have names starting with C for the sake of [[alliteration]] (e.g. Citation, Crusader, Chancellor).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moll|first=Nigel|date=April 1981|title=Name of the game: Would a Piper Aztec by any other name—say, “Piper Penobscot”—fly just as sweet?|url=|journal=Flying Magazine|volume=108|number=4|pages=58|issn=0015-4806|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Company terminology===
Cessna marketing terminology includes:

*'''Para-Lift Flaps''' – Large [[Fowler flaps]] Cessna introduced on the [[Cessna 170|170]]B in 1952, replacing the narrow chord plain flaps then in use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clarke&quot;&gt;Clarke, Bill: ''Cessna 150 and 152'' first edition, pages 5–17. TAB Books, 1987. {{ISBN|0-8306-9022-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Land-O-Matic''' – In 1956, Cessna introduced sprung-steel [[tricycle landing gear]] on the 172. The marketing department chose “Land-O-Matic” to imply that these aircraft were much easier to land and take off than the preceding [[conventional landing gear]] equipped Cessna 170. They even went as far as to say pilots could do “drive-up take-offs and drive-in landings”, implying that flying these aircraft was as easy as driving a car. In later years, some Cessna models had their steel sprung landing gear replaced with steel tube gear legs. The [[Cessna 206|206]] retains the original spring steel landing gear today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clarke&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Cessna 150E (C-GFAU).jpg|thumb|right|A 1965 [[Cessna 150]] with &quot;omni-vision&quot; rear windows]]
*'''Omni-Vision''' – The rear windows on some Cessna singles, starting with the [[Cessna 182|182]] and [[Cessna 210|210]] in 1962, the [[Cessna 172|172]] in 1963 and the [[Cessna 150|150]] in 1964. The term was intended to make the pilot feel visibility was improved on the notably poor-visibility Cessna line. The introduction of the rear window caused in most models a loss of cruise speed due to the extra drag, while not adding any useful visibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clarke&quot; /&gt;
*'''Cushioned Power''' – The rubber mounts on the cowling of the 1967 model 150, in addition to the rubber mounts isolating the engine from the cabin.
*'''Omni-Flash''' – The flashing beacon on the tip of the fin that could be seen all around.
*'''Open-View''' – This referred to the removal of the top section of the control wheel in 1967 models. These had been rectangular, they now became “ram’s horn” shaped, thus not blocking the instrument panel as much.
*'''Quick-Scan''' – Cessna introduced a new instrument panel layout in the 1960s and this buzzword was to indicate Cessna’s panels were ahead of the competition.
*'''Nav-O-Matic''' – The name of the Cessna autopilot system, which implied the system was relatively simple.
*'''Camber-Lift''' – A marketing name used to describe Cessna aircraft wings starting in 1972 when the aerodynamics designers at Cessna added a slightly drooped [[leading edge]] to the standard [[NACA airfoil|NACA 2412]] [[airfoil]] used on most of the light aircraft fleet. Writer Joe Christy described the name as &quot;stupid&quot; and added &quot;Is there any other kind [of lift]?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ChristyJ&quot;&gt;Christy, Joe: ''The Complete Guide to the Single Engine Cessnas – Third Edition'', page 119. TAB Books, 1979. {{ISBN|0-8306-2268-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Stabila-Tip''' – Cessna started commonly using wingtip [[fuel tanks]], carefully shaped for aerodynamic effect rather than being tubular-shaped. Tip tanks do have an advantage of reducing [[free surface effect]] of fuel affecting the balance of the aircraft in rolling manoeuvres.
