A '''cruise missile''' is a [[Missile|guided missile]] used against terrestrial targets, that remains in the atmosphere and flies the major portion of its flight path at approximately constant speed. Cruise missiles are designed to deliver a large [[warhead]] over long distances with high precision. Modern cruise missiles are capable of travelling at [[Supersonic speed|supersonic]] or high [[Aerodynamics#Incompressible aerodynamics|subsonic]] speeds, are self-navigating, and are able to fly on a non-[[Ballistics|ballistic]], extremely low-altitude trajectory.

== History ==
[[File:Fieseler Fi-103.jpg|thumb|A Fieseler Fi-103, the German [[V-1 flying bomb]]]]
The idea of an &quot;aerial torpedo&quot; was shown in the British 1909 film ''[[The Airship Destroyer]]'', where flying torpedoes controlled wirelessly are used to bring down airships bombing London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctie.monash.edu.au/hargrave/rpav_britain.html |title=Remote Piloted Aerial Vehicles : The 'Aerial Target' and 'Aerial Torpedo' in Britain |publisher=Ctie.monash.edu.au |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, American aviator [[Lawrence Sperry]] built and patented an &quot;aerial torpedo&quot;, the [[Hewitt-Sperry Automatic Airplane]], a small biplane carrying a TNT charge, a Sperry [[autopilot]] and a barometric altitude control. Inspired by these experiments, the United States Army developed a similar flying bomb called the [[Kettering Bug]]. Germany had also flown trials with remote-controlled aerial gliders ''(Torpedogleiter)'' built by Siemens-Schuckert beginning in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Branfill-Cook, &quot;Torpedo&quot;, Seaforth Publishing, Great Britain 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period between the World Wars the UK developed the [[RAE Larynx|Larynx (Long Range Gun with Lynx Engine)]], which underwent a few flight tests in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vectorsite.net/twcruz_1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813001620/http://www.vectorsite.net/twcruz_1.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 August 2007|title=[1.0] The Aerial Torpedo|date=13 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Soviet Union]], [[Sergei Korolev]] headed the [[Group for the Study of Reactive Motion|GIRD]]-06 cruise missile project from 1932 to 1939, which used a rocket-powered boost-[[glide bomb]] design. The 06/III (RP-216) and 06/IV (RP-212) contained gyroscopic guidance systems.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Object No. 212&quot;, 1936 report in _Tvorcheskoi Nasledie Akedemika Sergeya Pavlovicha Koroleva_&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle was designed to boost to 28&amp;nbsp;km altitude and glide a distance of 280&amp;nbsp;km, but test flights in 1934 and 1936 only reached an altitude of 500 meters.

In 1944, Germany deployed the first operational cruise missiles in [[World War II]]. The [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]], often called a [[flying bomb]], contained a [[gyroscope]] guidance system and was propelled by a simple [[pulsejet]] engine, the sound of which gave it the nickname of &quot;buzz bomb&quot; or &quot;doodlebug&quot;. Accuracy was sufficient only for use against very large targets (the general area of a city), while the range of 250&amp;nbsp;km was significantly lower than that of a bomber carrying the same payload. The main advantages were speed (although not sufficient to outperform contemporary propeller-driven interceptors) and expendability. The production cost of a V-1 was only a small fraction of that of a [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] [[Supersonic speed|supersonic]] [[ballistic missile]], carrying a similar-sized warhead.&lt;ref&gt;Both missiles were manufactured under the heavy use of [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|Nazi slave labour]].&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the V-2, the initial deployments of the V-1 required stationary launch ramps which were susceptible to bombardment. Nazi Germany, in 1943, also developed the [[Mistel]] [[composite aircraft]] program, which can be seen as a rudimentary air-launched cruise missile, where a piloted fighter-type aircraft was mounted atop an unpiloted bomber-sized aircraft that was packed with explosives to be released while approaching the target. Bomber-launched variants of the V-1 saw limited operational service near the end of the war, with the pioneering V-1's design reverse-engineered by the Americans as the [[Republic-Ford JB-2]] cruise missile.

Immediately after the war the [[United States Air Force]] had 21 different guided missile projects, including would-be cruise missiles.  All but four were cancelled by 1948,&amp;nbsp;â€” the [[Air Materiel Command]] [[BANSHEE]], the [[SM-62 Snark]], the [[SM-64 Navaho]], and the [[MGM-1 Matador]]. The BANSHEE design was similar to [[Operation Aphrodite]]; like Aphrodite, it failed, and was cancelled in April 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&amp;verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA162646 The Evolution of the Cruise Missile by Werrell, Kenneth P.] see PDF page 92 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304213844/http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&amp;verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA162646 |date=4 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, the US Navy's Operation: BUMBLEBEE, was conducted at Topsail Island, North Carolina, from c. 1 June 1946, to 28 July 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[[Operation Bumblebee]]{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operation: BUMBLEBEE produced proof-of-concept technologies that influenced the US military's other missile projects.

During the [[Cold War]] period both the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] experimented further with the concept, deploying early cruise missiles from land, submarines and aircraft. The main outcome of the United States Navy submarine missile project was the [[SSM-N-8 Regulus]] missile, based upon the V-1.

The United States Air Force's first operational surface-to-surface missile was the winged, mobile, nuclear-capable [[MGM-1 Matador]], also similar in concept to the V-1. Deployment overseas began in 1954, first to West Germany and later to the Republic of China (Taiwan) and South Korea. On 7 November 1956, U.S. Air Force deployed Matador units in West Germany, whose missiles were capable of striking targets in the Warsaw Pact, from their fixed day-to-day sites to unannounced dispersed launch locations. This alert was in response to the crisis posed by the Soviet attack on Hungary which suppressed the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]].

Between 1957 and 1961 the United States followed an ambitious and well-funded program to develop a nuclear-powered cruise missile, [[Supersonic Low Altitude Missile]] (SLAM). It was designed to fly below the enemy's radar at speeds above [[Mach number|Mach]] 3 and carry [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bombs]] that it would drop along its path over enemy territory. Although the concept was proven sound and the 500 [[Watt#Megawatt|megawatt]] engine finished a successful test run in 1961, no airworthy device was ever completed. The project was finally abandoned in favor of [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]] development.

While [[ballistic missile]]s were the preferred weapons for land targets, heavy nuclear and [[conventional weapon]] tipped cruise missiles were seen by the USSR as a primary weapon to destroy United States naval [[carrier battle group]]s. Large submarines (for example, [[Echo-class submarine|Echo]] and [[Oscar-class submarine|Oscar]] classes) were developed to carry these weapons and shadow United States battle groups at sea, and large bombers (for example, [[Tupolev Tu-22M|Backfire]], [[Tupolev Tu-95|Bear]], and [[Tupolev Tu-160|Blackjack]] models) were equipped with the weapons in their air-launched cruise missile (ALCM) configuration.

==General design==
Cruise missiles generally consist of a [[guidance system]], payload, and [[aircraft propulsion]] system, housed in an [[airframe]] with small wings and [[empennage]] for flight control. Payloads usually consist of a conventional warhead or a [[Nuclear Weapon|nuclear warhead]]. Cruise missiles tend to be propelled by a [[jet engine]], [[turbofan]] engines being preferred due to their greater efficiency at low altitude and subsonic speed.

===Guidance systems===
{{Main|Missile guidance}}
Guidance systems also vary greatly. Low-cost systems use a [[radar altimeter]], barometric altimeter and [[clock]] to navigate a [[Digital data|digital]] strip [[map]]. More advanced systems use [[inertial guidance]], [[satellite guidance]] and [[TERCOM|terrain contour matching (TERCOM)]]. Use of an [[automatic target recognition|automatic target recognition (ATR)]] algorithm/device in the guidance system increases accuracy of the missile. The [[Standoff Land Attack Missile]] features an ATR unit from [[General Electric]].

==Categories==
Cruise missiles can be categorized by size, speed (subsonic or supersonic), and range, and whether launched from land, air, surface ship, or submarine. Often versions of the same missile are produced for different launch platforms; sometimes air- and submarine-launched versions are a little lighter and smaller than land- and ship-launched versions.

Guidance systems can vary across missiles. Some missiles can be fitted with any of a variety of navigation systems ([[Inertial navigation]], [[TERCOM]], or [[satellite navigation]]). Larger cruise missiles can carry either a conventional or a nuclear warhead, while smaller ones carry only conventional warheads.

===Hypersonic===
{{redirect|Hypersonic Missiles|the Sam Fender album|Hypersonic Missiles (album)}}
A [[hypersonic flight|hypersonic speed]] cruise missile would travel at least five times the [[speed of sound]] ([[Mach number|Mach]] 5).

[[File:AGM-129A - 2006 0306 b52 2lg.jpg|thumb|right|[[AGM-129 ACM]] being secured on a [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52H bomber]]]]
The most common mission for cruise missiles is to attack relatively high-value targets such as ships, command bunkers, bridges and dams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/products/tomahawk/|title=Raytheon: Tomahawk Cruise Missile|website=www.raytheon.com|access-date=2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern guidance systems permit accurate attacks.

{{Asof|2001}} the BGM-109 [[Tomahawk missile]] model has become a significant part of the United States naval arsenal. It gives ships and submarines an extremely accurate, long-range, conventional land attack weapon. Each costs about US$1.99 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/documents/defbudget/FY2017/FY2017_Weapons.pdf#page=63&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Tomahawk and the AGM-86 were used extensively during [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]]. On 7 April 2017, during the [[Timeline of the Syrian Civil War (Januaryâ€“April 2017)#April 2017|Syrian Civil War]], U.S. warships fired more than 50 cruise missiles into a Syrian air base in retaliation for a Syrian Sarin gas attack against a rebel stronghold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/de1b6e80a0cf4d84bca38835e9bb3310/US-hints-at-military-action-to-retaliate-against-Assad|title=US missiles blast Syria; Trump demands 'end the slaughter'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) deploys an air-launched cruise missile, the [[AGM-86 ALCM]]. The [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] is the exclusive delivery vehicle for the [[AGM-86]] and [[AGM-129 ACM]]. Both missile types are configurable for either conventional or nuclear warheads.

[[File:BRAHMOS Launcher.JPG|thumb|left|[[Indian Army]]'s BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles mounted on Mobile Autonomous Launchers (MAL).]]
The USAF adopted the AGM-86 for its bomber fleet while AGM-109 was adapted to launch from trucks and ships and adopted by the USAF and Navy. The truck-launched versions, and also the Pershing II and SS-20 Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles, were later destroyed under the bilateral INF (Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces) treaty with the USSR.

The British [[Royal Navy]] (RN) also operates cruise missiles, specifically the U.S.-made Tomahawk, used by the RN's nuclear submarine fleet. UK conventional warhead versions were first fired in combat by the RN in 1999, during the [[Kosovo War]] (the United States fired cruise missiles in 1991). The [[Royal Air Force]] uses the [[Storm Shadow]] cruise missile on its [[Tornado GR4]] aircraft. It is also used by France, where it is known as SCALP EG, and carried by the [[ArmÃ©e de l'Air]]'s [[Mirage 2000]] and [[Rafale]] aircraft.

India and Russia have jointly developed the supersonic cruise missile [[BrahMos]]. There are three versions of the Brahmos: ship/land-launched, air-launched and sub-launched. The ship/land-launched version were operational as of late 2007. The Brahmos has the capability to attack targets on land. Russia also continues to operate other cruise missiles: the [[SS-N-12 Sandbox]], [[SS-N-19 Shipwreck]], [[SS-N-22 Sunburn]] and [[Kh-35|SS-N-25 Switchblade]]. [[Germany]] and [[Spain]] operate the [[KEPD 350|Taurus missile]] while [[Pakistan]] has made the [[Babur missile]], a variant of the US [[Tomahawk missile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://missilethreat.csis.org/missile/hatf-7/ |title = Hatf 7 &quot;Babur&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]) have designed several cruise missile variants, such as the well-known [[C-802]], some of which are capable of carrying biological, chemical, nuclear, and conventional warheads.

Russia has [[Raduga Kh-55|Kh-55SM]] cruise missiles, with similar to United States' [[AGM-129 ACM|AGM-129]] range of 3000&amp;nbsp;km, but are able to carry a more powerful warhead of 200&amp;nbsp;kt. They are equipped with a [[TERCOM]] system which allows them to cruise at an altitude lower than 110 meters at subsonic speeds while obtaining a [[Circular error probable|CEP]] accuracy of 15 meters with an [[Inertial navigation system]]. They are air-launched from either [[Tupolev Tu-95]]s, [[Tupolev Tu-22M]]s, or [[Tupolev Tu-160]]s, each able to carry 16 for the Tu-95, 12 for the Tu-160, and 4 for the Tu-22M. A [[Stealth technology|stealth]] version of the missile, the Kh-101 is in development. It has similar qualities as the Kh-55, except that its range has been extended to 5,000&amp;nbsp;km, equipped with a 1,000&amp;nbsp;kg conventional warhead, and has stealth features which reduces its probability of intercept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/bomber/kh-101.htm |title=Kh-101 â€“ Russian and Soviet Nuclear Forces |publisher=Fas.org |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Soviet Union was attempting to develop cruise missiles. In this short time frame, the Soviet Union was working on nearly ten different types of cruise missiles. However, due to resources, most of the initial types of cruise missiles developed by the Soviet Union were Sea- Launched Cruise Missiles or Submarine-Launched Cruise Missiles ([[Submarine-launched cruise missile|SLCM]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s). The [[KSShch|SS-N-1]] cruise missile was developed to have different configurations to be fired from a submarine or a ship. However, as the time progressed, the Soviet Union began to work on air launched cruise missiles as well ([[Air-launched cruise missile|ALCM]]). These ACLM missiles were typically delivered via bombers designated as &quot;Blinders&quot; or &quot;Backfire&quot;. The missiles in this configuration were called the AS-1, and AS-2 with eventual new variants with more development time. The main purpose of Soviet-based cruise missiles was to have defense and offensive mechanisms against enemy ships; in other words most of the Soviet cruise missiles were anti-ship missiles. the 1980s the Soviet Union had developed an arsenal of cruise missiles nearing 600 platforms which consisted of land, sea, and air delivery systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arkin|first=William|date=May 1983|title=Soviet Cruise Missile Programs|journal=Arms Control Today|volume=13|issue=4|pages=3â€“4|jstor=23623103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Efficiency in modern warfare===
Currently cruise missiles are among the most expensive of single-use weapons, up to several million dollars apiece. One consequence of this is that its users face difficult choices in [[targeting (warfare)|target allocation]], to avoid expending the missiles on targets of low value. For instance, during [[Operation Enduring Freedom|the 2001 strikes on Afghanistan]] the United States attacked targets of very low monetary value with cruise missiles, which led many to question the efficiency of the weapon. However, proponents of the cruise missile counter that the same argument applies to other types of [[unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]s: they are cheaper than human pilots when total training and infrastructure costs are taken into account, not to mention the risk of loss of personnel. As demonstrated in [[Operation Odyssey Dawn|Libya in 2011]] and prior conflicts, cruise missiles are much more difficult to detect and intercept than other aerial assets (reduced radar cross-section, infrared and visual signature due to smaller size), suiting them to attacks against static air defense systems.
