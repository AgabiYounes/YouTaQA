A '''conditional proof''' is a [[formal proof|proof]] that takes the form of asserting a [[Material conditional|conditional]], and proving that the [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] of the conditional necessarily leads to the [[consequent]]. 

==Overview==
The assumed antecedent of a conditional proof is called the '''conditional proof assumption'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ('''CPA'''). Thus, the goal of a conditional proof is to demonstrate that if the CPA were true, then the desired conclusion [[Logical consequence|necessarily follows]]. The validity of a conditional proof does not require that the CPA be actually true, only that ''if it were true'' it would lead to the consequent.

Conditional proofs are of great importance in [[mathematics]]. Conditional proofs exist linking several otherwise unproven [[conjecture]]s, so that a proof of one conjecture may immediately imply the validity of several others. It can be much easier to show a proposition's truth to follow from another proposition than to prove it independently.

A famous network of conditional proofs is the [[NP-complete]] class of complexity theory. There is a [[List of NP-complete problems|large number]] of interesting tasks, and while it is not known if a polynomial-time solution exists for any of them, it is known that if such a solution exists for any of them, one exists for all of them. Similarly, the [[Riemann hypothesis]] has many consequences already proven.

== Symbolic logic ==
As an example of a conditional proof in [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], suppose we want to prove A → C (if A, then C) from the first two premises below:

{|
|-
|align=right| 1. || A → B&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || (&quot;If A, then B&quot;)
|-
|align=right| 2. || B → C || (&quot;If B, then C&quot;)
|-
|colspan=3| &lt;hr&gt;
|-
|align=right| 3. || A ||(conditional proof assumption, &quot;Suppose A is true&quot;)
|-
|align=right| 4. || B || (follows from lines 1 and 3, [[modus ponens]]; &quot;If A then B; A, therefore B&quot;)
|-
|align=right| 5. || C || (follows from lines 2 and 4, [[modus ponens]]; &quot;If B then C; B, therefore C&quot;)
|-
|align=right| 6. || A → C || (follows from lines 3–5, conditional proof; &quot;If A, then C&quot;)
|}
