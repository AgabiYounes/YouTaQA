==History==
[[File:Old Town House.GIF|thumb|left| Old Town House, 1790]]
The area that would become Concord was originally settled thousands of years ago by [[Abenaki]] Native Americans called the [[Pennacook]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyford&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyford|first=James|author2=Amos Hadley|author3=Howard F. Hill|author4=Benjamin A. Kimball|author5=Lyman D. Stevens|author6=John M.

The stream was also the transportation route for their [[birch bark]] canoes, which could travel from [[Lake Winnipesaukee]] to the Atlantic Ocean. The broad sweep of the Merrimack River valley [[floodplain]] provided good soil for farming [[bean]]s, [[gourd]]s, [[pumpkin]]s, [[melon]]s and [[maize]].

The area was first settled in 1659 as &quot;Penacook&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Concord, NH&quot; NHES. https://www.nhes.nh.gov/elmi/products/cp/profiles-htm/concord.htm&lt;/ref&gt; On January 17, 1725, the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], which then claimed territories west of the Merrimack River, granted the Concord area as the Plantation of Penacook.&lt;ref name=Lyford/&gt;{{rp|107}} It was settled between 1725 and 1727 by Captain Ebenezer Eastman and others from [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]]. On February 9, 1734, the town was incorporated as &quot;Rumford&quot;,&lt;ref name=Lyford/&gt;{{rp|147}} from which [[Benjamin Thompson|Sir Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford]] would take his title. It was renamed &quot;Concord&quot; in 1765 by Governor [[Benning Wentworth]] following a bitter boundary dispute between Rumford and the town of [[Bow, New Hampshire|Bow]]; the city name was meant to reflect the new concord, or harmony, between the disputant towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Jacob|title=Annals of the Town of Concord|publisher=Jacob B. Moore|year=1824|location=Concord, N.H.|pages=31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens displaced by the resulting border adjustment were given land elsewhere as compensation. In 1779, New Pennacook Plantation was granted to Timothy Walker, Jr. and his associates at what would be incorporated in 1800 as [[Rumford, Maine]], the site of Pennacook Falls.

Concord grew in prominence throughout the 18th century, and some of its earliest houses survive [[Concord Historic District|at the northern end of Main Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/AssetDetail/c0dfaee3-eae5-4738-b57b-4c10691b0158|title=National Register of Historic Places: Concord Historic District|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=February 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years following the [[American Revolution|Revolution]], Concord's central geographical location made it a logical choice for the state capital, particularly after Samuel Blodget in 1807 opened a [[canal]] and [[lock (water transport)|lock]] system to allow vessels passage around the [[Amoskeag Falls]] downriver, connecting Concord with [[Boston]] by way of the [[Middlesex Canal]]. In 1808, Concord was named the official seat of state government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyford&quot; /&gt;{{rp|324–326}} The 1819 [[New Hampshire State House|State House]] is the oldest capitol in the nation in which the state's legislative branches meet in their original chambers. The city would become noted for [[furniture]]-making and [[granite]] [[quarry]]ing. In 1828, Lewis Downing joined J. Stephens Abbot to form [[Abbot-Downing Company|Abbot and Downing]].&lt;ref name=Lyford/&gt;{{rp|339–340}} Their most famous product was their [[Concord coach]], widely used in the development of the [[American West]]. In the 19th century, Concord became a hub for the [[railroad]] industry, with Penacook a [[textile]] manufacturing center using [[hydropower|water power]] from the [[Contoocook River]]. Today, the city is a center for health care and several [[insurance company|insurance companies]].

Concord is located at {{coord|43|12|24|N|71|32|17|W|type:city}} (43.2070, −71.5371).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://msrmaps.com/map.aspx?t=2&amp;s=12&amp;lon=-71.538056&amp;lat=43.206667&amp;w=600&amp;h=400 | title = Topo Map: Concord, New Hampshire, United States 01 July 1985 | work = [[The National Map]] | publisher = [[U.S. Geological Survey]] | accessdate = 2008-06-09 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120317052325/http://msrmaps.com/map.aspx?t=2&amp;s=12&amp;lon=-71.538056&amp;lat=43.206667&amp;w=600&amp;h=400 | archive-date = 17 March 2012 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|174.8|sqkm|order=flip}}. {{convert|166.4|sqkm|order=flip}} of it is land and {{convert|8.4|sqkm|order=flip}} of it is water, comprising 4.79% of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2010&quot;/&gt; Concord is drained by the [[Merrimack River]]. [[Penacook Lake]] is in the west. The highest point in Concord is {{convert|860|ft}} above sea level on Oak Hill, just west of the hill's {{convert|970|ft|adj=on}} summit in neighboring [[Loudon, New Hampshire|Loudon]].

Concord lies fully within the Merrimack River [[Drainage basin|watershed]],&lt;ref name=watershed&gt;{{cite book |title=Water Use in New Hampshire: An Activities Guide for Teachers |url=http://nh.water.usgs.gov/Publications/nh.intro.html |last=Foster |first=Debra H. |author2=Batorfalvy, Tatianna N. |author3=Medalie, Laura |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior and U.S. Geological Survey |year=1995 |access-date=2007-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717004543/http://nh.water.usgs.gov/Publications/nh.intro.html |archive-date=2011-07-17 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is centered on the river, which runs from northwest to southeast through the city. Downtown is located on a low terrace to the west of the river, with residential neighborhoods climbing hills to the west and extending southwards towards the town of Bow. To the east of the Merrimack, atop a {{convert|100|ft|adj=on}} bluff, is a flat, sandy plain known as Concord Heights, which has seen most of the city's commercial development since 1960. The eastern boundary of Concord (with the town of [[Pembroke, New Hampshire|Pembroke]]) is formed by the [[Soucook River]], a tributary of the Merrimack. The [[Turkey River (New Hampshire)|Turkey River]] winds through the southwestern quarter of the city, passing through the campus of St. Paul's School before entering the Merrimack River in Bow. In the northern part of the city, the [[Contoocook River]] enters the Merrimack at the village of Penacook. Other village centers in the city include West Concord (actually north of downtown, on the west side of the Merrimack) and East Concord (also north of downtown, but on the east side of the Merrimack).

===Climate===
Concord, as with much of New England, is within the [[humid continental climate]] zone ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb''), with long, cold, snowy winters, very warm (and at times humid) summers, and relatively brief autumns and springs. In winter, successive storms deliver light to moderate snowfall amounts, contributing to the relatively reliable snow cover. In addition, lows reach at least {{convert|0|°F|0}} on an average 15 nights per year, and the city straddles the border between [[Hardiness zone|USDA Hardiness Zone]] 5b and 6a.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arborday.org/treeinfo/ZoneInfo.cfm?ZipCode=03301&amp;submit=Look+it+up%21 The Arbor Day Foundation]. Arborday.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-02.&lt;/ref&gt; However, thaws are frequent, with one to three days per month with {{convert|50|°F}}+ highs from December to February. Summer can bring stretches of humid conditions as well as thunderstorms, and there is an average of 12 days of {{convert|90|°F|0}}+ highs annually. The window for freezing temperatures on average begins on September 27 and expires on May 14.&lt;ref name = &quot;NWS Gray/Portland, ME (GYX)&quot;/&gt;

The monthly daily average temperature range from {{convert|20.6|°F|1}} in January to {{convert|70.0|°F|1}} in July. Temperature extremes have ranged from {{convert|−37|°F|0}} in February 1943 to {{convert|102|°F|0}} in July 1966.

The [[New Hampshire State House]], designed by architect Stuart Park and constructed between 1815 and 1818, is the oldest state house in which the legislature meets in its original chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nh.gov/nhdhr/publications/documents/state_house_history.pdf|title=State House History|publisher=nh.gov|accessdate=August 19, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006014218/https://www.nh.gov/nhdhr/publications/documents/state_house_history.pdf|archive-date=October 6, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was remodeled in 1866, and the third story and west wing were added in 1910.

Across from the State House is the [[Eagle Hotel (Concord, New Hampshire)|Eagle Hotel]] on Main Street, which has been a downtown landmark since its opening in 1827. [[U.S. President]]s [[Ulysses S.

Other well-known guests included [[Jefferson Davis]], [[Charles Lindbergh]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Richard M. Nixon]] (who carried New Hampshire in all three of his presidential bids), and [[Thomas E. Dewey]]. The hotel closed in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM1Q7R_Eagle_Hotel__Concord_NH|title=Eagle Hotel|publisher=waymarking.com|accessdate=July 23, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501122727/http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM1Q7R_Eagle_Hotel__Concord_NH|archive-date=May 1, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
