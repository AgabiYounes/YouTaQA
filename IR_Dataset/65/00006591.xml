'''Crete''' ({{lang-el|Κρήτη}}, ''{{transl|el|Kríti}}'' {{IPA-el|'kriti|}}; [[Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Κρήτη}}, ''Krḗtē'') is the largest and most populous of the [[Greek islands]], the [[List of islands by area|88th]] largest island in the world and the [[List of islands in the Mediterranean|fifth]] largest island in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], after [[Sicily]], [[Sardinia]], [[Cyprus]], and [[Corsica]]. It bounds the southern border of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean sea]]. Crete lies approximately {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the Greek mainland. It has an area of {{convert|8336|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} and a coastline of 1,046&amp;nbsp;km (650&amp;nbsp;mi).

Crete and a number of surrounding islands and islets constitute the region of Crete ({{lang-el|Περιφέρεια Κρήτης|links=no}}), the southernmost of the 13 [[Modern regions of Greece|top-level administrative units of Greece]]; the region is the fifth most populous region of Greece. Its capital and largest city is [[Heraklion]], located on the northern shore of the island. {{As of|2011}}, the region had a population of 623,065. The [[Dodecanese]] are located to the northeast of Crete, while the [[Cyclades]] are situated to the north, separated by the [[Sea of Crete]]. The [[Peloponnese]] is to the region's northwest.

Humans have inhabited the island since at least 130,000 years ago, during the [[Paleolithic]] age. Crete was the centre of [[Europe]]'s first advanced civilization, the [[Minoan Civilization|Minoans]], from 2700 to 1420 BC; the Minoan civilization was overrun by the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilization]] from mainland Greece. Later, Crete fell under Roman rule, and afterwards the [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Andalusia]]n [[Arabs]], the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]] successively ruled Crete. The Cretan people, who maintained a desire to join the Greek state, achieved independence from the Ottomans in 1898 as the [[Cretan State]] and became part of Greece in December 1913.

The island is mountainous, and its character is defined by a high mountain range crossing from west to east; the range of the [[Lefka Ori|White Mountains]] (Lefka Ori) contains Crete's highest point, [[Mount Ida (Crete)|Mount Ida]]. Crete forms a significant part of the economy and cultural heritage of Greece, while retaining its own local cultural traits (such as its own [[Mantinada|poetry]] and [[Cretan music|music]]). The [[Heraklion International Airport, &quot;Nikos Kazantzakis&quot;|Nikos Kazantzakis]] at [[Heraklion]] and the [[Chania International Airport|Daskalogiannis]] airport at [[Chania]] serve international travellers. The palace of [[Knossos]], a Bronze Age settlement and ancient Minoan city, lies in [[Heraklion]] in Crete.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ancient Crete&quot;&gt;[http://oxfordbibliographiesonline.com/display/id/obo-9780195389661-0071 Ancient Crete] Oxford Bibliographies Online: Classics&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The island is first referred to as ''Kaptara'' in texts from the [[Syria]]n city of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] dating from the 18th century BC,&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Lynn Budin, ''The Ancient Greeks: An Introduction'' (New York: Oxford UP, 2004), 42.&lt;/ref&gt; repeated later in [[Neo-Assyrian]] records and the [[Bible]] (''[[Caphtor]]''). It was also known in ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] as ''Keftiu'', strongly suggesting a similar [[Minoan civilisation|Minoan]] name for the island.&lt;ref&gt;O. Dickinson, ''The Aegean Bronze Age'' (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge UP, 1994), 241–244.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current name of Crete is thought to be first attested in [[Mycenaean Greek]] texts written in [[Linear B]], through the words ''ke-re-te'' (*''Krētes''; later Greek: {{lang|grc|Κρῆτες}}, plural of {{lang|grc|Κρής}}),&lt;ref&gt;Found on the [[Pylos|PY]] An 128 tablet.&lt;/ref&gt; ''ke-re-si-jo'' (*''Krēsijos''; later Greek: {{lang|grc|Κρήσιος}}),&lt;ref&gt;Found on the PY Ta 641 and PY Ta 709 tablets.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Cretan&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Linear B word ke-re-si-ji|website=Palaeolexicon. Word-study tool for ancient languages|url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/ShowWord.aspx?Id=16779}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|*krh/s|Κρής}}, {{LSJ|krhsi/ai|Κρήσιος s.v. κρησίαι|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Greek]], the name Crete ({{lang|grc|Κρήτη}}) first appears in [[Homer]]'s [[Odyssey]].&lt;ref&gt;Book 14, line 199; Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon''&lt;/ref&gt; Its etymology is unknown. In [[Classical Latin|Latin]], it became ''Creta''.

The original Arabic name of Crete was ''Iqrīṭiš'' ({{lang-ar|اقريطش}} &lt; {{lang|el|(της) Κρήτης)}}, but after the [[Emirate of Crete]]'s establishment of its new capital at {{lang|ar|ربض الخندق}} ''Rabḍ al-Ḫandaq'' (modern [[Iraklion]]), both the city and the island became known as {{lang|gkm|Χάνδαξ}} (''Chandax'') or {{lang|gkm|Χάνδακας}} (''Chandakas''), which gave Latin, Italian and Venetian ''Candia'', from which were derived French ''Candie'' and English ''Candy'' or ''Candia''. Under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], Crete was called ''Girit'' ({{lang|ota|كريت}}).

Crete is the largest island in Greece and the fifth largest island in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It is located in the southern part of the [[Aegean Sea]] separating the Aegean from the [[Libyan Sea]].

===Island morphology===

The island has an elongated shape: it spans {{convert|260|km|mi|abbr=on}} from east to west, is {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} at its widest point, and narrows to as little as {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} (close to [[Ierapetra]]). Crete covers an area of {{convert|8336|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, with a coastline of {{convert|1046|km|mi|abbr=on}}; to the north, it broaches the [[Sea of Crete]] ({{lang-el|Κρητικό Πέλαγος|links=no}}); to the south, the [[Libyan Sea]] ({{lang-el|links=no|Λιβυκό Πέλαγος}}); in the west, the [[Myrtoan Sea]], and toward the east the Karpathian Sea. It lies approximately {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the Greek mainland.

===Mountains and valleys===
&lt;!--Linked from [[:Category:Mountains of Crete]]--&gt;

Crete is mountainous, and its character is defined by a high mountain range crossing from west to east, formed by three different groups of mountains:
*The White Mountains or [[Lefka Ori]] {{convert|2454|m|ft|abbr=on}}
*The Idi Range ([[Psiloritis]] {{Coord|35.18|N|24.82|E|}} {{convert|2456|m|ft|abbr=on}}
*[[Mount Kedros|Kedros]] {{convert|1777|m|ft|abbr=on}}
*The [[Dikti|Dikti Mountains]] {{convert|2148|m|ft|abbr=on}}
*Thripti {{convert|1489|m|ft|abbr=on}}

These mountains lavish Crete with valleys, such as [[Amari Valley|Amari valley]], fertile plateaus, such as [[Lasithi Plateau|Lasithi plateau]], [[Omalos]] and [[Nidha]]; caves, such as [[Gourgouthakas]], [[Diktaion]], and [[Idaion]] (the birthplace of the ancient Greek god [[Zeus]]); and a number of gorges.

Mountains in Crete are the object of tremendous fascination both for locals and tourists. The mountains have been seen as a key feature of the island's distinctiveness especially since the time of Romantic travellers' writing. Contemporary Cretans distinguish between highlanders and lowlanders; the former often claim to reside in places affording a higher/better climatic but also moral environment. In keeping with the legacy of Romantic authors, the mountains are seen as having determined their residents' 'resistance' to past invaders which relates to the oft-encountered idea that highlanders are 'purer' in terms of less intermarriages with occupiers. For residents of mountainous areas, such as Sfakia in western Crete, the aridness and rockiness of the mountains is emphasised as an element of pride and is often compared to the alleged soft-soiled mountains of others parts of Greece or the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kalantzis |first1=Konstantinos |title=Tradition in the Frame: Photography, Power, and Imagination in Sfakia, Crete |date=2019 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-03713-8 |pages=23–58 |url=http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=809810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gorges, rivers and lakes===
The island has a number of gorges, such as the [[Samariá Gorge]], [[Imbros Gorge]], [[Kourtaliotiko Gorge]], [[Ha Gorge]], [[Platania Gorge]], the Gorge of the Dead (at [[Kato Zakros]], [[Sitia]]) and [[Richtis Gorge]] and (Richtis) waterfall at Exo Mouliana in [[Sitia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cretanbeaches.com/Gorges/Lassithi-gorges/kato-zakros-gorge-deads-gorge/ |title=Gorge of the Dead |publisher=Cretanbeaches.com |accessdate=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cretanbeaches.com/en/gorges-of-crete/gorges-in-lassithi-prefecture/641-richtis-gorge.html |title=Richtis gorge |publisher=Cretanbeaches.com |accessdate=13 September 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120731062158/http://www.cretanbeaches.com/en/gorges-of-crete/gorges-in-lassithi-prefecture/641-richtis-gorge.html |archive-date=31 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://candia.wordpress.com/photos/photo-2010/richtis-gorge-april-2010/ |title=Richtis beach and gorge |publisher=Candia.wordpress.com |date=20 April 2010 |accessdate=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldreviewer.com/travel-guides/canyon/richtis-gorge-and-waterfall/61078/ |title=Richtis gorge and waterfall |publisher=Worldreviewer.com |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rivers of Crete include the [[Ieropotamos River]], the Koiliaris, the Anapodiaris, the Almiros, the Giofyros, and Megas Potamos. There are only two freshwater lakes in Crete: Lake [[Kournas]] and Lake Agia, which are both in Chania regional unit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crete.tournet.gr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1155&amp;lang=en Photos of Agia Lake] Crete TOURnet.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lake Voulismeni]] at the coast, at Aghios Nikolaos, was formerly a freshwater lake but is now connected to the sea, in Lasithi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aghiosnikolaos.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=24&amp;Itemid=35 Lake Voulismeni] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720152021/http://www.aghiosnikolaos.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=24&amp;Itemid=35 |date=20 July 2011 }} aghiosnikolaos.eu&lt;/ref&gt; Lakes that were created by dams also exist in Crete. There are three: the lake of Aposelemis Dam, the lake of Potamos Dam, and the lake of Mpramiana Dam.

===Surrounding islands===
{{Main|List of Greek islands}}

A large number of islands, islets, and rocks hug the coast of Crete. Many are visited by tourists, some are only visited by [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] and [[biologist]]s. Some are [[Environmental protection|environmentally protected]]. A small sample of the islands includes:
*[[Gramvousa]] ([[Kissamos]], [[Chania]]) the pirate island opposite the Balo lagoon
*[[Elafonisi]] ([[Chania]]), which commemorates a shipwreck and an Ottoman massacre
*[[Chrysi (island)|Chrysi]] island ([[Ierapetra]], [[Lasithi]]), which hosts the largest natural [[Cedrus libani|Lebanon cedar]] forest in Europe
*[[Paximadia]] island (Agia Galini, [[Rethymno]]) where the god Apollo and the goddess Artemis were born
*The Venetian fort and leper colony at [[Spinalonga]] opposite the beach and shallow waters of [[Elounda]] ([[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Agios Nikolaos]], Lasithi)
*[[Dionysades]] islands which are in an environmentally protected region together the Palm Beach Forest of [[Vai (Crete)|Vai]] in the municipality of [[Sitia]], Lasithi

Off the south coast, the island of [[Gavdos]] is located {{convert|26|nmi|km|0}} south of [[Hora Sfakion]] and is the [[Extreme points of Europe|southernmost]] point of [[Europe]].

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Greece}}
Crete straddles two climatic zones, the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and the [[North African]], mainly falling within the former. As such, the climate in Crete is primarily [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]]. The atmosphere can be quite humid, depending on the proximity to the sea, while winter is fairly mild. Snowfall is common on the mountains between November and May, but rare in the low-lying areas. While some mountain tops are snow-capped for most of the year, near the coast snow only stays on the ground for a few minutes or hours. However, a truly exceptional cold snap swept the island in February 2004, during which period the whole island was blanketed with snow. During the Cretan summer, average temperatures reach the high 20s-low 30s Celsius (mid 80s to mid 90s Fahrenheit), with maxima touching the upper 30s-mid 40s.

The south coast, including the [[Mesara Plain]] and [[Asterousia Mountains]], falls in the [[North Africa]]n climatic zone, and thus enjoys significantly more sunny days and high temperatures throughout the year. There, [[date palm]]s bear fruit, and [[Swallow (bird)|swallows]] remain year-round rather than migrate to [[Africa]]. The fertile region around [[Ierapetra]], on the southeastern corner of the island, is renowned for its exceptional year-round agricultural production, with all kinds of summer vegetables and fruit produced in [[greenhouse]]s throughout the winter.&lt;ref&gt;Rackham, O. &amp; Moody, J., 1996.

Crete is the most populous island in Greece with a population of more than 600,000 people. Approximately 42% live in Crete's main cities and towns whilst 45% live in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KVYFI9NzLz0C&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=population+statistics+Crete&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Crete, p.44], by Victoria Kyriakopoulos.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crete with its nearby islands form the '''Crete Region''' ({{lang-el|Περιφέρεια Κρήτης}}, ''Periféria Krítis''), one of the 13 [[Modern regions of Greece|regions of Greece]] which were established in the 1987 administrative reform.&lt;ref&gt;Π.Δ. 51/87 &quot;Καθορισμός των Περιφερειών της Χώρας για το σχεδιασμό κ.λ.π. της Περιφερειακής Ανάπτυξης&quot; (''Determination of the Regions of the Country for the planning etc. of the development of the Region, [[Efimeris tis Kyverniseos|ΦΕΚ]] A 26/06.03.1987&lt;/ref&gt; Under the 2010 [[Kallikratis plan]], the powers and authority of the regions were redefined and extended. The region is based at [[Heraklion]] and is divided into four [[regional units of Greece|regional units]] (pre-Kallikratis [[prefectures of Greece|prefectures]]). From west to east these are: [[Chania (regional unit)|Chania]], [[Rethymno (regional unit)|Rethymno]], [[Heraklion (regional unit)|Heraklion]], and [[Lasithi]]. These are further subdivided into 24 [[Municipalities of Greece|municipalities]].

The region's governor is, since 1 January 2011, [[Stavros Arnaoutakis]], who was elected in the [[Greek local elections, 2010|November 2010 local administration elections]] for the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]].

===Economy===
{{further|Economy of Greece}}

The economy of Crete is predominantly based on services and tourism. However, agriculture also plays an important role and Crete is one of the few Greek islands that can support itself independently without a tourism industry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z3vxvYOZkj4C&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=economy+Crete&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=economy%20Crete&amp;f=false The rough guide to Crete, Introduction, p. ix] by J. Fisher and G. Garvey.&lt;/ref&gt; The economy began to change visibly during the 1970s as tourism gained in importance. Although an emphasis remains on agriculture and stock breeding, because of the climate and terrain of the island, there has been a drop in manufacturing, and an observable expansion in its service industries (mainly tourism-related). All three sectors of the Cretan economy (agriculture/farming, processing-packaging, services), are directly connected and interdependent. The island has a per capita income much higher than the Greek average, whereas unemployment is at approximately 4%, one-sixth of that of the country overall.

As in many regions of Greece, [[viticulture]] and [[olive]] groves are significant; [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]] and [[Greek citron|citrons]] are also cultivated. Until recently there were restrictions on the import of bananas to Greece, therefore bananas were grown on the island, predominantly in greenhouses. Dairy products are important to the local economy and there are a number of speciality cheeses such as [[mizithra]], [[anthotyros]], and [[kefalotyri]].

===Transport infrastructure===
[[File:Kreta - Europastraße75 2.jpg|thumb|[[European route E75]] near [[Heraklion]]]]

====Airports====
The island has three significant airports, [[Heraklion International Airport, &quot;Nikos Kazantzakis&quot;|Nikos Kazantzakis]] at [[Heraklion]], the [[Chania International Airport|Daskalogiannis]] airport at [[Chania]] and a [[Sitia Public Airport|smaller one]] in [[Sitia]]. The first two serve international routes, acting as the main gateways to the island for travellers.  There is a long-standing plan to replace Heraklion airport with a completely new airport at Kastelli, where there is presently an air force base.

====Ferries====
The island is well served by ferries, mostly from [[Athens]], by ferry companies such as [[Minoan Lines]] and [[ANEK Lines]].

====Road Network====
Although the road network leads almost everywhere, there is a lack of modern highways, although this is gradually changing with the completion of the northern coastal spine highway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/projects/greece/new-road-in-crete-set-to-improve-journey-times-and-safety|title=New road in Crete set to improve journey times and safety-Projects|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Railway====
Also, during the 1930s there was a narrow-gauge industrial railway in Heraklion, from Giofyros in the west side of the city to the port.  There are now no railway lines on Crete. The government is planning the construction of a line from Chania to Heraklion via Rethymno.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.gr&quot;&gt;Rackham, O. &amp; Moody, J., 1996.

===Development===
Newspapers have reported that the Ministry of Mercantile Marine is ready to support the agreement between Greece, [[South Korea]], [[Dubai Ports World]] and [[China]] for the construction of a large international [[container (cargo)|container]] port and [[free trade zone]] in southern Crete near [[Tympaki]]; the plan is to expropriate 850&amp;nbsp;ha of land. The port would handle 2&amp;nbsp;million containers per year, but the project has not been universally welcomed because of its environmental, economic and cultural impact.&lt;ref name=ncp&gt;[http://www.no-container-port-in-timbaki.net/facts_en.php No Container Transshipment Hub in Timbaki] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123131440/http://www.no-container-port-in-timbaki.net/facts_en.php |date=23 January 2007 }}. Retrieved 27 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2013, the project has still not been confirmed, although there is mounting pressure to approve it, arising from Greece's difficult economic situation.

There are plans for underwater cables going from mainland Greece to Israel and Egypt passing by Crete and Cyprus: [[EuroAfrica Interconnector]] and [[EuroAsia Interconnector]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EA&quot;&gt;[http://www.euroasia-interconnector.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/EuroAsia_Interconnector_Project_and_Progress_English.pdf EuroAsia Interconnector Project and Progress]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EAF&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.euroafrica-interconnector.com/|title=EuroAfrica Interconnector|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They would connect Crete electrically with mainland Greece, ending energy isolation of Crete.  Now Hellenic Republic covers for Crete electricity costs difference of around €300&amp;nbsp;million per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRE&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cretalive.gr/crete/hmerida-gia-thn-hlektrikh-diasyndesh-euroasia-interconnector-meso-ths-krhths|title=Η ηλεκτρική διασύνδεση EuroAsia Interconnector θα εξασφαλίσει ενεργειακά την Κρήτη|website=Cretalive|access-date=2019-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hominids settled in Crete at least 130,000 years ago. In the later Neolithic and Bronze Age periods, under the [[Minoan civilisation|Minoan]]s, Crete had a highly developed, literate civilisation. It has been ruled by various ancient Greek entities, the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Emirate of Crete]], the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. After a brief period of independence (1897–1913) under a provisional Cretan government, it joined the Kingdom of Greece. It was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] during the [[Second World War]].

===Prehistoric Crete===

In 2002, the paleontologist Gerard Gierlinski discovered fossil footprints left by ancient human relatives 5,600,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chung|first1=Emily|title=One hell of an impression|url=https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/longform/human-footprints-greece?cnis=4a3f54f1-23a4-4496-8e8e-1bd44571486b*C*1195*0*0*A|website=CBCnews|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minoan civilization===
{{Main|Minoan civilization}}
Crete was the centre of [[Europe]]'s first advanced civilization, the [[Minoan Civilization|Minoan]] ({{nowrap|c. 2700–1420 BC}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ancient Crete&quot;/&gt; This civilization wrote in the undeciphered script known as [[Linear A]]. Early [[Ancient Crete|Cretan]] history is replete with legends such as those of [[Minos|King Minos]], [[Theseus]] and the [[Minotaur]], passed on orally via poets such as [[Homer]]. The [[Minoan eruption|volcanic eruption]] of [[Thera]] may have been the cause of the downfall of the Minoan civilization.

===Mycenaean civilization===
{{Main|Mycenaean Greece}}
In 1420&amp;nbsp;BC, the Minoan civilization was overrun by the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilization]] from mainland Greece. The oldest samples of writing in the Greek language, as identified by [[Michael Ventris]], is the [[Linear B]] archive from Knossos, dated approximately to 1425–1375&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Cynthia|last=Shelmerdine|title=Where Do We Go From Here?

=== Archaic and Classical period ===

After the [[Bronze Age collapse]], Crete was settled by new waves of Greeks from the mainland. A number of city states developed in the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]]. There was very limited contact with mainland Greece, and [[Greek historiography]] shows little interest in Crete, and as a result, there are very few literary sources.

During the 6th to 4th centuries BC, Crete was comparatively free from warfare. The [[Gortyn code]] (5th century BC) is evidence for how codified [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] established a balance between aristocratic power and civil rights.

In the late 4th century BC, the aristocratic order began to collapse due to endemic infighting among the elite, and Crete's economy was weakened by prolonged wars between city states. During the 3rd century BC, [[Gortyn]], Kydonia ([[Chania]]), [[Lyctus|Lyttos]] and [[Polyrrhenia]] challenged the primacy of ancient Knossos.

While the cities continued to prey upon one another, they invited into their feuds mainland powers like [[Macedon]] and its rivals [[Rhodes]] and [[Ptolemaic Egypt]]. In 220 BC the island was tormented by a [[Lyttian War|war between two opposing coalitions of cities]]. As a result, the Macedonian king [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] gained [[hegemony]] over Crete which lasted to the end of the [[Cretan War (205–200 BC)]], when the [[Rhodes|Rhodians]] opposed the rise of Macedon and the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] started to interfere in Cretan affairs.

In the 2nd century BC Ierapytna ([[Ierapetra]]) gained supremacy on eastern Crete.

===Roman rule===
{{Main|Crete and Cyrenaica}}
Crete was involved in the [[Mithridatic Wars]], initially repelling an attack by Roman general [[Marcus Antonius Creticus]] in 71&amp;nbsp;BC. Nevertheless, a ferocious three-year campaign soon followed under [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Creticus (died 55&amp;nbsp;BC)|Quintus Caecilius Metellus]], equipped with three legions and Crete was finally conquered by Rome in 69&amp;nbsp;BC, earning for Metellus the title &quot;''Creticus''&quot;. [[Gortyn]] was made capital of the island, and Crete became a Roman province, along with [[Cyrenaica]] that was called [[Creta et Cyrenaica]]. Archaeological remains suggest that Crete under Roman rule witnessed prosperity and increased connectivity with other parts of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jane Francis and Anna Kouremenos |title=Roman Crete: New Perspectives |date=2016 |publisher=Oxbow |location=Oxford |isbn=978-1785700958}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2nd century AD, at least three cities in Crete (Lyttos, Gortyn, Hierapytna) joined the Panhellenion, a league of Greek cities founded by the emperor Hadrian. When Diocletian redivided the Empire, Crete was placed, along with Cyrene, under the diocese of Moesia, and later by Constantine I to the diocese of Macedonia.

===Byzantine Empire – first period===
{{Main|Byzantine Crete}}

[[File:Crete MoniArkadiou1 tango7174.jpg|thumb|[[Arkadi Monastery]]]]

Crete was separated from Cyrenaica {{circa|297}}. It remained a province within the eastern half of the Roman Empire, usually referred to as the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire after the establishment of a second capital in Constantinople by Constantine in 330. Crete was subjected to an attack by [[Vandals]] in 467, the great earthquakes of [[365 Crete earthquake|365]] and 415, a raid by [[Slavs]] in 623, Arab raids in 654 and the 670s, and again in the 8th century. In {{circa|732}}, the Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian]] transferred the island from the jurisdiction of the [[Pope]] to that of the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODB546&quot;&gt;Kazhdan (1991), p. 546&lt;/ref&gt;

===Andalusian Arab rule===

{{Main|Emirate of Crete}}

In the 820s, after 900 years as a Roman, and then Eastern Roman (Byzantine) island, Crete was captured by [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] [[Muladi]]s led by [[Abu Hafs (pirate)|Abu Hafs]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Iberia&quot;&gt;Reinhart Dozy, ''Histoire des Musulmans d'Espagne: jusqu'à la conquête de l'Andalousie par les Almoravides'' (French) pg. 711–1110, Leiden, 1861 &amp; 1881, 2nd edition&lt;/ref&gt; who established the [[Emirate of Crete]]. The Byzantines launched a campaign that took most of the island back in 842 and 843 under [[Theoktistos]]. Further Byzantine campaigns in 911 and 949 failed. In 960/1, [[Nikephoros II|Nikephoros Phokas]]' [[Siege of Chandax|campaign]] completely restored Crete to the Byzantine Empire, after a century and a half of Arab control.

===Byzantine Empire – second period===
{{Main|Byzantine Crete}}

In 961, [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nikephoros Phokas]] returned the island to Byzantine rule after expelling the Arabs.&lt;ref name=intro&gt;Panagiotakis, Introduction, p. XVI.&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive efforts at conversion of the populace were undertaken, led by [[John Xenos]] and [[Nikon the Metanoeite|Nikon &quot;the Metanoeite&quot;]].{{sfn|ODB|loc=&quot;Crete&quot; (T. E. Gregory, A. Kazhdan), pp. 545–546}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=495}} The reconquest of Crete was a major achievement for the Byzantines, as it restored Byzantine control over the Aegean littoral and diminished the threat of [[Saracen]] pirates, for which Crete had provided a base of operations.

In 1204, the [[Fourth Crusade]] seized and sacked the imperial capital of [[Constantinople]].  Crete was initially granted to leading Crusader [[Boniface of Montferrat]]&lt;ref name=intro/&gt; in the partition of spoils that followed. However, Boniface sold his claim to the [[Republic of Venice]],&lt;ref name=intro/&gt; whose forces made up the majority of the Crusade. Venice's rival the [[Republic of Genoa]] immediately seized the island and it was not until 1212 that Venice secured Crete as a colony.

===Venetian rule===

From 1212, during [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]'s rule, which lasted more than four centuries, a [[Renaissance]] swept through the island as is evident from the plethora of artistic works dating to that period. Known as [[The Cretan School]] or [[Post-Byzantine Art]], it is among the last flowerings of the artistic traditions of the fallen empire.  The most notable representatives of this Cretan renaissance were the painter [[El Greco]] and the writers [[Nicholas Kalliakis]] (1645–1707), [[Georgios Kalafatis (professor)]] ({{circa|1652}}–1720), [[Andreas Musalus]] ({{circa|1665}}–1721) and [[Vitsentzos Kornaros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Tiepolo, Maria Francesca |author2=Tonetti, Eurigio |title=I greci a Venezia| publisher=Istituto veneto di scienze|year=2002|page=201|isbn=978-88-88143-07-1 |quote= Cretese Nikolaos Kalliakis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot; Boehm, Eric H. 1995 755 &quot;&gt;{{cite book | author= Boehm, Eric H. |title= Historical abstracts: Modern history abstracts, 1450–1914, Volume 46, Issues 3–4 |publisher= American Bibliographical Center of ABC-Clio |year= 1995 |page=755 |oclc= 701679973 |quote= Between the 15th and 19th centuries the University of Padua attracted a great number of Greek students who wanted to study medicine.

Under the rule of the [[Catholic]] [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], the city of [[Heraklion|Candia]] was reputed to be the best fortified city of the [[Eastern Mediterranean]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Greene&quot;&gt;M.

According to Starr's 1942 article, the rule of Giacomo Foscarini was a Dark Age for Jews and Greeks. Under his rule, non-Catholics had to pay high taxes with no allowances. In 1627, there were 800 Jews in the city of [[Herakleion|Candia]], about seven percent of the city's population.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, J.

The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] [[Cretan War (1645–1669)|conquered Crete]] in 1669, after the [[siege of Candia]]. Many Greek Cretans fled to other regions of the [[Republic of Venice]] after the [[Ottoman–Venetian Wars]], some even prospering such as the family of [[Simone Stratigo]] (c. 1733 – c. 1824) who migrated to [[Dalmatia]] from Crete in 1669.&lt;ref name=&quot; Carlo Capra, Franco Della Peruta, Fernando Mazzocca 2002 pp.200&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Carlo Capra |author2=Franco Della Peruta |author3=Fernando Mazzocca |title= Napoleone e la repubblica italiana: 1802–1805 |publisher= Skira |year= 2002 |page=200 |isbn=978-88-8491-415-6 |quote= Simone Stratico, nato a Zara nel 1733 da famiglia originaria di Creta (abbandonata a seguito della conquista turca del 1669)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islamic]] presence on the island, aside from the interlude of the [[Emirate of Crete|Arab occupation]], was cemented by the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman conquest]]. Most [[Cretan Muslims]] were local Greek converts who spoke Cretan [[Greek language|Greek]], but in the island's 19th-century political context they came to be viewed by the Christian population as Turks.&lt;ref&gt;Demetres Tziovas, ''Greece and the Balkans: Identities, Perceptions and Cultural Encounters Since the Enlightenment''; William Yale, ''The Near East: A modern history'' Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1958)&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary estimates vary, but on the eve of the [[Greek War of Independence]] (1830), as much as 45% of the population of the island may have been Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;William Yale, ''The Near East: A modern history'' by (Ann Arbor, The University of Michigan Press, 1958)&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[Sufi]] orders were widespread throughout the island, the [[Bektashi]] order being the most prevalent, possessing at least five [[tekkes]]. Many among them were [[crypto-Christians]] who converted back to Christianity in subsequent years, while many [[Cretan Turks]] fled Crete because of the unrest, settling in Turkey, Rhodes, Syria, Libya and elsewhere. By 1900, 11% of the population was Muslim. Those remaining were relocated in the 1924 [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.holidaytrust.nl/s/griekenland/kreta/|title=Vakantie Kreta – De beste Tips &amp; Reviews {{!}} Holidaytrust.nl|language=nl|access-date=2019-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Easter of 1770, a notable revolt against Ottoman rule, in Crete, was started by [[Daskalogiannis]], a shipowner from [[Sfakia]] who was promised support by [[Orlov Revolt|Orlov's fleet]] which never arrived. Daskalogiannis eventually surrendered to the Ottoman authorities. Today, the airport at Chania is named after him.

Crete was left out of the modern Greek state by the [[London Protocol of 1830]], and soon it was yielded to [[Egypt]] by the Ottoman [[sultan]]. Egyptian rule was short-lived and sovereignty was returned to the Ottoman Empire by the [[Convention of London (1840)|Convention of London]] on 3 July 1840.

Heraklion was surrounded by high walls and bastions and extended westward and southward by the 17th century. The most opulent area of the city was the northeastern quadrant where all the elite were gathered together. The city had received another name under the rule of the Ottomans, &quot;the deserted city&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greene&quot;/&gt; The urban policy that the Ottoman applied to Candia was a two-pronged approach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greene&quot;/&gt; The first was the religious endowments. It made the Ottoman elite contribute to building and rehabilitating the ruined city. The other method was to boost the population and the urban revenue by selling off urban properties. According to Molly Greene (2001) there were numerous records of [[real-estate]] transactions during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. In the deserted city, minorities received equal rights in purchasing property. Christians and Jews were also able to buy and sell in the real-estate market.

The [[Cretan Revolt (1866–69)|Cretan Revolt of 1866–1869]] or Great Cretan Revolution ({{lang-el|links=no|Κρητική Επανάσταση του 1866}}) was a three-year uprising against Ottoman rule, the third and largest in a series of revolts between the end of the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1830 and the establishment of the independent Cretan State in 1898. A particular event which caused strong reactions among the liberal circles of western Europe was the ''Holocaust of Arkadi''. The event occurred in November 1866, as a large Ottoman force besieged the [[Arkadi Monastery]], which served as the headquarters of the rebellion. In addition to its 259 defenders, over 700 women and children had taken refuge in the monastery. After a few days of hard fighting, the Ottomans broke into the monastery. At that point, the abbot of the monastery set fire to the gunpowder stored in the monastery's vaults, causing the death of most of the rebels and the women and children sheltered there.

Following the repeated uprisings in 1841, 1858, 1889, 1895 and 1897 by the Cretan people, who wanted to join Greece, the [[Great powers#History|Great Powers]] decided to restore order and in February 1897 sent in troops. The island was subsequently garrisoned by troops from Great Britain, France, Italy and Russia; Germany and Austro-Hungary withdrawing from the occupation in early 1898. During this period Crete was governed through a committee of admirals from the remaining four Powers. In March 1898 the Powers decreed, with the very reluctant consent of the Sultan, that the island would be granted autonomy under Ottoman [[suzerainty]] in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;Pinar Senisik, ''The Transformation of Ottoman Crete, Revolts, Politics and Identity in the Late Nineteenth century'' p. 165. I. B. Tauris, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1898 an outbreak of rioting in Candia, modern Heraklion, left over 500 Cretan Christians, and 14 British servicemen, dead. As a result, the Admirals ordered the expulsion of all Ottoman troops and administrators from the island, a move that was ultimately completed by early November. The decision to grant autonomy to the island was enforced and a High Commissioner, [[Prince George of Greece]], appointed, arriving to take up his post in December 1898.&lt;ref name=Holland&gt;Robert Holland and Diane Markides, ''The British and the Hellenes: Struggles for Mastery in the Eastern Mediterranean 1850–1960''. p. 81. Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The flag of the [[Cretan State]] was chosen by the Powers, with the white star representing the Ottoman suzenraity over the island.

In 1905, disagreements between Prince George and minister Eleftherios Venizelos 
over the question of the ''enosis'' (union with Greece), such as the Prince's autocratic style of government, resulted in the [[Theriso revolt]], one of leaders of which being [[Eleftherios Venizelos]].

Prince George resigned as High Commissioner and was replaced by [[Alexandros Zaimis]], a former Greek prime minister, in 1906. In 1908, taking advantage of domestic turmoil in Turkey as well as the timing of Zaimis's vacation away from the island, the Cretan deputies unilaterally declared union with Greece.

With the break out of the [[First Balkan War]], the Greek government declared that Crete was since then part of the Greek territory. This was not recognised internationally until 1 December 1913.&lt;ref name=Holland/&gt;

{{Main|Battle of Crete|Cretan resistance}}

During [[World War II]], the island was the scene of the famous [[Battle of Crete]] in May 1941. The initial 11-day battle was bloody and left more than 11,000 soldiers and civilians killed or wounded. As a result of the fierce resistance from both Allied forces and civilian Cretan locals, the invasion force suffered heavy casualties, and [[Adolf Hitler]] forbade further large-scale [[paratroop]] operations for the rest of the war. During the initial and subsequent occupation, German firing squads routinely executed male civilians in reprisal for the death of German soldiers; civilians were rounded up randomly in local villages for the mass killings, such as at the [[Massacre of Kondomari]] and the [[Viannos massacres]]. Two German generals were later tried and executed for their roles in the killing of 3,000 of the island's inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/WCC/warcrimgenrls.htm &quot;Some Noteworthy War Criminals&quot;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401143013/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/WCC/warcrimgenrls.htm |date=1 April 2012 }}, Source: ''History of the United Nations War Crimes Commission and the Development of the Laws of War'', United Nations War Crimes Commission.

==Tourism==
{{Main|Tourism in Greece}}

[[File:Kreta-Matala07.jpg|thumb|[[Matala, Crete|Matala]] beach]]

Crete was one of the most popular holiday destinations in Greece. 15% of all arrivals in Greece come through the city of [[Heraklion]] (port and airport), while charter journeys to Heraklion seven years ago made up 20% of all charter flights in Greece.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Overall, more than two million tourists visited Crete some years back,{{When|date=August 2011}} when the increase in tourism was reflected in the number of hotel beds, rising by 53% in the period between 1986 and 1991.

Today, the island's tourism infrastructure caters to all tastes, including a very wide range of accommodation; the island's facilities take in large luxury hotels with their complete facilities, swimming pools, sports and recreation, smaller family-owned apartments, camping facilities and others. Visitors reach the island via two international airports in Heraklion and [[Chania]] and a smaller airport in [[Sitia]] (international charter and domestic flights starting May 2012)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sitia.gr/information-services/news/aerchart.html Charter flights to Sitia in 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001191455/http://www.sitia.gr/information-services/news/aerchart.html |date=1 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by boat to the main ports of Heraklion, Chania, [[Rethimno]], [[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Agios Nikolaos]] and [[Sitia]].

Popular tourist attractions include the archaeological sites of the Minoan civilisation, the Venetian old city and port of [[Chania]], the Venetian castle at [[Rethymno]], the gorge of [[Samariá Gorge|Samaria]], the islands of [[Chrysi (island)|Chrysi]], [[Elafonisi]], [[Gramvousa]], [[Spinalonga]] and the Palm Beach of [[Vai (Crete)|Vai]], which is the largest natural palm forest in Europe.

===Transportation===
Crete has an extensive bus system with regular services across the north of the island and from north to south. There are two regional bus stations in [[Heraklion]]. Bus routes and timetables can be found on KTEL website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-ktel.com/en/ KTEL bus services]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Holiday homes and immigration ===
Crete's mild climate attracts interest from [[northern Europe]]ans who want a holiday home or residence on the island. [[European Union|EU]] citizens have the right to freely buy property and reside with little formality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:229:0035:0048:EN:PDF On the Rights of Citizens of the Union'', EC Directive 2004/58 EC (2004)] Eur-lex.europa.eu&lt;/ref&gt; A growing number of real estate companies cater to mainly British immigrants, followed by [[Germany|German]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]], [[Scandinavia]]n and other European nationalities wishing to own a home in Crete. The [[United Kingdom|British]] immigrants are concentrated in the western regional units of [[Chania (regional unit)|Chania]] and [[Rethymno (regional unit)|Rethymno]] and to a lesser extent in [[Heraklion (regional unit)|Heraklion]] and [[Lasithi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.gr&quot;/&gt;

===Archaeological sites and museums===

{{Main|List of museums in Greece#Crete}}

The area has a large number of archaeological sites, including the Minoan sites of [[Knossos]], [[Malia, Crete#History|Malia]] (not to be confused with the town of the same name), [[Petras]] and [[Phaistos]], the classical site of [[Gortys]], and the diverse archaeology of the island of [[Koufonisi]], which includes Minoan, Roman, and World War II era ruins (nb. due to conservation concerns, access to the latter has been restricted for the last few years, so it is best to check before heading to a port).

There are a number of museums throughout Crete. The [[Heraklion Archaeological Museum]] displays most of the archaeological finds from the Minoan era and was reopened in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.explorecrete.com/archaeology/antiquities-crete.html Archaeological sites and Museums in Crete] ExploreCrete.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Harmful Effects ===
Helen Briassoulis proposed in the Journal of Sustainable Tourism that Crete is a victim of external tourist systems applying pressure to it to develop at an unhealthy rate, and that informal, internal systems within the country are forced to adapt. According to her, these forces have strengthened in 3 stages: from the period from 1960–1970, 1970–1990, and 1990 to the present. During this first period, tourism was a largely positive force, pushing modern developments like running water and electricity onto the largely rural countryside. However, beginning in the second period and especially in the third period leading up to the present day, tourist companies became more pushy with deforestation and pollution of Crete's natural resources. The country is then pulled into an interesting parity, where these companies only upkeep those natural resources that are directly essential to their industry.&lt;gallery widths=&quot;200&quot; heights=&quot;140&quot;&gt;

== Fauna and flora ==

===Fauna===

Crete is isolated from mainland Europe, Asia, and Africa, and this is reflected in the diversity of the fauna and flora. As a result, the fauna and flora of Crete have many clues to the evolution of species. There are no animals that are dangerous to humans on the island of Crete in contrast to other parts of Greece. Indeed, the ancient Greeks attributed the lack of large mammals such as bears, wolves, jackals, and poisonous snakes, to the labour of [[Hercules]] (who took a live Cretan bull to the [[Peloponnese]]). Hercules wanted to honor the birthplace of [[Zeus]] by removing all &quot;harmful&quot; and &quot;poisonous&quot; animals from Crete. Later, Cretans believed that the island was cleared of dangerous creatures by the [[Apostle Paul]], who lived on the island of Crete for two years, with his exorcisms and blessings. There is a [[natural history museum]], the [[Natural History Museum of Crete]], operating under the direction of the [[University of Crete]] and two aquariums – [[Aquaworld Aquarium|Aquaworld]] in [[Hersonissos]] and [[Cretaquarium]] in Gournes, displaying sea creatures common in Cretan waters.

A large variety of birds includes eagles (can be seen in [[Lasithi]]), swallows (throughout Crete in the summer and all the year in the south of the island), pelicans (along the coast), and cranes (including [[Gavdos]] and [[Gavdopoula]]). The Cretan mountains and gorges are refuges for the endangered [[lammergeier]] vulture. Bird species include: the [[golden eagle]], [[Bonelli's eagle]], the [[bearded vulture]] or lammergeier, the [[griffon vulture]], [[Eleanora's falcon]], [[peregrine falcon]], [[lanner falcon]], [[European kestrel]], [[tawny owl]], [[little owl]], [[hooded crow]], [[alpine chough]], [[red-billed chough]], and the [[hoopoe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.we-love-crete.com/birds-of-crete.html Birds of Crete] We-love-crete.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cretewww.com/birds/list.htm Checklist and Guide to the Birds of Crete] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529010744/http://www.cretewww.com/birds/list.htm |date=29 May 2013 }} Cretewww.com&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reptiles and amphibians====
Tortoises can be seen throughout the island. Snakes can be found hiding under rocks. Toads and frogs reveal themselves when it rains.

Reptiles include the [[aegean wall lizard]], [[balkan green lizard]], ''[[Chamaeleo chamaeleon]]'', [[Chalcides ocellatus|ocellated skink]], [[snake-eyed skink]], [[moorish gecko]], [[turkish gecko]], [[Kotschy's gecko]], [[spur-thighed tortoise]], and the [[stripe-necked terrapin]].&lt;ref name=icw/&gt;&lt;ref name=natrep&gt;[http://www.aquaworld-crete.com/rep1.html Native Reptiles of Crete at Aquaworld] Aquaworld Aquarium.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four species of snake on the island and these are not dangerous to humans. The four species include the [[leopard snake]] (locally known as Ochendra), the [[Balkan whip snake]] (locally called Dendrogallia), the [[dice snake]] (called Nerofido in Greek), and the only venomous snake is the nocturnal [[European cat snake|cat snake]] which has evolved to deliver a weak venom at the back of its mouth to paralyse geckos and small lizards, and is not dangerous to humans.&lt;ref name=icw/&gt;&lt;ref name=snakes&gt;[http://www.cretegazette.com/archive/2005-11-snakes.php The Snakes of Crete by John McClaren] CreteGazette.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Turtles include the [[green turtle]] and the [[loggerhead turtle]] which are both endangered species.&lt;ref name=natrep/&gt; The loggerhead turtle nests and hatches on north-coast beaches around Rethymno and Chania, and south-coast beaches along the gulf of Mesara.&lt;ref name=turtle&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KVYFI9NzLz0C&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Crete+insects&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=Crete%20insects&amp;f=false Crete p. 69], by Victoria Kyriakopoulos&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arthropods====
Crete has an unusual variety of insects. [[Cicada]]s, known locally as ''Tzitzikia'', make a distinctive repetitive ''tzi tzi'' [http://www.cicadasong.eu sound] that becomes louder and more frequent on hot summer days. Butterfly species include the [[swallowtail butterfly]].&lt;ref name=icw/&gt; Moth species include the [[hummingbird moth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.picturenation.co.uk/view/info/77283/hummingbird-moth-flower?s=hummingbird&amp;page=1 Feeding time for a hummingbird moth] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314022813/http://www.picturenation.co.uk/view/info/77283/hummingbird-moth-flower?s=hummingbird&amp;page=1 |date=14 March 2012 }} PictureNation.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; There are several species of scorpion such as [[Euscorpius]] carpathicus whose venom is generally no more potent than a mosquito bite.

====Crustaceans and molluscs====
River crabs include the semi-terrestrial ''[[Potamon potamios]]'' crab.&lt;ref name=icw/&gt; Edible snails are widespread and can cluster in the hundreds waiting for rainfall to reinvigorate them.

====Sealife====
Apart from terrestrial mammals, the seas around Crete are rich in large marine mammals, a fact unknown to most Greeks at present, although reported since ancient times. Indeed, the Minoan frescoes depicting dolphins in Queen's Megaron at Knossos indicate that Minoans were well aware of and celebrated these creatures. Apart from the famous endangered [[Mediterranean monk seal]], which lives in almost all the coasts of the country, Greece hosts [[whale]]s, [[sperm whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s and [[porpoise]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cretanbeaches.com/en/fauna-of-crete/marine-mammals.html Marine mammals of Crete] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207014311/http://www.cretanbeaches.com/en/fauna-of-crete/marine-mammals.html |date=7 February 2011 }} CretanBeaches.com&lt;/ref&gt; These are either permanent residents of the Mediterranean or just occasional visitors. The area south of Crete, known as the Greek Abyss, hosts many of them. [[Squid]] and [[octopus]] can be found along the coast and [[sea turtle]]s and [[hammerhead shark]]s swim in the sea around the coast. The [[Cretaquarium]] and the [[Aquaworld Aquarium]], are two of only three aquariums in the whole of Greece.  They are located in [[Gournes]] and [[Hersonissos]] respectively.

==Mythology==
{{Main|Greek mythology}}

[[File:Zeushoehle.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|&quot;[[Psychro Cave|Diktaean Cave]]&quot;]]

Crete has a rich mythology mostly connected with the ancient [[Greek Gods]] but also connected with the [[Minoan civilisation]].

According to Greek Mythology, The [[Psychro Cave|Diktaean Cave]] at Mount [[Dikti]] was the birthplace of the god [[Zeus]]. The [[Paximadia]] islands were the birthplace of the goddess [[Artemis]] and the god [[Apollo]]. Their mother, the goddess [[Leto]], was worshipped at [[Phaistos]]. The goddess [[Athena]] bathed in Lake Voulismeni. The ancient Greek god [[Zeus]] launched a lightning bolt at a giant lizard that was threatening Crete. The lizard immediately turned to stone and became the island of [[Dia (island)|Dia]]. The island can be seen from Knossos and it has the shape of a giant lizard. The islets of [[Souda (island)|Lefkai]] were the result of a musical contest between the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s and the [[Muses]]. The Muses were so anguished to have lost that they plucked the feathers from the wings of their rivals; the Sirens turned white and fell into the sea at [[Aptera, Greece|Aptera]] (&quot;featherless&quot;) where they formed the islands in the bay that were called Lefkai (the islands of [[Souda (island)|Souda]] and [[Leon (Souda Bay)|Leon]]).&lt;ref&gt;Caroline M. Galt, &quot;A marble fragment at Mount Holyoke College from the Cretan city of Aptera&quot;, ''Art and Archaeology'' '''6''' (1920:150).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heracles]], in one of his labors, took the [[Cretan bull]] to the Peloponnese. [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] and [[Zeus]] made love at [[Gortys]] and conceived the kings of Crete: [[Rhadamanthys]], [[Sarpedon (brother of Minos)|Sarpedon]], and [[Minos]].

The [[labyrinth]] of the [[Palace of Knossos]] was the setting for the myth of [[Theseus#Minotaur|Theseus and the Minotaur]] in which the [[Minotaur]] was slain by [[Theseus]]. [[Icarus]] and [[Daedalus]] were captives of [[King Minos]] and crafted wings to escape. After his death [[King Minos]] became a judge of the dead in [[Hades]], while [[Rhadamanthys]] became the ruler of the Elysian fields.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Greece}}
{{See also|Cretan School|Cretan literature|Music of Crete|Cretan cuisine}}

Crete has its own distinctive [[Mantinada|Mantinades]] poetry. The island is known for its Mantinades-based [[Music of Crete|music]] (typically performed with the [[Lyra (Cretan)|Cretan lyra]] and the [[laouto]]) and has many indigenous dances, the most noted of which is the [[Pentozali]]. Since the 1980s and certainly in the 90s onwards there has been a proliferation of Cultural Associations that teach dancing (in Western Crete many focus on rizitiko singing). These Associations often perform in official events but also become stages for people to meet up and engage in traditionalist practices. The topic of tradition and the role of Cultural Associations in reviving it is very often debated throughout Crete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kalantzis |first1=Konstantinos |title=Tradition in the Frame Photography, Power, and Imagination in Sfakia, Crete |date=2019 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-03713-8 |pages=153–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cretan authors have made important contributions to [[Greek Literature]] throughout the modern period; major names include [[Vikentios Kornaros]], creator of the 17th-century epic romance ''[[Erotokritos]]'' (Greek Ερωτόκριτος), and, in the 20th century, [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]. In the Renaissance, Crete was the home of the [[Cretan School]] of icon painting, which influenced [[El Greco]] and through him subsequent European painting.
Crete is also famous for its traditional cuisine. The nutritional value of the Cretan cuisine was discovered by the American epidemiologist [[Ancel Keys]] in the 1960, being later often mentioned by epidemiologists as one of the best examples of the Mediterranean diet.&lt;ref&gt;António José Marques da Silva, ''[http://www.editions-harmattan.fr/index.asp?navig=catalogue&amp;obj=livre&amp;no=47265 La diète méditerranéenne. Discours et pratiques alimentaires en Méditerranée (vol. 2)]'', L'Harmattan, Paris, 2015  {{ISBN|978-2-343-06151-1}}, pp. 49–51&lt;/ref&gt;

Cretans are fiercely proud of their island and customs, and men often don elements of traditional dress in everyday life: knee-high black riding boots (''stivania''), [[Breeches#Types of breeches|''vráka'' breeches]] tucked into the boots at the knee, black shirt and black headdress consisting of a fishnet-weave kerchief worn wrapped around the head or draped on the shoulders (''sariki'').  Men often grow large mustaches as a mark of masculinity.

Cretan society is known in Greece and internationally for family and clan [[feud|vendettas]] which persist on the island to date.&lt;ref name=&quot;feud&quot;&gt;Brian Murphy: [http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19990114&amp;slug=2938763 Vendetta Victims: People, A Village – Crete's `Cycle Of Blood' Survives The Centuries] at ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', 14 January 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aris Tsantiropoulos: {{cite web |url= http://www.pbs.plymouth.ac.uk/solon/journal/issue%202.1/Tsantiropoulos_Article_final%5B1%5D%5B1%5D.pdf |title= Collective Memory and Blood Feud: The Case of Mountainous Crete |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120331102316/http://www.pbs.plymouth.ac.uk/solon/journal/issue%202.1/Tsantiropoulos_Article_final%5B1%5D%5B1%5D.pdf |archivedate= 31 March 2012 |df= dmy-all }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(254&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, ''Crimes and Misdemeanours'' 2/1 (2008), [[University of Crete]].&lt;/ref&gt; Cretans also have a tradition of keeping firearms at home, a tradition lasting from the era of resistance against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Nearly every rural household on Crete has at least one unregistered gun.&lt;ref name=&quot;feud&quot;/&gt; Guns are subject to strict regulation from the Greek government, and in recent years a great deal of effort to control firearms in Crete has been undertaken by the Greek police, but with limited success.
