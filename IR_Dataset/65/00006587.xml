[[European colonization of the Americas|European explorers]] and fur traders visited this area from the 18th century, most of them initially French and French-Canadians who traded with regional Native Americans. More permanent communities were not established until the late 19th century. Initial settlements developed from logging camps and the logging industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SwtM - Cadillac|url=https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7346K_swtm-cadillac?guid=a910bbbd-ea97-4435-b7f3-d920da547a12|accessdate=17 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871, the first [[sawmill]] began operations at Cadillac. Originally called the Pioneer Mill, it was built by John R. Yale.{{Failed verification|date=July 2008}} That same year, [[George A. Mitchell]], a prominent Cadillac banker and railroad entrepreneur, and Adam Gallinger, a local carpenter, formed the Clam Lake Canal Improvement and Construction Company. Two years later, the Clam Lake Canal was constructed between Big and Little Clam lakes, known as present-day lakes Mitchell and [[Lake Cadillac|Cadillac]]. Sawmill owners used the canal to transport timber from Big Clam Lake to the mills and railroad sites on Little Clam Lake.{{Failed verification|date=July 2008}} The [[Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad]] (|G.R. &amp; I.

This settlement was originally named Clam Lake and was incorporated as a village in 1874. George Mitchell was elected as the first mayor.&lt;ref name=&quot;factbook&quot;/&gt; The village was incorporated as a city in 1877 and renamed Cadillac, after [[Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac]], a French colonist who started the first permanent settlement at [[Detroit]] in 1701.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cadillac-mi.net/profile_history.php City of Cadillac, History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509133456/http://www.cadillac-mi.net/profile_history.php |date=May 9, 2008 }}.

===Battle of Manton===
The Wexford County seat of government, originally located in Sherman, was moved to [[Manton, Michigan|Manton]] in 1881, as the result of a compromise between the feuding residents of Cadillac and Sherman. Cadillac partisans, however, won the county seat by a county-wide vote in April 1882.&lt;ref name=&quot;factbook&quot;/&gt; The day following the election, a sheriff's posse left the city for Manton by special train to seize the county records. After they arrived and collected a portion of the materials, however, an angry crowd confronted the Cadillac men and drove them out of town.&lt;ref name=&quot;Battle&quot;&gt;[http://www.absolutemichigan.com/dig/michigan/battling-for-the-county-seat/ Battling for the County Seat]. ''[http://www.absolutemichigan.com/ Absolute Michigan].'' Retrieved on January 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the sheriff returned to Cadillac, he encountered a force consisting of several hundred armed men; this group reportedly included a brass band. The Sheriff's force, some of whom may have been intoxicated, traveled back to Manton to seize the remaining records. Although Manton residents confronted the Cadillac men and barricaded the courthouse, the posse successfully seized the documents. They returned to Cadillac in dubious glory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Battle&quot;/&gt;

In 1878, Ephraim Shay perfected his [[Shay locomotive]], which was particularly effective in its ability to climb steep grades, maneuver sharp turns, and accommodate imperfections in railroad tracks.

In October 1975 the rock group [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] visited Cadillac and performed at the Cadillac High School gymnasium. They played the concert to honor the [[Cadillac High School]] football team. In previous years, the team had compiled a record of sixteen consecutive victories, but the 1974 squad opened the season with two losses. The assistant coach, Jim Neff, an English teacher and [[rock'n'roll]] fan, thought to inspire the team by playing Kiss music in the locker room. He also connected the team's game plan, K-I-S-S or &quot;Keep It Simple Stupid&quot;, with the band. The team went on to win seven straight games and their conference co-championship.

The city's immediate proximity to two lakes, as well as [[Manistee National Forest]], [[Pere Marquette State Forest]], [[Mitchell State Park]] and a number of major highways, has established tourism as a significant sector of the local economy.&lt;ref name=cadillacyesterday/&gt;

Cadillac is also known as '''Chestnut Town, USA'''.

==Incidence of Lou Gehrig's disease==
Based on a single, limited study involving twenty people, Cadillac was ranked as one of three &quot;hot spots&quot; for [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|Lou Gehrig's disease]] (also known as ALS) in the US. But the study made no attempt to assess the frequency of the disease in other parts of the state, or elsewhere in the country. The study was designed to examine the possible occurrence of the disease due to genetic influences. According to the study, the frequency of diagnosis of the disease within the city limits is reportedly more than 100 times the normal rate. The cause of this anomaly is not known.&lt;ref&gt;Kaminski, Frank (March 14, 2003).

Cadillac is situated as the confluence of three highways: US&amp;nbsp;131, M-55 and M-115. Prior to 2001, the northern end of the freeway portion of US&amp;nbsp;131 was located at the southern entrance to Cadillac. With the construction of a [[Bypass (road)|bypass]], the US&amp;nbsp;131 freeway was extended around the east side of the city. The former route of the highway through downtown Cadillac was redesignated as BUS US&amp;nbsp;131. In the city, BUS US&amp;nbsp;131 is named Mitchell Street, after George Mitchell, but may be referred to as [[main street]].

The freeway continues southerly toward [[Big Rapids, Michigan|Big Rapids]] and [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] and northerly toward [[Manton, Michigan|Manton]] before transitioning to a two-lane highway for the remainder of the distance to [[Petoskey, Michigan|Petoskey]].
