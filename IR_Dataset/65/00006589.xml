==History==

Centralized operations under COINTELPRO officially began in August 1956 with a program designed to &quot;increase factionalism, cause disruption and win defections&quot; inside the [[Communist Party USA]] (CPUSA). Tactics included anonymous phone calls, [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) audits, and the creation of documents that would divide the American communist organization internally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weiner 2012 195&quot; /&gt; An October 1956 memo from Hoover reclassified the FBI's ongoing surveillance of black leaders, including it within COINTELPRO, with the justification that the movement was infiltrated by [[communists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|2012|p=198|ps=: &quot;On October 2, 1956, Hoover stepped up the FBI's long-standing surveillance of black civil rights activists. He sent a COINTELPRO memo to the field, warning that the Communist Party was seeking to infiltrate the movement.&quot; }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, Hoover sent an open letter denouncing Dr. [[T. R. M. Howard]], a [[civil rights]] leader, surgeon, and wealthy entrepreneur in Mississippi who had criticized FBI inaction in solving recent murders of [[George W. Lee]], [[Emmett Till]], and other African Americans in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Black Maverick: T. R. M.

After the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], Hoover singled out King as a major target for COINTELPRO. Under pressure from Hoover to focus on King, Sullivan wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|2012|p=235}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the light of King's powerful demagogic speech. ... We must mark him now if we have not done so before, as the most dangerous Negro of the future in this nation from the standpoint of communism, the Negro, and national security.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Soon after, the FBI was systematically bugging King's home and his hotel rooms, as they were now aware that King was growing in stature daily as the most prominent leader of the civil rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|2012|p=236|ps=: &quot;The bugs got quick results. When King traveled, as he did constantly in the ensuing weeks, to Washington, Milwaukee, Los Angeles, and Honolulu, the Bureau planted hidden microphones in his hotel rooms. The FBI placed a total of eight wiretaps and sixteen bugs on King.&quot; }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1960s, King began to publicly criticize the Bureau for giving insufficient attention to the use of [[terrorism]] by white supremacists. Hoover responded by publicly calling King the most &quot;notorious liar&quot; in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Branch_1999&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |url={{google books|CUI6tY9RJUYC|plainurl=yes}} |title=Pillar of Fire: America in the King Years 1963–1965 |last=Branch |first=Taylor |date=1999 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=978-1-4165-5870-5 |pages=524–529 |oclc=933467815 |ref=harv |author-link=Taylor Branch |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1991 memoir ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', journalist [[Carl Rowan]] asserted that the FBI had sent at least one anonymous letter to King encouraging him to commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/breakingbarriers00rowa |title=Breaking Barriers: A Memoir |last=Rowan |first=Carl T. |date=1991 |publisher=Little, Brown |isbn=978-0-316-75977-9 |edition=1st |location=Boston |page=260 |oclc=22110131 |author-link=Carl Rowan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Taylor Branch]] documents an anonymous November 21, 1964 &quot;[[FBI–King suicide letter|suicide package]]&quot; sent by the FBI that contained audio recordings, which were obtained through tapping King's phone and placing bugs throughout various hotel rooms over the past two years&lt;ref name=&quot;Churchill_2002&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=The COINTELPRO Papers: Documents from the FBI's Secret Wars Against Dissent in the United States |title-link=The COINTELPRO Papers |last=Churchill |first=Ward |last2=Vander Wall |first2=Jim |date=2002 |publisher=[[South End Press]] |isbn=978-0-89608-648-7 |author-link=Ward Churchill |orig-year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created two days after the announcement of King's impending [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref name=Churchill_2002/&gt; The tape, which was prepared by FBI audio technician John Matter&lt;ref name=Churchill_2002/&gt; documented a series of King's sexual indiscretions combined with a letter telling him: &quot;There is only one way out for you.

DeLoach, commenced a media campaign offering the surveillance transcript to various news organizations, including ''[[Newsweek]]'' and ''[[Newsday]]''.&lt;ref name=Churchill_2002/&gt; And even by 1969, as has been noted elsewhere, &quot;[FBI] efforts to 'expose' Martin Luther King Jr. had not slackened even though King had been dead for a year.

During the same period the program also targeted [[Malcolm X]]. While an FBI spokesman has denied that the FBI was &quot;directly&quot; involved in Malcolm's murder in 1965, it is documented that the Bureau worked to &quot;widen the rift&quot; between Malcolm and [[Elijah Muhammad]] through infiltration and the &quot;sparking of acrimonious debates within the organization&quot;, rumor-mongering, and other tactics designed to foster internal disputes, which ultimately led to Malcolm's assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branch|1999|p=243}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2000-05-14/news/0005140182_1_malcolm-x-kill-malcolm-muhammad |title=FBI should acknowledge complicity in the assassination of Malcolm X |last=Kane |first=Gregory |date=14 May 2000 |work=Baltimore Sun |access-date=26 May 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524001225/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2000-05-14/news/0005140182_1_malcolm-x-kill-malcolm-muhammad |archive-date=24 May 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI heavily infiltrated Malcolm's [[Organization of Afro-American Unity]] in the final months of his life.

Amidst the urban unrest of July–August 1967, the FBI began &quot;COINTELPRO–BLACK HATE&quot;, which focused on King and the SCLC, as well as the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC), the [[Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM)]], the [[Deacons for Defense and Justice]], [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE), and the [[Nation of Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cisupa.proquest.com/ksc_assets/catalog/101095_FBIBlackExtrOrgsPt1COINTELPRO.pdf |title=Guide to the Microfilm Edition of FBI Surveillance Files: Black Extremist Organizations, Part 1 |website=Lexis-Nexis |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603094342/http://cisupa.proquest.com/ksc_assets/catalog/101095_FBIBlackExtrOrgsPt1COINTELPRO.pdf |archive-date=2013-06-03 |access-date=2014-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; BLACK HATE established the [[Ghetto Informant Program]] and instructed 23 FBI offices to &quot;disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize the activities of black nationalist hate type organizations&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|2012|p=271}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A March 1968 memo stated the program's goal was to &quot;prevent the coalition of militant black nationalist groups&quot;; to &quot;Prevent the RISE OF A '[[messiah|MESSIAH]]' who could unify ... the militant black nationalist movement&quot;; &quot;to pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them before they exercise their potential for violence [against authorities].&quot;; to &quot;Prevent militant black nationalist groups and leaders from gaining RESPECTABILITY, by discrediting them to ... both the responsible community and to liberals who have vestiges of sympathy...&quot;; and to &quot;prevent the long-range GROWTH of militant black organizations, especially among youth&quot;.

This program coincided with a broader federal effort to prepare military responses for [[urban riots]] and began increased collaboration between the FBI, [[Central Intelligence Agency]], [[National Security Agency]], and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. The CIA launched its own domestic espionage project in 1967 called [[Operation CHAOS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|2012|p=272|ps=: &quot;Some 1,500 army intelligence officers in civilian clothing undertook the surveillance of some 100,000 American citizens. Army intelligence shared all their reports over the next three years. The CIA tracked antiwar leaders and black militants who traveled overseas, and it reported back to the FBI. The FBI, in turn, shared thousands of selected files on Americans with army intelligence and the CIA. All three intelligence services sent the names of Americans to the National Security Agency for inclusion on a global watch list; the NSA relayed back to the FBI hundreds of transcripts of intercepted telephone calls to and from suspect Americans.&quot;}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A particular target was the [[Poor People's Campaign]], a national effort organized by King and the SCLC to occupy Washington, DC.

Overall, COINTELPRO encompassed disruption and sabotage of the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] (1961), the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (1964), the [[Nation of Islam]], the [[Black Panther Party]] (1967), and the entire [[New Left]] social/political movement, which included antiwar, community, and religious groups (1968). A later investigation by the Senate's [[Church Committee]] (see below) stated that &quot;COINTELPRO began in 1956, in part because of frustration with Supreme Court rulings limiting the Government's power to proceed overtly against dissident groups.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cfr3a&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2017/dec/08/fbi-kkk/ |title=FBI leadership claimed Bureau was &quot;almost powerless&quot; against KKK, despite making up one-fifth of its membership |publisher=Muckrock |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190124203613/https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2017/dec/08/fbi-kkk/ |archive-date=2019-01-24 |access-date=2018-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official congressional committees and several court cases&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''[http://www.leagle.com/decision/1984738737F2d1_1738/HOBSON%20v.%20WILSON Hobson v.

The program was secret until 1971, when the [[Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI]] burgled an FBI field office in [[Media, Pennsylvania]], took several dossiers, and exposed the program by passing this material to news agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/1971/ |title=1971: Citizens Who Exposed COINTELPRO |last=Hamilton |first=Johanna |date=18 May 2015 |website=PBS: Independent Lens |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924131425/http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/1971/ |archive-date=24 September 2015 |access-date=25 August 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boxing match known as the [[Fight of the Century]] between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Joe Frazier]] in March 1971 provided cover for the activist group to successfully pull off the burglary; Muhammad Ali was himself a COINTELPRO target due to his involvement with the Nation of Islam and the anti-war movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intercept&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://theintercept.com/2016/06/06/in-1971-muhammad-ali-helped-undermine-the-fbis-illegal-spying-on-americans/ |title=In 1971, Muhammad Ali Helped Undermine the FBI's Illegal Spying on Americans |last=Medsger |first=Betty |date=June 6, 2016 |website=[[The Intercept]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427235216/https://theintercept.com/2016/06/06/in-1971-muhammad-ali-helped-undermine-the-fbis-illegal-spying-on-americans/ |archive-date=April 27, 2017 |access-date=April 17, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many news organizations initially refused to publish the information. Within the year, Director J. Edgar Hoover declared that the centralized COINTELPRO was over, and that all future [[counterintelligence]] operations would be handled on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.albionmonitor.net/9905a/jbcointelpro.html |title=A Short History of FBI COINTELPRO |last=Cassidy |first=Mike |last2=Miller |first2=Will |date=May 26, 1999 |website=Albion Monitor |publisher=Wayward Press Inc. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928104133/http://www.albionmonitor.net/9905a/jbcointelpro.html |archive-date=September 28, 2007 |access-date=July 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|2012|p=293}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional documents were revealed in the course of separate lawsuits filed against the FBI by [[NBC]] correspondent Carl Stern, the Socialist Workers Party, and a number of other groups. In 1976 the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities of the United States Senate, commonly referred to as the &quot;[[Church Committee]]&quot; after its chairman, Senator [[Frank Church]] of [[Idaho]], launched a major investigation of the FBI and COINTELPRO. Many released documents have been partly or entirely [[Sanitization (classified information)|redacted]].

The Final Report of the Select Committee castigated the conduct of the intelligence community in its domestic operations (including COINTELPRO) in no uncertain terms:
{{quote|The Committee finds that the domestic activities of the intelligence community at times violated specific statutory prohibitions and infringed the constitutional rights of American citizens. The legal questions involved in intelligence programs were often not considered. On other occasions, they were intentionally disregarded in the belief that because the programs served the &quot;national security&quot; the law did not apply. While intelligence officers on occasion failed to disclose to their superiors programs which were illegal or of questionable legality, the Committee finds that the most serious breaches of duty were those of senior officials, who were responsible for controlling intelligence activities and generally failed to assure compliance with the law.&lt;ref name=&quot;church-final-report&quot; /&gt;

Many of the techniques used would be intolerable in a democratic society even if all of the targets had been involved in violent activity, but COINTELPRO went far beyond that ... the Bureau conducted a sophisticated vigilante operation aimed squarely at preventing the exercise of [[First Amendment]] rights of speech and association, on the theory that preventing the growth of dangerous groups and the propagation of dangerous ideas would protect the national security and deter violence.&lt;ref name=cfr3a/&gt;}}

The Church Committee documented a history of the FBI exercising political repression as far back as World War I, through the 1920s, when agents were charged with rounding up &quot;anarchists, communists, socialists, reformists and revolutionaries&quot; for deportation. The domestic operations were increased against political and anti-war groups from 1936 through 1976.

==Intended effects==
The intended effect of the FBI's COINTELPRO was to &quot;expose, disrupt, misdirect, or otherwise neutralize&quot; groups that the FBI officials believed were &quot;subversive&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zBgDPupR_lMC&amp;pg=PA182 |title=Surveillance and governance: crime control and beyond |last=Deflam, Mathieu |publisher=Emerald Publishing Group |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7623-1416-4 |page=182 |access-date=2017-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190405144752/https://books.google.com/books?id=zBgDPupR_lMC&amp;pg=PA182 |archive-date=2019-04-05 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; by instructing FBI field operatives to:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zBgDPupR_lMC&amp;pg=PA184#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Surveillance and governance: crime control and beyond |last=Deflam, Mathieu |publisher=Emerald Publishing Group |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7623-1416-4 |pages=184–185 |access-date=2017-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190405164813/https://books.google.com/books?id=zBgDPupR_lMC&amp;pg=PA184#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archive-date=2019-04-05 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Range of targets==
At its inception, the program's main target was the Communist Party.&lt;ref name=Churchill_1990/&gt;

In an interview with the [[BBC]]'s [[Andrew Marr]] in February 1996, [[Noam Chomsky]]—a political activist and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] professor of [[linguistics]]—spoke about the purpose and the targets of COINTELPRO, saying:&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|oG24vg8js4o}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
COINTELPRO was a program of subversion carried out not by a couple of petty crooks but by the national political police, the FBI, under four administrations... by the time it got through, I won't run through the whole story, it was aimed at the entire new left, at the women's movement, at the whole black movement, it was extremely broad. Its actions went as far as political assassination.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the [[Church Committee]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/94755_II.pdf |title=Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (Book II, Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans) |year=1976 |page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
While the declared purposes of these programs were to protect the &quot;national security&quot; or prevent violence, Bureau witnesses admit that many of the targets were nonviolent and most had no connections with a foreign power. Indeed, nonviolent organizations and individuals were targeted because the Bureau believed they represented a &quot;potential&quot; for violence—and nonviolent citizens who were against the war in Vietnam were targeted because they gave &quot;aid and comfort&quot; to violent demonstrators by lending respectability to their cause.

The imprecision of the targeting is demonstrated by the inability of the Bureau to define the subjects of the programs. The Black Nationalist program, according to its supervisor, included &quot;a great number of organizations that you might not today characterize as black nationalist but which were in fact primarily black&quot;. Thus, the nonviolent Southern Christian Leadership Conference was labeled as a Black Nationalist-&quot;Hate Group&quot;.

Furthermore, the actual targets were chosen from a far broader group than the titles of the programs would imply. The CPUSA program targeted not only Communist Party members but also sponsors of the [[National Committee to Abolish the House Un-American Activities Committee]] and civil rights leaders allegedly under Communist influence or deemed to be not sufficiently &quot;anti-Communist&quot;. The Socialist Workers Party program included non-SWP sponsors of anti-war demonstrations which were cosponsored by the SWP or the Young Socialist Alliance, its youth group. The Black Nationalist program targeted a range of organizations from the Panthers to SNCC to the peaceful Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and included every Black Student Union and many other black student groups. New Left targets ranged from the SDS to the InterUniversity Committee for Debate on Foreign Policy, from [[Antioch College]] (&quot;vanguard of the New Left&quot;) to the New Mexico Free University and other &quot;alternate&quot; schools, and from underground newspapers to students' protesting university censorship of a student publication by carrying signs with four-letter words on them.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] (1933–1945) asked the FBI to put in its files the names of citizens sending telegrams to the White House opposing his &quot;national defense&quot; policy and supporting Col. [[Charles Lindbergh]].
* [[Harry S Truman|President Truman]] (1945–1953) received inside information on a former Roosevelt aide's efforts to influence his appointments, labor union negotiating plans, and the publishing plans of journalists.

* The [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]] (1961–1963) had the FBI wiretap a congressional staff member, three executive officials, a lobbyist, and a Washington law firm. [[US Attorney General]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]] received the fruits of an FBI wire tap on [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and an electronic listening device targeting a congressman, both of which yielded information of a political nature.
* [[Lyndon Johnson|President Johnson]] (1963–1969) asked the FBI to conduct &quot;name checks&quot; of his critics and members of the staff of his 1964 opponent, Senator [[Barry Goldwater]]. He also requested purely political intelligence on his critics in the Senate, and received extensive intelligence reports on political activity at the [[1964 Democratic Convention]] from FBI electronic surveillance.
* [[Richard M. Nixon|President Nixon]] (1969–1974) authorized a program of wiretaps, which produced for the White House purely political or personal information unrelated to national security, including information about a Supreme Court Justice.

The COINTELPRO operators targeted multiple groups at once and encouraged splintering of these groups from within. In letter-writing campaigns (wherein false letters were sent on behalf of members of parties), the FBI ensured that groups would not unite in their causes. For instance, they launched a campaign specifically to alienate the Black Panther Party from the Mau Maus, Young Lords, Young Patriots and SDS. These racially diverse groups had been building alliances, in part due to charismatic leaders such as Fred Hampton and his attempts to create a &quot;Rainbow Coalition&quot;. The FBI was concerned with ensuring that groups could not gain traction through unity, specifically across racial lines. One of the main ways of targeting these groups was to arouse suspicion between the different parties and causes. In this way the bureau took on a divide and conquer offensive.&lt;ref name=Churchill_1990/&gt;

The COINTELPRO documents show numerous cases of the FBI's intentions to prevent and disrupt protests against the [[Vietnam War]]. Many techniques were used to accomplish this task. &quot;These included promoting splits among antiwar forces, encouraging [[red-baiting]] of socialists, and pushing violent confrontations as an alternative to massive, peaceful demonstrations.&quot; One 1966 COINTELPRO operation tried to redirect the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] from their pledge of support for the antiwar movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46439435 |title=COINTELPRO: The FBI's Secret War on Political Freedom |last=Blackstock |first=Nelson |publisher=Pathfinder |year=1975 |isbn=0-87348-877-6 |location=New York |pages=111 |oclc=46439435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[FBI]] has said that it no longer undertakes COINTELPRO or COINTELPRO-like operations. However, critics have claimed that agency programs in the spirit of COINTELPRO targeted groups such as the [[Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador]],&lt;ref&gt;Gelbspan, Ross.

According to attorney Brian Glick in his book ''War at Home'', the FBI used five main methods during COINTELPRO:
# '''Infiltration:''' Agents and informers did not merely spy on political activists. Their main purpose was to discredit, disrupt and negatively redirect action. Their very presence served to undermine trust and scare off potential supporters. The FBI and police exploited this fear to smear genuine activists as agents.
# '''Psychological warfare:''' The FBI and police used myriad &quot;dirty tricks&quot; to undermine progressive movements. They planted false media stories and published bogus leaflets and other publications in the name of targeted groups. They forged correspondence, sent anonymous letters, and made anonymous telephone calls. They spread misinformation about meetings and events, set up pseudo movement groups run by government agents, and manipulated or strong-armed parents, employers, landlords, school officials, and others to cause trouble for activists. They used [[bad-jacketing]] to create suspicion about targeted activists, sometimes with lethal consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ward Churchill |title=Agents of Repression |date=2002 |edition=Agents of Repression: The FBI's Secret Wars Against the Black Panther Party and the American Indian Movement |publisher=South End Press |isbn=978-0896086463 |oclc=50985124 |ol=25433596M |id=0896086461}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Harassment via the legal system:''' The FBI and police abused the legal system to harass dissidents and make them appear to be criminals. Officers of the law gave perjured testimony and presented fabricated evidence as a pretext for false arrests and wrongful imprisonment. They discriminatorily enforced tax laws and other government regulations and used conspicuous surveillance, &quot;investigative&quot; interviews, and grand jury subpoenas in an effort to intimidate activists and silence their supporters.&lt;ref name=&quot;icdc.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/churchfinalreportIIIc.htm |title=The FBI'S Covert Action Program to Destroy the Black Panther Party |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113102047/http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/churchfinalreportIIIc.htm |archive-date=2013-01-13 |access-date=2005-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/reports/book3/html/ChurchB3_0001a.htm |title=Assassination Archive and Research Center |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140918004714/http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/reports/book3/html/ChurchB3_0001a.htm |archive-date=2014-09-18 |access-date=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Illegal force:''' The FBI conspired with local police departments to threaten dissidents; to conduct illegal break-ins in order to search dissident homes; and to commit vandalism, assaults, beatings and assassinations.&lt;ref name=&quot;icdc.com&quot; /&gt; The objective was to frighten or eliminate dissidents and disrupt their movements.
# '''Undermine public opinion:''' One of the primary ways the FBI targeted organizations was by challenging their reputations in the community and denying them a platform to gain legitimacy. Hoover specifically designed programs to block leaders from &quot;spreading their philosophy publicly or through the communications media&quot;. Furthermore, the organization created and controlled negative media meant to undermine black power organizations. For instance, they oversaw the creation of &quot;documentaries&quot; skillfully edited to paint the Black Panther Party as aggressive, and false newspapers that spread misinformation about party members. The ability of the FBI to create distrust within and between revolutionary organizations tainted their public image and weakened chances at unity and public support.&lt;ref name=Churchill_1990/&gt;

The FBI specifically developed tactics intended to heighten tension and hostility between various factions in the black power movement, for example between the Black Panthers and the [[US Organization]]. For instance, the FBI sent a fake letter to the US Organization exposing a supposed Black Panther plot to murder the head of the US Organization, [[Maulana Karenga|Ron Karenga]]. They then intensified this by spreading falsely attributed cartoons in the black communities pitting the Black Panther Party against the US Organization.&lt;ref name=Churchill_1990/&gt; This resulted in numerous deaths, among which were San Diego Black Panther Party members John Huggins, Bunchy Carter and Sylvester Bell.&lt;ref name=&quot;icdc.com&quot; /&gt; Another example of the FBI's anonymous letter writing campaign is how they turned the Blackstone Rangers head, Jeff Fort, against former ally Fred Hampton, by stating that Hampton had a hit on Fort.&lt;ref name=Churchill_1990/&gt; They also were instrumental in developing the rift between Black Panther Party leaders Eldridge Cleaver and Huey Newton, as executed through false letters inciting the two leaders of the Black Panther Party.&lt;ref name=Churchill_1990/&gt;

[[Dhoruba al-Mujahid bin Wahad|Dhoruba Bin Wahad]], a former Black Panther, reflects on how these tactics made him feel, saying he had a combat mentality and felt like he was at war with the government. When asked about why he thinks the Black Panthers were targeted he said, &quot;In the United States, the equivalent of the military was the local police. During the early sixties, at the height of the civil rights movement, and the human rights movement, the police in the United States became increasingly militaristic. They began to train out of military bases in the United States. The Law Enforcement Assistance Act supplied local police with military technology, everything from assault rifles to army personnel carriers. In his opinion, the Counterintelligence Program went hand-in-hand with the militarization of the police in the Black community, with the militarization of police in America.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Still Black, Still Strong |last=Bin Wahad |first=Dhoruba |last2=Abu-Jamal |first2=Mumia |last3=Shakur |first3=Assata |date=1993 |publisher=[[Semiotext(e)]] |isbn=978-0936756745 |pages=18–19 |author-link=Dhoruba al-Mujahid bin Wahad |author-link2=Mumia Abu-Jamal |author-link3=Assata Shakur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI also conspired with the police departments of many U.S. cities (San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, Philadelphia, Chicago) to encourage repeated raids on Black Panther homes—often with little or no evidence of violations of federal, state, or local laws—which resulted directly in the police killing many members of the Black Panther Party, most notably Chicago Black Panther Party Chairman [[Fred Hampton]] on December 4, 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI Secrets 1995&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;icdc.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Taste of Power: A Black Woman's Story |last=Brown |first=Elaine |date=1992 |publisher=New York: Doubleday |isbn=978-0385471077 |pages=204–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the death of Hampton, long-term infiltrator, William O'Neal, shared floor plans of his apartment with the COINTELPRO team. He then gave Hampton a dose of secobarbital that rendered Hampton unconscious during the raid on his home.&lt;ref name=Churchill_1990/&gt;

In order to eliminate black militant leaders whom they considered dangerous, the FBI is believed to have worked with local police departments to target specific individuals,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/doc156.gif Paul Wolf, &quot;COINTELPRO&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927132811/http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/doc156.gif |date=2009-09-27 }}, ICDC&lt;/ref&gt; accuse them of crimes they did not commit, suppress exculpatory evidence and falsely incarcerate them. [[Elmer Pratt|Elmer &quot;Geronimo&quot; Pratt]], a Black Panther Party leader, was incarcerated for 27 years before a California Superior Court vacated his murder conviction, ultimately freeing him. Appearing before the court, an FBI agent testified that he believed Pratt had been framed, because both the FBI and the Los Angeles Police Department knew he had not been in the area at the time the murder occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9706/10/pratt.release/ |title=Former Black Panther freed after 27 years in jail |access-date=April 30, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415190050/http://www.cnn.com/US/9706/10/pratt.release/ |archive-date=2009-04-15 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/law/inrepratt82CalRptr2d260.htm |title=In re Pratt, 82 Cal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 the FBI special agent in San Francisco wrote Hoover that his investigation of the Black Panther Party had concluded that in his city, at least, the Panthers were primarily engaged in feeding breakfast to children. Hoover fired back a memo implying the agent's career goals would be directly affected by his supplying evidence to support Hoover's view that the Black Panther Party was &quot;a violence-prone organization seeking to overthrow the Government by revolutionary means&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;FBI document, 27 May 1969, &quot;Director FBI to SAC San Francisco&quot;, available at the FBI reading room.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoover supported using false claims to attack his political enemies.

Hoover ordered preemptive action &quot;to pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them before they exercise their potential for violence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WRH&quot; /&gt;

==Illegal surveillance==
The final report of the [[Church Committee]] concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Too many people have been spied upon by too many Government agencies and too much information has been illegally collected. The Government has often undertaken the secret surveillance of citizens on the basis of their political beliefs, even when those beliefs posed no threat of violence or illegal acts on behalf of a hostile foreign power. The Government, operating primarily through secret and biased informants, but also using other intrusive techniques such as wiretaps, microphone &quot;bugs&quot;, surreptitious mail opening, and break-ins, has swept in vast amounts of information about the personal lives, views, and associations of [[American citizen]]s. Investigations of groups deemed potentially dangerous—and even of groups suspected of associating with potentially dangerous organizations—have continued for decades, despite the fact that those groups did not engage in unlawful activity.

Groups and individuals have been assaulted, repressed, harassed and disrupted because of their political views, social beliefs and their lifestyles. Investigations have been based upon vague standards whose breadth made excessive collection inevitable. Unsavory, harmful and vicious tactics have been employed—including anonymous attempts to break up marriages, disrupt meetings, ostracize persons from their professions, and provoke target groups into rivalries that might result in deaths. Intelligence agencies have served the political and personal objectives of presidents and other high officials. While the agencies often committed excesses in response to pressure from high officials in the Executive branch and Congress, they also occasionally initiated improper activities and then concealed them from officials whom they had a duty to inform.

Governmental officials—including those whose principal duty is to enforce the law—have violated or ignored the law over long periods of time and have advocated and defended their right to break the law.

The Constitutional system of checks and balances has not adequately controlled intelligence activities. Until recently the Executive branch has neither delineated the scope of permissible activities nor established procedures for supervising intelligence agencies. Congress has failed to exercise sufficient oversight, seldom questioning the use to which its appropriations were being put. Most domestic intelligence issues have not reached the courts, and in those cases when they have reached the courts, the judiciary has been reluctant to grapple with them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Church&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/churchfinalreportIIa.htm |title=Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans Book II, Final Report of the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with respect to Intelligence Activities United States Senate (Church Committee) |publisher=United States Senate |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019170937/http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/churchfinalreportIIa.htm |archive-date=October 19, 2006 |access-date=May 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Slate&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2135325/ |title=Tapped Out Why Congress won't get through to the NSA. |last=Patrick Radden Keefe |date=February 2, 2006 |website=Slate |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209041309/http://www.slate.com/id/2135325/ |archive-date=February 9, 2006 |access-date=May 11, 2006 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
