'''Charles Walter Stansby Williams''' (20 September 1886 – 15 May 1945) was a British poet, novelist, playwright, theologian, literary critic, and member of the [[Inklings]].

== Early life and education ==
Williams was born in London in 1886, the only son of (Richard) Walter Stansby Williams (1848–1929), a journalist and foreign business correspondent for an importing firm, writing in French and German,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Higgins |first= Sørina | url= https://theoddestinkling.wordpress.com/2013/06/12/cws-life-1886-1908/ | work= The Oddest Inkling: An exploration of the works of poet Charles Williams (1886-1945)| title= Under the Cathedral: CW’s early life 1886–1908| date= 12 June 2013| publisher=Word press  | access-date= 14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Fellowship: The Literary Lives of the Inklings: J.R.R.

He had one sister, Edith, born in 1889. The Williams family lived in 'shabby-genteel' circumstances, owing to Walter's increasing blindness and the decline of the firm by which he was employed, in Holloway.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charles Williams 2015, pg 6&quot; /&gt;

In 1894 the family moved to [[St Albans]] in [[Hertfordshire]], where Williams lived until his marriage in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueplaqueplaces.co.uk/charles-williams-blue-plaque-in-st-albans-4732#.WqaeL5pLGM9] Charles Williams blue plaque in St Albans&lt;/ref&gt;

Educated at [[St Albans School (Hertfordshire)|St Albans School]], Williams was awarded a scholarship to [[University College London]], but he left school in 1904 without attempting to gain a degree due to an inability to pay tuition fees.

Williams began work in 1904 in a [[Methodist]] [[bookroom]]. He was hired by the [[Oxford University Press]] (OUP) as a proofreading assistant in 1908 and quickly climbed to the position of editor. He continued to work at the OUP in various positions of increasing responsibility until his death in 1945. One of his greatest editorial achievements was the publication of the first major English-language edition of the works of [[Søren Kierkegaard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://dspace.lasrworks.org/bitstream/handle/10349/770/From%20a%20Publisher%27s%20Point%20of%20View.pdf?sequence=1 | contribution = From a Publisher's Point of View: Charles Williams’s Role in Publishing Kierkegaard in English | first = Michael J., Jr. | last = Paulus | editor1-first = Suzanne | editor1-last = Bray | editor2-first = Richard | editor2-last = Sturch | title = Charles Williams and His Contemporaries | place = Newcastle, UK | publisher = Cambridge Scholars Publishing | year = 2009 | ISBN = 978-1-4438-0565-0 | format = PDF | access-date = 10 January 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140826115650/https://dspace.lasrworks.org/bitstream/handle/10349/770/From%20a%20Publisher%27s%20Point%20of%20View.pdf?sequence=1# | archive-date = 26 August 2014 | url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although chiefly remembered as a novelist, Williams also published poetry, works of literary criticism, theology, drama, history, biography, and a voluminous number of book reviews. Some of his best known novels are ''War in Heaven'' (1930), ''[[Descent into Hell (novel)|Descent into Hell]]'' (1937), and ''All Hallows' Eve'' (1945).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first= David N.| last= Samuelson | title= Charles Williams | editor1-first= E.F. | editor1-last= Bleiler| editor1-link= E. F. Bleiler| work= Supernatural Fiction Writers : Fantasy and Horror| place= New York |publisher= Scribner's | year= 1985 | isbn= 0-68417808-7 | pages= 631–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[T. S. Eliot]], who wrote an introduction for the last of these, described Williams's novels as &quot;supernatural thrillers&quot; because they explore the sacramental intersection of the physical with the spiritual while also examining the ways in which power, even spiritual power, can corrupt as well as sanctify. All of Williams's fantasies, unlike those of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and most of those of [[C. S. Lewis]], are set in the contemporary world. Williams has been described by [[Colin Manlove]] as one of the three main writers of &quot;Christian fantasy&quot; in the twentieth century (the other two being C.S. Lewis and [[T. F. Powys]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1= Margarita| last1= Carretero González | first2= Encarnación |last2= Hidalgo Tenorio | title= Behind the Veil of Familiarity: C.S. Lewis (1898–1998)| publisher= Peter Lang | year= 2001| isbn= 0-82045099-5 |page= 305}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent writers of fantasy novels with contemporary settings, notably [[Tim Powers]], cite Williams as a model and inspiration. [[W. H. Auden]], one of Williams's greatest admirers, reportedly re-read Williams's extraordinary and highly unconventional history of the church, ''The Descent of the Dove'' (1939), every year. Williams's study of Dante entitled ''The Figure of Beatrice'' (1944) was very highly regarded at its time of publication and continues to be consulted by [[Dante]] scholars today. His work inspired [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] to undertake her translation of ''The Divine Comedy''. Williams, however, regarded his most important work to be his extremely dense and complex [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] poetry, of which two books were published, ''Taliessin through Logres'' (1938) and ''The Region of the Summer Stars'' (1944), and more remained unfinished at his death. Some of Williams's essays were collected and published posthumously in ''Image of the City and Other Essays'' (1958), edited by [[Anne Ridler]].

Williams gathered many followers and disciples during his lifetime. He was, for a period, a member of the Salvator Mundi Temple of the [[Fellowship of the Rosy Cross]]. He met fellow Anglican [[Evelyn Underhill]] (who was affiliated with a similar group, the [[Order of the Golden Dawn]]) in 1937 and was later to write the introduction to her published ''Letters'' in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~dcandmkw/spirit/eucw%20-%20int.htm|title= Introduction to ''The Letters of Evelyn Underhill'' |last= Williams |first=Charles |year= 1943|website= iHug |publisher= Longmans, Green &amp; Co |place= NZ |url-status= dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421221635/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~dcandmkw/spirit/eucw%20-%20int.htm|archivedate= 21 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[World War II]] broke out in 1939, [[Oxford University Press]] moved its offices from London to [[Oxford]]. Williams was reluctant to leave his beloved city, and his wife Florence refused to go. From the nearly 700 letters he wrote his wife during the war years a generous selection has been published; &quot;primarily… love letters,&quot; the editor calls them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-first= Roma A, Jr | editor-last= King| title= To Michal from Serge: Letters from Charles Williams to his wife, Florence, 1939–1945| place= Kent, Ohio; London| publisher= Kent State University Press | year= 2002| page= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the move to Oxford did allow him to participate regularly in Lewis's literary society known as the [[Inklings]]. In this setting Williams was able to read (and improve) his final published novel, ''All Hallows' Eve'', as well as to hear [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] read aloud to the group some of his early drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. In addition to meeting in Lewis's rooms at Oxford, they also regularly met at [[The Eagle and Child]] pub in Oxford (better known by its nickname &quot;The Bird and Baby&quot;). During this time Williams also gave lectures at Oxford on [[John Milton]], [[William Wordsworth]], and other authors, and received an honorary M.A. degree. Williams is buried in [[Holywell Cemetery]] in Oxford: his headstone bears the word &quot;poet&quot;, followed by the words &quot;Under the Mercy&quot;, a phrase often used by Williams himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Arbor field|title=Under the Mercy | url= http://oxfordinklings.blogspot.com/2011/02/under-mercy.html|website= The Inklings |publisher= Google Blogger |date= 3 February 2011| accessdate= 25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Grave of Charles Williams at Holywell.jpg|thumb|right|Williams' grave at [[Holywell Cemetery]] in Oxford]]

In 1917 Williams married his first sweetheart, Florence Conway, following a long courtship during which he presented her with a sonnet sequence that would later become his first published book of poetry, ''The Silver Stair''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theoddestinkling.wordpress.com/2013/11/13/the-silver-stair-1912/|title=''The Silver Stair'', 1912|last=Higgins|first=Sørina|date=13 November 2013|website=The Oddest Inkling|publisher=Wordpress|access-date=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Silver Stair''. London: Herbert &amp; Daniel, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; Their son Michael was born in 1922.

Williams was an unswerving and devoted member of the [[Church of England]], reputedly with a tolerance of the scepticism of others and a firm belief in the necessity of a &quot;[[doubting Thomas]]&quot; in any apostolic body.&lt;ref name= CWS&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.charleswilliamssociety.org.uk/about/ | publisher= Oxford University Press; reproduced by permission online by The Charles Williams Society| title= About Charles Williams: Biography of Charles Walter Stansby Williams (1886-1945)| first= G. W. S. |last= Hopkins| work= Dictionary of National Biography, 1941-50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Williams attracted the attention and admiration of some of the most notable writers of his day, including [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[W. H. Auden]], his greatest admirer was probably [[C. S. Lewis]], whose novel ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'' (1945) has been regarded as partially inspired by his acquaintance with both the man and his novels and poems. Williams came to know Lewis after reading Lewis's then-recently published study ''[[The Allegory of Love]]''; he was so impressed he jotted down a letter of congratulation and dropped it in the mail. Coincidentally, Lewis had just finished reading Williams's novel ''[[The Place of the Lion]]'' and had written a similar note of congratulation. The letters crossed in the mail and led to an enduring and fruitful friendship.

== Theology ==
Williams developed the concept of co-inherence and gave rare consideration to the theology of romantic love. Falling in love for Williams was a form of mystical envisioning in which one saw the beloved as he or she was seen through the eyes of God. Co-inherence was a term used in [[Patristic]] theology to describe the relationship between the human and divine natures of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] and the relationship between the persons of the blessed [[Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= The Figure of Beatrice: A Study in Dante|last=Williams |first= Charles |publisher=Noonday |year= 1961 |location=New York |page =92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bztKAwAAQBAJ|title= God in Patristic Thought|last= Prestige |first=G.L.|publisher= Wipf &amp; Stock|year=2008|isbn= 978-1-55635779-4 |chapter = XIV: Co-Inherence}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams extended the term to include the ideal relationship between the individual parts of God's creation, including human beings. It is our mutual indwelling: Christ in us and we in Christ, interdependent.  It is also the web of interrelationships, social and economic and ecological, by which the social fabric and the natural world function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Marshall|first=Ashley |title= Reframing Charles Williams: Modernist Doubt and the Crisis of World War in ''All Hallows' Eve''|journal= Journal of Modern Literature|volume= 30 |issue= 2|date=2007 |page = 67 |jstor= 4619328}}&lt;/ref&gt; But especially for Williams, co-inherence is a way of talking about the Body of Christ and the communion of saints. For Williams, salvation was not a solitary affair: &quot;The thread of the love of God was strong enough to save you and all the others, but not strong enough to save you alone.&quot;{{Citation needed |date=March 2016}} He proposed an order, the Companions of the Co-inherence, who would practice substitution and exchange, living in love-in-God, truly bearing one another's burdens, being willing to sacrifice and to forgive, living from and for one another in Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Newman|first=Barbara |date= 1 January 2009|title= Charles Williams and the Companions of the Co-inherence |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/spiritus/v009/9.1.newman.html|journal= Spiritus: A Journal of Christian Spirituality |volume= 9 |issue= 1 |pages=1–26|doi=10.1353/scs.0.0043 |issn= 1535-3117}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gunnar Urang, co-inherence is the focus of all Williams's novels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Urang1971&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first= Gunnar |last=Urang |title= Shadows of heaven: religion and fantasy in the writing of C.S.

He undertakes an experiment using African lore to die and resurrect his own body thereby assuring his immortality. His followers begin a revolutionary movement to supplant European civilisation. The first of Williams's novels to be written, though not the first published.&lt;ref name=&quot;CWS&quot; /&gt;
* {{Cite book | title = [[Descent into Hell (novel)|Descent into Hell]] | year = 1937}} – Generally thought to be Williams's best novel, ''Descent'' deals with various forms of selfishness, and how the cycle of sin brings about the necessity for redemptive acts. In it, an academic becomes so far removed from the world that he fetishises a woman to the extent that his perversion takes the form of a [[succubus]]. Other characters include a [[doppelgänger]], the ghost of a suicidal [[Victorian era|Victorian]] labourer, and a playwright modelled in some ways on the author. Illustrates Williams's belief in the replacement of sin and substitutional love.
* {{Cite book | title = All Hallows' Eve | year = 1945}} – Opens with a discussion between the ghosts of two dead women wandering about London. Presents a theology of the arts in which an artwork can provide truth that the artist was not consciously aware of. Ultimately, the book explores the meaning of human suffering and empathy by dissolving the barrier between the living and the dead through both black magic and divine love.
