The '''Cyclades''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|k|l|ə|d|iː|z}}; {{lang-el|Κυκλάδες}} {{IPA-el|kikˈlaðes|}}) are an [[island group]] in the [[Aegean Sea]], southeast of mainland Greece and a former administrative [[prefectures of Greece|prefecture]] of Greece. They are one of the [[List of islands of Greece|island groups]] which constitute the Aegean [[archipelago]]. The name refers to the islands ''around'' (&quot;cyclic&quot;, κυκλάς) the sacred island of [[Delos]]. The largest island of the Cyclades is [[Naxos]].

==History==
{{main|History of the Cyclades}}
[[File:Harp player, Cycladic civilization - Greece.JPG|thumb|left|140px|''Harp player'', example of Cycladic art, at the National Archeological Museum, Athens]]

The significant Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age [[Cycladic culture]] is best known for its schematic, flat sculptures carved out of the islands' pure white marble centuries before the great Middle [[Bronze Age]] [[Minoan civilization]] arose in Crete to the south. (These figures have been looted from burials to satisfy a thriving Cycladic antiquities market since the early 20th century.)

A distinctive Neolithic culture amalgamating Anatolian and mainland Greek elements arose in the western Aegean before 4000 BCE, based on [[emmer]] and wild-type barley, sheep and goats, pigs, and tuna that were apparently speared from small boats (Rutter). Excavated sites include [[Chalandriani]], [[Phylakopi]], [[Skarkos]], [[Saliagos]] and Kephala (on [[Kea (island)|Kea]]) with signs of copperworking, Each of the small Cycladic islands could support no more than a few thousand people, though Late Cycladic boat models show that fifty oarsmen could be assembled from the scattered communities (Rutter), and when the highly organized palace-culture of Crete arose, the islands faded into insignificance, with the exception of Delos, which retained its archaic reputation as a sanctuary throughout antiquity and until the emergence of [[Christianity]].

===Archaeology===
[[File:Ancient Greek theatre in Delos 01.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient theatre, [[Delos]]]]

The first archaeological excavations of the 1880s were followed by systematic work by the [[British School at Athens]] and by [[Christos Tsountas]], who investigated burial sites on several islands in 1898–1899 and coined the term &quot;Cycladic civilization&quot;. Interest lagged, then picked up in the mid-20th century, as collectors competed for the modern-looking figures that seemed so similar to sculpture by [[Jean Arp]] or [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. Sites were looted and a brisk trade in forgeries arose. The context for many of these [[Cycladic art|Cycladic figurines]] has been mostly destroyed and their meaning may never be completely understood. 

Another intriguing and mysterious object is that of the Cycladic [[frying pans]]. More accurate [[archaeology]] has revealed the broad outlines of a farming and seafaring culture that had immigrated from [[Anatolia]] c. 5000 BCE. Early Cycladic culture evolved in three phases, between c.&amp;nbsp;3300 – 2000 BCE, when it was increasingly swamped in the rising influence of Minoan Crete. The culture of mainland Greece contemporary with Cycladic culture is known as the [[Helladic period]].

In recent decades the Cyclades have become popular with European and other [[tourism|tourists]], and as a result there have been problems with [[erosion]], [[pollution]], and water shortages.

==Geography==

The Cyclades comprise about 220 islands, the major ones being [[Amorgos]], [[Anafi]], [[Andros]], [[Antiparos]], [[Delos]], [[Ios (island)|Ios]], [[Kea (island)|Kea]], [[Kimolos]], [[Kythnos]], [[Milos]], [[Mykonos]], [[Naxos]], [[Paros]], [[Folegandros]], [[Serifos]], [[Sifnos]], [[Sikinos]], [[Syros]], [[Tinos]], and [[Santorini|Thira or Santoríni]]. There are also many minor islands including [[Donousa]], [[Eschati]], [[Gyaros]], [[Irakleia_(Cyclades)|Irakleia]], [[Koufonisia]], [[Makronisos]], [[Rineia]], and [[Schoinousa]]. The name &quot;Cyclades&quot; refers to the islands forming a circle (&quot;circular islands&quot;) around the sacred island of Delos. Most of the smaller islands are uninhabited.

[[Ermoupoli]] on Syros is the chief town and administrative center of the former prefecture.

The islands are peaks of a submerged mountainous terrain, with the exception of two [[volcano|volcanic islands]], Milos and Santorini. The climate is generally dry and mild, but with the exception of Naxos the soil is not very fertile; agricultural produce includes [[wine]], [[fruit]], [[wheat]], [[olive oil]], and [[tobacco]].  Lower temperatures are registered in higher elevations and these areas do not usually see wintry weather.

The Cyclades are bounded to the south by the [[Sea of Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;Saundry, Hogan &amp; Baum. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration==

The '''Cyclades Prefecture''' ({{lang-el|Νομός Κυκλάδων}}) was one of the [[prefectures of Greece]]. As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the prefecture was abolished, and its territory was divided into nine [[regional units of Greece|regional units]] of the [[South Aegean]] region:
* [[Andros]]
* [[Kea-Kythnos]]
* [[Milos (regional unit)|Milos]]
* [[Mykonos]]
* [[Naxos (regional unit)|Naxos]]
* [[Paros (regional unit)|Paros]]
* [[Thira (regional unit)|Thira]]
* [[Syros]]
* [[Tinos]]

===Municipalities and communities===

The prefecture was subdivided into the following municipalities and communities. These have been reorganised at the 2011 Kallikratis reform as well.
