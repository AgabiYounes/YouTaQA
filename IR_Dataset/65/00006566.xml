      <comment>Ireland, Zimbabwe and the Maldives are the Commonwealth nations who left on their own volition, each of which maintain English as an official language alongside others, and in the case of Ireland it is spoken by the majority of the population. Their variants adhere to British/Commonwealth spelling so addition of &quot;former&quot; is required. Also changed order of countries, adding Ireland and added better Commonwealth membership map.</comment>

The use of the [[English language]] in most current and former [[Member states of the Commonwealth of Nations|member countries]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] was inherited from [[British Empire|British colonisation]].  [[Mozambique]] is an exception â€“ although English is widely spoken there, it is a former Portuguese colony which joined the Commonwealth in 1996.  English is spoken as a first or second language in most of the Commonwealth. In a few countries, such as [[Languages of Cyprus|Cyprus]] and [[Languages of Malaysia|Malaysia]], it does not have [[official language|official status]], but is widely used as a [[lingua franca]].

Many regions, notably [[Australian English|Australia]], [[Brunei English|Brunei]], [[Canadian English|Canada]], [[Hong Kong English|Hong Kong]], [[Indian English|India]], [[Hiberno-English|Ireland]], [[Malaysian English|Malaysia]], [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]], [[Pakistani English|Pakistan]], [[Singapore English|Singapore]], [[South African English|South Africa]], [[Sri Lankan English|Sri Lanka]] and the [[Caribbean English|Caribbean]], have developed their own native varieties of the language.

Written English as used in the current and former Commonwealth generally favours British spelling as opposed to American, with some exceptions in Canada, where there is a strong influence from neighbouring American English (collectively, the US and Canadian dialects form [[North American English]]). Few said countries besides Canada and Australia have produced their own [[Dictionary|dictionaries]] and [[style guide]]s from major publishers, and rely on those produced in the United Kingdom, especially for formal writing.

The report of the Inter-Governmental Group on Criteria for Commonwealth Membership states that English is a symbol of Commonwealth heritage and unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://thecommonwealth.org/history-of-the-commonwealth/new-criteria-commonwealth-membership |title=New criteria for Commonwealth membership |work=TheCommonwealth.org |publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat |access-date=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Native varieties ==
[[Southern Hemisphere]] native varieties of English began to develop during the 18th century, with the colonisation of Australasia and South Africa. [[Australian English]] and [[New Zealand English]] are closely related to each other, and share some similarities with [[South African English]] (though it has unique influences from indigenous African languages, and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] influences it inherited along with the development of [[Afrikaans]] from Dutch). The vocabularies of these dialects draw from both [[British English]] (in the main) and [[American English]] (especially for recent terminology), as well as numerous native peculiarities.

[[Canadian English]] contains elements of British English and American English, as well as many Canadianisms and some French influences. It is the product of several waves of immigration and settlement, from Britain, Ireland, France, the United States, and around the world, over a period of almost two centuries. Modern Canadian English has taken significant vocabulary and spelling from the shared political and social institutions of Commonwealth countries.

=== The Caribbean ===
[[Caribbean English]] is influenced by the English-based [[Creole language|Creole]] varieties spoken, but they are not one and the same. There is a great deal of variation in the way English is spoken, with a &quot;Standard English&quot; at one end of a bipolar linguistic continuum and Creole languages at the other. These dialects have roots in 17th-century British and [[Irish English]], and [[African language]]s, plus localised influences from other [[Colonial Era|colonial]] languages including French, Spanish, and Dutch; unlike most native varieties of English, West Indian dialects often tend to be syllable-timed rather than [[Timing (linguistics)|stress-timed]].

== Non-native varieties ==

Second-language varieties of English in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] have often undergone &quot;indigenisation&quot;; that is, each English-speaking community has developed (or is in the process of developing) its own standards of usage, often under the influence of local languages. These dialects are sometimes referred to as ''New Englishes'' (McArthur, p.&amp;nbsp;36); most of them inherited [[Rhoticity in English|non-rhoticity]] from Southern British English.

=== Africa ===
Several dialects of [[West African English]] exist, with a lot of regional variation and some influence from indigenous languages. West African English tends to be [[Isochrony|syllable-timed]], and its phoneme inventory is much simpler than that of [[received pronunciation]]; this sometimes affects mutual intelligibility with native varieties of English. A distinctive [[East African English]], often with significant influences from Bantu languages such as [[Swahili language|Swahili]], is spoken in countries such as [[Kenya]] or [[Tanzania]], particularly in Nairobi and other cities where there is an expanding middle class, for whom English is increasingly being used in the home as the first language.

Small communities of native English speakers can be found in [[Zimbabwe]], [[Botswana]], and [[Namibia]]; the dialects spoken are similar to native [[South African English]].

=== Asia ===
[[India]] has the largest English-speaking population in the Commonwealth, although comparatively few speakers of [[Indian English]] are first-language speakers. The same is true of English spoken in other parts of South Asia, e.g. [[Pakistani English]], and [[Bangladeshi English]]. [[South Asia]]n English phonology is highly variable; stress, rhythm and intonation are generally different from those of native varieties. There are also several peculiarities at the levels of morphology, syntax and usage, some of which can also be found among educated speakers.

[[Southeast Asian English]] comprises [[Singapore English]], [[Malaysian English]], and [[Brunei English]]; it features some influence from [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] languages, as well as [[Indian English]].

[[Hong Kong]] ceased to be part of the Commonwealth in 1997. Nonetheless, [[Hong Kong English|the English language there]] still enjoys status as an official language.
