'''Andy Warhol''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɔːr|h|ɒ|l}};&lt;ref&gt;''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]'': [http://www.dictionary.com/browse/warhol &quot;Warhol&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; born '''Andrew Warhola'''; August 6, 1928&amp;nbsp;– February 22, 1987) was an American artist, film director, and producer who was a leading figure in the [[Art movement|visual art movement]] known as [[pop art]]. His works explore the relationship between artistic expression, [[advertising]], and [[celebrity culture]] that flourished by the 1960s, and span a variety of media, including painting, [[silkscreening]], photography, film, and sculpture. Some of his best known works include the silkscreen paintings ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'' (1962) and ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'' (1962), the experimental film ''[[Chelsea Girls]]'' (1966), and the [[multimedia]] events known as the ''[[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]]'' (1966–67).

Born and raised in [[Pittsburgh]], Warhol initially pursued a successful career as a [[commercial illustrator]]. After exhibiting his work in several [[art gallery|galleries]] in the late 1950s, he began to receive recognition as an influential and controversial artist. His [[New York City|New York]] studio, [[The Factory]], became a well-known gathering place that brought together distinguished [[intellectual]]s, [[drag queen]]s, playwrights, [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] street people, [[Hollywood]] celebrities, and wealthy patrons.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20181112&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Trebay |first1=Guy |last2=La Ferla |first2=Ruth |title=Tales From the Warhol Factory - In each of three successive spaces called the Factory, Andy Warhol created movies, paintings, time capsules and psychosexual dramas with a half-life of many decades.

In the late 1960s he managed and produced the [[experimental rock]] band [[The Velvet Underground]] and founded ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine. He authored numerous books, including ''[[The Philosophy of Andy Warhol]]'' and ''[[Popism: The Warhol Sixties]]''. He lived openly as a [[gay]] man before the [[gay liberation|gay liberation movement]]. After [[gallbladder]] [[surgery]], Warhol died of [[cardiac arrhythmia]] in February 1987 at the age of 58.

Warhol has been the subject of numerous retrospective [[art exhibition|exhibitions]], books, and [[I Shot Andy Warhol|feature]] and documentary films. [[The Andy Warhol Museum]] in his native city of Pittsburgh, which holds an extensive permanent collection of art and archives, is the largest museum in the United States dedicated to a single artist. Many of his creations are very collectible and highly valuable. The highest price ever paid for a Warhol painting is US$105&amp;nbsp;million for a 1963 [[canvas]] titled ''[[Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)]]''; his works include some of the [[List of most expensive paintings|most expensive paintings ever sold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/andy-warhol-painting-sells-105m-article-1.1516240 |title=Andy Warhol painting sells for $105M |work=New York Daily News |date=November 13, 2013 |accessdate=November 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 article in ''[[The Economist]]'' described Warhol as the &quot;[[bellwether]] of the art market&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14941229 |title=A special report on the art market: The Pop master's highs and lows |work=The Economist |date= November 26, 2009|accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life and beginnings (1928–1949)===
[[File:Andy Warhol's childhood home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Warhol's childhood home. 3252 Dawson Street, [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|South Oakland]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania]]
Warhol was born on August 6, 1928, in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://warholfoundation.org/legacy/biography.html |title=Andy Warhol: Biography |publisher=Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the fourth child of Ondrej Warhola (Americanized as Andrew Warhola, Sr., 1889–1942)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.warhola.com/biography.html |title=Biography |publisher=Warhola.com |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. Bockris, ''Warhol: The Biography'', Da Capo Press, 2009, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Julia Warhola|Julia]] (''[[née]]'' Zavacká, 1892–1972),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.warhola.com/andysmother.html |title=Mother |publisher=Warhola.com |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose first child was born in their homeland and died before their move to the U.S.

His parents were working-class [[Lemko]]&lt;ref&gt;Paul Robert Magocsi, Ivan Pop, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ovCVDLYN_JgC&amp;pg=PA539 ''Encyclopedia of Rusyn History and Culture''], [[University of Toronto Press]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Daggett Dillenberger, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KemglT-1jSIC&amp;pg=PA7 Religious Art of Andy Warhol], Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; emigrants from [[Miková|Mikó]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (now called Miková, located in today's northeastern [[Slovakia]]). Warhol's father emigrated to the United States in 1914, and his mother joined him in 1921, after the death of Warhol's grandparents. Warhol's father worked in a coal mine. The family lived at 55 Beelen Street and later at 3252 Dawson Street in the [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]] neighborhood of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bockris&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |first=Victor |last=Bockris |authorlink=Victor Bockris |title=The life and death of Andy Warhol |publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City |year=1989 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/lifedeathofandyw00bock/page/4 4–5] |isbn=0-553-05708-1 |oclc=19631216 |url=https://archive.org/details/lifedeathofandyw00bock/page/4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The family was [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Catholic]] and attended [[St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church (Pittsburgh)|St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church]]. Andy Warhol had two elder brothers—Pavol (Paul), the eldest, was born before the family emigrated; [[John Warhola|Ján]] was born in Pittsburgh. Pavol's son, [[James Warhola]], became a successful children's book illustrator.

In third grade, Warhol had [[Sydenham's chorea]] (also known as St. Vitus' Dance), the nervous system disease that causes involuntary movements of the extremities, which is believed to be a complication of [[Rheumatic fever|scarlet fever]] which causes skin pigmentation blotchiness.&lt;ref name=&quot;warhol.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warhol.org/collection/aboutandy/andyfaq/ |title=biography |publisher=warhol.org |accessdate=January 13, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106165536/http://www.warhol.org/collection/aboutandy/andyfaq/ |archivedate=January 6, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At times when he was confined to bed, he drew, listened to the radio and collected pictures of movie stars around his bed. Warhol later described this period as very important in the development of his personality, skill-set and preferences. When Warhol was 13, his father died in an accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/popart/Andy-Warhol.html |title=The Prince of Pop Art |publisher=Arthistoryarchive.com |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707153626/http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/popart/Andy-Warhol.html |archivedate=July 7, 2010 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager, Warhol graduated from [[Schenley High School]] in 1945. Also as a teen, Warhol won a [[Scholastic Art and Writing Awards|Scholastic Art and Writing Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=Scholastic Inc |date=March 14, 2016 |title=America's Most Creative Teens Names as National 2016 Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Award Recipients |url=http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/press-release/america-s-most-creative-teens-named-national-2016-scholastic-art-writing-awards-recipe }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from high school, his intentions were to study [[Visual arts education|art education]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in the hope of becoming an art teacher, but his plans changed and he enrolled in the Carnegie Institute of Technology, now [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in Pittsburgh, where he studied [[commercial art]]. During his time there, Warhol joined the campus Modern Dance Club and Beaux Arts Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andy Warhol: The College Years |url=http://www.warhol.org/responsive/event.aspx?id=2077 |website=The Andy Warhol Museum |accessdate=February 9, 2015|ref=warholmuse}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as art director of the student art magazine, ''Cano'', illustrating a cover in 1948&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.warhol.org/Warhol/Content/collection/art/earlywork/1998-1-1590 |title=Sprite Heads Playing Violins, 1948 |website=the warhol |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209190850/http://www.warhol.org/Warhol/Content/collection/art/earlywork/1998-1-1590/|archivedate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a full-page interior illustration in 1949.&lt;ref name=Blake&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gopnik|first1=Blake|title=Feb 9, 2015: The Daily Pic|url=http://blakegopnik.com/post/110535434580|website=Blake Gopnik on Art|accessdate=February 9, 2015|ref=gopnik}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are believed to be his first two published artworks.&lt;ref name=Blake/&gt; Warhol earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in pictorial design in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he moved to New York City and began a career in magazine illustration and [[advertising]].

===1950s===
Warhol's early career was dedicated to commercial and advertising art, where his first commission had been to draw shoes for ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' magazine in the late 1940s.&lt;ref name=foot/&gt; In the 1950s, Warhol worked as a [[Footwear|designer]] for shoe manufacturer Israel Miller.&lt;ref name=foot&gt;
Benstock, Shari and Suzanne Ferriss (editors). ''Footnotes: On Shoes'';  Rutgers University Press; February 1, 2001; {{ISBN|978-0813528717}}; pp. 44–48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Israel Miller see [[i.a.]] &quot;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/realestate/10scap.html A Little Jewel Box of a Shoe Store]&quot; by Christopher Gray, ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; American photographer John Coplans recalled that

{{quote|nobody drew shoes the way Andy did. He somehow gave each shoe a temperament of its own, a sort of sly, [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] kind of sophistication, but the shape and the style came through accurately and the buckle was always in the right place. The kids in the apartment [which Andy shared in New York – note by Coplans] noticed that the [[Shoe#Construction|vamp]]s on Andy's shoe drawings kept getting longer and longer but [Israel] Miller didn't mind. Miller loved them.}}

Warhol's &quot;whimsical&quot; [[Pen-and-ink drawing|ink drawing]]s of shoe advertisements figured in some of his earliest showings at the [[Bodley Gallery]] in New York.

Warhol was an early adopter of the [[Screen printing|silk screen]] printmaking process as a technique for making paintings.  A young Warhol was taught silk screen printmaking techniques by [[Max Arthur Cohn]] at his graphic arts business in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://americanart.si.edu/artist/max-arthur-cohn-935 &quot;Max Arthur Cohn&quot;] at SAAM.&lt;/ref&gt; While working in the shoe industry, Warhol developed his &quot;blotted line&quot; technique, applying ink to paper and then blotting the ink while still wet, which was akin to a [[printmaking]] process on the most rudimentary scale. His use of tracing paper and ink allowed him to repeat the basic image and also to create endless variations on the theme, a method that prefigures his 1960s silk-screen canvas.&lt;ref name=foot/&gt; In his book ''[[Popism: The Warhol Sixties]]'', Warhol writes: &quot;When you do something exactly wrong, you always turn up something.&quot;&lt;ref name=sherman&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SC0MCcfRsA8C&amp;pg=PA106 |title=Pop: The Genius of Andy Warhol|author= Tony Scherman|author2= David Dalton|publisher= HarperCollins|date= 2010 | isbn= 9780060936631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol habitually used the expedient of tracing photographs projected with an [[Opaque projector|epidiascope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Warhol, Andy | author2=Glozer, Laslo, 1936- | author3=Schellmann, Jörg | author4=Edition Schellmann | title=Andy Warhol, art from art | date=1994 | publisher=Edition Schellmann; München : Schirmer/Mosel | isbn=978-3-88814-725-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using prints by [[Edward Wallowitch]], his 'first boyfriend'&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Citation | author1=Koestenbaun, Wayne | title=Andy Warhol : a biography | date=2015 | publisher=New York, NY Open Road Integrated Media, Inc | isbn=978-1-4976-9989-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the photographs would undergo a subtle transformation during Warhol's often cursory tracing of contours and [[hatching]] of shadows. Warhol used Wallowitch's photograph ''Young Man Smoking a Cigarette'' (c.1956),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://flavorwire.com/573987/warhol-by-the-book-reveals-the-icons-fascinating-career-as-a-book-artist/8 |title=Edward Wallowitch ''Young Man Smoking a Cigarette'' (c.1956 Gelatin silver print).

With the rapid expansion of the [[record industry]], [[RCA Records]] hired Warhol, along with another freelance artist, Sid Maurer, to design album covers and promotional materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Andrew |last1=Oldham |authorlink=Andrew Loog Oldham |author2=Simon Spence |author3=Christine Ohlman |title=2Stoned |publisher=[[Secker and Warburg]] |location=London |year=2002 |isbn=0-436-28015-9 |oclc=50215773|page=137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andy Warhol's first New York solo [[pop art]] exhibition was hosted at Eleanor Ward's [[Stable Gallery]] November 6–24, 1962. The exhibit included the works ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'', ''100 Soup Cans'', ''100 Coke Bottles'', and ''100 Dollar Bills''. At the [[Stable Gallery]] exhibit, the artist met for the first time poet [[John Giorno]] who would star in Warhol's first film, ''[[Sleep (1963 film)|Sleep]]'', in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.warholstars.org/warhol/warhol1/warhol1b/johngiorno.html |work=www.warholstars.org |title=John Giorno }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during the 1960s that Warhol began to make paintings of iconic American objects such as dollar bills, [[mushroom cloud]]s, [[electric chair]]s, [[Campbell's Soup Cans]], [[Coca-Cola]] bottles, celebrities such as [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Marlon Brando]], [[Troy Donahue]], [[Muhammad Ali]], and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], as well as newspaper headlines or photographs of police dogs attacking African-American protesters during the [[Birmingham campaign]] in the [[civil rights movement]]. During these years, he founded his studio, &quot;[[The Factory]]&quot; and gathered about him a wide range of artists, writers, musicians, and underground celebrities. His work became popular and controversial. Warhol had this to say about Coca-Cola:

{{quote|What's great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coca-Cola, Liz Taylor drinks Coca-Cola, and just think, you can drink Coca-Cola, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good.

New York City's [[Museum of Modern Art]] hosted a Symposium on pop art in December 1962 during which artists such as Warhol were attacked for &quot;capitulating&quot; to consumerism. Critics were scandalized by Warhol's open embrace of market culture. This symposium set the tone for Warhol's reception.

A pivotal event was the 1964 exhibit ''The American Supermarket'', a show held in Paul Bianchini's Upper East Side gallery. The show was presented as a typical U.S. small supermarket environment, except that everything in it—from the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc.—was created by six prominent pop artists of the time, among them the controversial (and like-minded) [[Billy Apple]], Mary Inman, and [[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]]. Warhol's painting of a can of Campbell's soup cost $1,500 while each autographed can sold for $6. The exhibit was one of the first mass events that directly confronted the general public with both pop art and the perennial question of what art is.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Weitman, ''Pop Impressions Europe/USA: Prints and Multiples from the Museum of Modern Art'' (NY: Museum of Modern Art, 1999). {{ISBN|9780870700774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Andy Warhol by Jack Mitchell.jpg|thumb|Andy Warhol, between 1966 and 1977]]

As an [[Commercial art|advertisement illustrator]] in the 1950s, Warhol used assistants to increase his productivity. Collaboration would remain a defining (and controversial) aspect of his working methods throughout his career; this was particularly true in the 1960s. One of the most important collaborators during this period was [[Gerard Malanga]]. Malanga assisted the artist with the production of silkscreens, films, sculpture, and other works at &quot;[[The Factory]]&quot;, Warhol's [[aluminum foil]]-and-silver-paint-lined studio on 47th Street (later moved to Broadway). Other members of Warhol's Factory crowd included [[Freddie Herko]], [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]], [[Ronald Tavel]], [[Mary Woronov]], [[Billy Name]], and [[Brigid Berlin]] (from whom he apparently got the idea to tape-record his phone conversations).&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, Warhol also groomed a retinue of [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] and [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] eccentrics upon whom he bestowed the designation &quot;[[Warhol Superstar|Superstars]]&quot;, including [[Nico]], [[Joe Dallesandro]], [[Edie Sedgwick]], [[Viva (actress)|Viva]], [[Isabelle Collin Dufresne|Ultra Violet]], [[Holly Woodlawn]], [[Jackie Curtis]], and [[Candy Darling]]. These people all participated in the Factory films, and some—like Berlin—remained friends with Warhol until his death. Important figures in the New York underground art/cinema world, such as writer [[John Giorno]] and film-maker [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]], also appear in Warhol films (many premiering at the [[New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre]] and [[55th Street Playhouse]]) of the 1960s, revealing Warhol's connections to a diverse range of artistic scenes during this time. Less well known was his support and collaboration with several teenagers during this era, who would achieve prominence later in life including writer [[David Dalton (writer)|David Dalton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Menand|first1=Louis|title=Top of the Pops|work=New Yorker|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/01/11/top-of-the-pops|date=January 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; photographer [[Stephen Shore]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grow|first1=Krystal|title=Time Lightbox|url=http://lightbox.time.com/2014/09/23/stephen-shore-at-the-factory/#1|publisher=Time Inc.|date=September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and artist [[Bibbe Hansen]] (mother of pop musician [[Beck]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=Dagon|title=Billy Name:The Silver Age Black and White Photographs of Andy Warhol's Factory|date=2014|publisher=Reel Art Press|isbn=978-1909526174|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attempted murder (1968)====
On June 3, 1968, [[radical feminist]] writer [[Valerie Solanas]] shot Warhol and [[Mario Amaya]], art critic and curator, at Warhol's studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schaffner |first=Ingrid |authorlink=Ingrid Schaffner |title=The Essential Andy Warhol |publisher=[[Harry N. Abrams]] |location=New York City |page=79 |year=1999 |isbn=0-8109-5806-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the shooting, Solanas had been a marginal figure in the Factory scene. She authored in 1967 the ''[[S.C.U.M. Manifesto]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Solanas&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Valerie |last=Solanas |authorlink=Valerie Solanas |title=SCUM Manifesto |publisher=Verso |location=London |origyear=1967 |year=2004 |isbn=1-85984-553-3 |oclc=53932627|title-link=SCUM Manifesto }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Separatist feminism|separatist feminist]] tract that advocated the elimination of men; and appeared in the 1968 Warhol film ''[[I, a Man]]''. Earlier on the day of the attack, Solanas had been turned away from the Factory after asking for the return of a script she had given to Warhol. The script had apparently been misplaced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jobey&quot;&gt;Jobey, Liz, &quot;Solanas and Son,&quot; ''The Guardian'' (Manchester, England), August 24, 1996, p, T10 and following.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amaya received only minor injuries and was released from the hospital later the same day. Warhol was seriously wounded by the attack and barely survived: surgeons opened his chest and [[internal cardiac massage|massaged his heart]] to help stimulate its movement again. He suffered physical effects for the rest of his life, including being required to wear a surgical corset.&lt;ref name=&quot;warhol.org&quot;/&gt; The shooting had a profound effect on Warhol's life and art.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harding&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harding |first=James |title=The Simplest Surrealist Act: Valerie Solanas and the (Re)Assertion of Avantgarde Priorities |journal=[[TDR (journal)|TDR/The Drama Review]] |volume=45 |issue=4; Winter 2001 |pages=142–162 |doi=10.1162/105420401772990388 |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;popism287-295&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first1=Andy |last1=Warhol |author2=Pat Hacket |title=POPism: the Warhol '60s |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=New York |year=1980 |pages=287–295 |isbn=0-15-173095-4 |oclc=5673923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solanas was arrested the day after the assault, after turning herself in to police. By way of explanation, she said that Warhol &quot;had too much control over my life.&quot; She was subsequently diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]] and eventually sentenced to three years under the control of the [[New York City Department of Correction|Department of Corrections]]. After the shooting the Factory scene heavily increased its security, and for many the &quot;Factory 60s&quot; ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;popism287-295&quot;/&gt;

Warhol had this to say about the attack: &quot;Before I was shot, I always thought that I was more half-there than all-there—I always suspected that I was watching TV instead of living life. People sometimes say that the way things happen in movies is unreal, but actually it's the way things happen in life that's unreal. The movies make emotions look so strong and real, whereas when things really do happen to you, it's like watching television—you don't feel anything. Right when I was being shot and ever since, I knew that I was watching television. The channels switch, but it's all television.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;StilesSelz1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kristine Stiles |author2=Peter Howard Selz |title=Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: a Sourcebook of Artists' Writings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WXV-HlsUzdcC&amp;pg=PA345 |accessdate=January 13, 2013 |year=1996 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |isbn=978-0-520-20251-1 |pages=345– }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
[[File:Jimmy Carter Andy Warhol 1977.jpg|thumb|President [[Jimmy Carter]] and Warhol in 1977]]

Compared to the success and scandal of Warhol's work in the 1960s, the 1970s were a much quieter decade, as he became more entrepreneurial. According to [[Bob Colacello]], Warhol devoted much of his time to rounding up new, rich patrons for portrait commissions—including Shah of Iran [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], his wife Empress [[Farah Pahlavi]], his sister [[Princess Ashraf Pahlavi]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[John Lennon]], [[Diana Ross]], and [[Brigitte Bardot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8179627.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |title=Warhol's Jackson goes on display |date=August 7, 2009 |accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.artexpertswebsite.com/pages/artists/warhol.php |title=Andy Warhol Expert art authentication, certificates of authenticity and expert appraisers |website=www.artexpertswebsite.com |access-date=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warhol's famous portrait of Chinese Communist leader [[Mao Zedong]] was created in 1973. He also founded, with [[Gerard Malanga]], ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine, and published ''The Philosophy of Andy Warhol'' (1975). An idea expressed in the book: &quot;Making money is art, and working is art and good business is the best art.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Broughton |first=Philip Delves |title=The Art of the Sale |year=2012 |publisher=The Penguin Press |location=New York, NY |page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol socialized at various nightspots in New York City, including [[Max's Kansas City]] and, later in the 1970s, [[Studio 54]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maxskansascity.com/warhol/ |title=Andy Warhol Biography: From The Velvet Underground To Basquiat |accessdate=January 6, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107015819/http://www.maxskansascity.com/warhol/ |archivedate=January 7, 2009 |url-status=live}} {{unreliable source?|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was generally regarded as quiet, shy, and a meticulous observer. Art critic [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] called him &quot;the white mole of [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Robert |last=Hughes |author-link=Robert Hughes (critic) |date=February 18, 1982 |title=The Rise of Andy Warhol |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1982/02/18/the-rise-of-andy-warhol/ |magazine=The New York Review of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, along with his longtime friend [[Stuart Pivar]], Warhol founded the [[New York Academy of Art]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYM 1992&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gOMCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA28|title=What happened to Andy's Treasures|magazine=New York Magazine|publisher=New York Media|date=January 27, 1992|volume=25|number=4|page=28|accessdate=December 4, 2013|last1=Alexander|first1=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NOECAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA24|title=School for Scandal|magazine=New York Magazine|publisher=New York Media|date=April 8, 1996|volume=29|number=14|page=24|accessdate=December 4, 2013|last1=Connolly|first1=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
Warhol had a re-emergence of critical and financial success in the 1980s, partially due to his affiliation and friendships with a number of prolific younger artists, who were dominating the &quot;[[bull market]]&quot; of 1980s New York art: [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Julian Schnabel]], [[David Salle]] and other so-called [[Neo-expressionism|Neo-Expressionists]], as well as members of the [[Transavantgarde]] movement in Europe, including [[Francesco Clemente]] and [[Enzo Cucchi]]. Before the 1984 [[Sarajevo]] [[Winter Olympics]], he teamed with 15 other artists, including [[David Hockney]] and [[Cy Twombly]], and contributed a [[Speed Skater]] print to the Art and Sport collection. The Speed Skater was used for the official [[1984 Winter Olympics|Sarajevo Winter Olympics]] poster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aanddgallery.com/store/images/uploads/WarholWinterolympics.jpg|title=&quot;Speed Skater&quot; official 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics poster by Andy Warhol|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, [[graffiti]] artist [[Fab Five Freddy]] paid homage to Warhol when he painted an entire train with Campbell soup cans. This was instrumental in Freddy becoming involved in the underground NYC art scene and becoming an affiliate of Basquiat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hip Hop Family Tree|last=Piskor|first=Ed|publisher=Fantagraphics|year=2013|isbn=978-1606996904|location=|pages=|quote=|via=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/hiphopfamilytree0000pisk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this period, Warhol was being criticized for becoming merely a &quot;business artist&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;jpost&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|first=Michal |last=Lando |date=April 8, 2008 |title=Reexamining Warhol's Jews |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1207486218796&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |accessdate=January 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703204535/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1207486218796&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |archivedate=July 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, reviewers disliked his exhibits of portraits of 1970s personalities and celebrities, calling them superficial, facile and commercial, with no depth or indication of the significance of the subjects. They also criticized his 1980 exhibit of 10 portraits at the [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|Jewish Museum]] in Manhattan, entitled ''Jewish Geniuses'', which Warhol—who was uninterested in [[Judaism]] and Jews—had described in his diary as &quot;They're going to sell.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jpost&quot; /&gt; In hindsight, however, some critics have come to view Warhol's superficiality and commerciality as &quot;the most brilliant mirror of our times,&quot; contending that &quot;Warhol had captured something irresistible about the [[zeitgeist]] of American culture in the 1970s.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jpost&quot; /&gt;

Warhol also had an appreciation for intense [[Hollywood glamour]]. He once said: &quot;I love Los Angeles. I love Hollywood. They're so beautiful. Everything's plastic, but I love plastic. I want to be plastic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Victor |last1=Bockris |authorlink=Victor Bockris |author2=Gerard Malanga |title=Up-tight: the Velvet Underground story |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |location=London |year=2002 |page=66 |isbn=0-7119-9170-7 |oclc=49906101|author2-link=Gerard Malanga }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 Vanity Fair commissioned Warhol to produce a portrait of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], in order to accompany an article that celebrated the success of ''[[Purple Rain (album)|Purple Rain]]'' and [[Purple Rain (film)|its accompanying movie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2016/04/prince-at-the-height-of-his-powers|title=Purple Fame: An Appreciation of Prince at the Height of His Powers.

In the ''[[The Andy Warhol Diaries|Andy Warhol Diaries]]'', Warhol recorded how excited he was to see Prince and [[Billy Idol]] together at a party in the mid 1980s, and he compared them to the Hollywood movie stars of the 1950s and 1960s who also inspired his portraits: &quot;...{{nbsp}}seeing these two glamour boys, its like ''boys'' are the new Hollywood glamour girls, like [[Jean Harlow]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Andy Warhol diaries |date=2014 |last=Warhol |first=Andy |last2=Hackett |first2=Pat |isbn=9781455561452|edition= 1st Twelve |location=New York, NY |publisher=Twelve |oclc=881024850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol died in Manhattan at 6:32&amp;nbsp;a.m. on February 22, 1987, at age 58. According to news reports, he had been making a good recovery from [[gallbladder]] surgery at [[New York Hospital]] before dying in his sleep from a sudden post-operative [[cardiac arrhythmia|irregular heartbeat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/13/nyregion/hospital-asserts-it-gave-warhol-adequate-care.html |first=Robert O. |last=Boorstin |title=Hospital Asserts it Gave Warhol Adequate Care |date=April 13, 1987 |accessdate=January 2, 2009 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his diagnosis and operation, Warhol delayed having his recurring gallbladder problems checked, as he was afraid to enter hospitals and see doctors.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYM 1992&quot; /&gt; His family sued the hospital for inadequate care, saying that the arrhythmia was caused by improper care and [[water intoxication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sullivan |first=Ronald |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/05/nyregion/care-faulted-in-the-death-of-warhol.html |title=Care faulted in the death of warhol |work=The New York Times |date=December 5, 1991 |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The malpractice case was quickly settled out of court; Warhol's family received an undisclosed sum of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-12-24/news/9112240841_1_warhol-york-hospital-gallstones |title=Andy Warhol Heirs Settle Lawsuit With Hospital Over Artist's Death| work= Orlando Sentinel |publisher= |date=December 24, 1991 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before Warhol's death, doctors expected Warhol to survive the surgery, though a re-evaluation of the case about thirty years after his death showed many indications that Warhol's surgery was in fact riskier than originally thought.&lt;ref name=&quot;death-nyt&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gobnik|first1=Blake |title=Warhol's Death: Not So Simple, After All |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/21/arts/design/andy-warhols-death-not-so-routine-after-all.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=February 22, 2017 | url-status = live | archivedate = February 22, 2017 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2017%2F02%2F21%2Farts%2Fdesign%2Fandy-warhols-death-not-so-routine-after-all.html%3Faction%3Dclick%26contentCollection%3DU.S.%26module%3DTrending%26version%3DFull%26region%3DMarginalia%26pgtype%3Darticle&amp;date=2017-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was widely reported at the time that Warhol died of a &quot;routine&quot; surgery, though when considering factors such as his age, a [[Family history (medicine)|family history]] of gallbladder problems, his previous [[Ballistic trauma|gunshot wound]], and his medical state in the weeks leading up to the procedure, the potential risk of death following the surgery appeared to have been significant.&lt;ref name=&quot;death-nyt&quot; /&gt;

Warhol's brothers took his body back to Pittsburgh, where an open-coffin [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] was held at the Thomas P. Kunsak Funeral Home. The solid bronze casket had gold-plated rails and white upholstery. Warhol was dressed in a black cashmere suit, a paisley tie, a platinum wig, and sunglasses. He was laid out holding a small prayer book and a red rose. The funeral [[liturgy]] was held at the [[Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church (Pittsburgh)|Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church]] on Pittsburgh's [[North Shore (Pittsburgh)|North Side]]. The eulogy was given by Monsignor Peter Tay. [[Yoko Ono]] and [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]] were speakers. The coffin was covered with white roses and [[Asparagus aethiopicus|asparagus ferns]]. After the [[liturgy]], the coffin was driven to [[St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cemetery]] in [[Bethel Park, Pennsylvania|Bethel Park]], a south suburb of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

At the grave, the priest said a brief prayer and sprinkled holy water on the casket. Before the coffin was lowered, Paige Powell dropped a copy of ''Interview'' magazine, an ''Interview'' T-shirt, and a bottle of the [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estee Lauder]] perfume &quot;Beautiful&quot; into the grave. Warhol was buried next to his mother and father. A memorial service was held in Manhattan for Warhol on April 1, 1987, at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York]].

===Paintings===
By the beginning of the 1960s, [[pop art]] was an experimental form that several artists were independently adopting; some of these pioneers, such as [[Roy Lichtenstein]], would later become synonymous with the movement. Warhol, who would become famous as the &quot;Pope of Pop&quot;, turned to this new style, where popular subjects could be part of the artist's palette. His early paintings show images taken from [[cartoons]] and advertisements, hand-painted with paint drips. Marilyn Monroe was a pop art painting that Warhol had done and it was very popular. Those drips emulated the style of successful abstract expressionists (such as [[Willem de Kooning]]). Warhol's first pop art paintings were displayed in April 1961, serving as the backdrop for New York Department Store Bonwit Teller's window display. This was the same stage his Pop Art contemporaries [[Jasper Johns]], [[James Rosenquist]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]] had also once graced.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Patrick S (1986).

It was the gallerist Muriel Latow who came up with the ideas for both the soup cans and Warhol's dollar paintings. On November 23, 1961, Warhol wrote Latow a check for $50 which, according to the 2009 Warhol biography, ''Pop, The Genius of Warhol'', was payment for coming up with the idea of the soup cans as subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warholstars.org/art/warhol/soup.html |title=The Soup Cans—Andy Warhol |publisher=Warholstars.org |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801234441/http://www.warholstars.org/art/warhol/soup.html |archivedate=August 1, 2010 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; For his first major exhibition, Warhol painted his famous cans of Campbell's soup, which he claimed to have had for lunch for most of his life. A 1964 ''Large Campbell's Soup Can'' was sold in a 2007 [[Sotheby's]] auction to a South American collector for £5.1 million ($7.4 million).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://news.artnet.com/market/sothebys-100-million-contemporary-art-evening-sale-422258 Early Lucian Freud Painting Leads Sotheby’s $100 Million Contemporary Art Evening Sale]&quot; by Colin Gleadell, ''[[Artnet]]'', February 10, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

He loved [[celebrity|celebrities]], so he painted them as well. From these beginnings he developed his later style and subjects. Instead of working on a signature subject matter, as he started out to do, he worked more and more on a signature style, slowly eliminating the handmade from the artistic process. Warhol frequently used [[silk-screen]]ing; his later drawings were traced from slide projections. At the height of his fame as a painter, Warhol had several assistants who produced his silk-screen multiples, following his directions to make different versions and variations.&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Warhol was commissioned by BMW to paint a Group-4 race version of the then &quot;elite supercar&quot; [[BMW M1]] for the fourth installment in the [[BMW Art Car Project]]. It was reported at the time that, unlike the three artists before him, Warhol opted to paint directly onto the automobile himself instead of letting technicians transfer his scale-model design to the car.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060525054033/http://www.carbodydesign.com/archive/2006/03/27-bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1/Andy-Warhol-lg.jpg Bmw Art Car 1979: M1 by Andy Warhol], ''Car Body Design'', March 27, 2006 (archived)&lt;/ref&gt; It was indicated that Warhol spent only a total of 23 minutes to paint the entire car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbodydesign.com/archive/2006/03/27-bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1/bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213000309/http://www.carbodydesign.com/archive/2006/03/27-bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1/bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1.php |archivedate=February 13, 2010 |title=Bmw Art Car 1979: M1 by Andy Warhol |publisher=carbodydesign.com |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol produced both comic and serious works; his subject could be a soup can or an electric chair. Warhol used the same techniques—silkscreens, reproduced serially, and often painted with bright colors—whether he painted celebrities, everyday objects, or images of suicide, car crashes, and disasters, as in the 1962–63 ''Death and Disaster'' series. The ''Death and Disaster'' paintings included ''Red Car Crash'', ''Purple Jumping Man'', and ''Orange Disaster.'' One of these paintings, the diptych ''Silver Car Crash'', became the highest priced work of his when it sold at Sotheby's Contemporary Art Auction on Wednesday, November 13, 2013, for $105.4 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;sothebys.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sothebys.com/content/sothebys/en/news-video/blogs/all-blogs/contemporary/2013/11/record-warhol-leads-.html |title=Record Warhol Leads Contemporary Sale |website=Sotheby's |date=November 14, 2013 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Warhol's work, as well as his own personality, has been described as being [[Buster Keaton|Keatonesque]]. Warhol has been described as playing dumb to the media. He sometimes refused to explain his work.

His cow wallpaper (literally, wallpaper with a cow [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]) and his [[redox|oxidation]] paintings (canvases prepared with copper paint that was then oxidized with urine) are also noteworthy in this context. Equally noteworthy is the way these works—and their [[means of production]]—mirrored the atmosphere at Andy's New York &quot;Factory&quot;. Biographer Bob Colacello provides some details on Andy's &quot;piss paintings&quot;:

{{quote|Victor&amp;nbsp;... was Andy's ghost pisser on the Oxidations. He would come to the Factory to urinate on canvases that had already been primed with copper-based paint by Andy or [[Ronnie Cutrone]], a second ghost pisser much appreciated by Andy, who said that the vitamin B that Ronnie took made a prettier color when the acid in the urine turned the copper green. Did Andy ever use his own urine? My diary shows that when he first began the series, in December 1977, he did, and there were many others: boys who'd come to lunch and drink too much wine, and find it funny or even flattering to be asked to help Andy 'paint'. Andy always had a little extra bounce in his walk as he led them to his studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Bob |last=Colacello |authorlink=Bob Colacello |title=Holy terror: Andy Warhol close up |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |year=1990 |page=343 |isbn=0-06-016419-0 |oclc=21196706}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Warhol's first portrait of ''Basquiat'' (1982) is a black photo-silkscreen over an oxidized copper &quot;piss painting&quot;.

After many years of silkscreen, oxidation, photography, etc., Warhol returned to painting with a brush in hand in a series of more than 50 large collaborative works done with [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]] between 1984 and 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Chiappini, Rudi (ed.), ''Jean-Michel Basquiat''.

Andy Warhol was commissioned in 1984 by collector and gallerist [[Alexander Iolas]] to produce work based on [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' for an exhibition at the old refectory of the Palazzo delle Stelline in [[Milan]], opposite from the [[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)|Santa Maria delle Grazie]] where Leonardo da Vinci's mural can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Schmuckli, [http://pastexhibitions.guggenheim.org/warhol/ &quot;Andy Warhol: The Last Supper&quot; (June 1999 – December 2001)] [[Guggenheim Museum SoHo]].

Artist [[Maurizio Cattelan]] describes that it is difficult to separate daily encounters from the art of Andy Warhol: &quot;That's probably the greatest thing about Warhol: the way he penetrated and summarized our world, to the point that distinguishing between him and our everyday life is basically impossible, and in any case useless.&quot; Warhol was an inspiration towards Cattelan's magazine and photography compilations, such as ''Permanent Food, Charley'', and ''Toilet Paper''.&lt;ref&gt;Spector, Nancy.

Warhol worked across a wide range of media—painting, photography, drawing, and sculpture. In addition, he was a highly prolific filmmaker. Between 1963 and 1968, he made more than 60 films,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0912238/|title=Andy Warhol Filmography|work=The Internet Movie Database|accessdate=September 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus some 500 short black-and-white &quot;[[Screen Tests|screen test]]&quot; portraits of Factory visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffner (1999), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his most famous films, ''[[Sleep (1963 film)|Sleep]]'', monitors poet [[John Giorno]] sleeping for six hours. The 35-minute film ''[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]]'' is one continuous shot of the face of [[DeVeren Bookwalter]] supposedly receiving [[oral sex]] from filmmaker [[Willard Maas]], although the camera never tilts down to see this. Another, ''[[Empire (1964 film)|Empire]]'' (1964), consists of eight hours of footage of the [[Empire State Building]] in New York City at dusk. The film ''[[Eat (film)|Eat]]'' consists of a man eating a mushroom for 45 minutes. Warhol attended the 1962 premiere of the static composition by [[LaMonte Young]] called ''Trio for Strings'' and subsequently created his famous series of static films including ''Kiss'', ''Eat'', and ''Sleep'' (for which Young initially was commissioned to provide music). Uwe Husslein cites filmmaker [[Jonas Mekas]], who accompanied Warhol to the Trio premiere, and who claims Warhol's static films were directly inspired by the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Uwe |last=Husslein |title=Pop goes art: Andy Warhol &amp; Velvet Underground |publisher=Wuppertal |year=1990 |oclc=165575494}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Batman Dracula]]'' is a 1964 film that was produced and directed by Warhol, without the permission of [[DC Comics]]. It was screened only at his art exhibits. A fan of the ''Batman''  series, Warhol's movie was an &quot;homage&quot; to the series, and is considered the first appearance of a blatantly [[Camp (style)|campy]] Batman. The film was until recently thought to have been lost, until scenes from the picture were shown at some length in the 2006 documentary ''[[Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis]]''.

Warhol's 1965 film ''[[Vinyl (1965 film)|Vinyl]]'' is an adaptation of [[Anthony Burgess]]' popular [[dystopia]]n novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. Others record improvised encounters between Factory regulars such as [[Brigid Berlin]], [[Viva (actress)|Viva]], [[Edie Sedgwick]], [[Candy Darling]], [[Holly Woodlawn]], [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]], [[Nico]], and [[Jackie Curtis]]. Legendary underground artist [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]] appears in the film ''Camp''.

His most popular and critically successful film was ''[[Chelsea Girls]]'' (1966). The film was highly innovative in that it consisted of two [[16 mm film|16 mm]]-films being projected simultaneously, with two different stories being shown in tandem. From the projection booth, the sound would be raised for one film to elucidate that &quot;story&quot; while it was lowered for the other. The multiplication of images evoked Warhol's seminal silk-screen works of the early 1960s.

After his June 3, 1968 shooting, a reclusive Warhol relinquished his personal involvement in filmmaking. His acolyte and assistant director, [[Paul Morrissey]], took over the film-making chores for [[the Factory]] collective, steering Warhol-branded cinema towards more mainstream, narrative-based, B-movie [[exploitation film|exploitation]] fare with ''[[Flesh (1968 film)|Flesh]]'', ''[[Trash (1970 film)|Trash]]'', and ''[[Heat (1972 film)|Heat]]''. All of these films, including the later ''[[Blood for Dracula|Andy Warhol's Dracula]]'' and ''[[Flesh for Frankenstein|Andy Warhol's Frankenstein]]'', were far more mainstream than anything Warhol as a director had attempted. These latter &quot;Warhol&quot; films starred [[Joe Dallesandro]]—more of a Morrissey star than a true [[Warhol superstar]].

In the early 1970s, most of the films directed by Warhol were pulled out of circulation by Warhol and the people around him who ran his business. After Warhol's death, the films were slowly restored by the Whitney Museum and are occasionally projected at museums and film festivals. Few of the Warhol-directed films are available on video or DVD.

===Music===
In the mid-1960s, Warhol adopted the band [[the Velvet Underground]], making them a crucial element of the [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]] multimedia performance art show. Warhol, with [[Paul Morrissey]], acted as the band's manager, introducing them to [[Nico]] (who would perform with the band at Warhol's request). While managing [[The Velvet Underground]], Andy would have them dressed in all black to perform in front of movies that he was also presenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Please kill me : the uncensored oral history of punk|others=McNeil, Legs,, McCain, Gillian|isbn=9780802125361|edition= Twentieth anniversary |location=New York|oclc=955634990|last1 = McNeil|first1 = Legs|year = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 he &quot;produced&quot; their first album ''[[The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico]]'', as well as providing its album art. His actual participation in the album's production amounted to simply paying for the studio time. After the band's first album, Warhol and band leader [[Lou Reed]] started to disagree more about the direction the band should take, and their artistic friendship ended.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In 1989, after Warhol's death, Reed and [[John Cale]] re-united for the first time since 1972 to write, perform, record and release the concept album ''[[Songs for Drella]]'', a tribute to Warhol.

Warhol designed many album covers for various artists starting with the photographic cover of [[John Wallowitch]]'s debut album, ''This Is John Wallowitch!!!'' (1964). He designed the cover art for [[The Rolling Stones]]' albums ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971) and ''[[Love You Live]]'' (1977), and the [[John Cale]] albums ''[[The Academy in Peril]]'' (1972) and ''[[Honi Soit (album)|Honi Soit]]'' in 1981. One of Warhol's last works was a portrait of [[Aretha Franklin]] for the cover of her 1986 [[Music recording sales certification|gold album]] ''[[Aretha (1986 album)|Aretha]]'', which was done in the style of the ''Reigning Queens'' series he had completed the year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bego | first = Mark |title =Aretha Franklin: The Queen of Soul |publisher=Da Capo Press |year = 2001 | page = 250 |isbn = 0-306-80935-4 |oclc = 46488152 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=ErKigdCXUwoC&amp;pg=PA250&amp;dq=warhol+album+cover+1986 | accessdate=March 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol strongly influenced the [[New wave music|new wave]]/[[punk rock]] band [[Devo]], as well as [[David Bowie]]. Bowie recorded a song called &quot;[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]&quot; for his 1971 album ''[[Hunky Dory]]''. Lou Reed wrote the song &quot;Andy's Chest&quot;, about [[Valerie Solanas]], the woman who shot Warhol, in 1968. He recorded it with the Velvet Underground, and this version was released on the ''[[VU (album)|VU]]'' album in 1985. Bowie would later play Warhol in the 1996 movie, ''[[Basquiat (film)|Basquiat]]''. Bowie recalled how meeting Warhol in real life helped him in the role, and recounted his early meetings with him:

{{quote|I met him a couple of times, but we seldom shared more than platitudes. The first time we saw each other an awkward silence fell till he remarked my bright yellow shoes and started talking enthusiastically. He wanted to be very superficial. And seemingly emotionless, indifferent, just like a dead fish. Lou Reed described him most profoundly when he once told me they should bring a doll of Andy on the market: a doll that you wind up and doesn't do anything. But I managed to observe him well, and that was a helping hand for the film [''Basquiat''...] We borrowed his clothes from the museum in Pittsburgh, and they were intact, unwashed. Even the pockets weren't emptied: they contained pancake, white, deadly pale ''{{abbr|fond de teint|foundation}}'' which Andy always smeared on his face, a check torn in pieces, someone's address, lots of homeopathic pills and a wig. Andy always wore those silver wigs, but he never admitted it were wigs. One of his hairdressers has told me lately that he had his wigs regularly cut, like it were real hair. When the wig was trimmed, he put on another next month as if his hair had grown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=http://www.algonet.se/~bassman/articles/95/h.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130616041825/http://www.algonet.se/~bassman/articles/95/h.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 16, 2013 |title=Can the Real David Bowie Rise, Please? |magazine=HUMO Magazine |date=December 5, 1995 |accessdate=June 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}The band [[Triumph (band)|Triumph]] also wrote a song about Andy Warhol, &quot;Stranger In A Strange Land&quot; off their 1984 album [[Thunder Seven]].

===Books and print===
[[File:Warhol autograph.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Warhol drawing and signature]]
Beginning in the early 1950s, Warhol produced several unbound portfolios of his work.

The first of several bound self-published books by Warhol was ''[[25 Cats Name Sam and One Blue Pussy]]'', printed in 1954 by Seymour Berlin on Arches brand watermarked paper using his blotted line technique for the lithographs. The original edition was limited to 190 numbered, hand colored copies, using Dr. Martin's ink washes. Most of these were given by Warhol as gifts to clients and friends. Copy No. 4, inscribed &quot;Jerry&quot; on the front cover and given to [[Geraldine Stutz]], was used for a facsimile printing in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John |last=Russell |authorlink=John Russell (art critic) |date=December 6, 1987 |title=Art |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/06/books/art.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=January 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the original was auctioned in May 2006 for US$35,000 by [[Doyle New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doylenewyork.com/default.htm May 3, 2006, auction at Doyle New York].

* ''[[A, a novel|a, A Novel]]'' (1968, {{ISBN|0-8021-3553-6}}) is a literal transcription—containing spelling errors and phonetically written background noise and mumbling—of audio recordings of [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]] and several of Andy Warhol's friends hanging out at the Factory, talking, going out.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* ''[[The Philosophy of Andy Warhol]] (From A to B &amp; Back Again)'' (1975, {{ISBN|0-15-671720-4}})—according to Pat Hackett's introduction to ''The Andy Warhol Diaries'', Pat Hackett did the transcriptions and text for the book based on daily phone conversations, sometimes (when Warhol was traveling) using audio cassettes that Andy Warhol gave her. Said cassettes contained conversations with [[Brigid Berlin]] (also known as Brigid Polk) and former ''Interview'' magazine editor [[Bob Colacello]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* ''[[Popism: The Warhol Sixties]]'' (1980, {{ISBN|0-15-672960-1}}), authored by Warhol and Pat Hackett, is a retrospective view of the 1960s and the role of pop art.
* ''[[The Andy Warhol Diaries]]'' (1989, {{ISBN|0-446-39138-7}}), edited by Pat Hackett, is a diary dictated by Warhol to Hackett in daily phone conversations. Warhol started the diary to keep track of his expenses after being audited, although it soon evolved to include his personal and cultural observations.&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol created the fashion magazine ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' that is still published today. The loopy title script on the cover is thought to be either his own handwriting or that of his mother, Julia Warhola, who would often do text work for his early commercial pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other media===
Although Andy Warhol is most known for his paintings and films, he authored works in many different media.

* '''Drawing:''' Warhol started his career as a commercial illustrator, producing drawings in &quot;blotted-ink&quot; style for advertisements and magazine articles. Best known of these early works are his drawings of shoes. Some of his personal drawings were self-published in small booklets, such as ''Yum, Yum, Yum'' (about food), ''Ho, Ho, Ho'' (about Christmas) and ''Shoes, Shoes, Shoes''. His most artistically acclaimed book of drawings is probably ''A Gold Book'', compiled of sensitive drawings of young men. ''A Gold Book'' is so named because of the [[gold leaf]] that decorates its pages.&lt;ref name=Bourdon51&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdon |first=David |title=Warhol |publisher=Harry N.

The image was said to have been drawn when Andy was nine or 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-17591826 |title='Andy Warhol sketch found' in US garage sale |date=April 2, 2012 |accessdate=April 3, 2012 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various authorities have challenged the image's authenticity.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
* '''Sculpture:''' Warhol's most famous sculpture is probably his ''Brillo Boxes'', silkscreened ink on wood replicas of the large, branded cardboard boxes used to hold 24 packages of [[Brillo]] soap pads. The original Brillo design was by commercial artist [[James Harvey (artist)|James Harvey]]. Warhol's sculpture was part of a series of &quot;grocery carton&quot; works that also included Heinz ketchup and Campbell's tomato juice cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;365 Takes&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Staff of The Andy Warhol Museum |title=Andy Warhol: 365 Takes |publisher=Harry N.

A ''Silver Cloud'' was included in the traveling exhibition ''Air Art'' (1968–1969) curated by [[Willoughby Sharp]]. ''Clouds'' was also adapted by Warhol for [[avant-garde]] choreographer Merce Cunningham's dance piece ''RainForest'' (1968).&lt;ref name=Bourdon231&gt;{{cite book |last=Bourdon |first=David |title=Warhol |publisher=Harry N.

* '''Audio:''' At one point Warhol carried a portable recorder with him wherever he went, taping everything everybody said and did. He referred to this device as his &quot;wife&quot;. Some of these tapes were the basis for his literary work. Another audio-work of Warhol's was his ''Invisible Sculpture'', a presentation in which burglar alarms would go off when entering the room. Warhol's cooperation with the musicians of The Velvet Underground was driven by an expressed desire to become a music producer.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* '''Time Capsules:''' In 1973, Warhol began saving ephemera from his daily life—correspondence, newspapers, souvenirs, childhood objects, even used plane tickets and food—which was sealed in plain cardboard boxes dubbed Time Capsules. By the time of his death, the collection grew to include 600, individually dated &quot;capsules&quot;. The boxes are now housed at the Andy Warhol Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Staff of The Andy Warhol Museum |title=Andy Warhol: 365 Takes |publisher=Harry N.

* '''Television:''' Andy Warhol dreamed of a [[television special]] about a favorite subject of his{{dash}}[[Nothing]]{{dash}}that he would call ''The Nothing Special''. Later in his career he did create two cable television shows, ''Andy Warhol's TV'' in 1982 and ''[[Andy Warhol's Fifteen Minutes]]'' (based on his famous &quot;[[fifteen minutes of fame]]&quot; quotation) for MTV in 1986. Besides his own shows he regularly made guest appearances on other programs, including ''[[The Love Boat]]'' wherein a Midwestern wife ([[Marion Ross]]) fears Andy Warhol will reveal to her husband ([[Tom Bosley]], who starred alongside Ross in sitcom ''[[Happy Days]]'') her secret past as a Warhol superstar named Marina del Rey. Warhol also produced a TV commercial for [[Schrafft's]] Restaurants in New York City, for an ice cream dessert appropriately titled the &quot;Underground Sundae&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joedallesandro.com/sundae.htm |title=Underground Sundae |year=2005 |first=Michael |last=Ferguson |accessdate=January 6, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116182237/http://www.joedallesandro.com/sundae.htm |archivedate=January 16, 2009 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Performance Art:''' Warhol and his friends staged theatrical multimedia happenings at parties and public venues, combining music, film, slide projections and even Gerard Malanga in an [[Sadomasochism|S&amp;M]] outfit cracking a whip. The [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]] in 1966 was the culmination of this area of his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bourdon221-225&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdon |first=David |title=Warhol |publisher=Harry N.

* '''Theater:''' Andy Warhol's ''Pork'' opened on May 5, 1971, at LaMama theater in New York for a two-week run and was brought to the Roundhouse in London for a longer run in August 1971. ''Pork'' was based on tape-recorded conversations between Brigid Berlin and Andy during which Brigid would play for Andy tapes she had made of phone conversations between herself and her mother, socialite Honey Berlin. The play featured [[Jayne County]] as &quot;Vulva&quot; and [[Cherry Vanilla]] as &quot;Amanda Pork&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warhol.org/responsive/event.aspx?id=2215|accessdate=January 19, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126195518/http://www.warhol.org/responsive/event.aspx?id=2215|work=warhol.org|title=Talk on the Wild Side: The Effect of Andy Warhol's PORK on the evolution of Glitter, Glam and Punk Rock|archivedate=January 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Andy Warhol also produced the stage musical ''[[Man on the Moon (musical)|Man on the Moon]]'', which was written by [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]] of the [[Mamas and the Papas]].

* '''Photography:''' To produce his silkscreens, Warhol made photographs or had them made by his friends and assistants. These pictures were mostly taken with a specific model of [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] camera, The Big Shot, that Polaroid kept in production especially for Warhol. This photographic approach to painting and his snapshot method of taking pictures has had a great effect on artistic photography. Warhol was an accomplished photographer, and took an enormous number of photographs of Factory visitors, friends.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.casualphotophile.com/2019/04/29/the-big-shot-polaroid-andy-warhols-pen-pencil/|title=The Big Shot Polaroid – Andy Warhol’s Pen &amp; Pencil|date=2019-04-29|website=Casual Photophile|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Computer:''' Warhol used [[Amiga]] computers to generate digital art, including ''[[You Are the One (Andy Warhol)|You Are the One]]'', which he helped design and build with Amiga, Inc. He also displayed the difference between slow fill and fast fill on live TV with [[Debbie Harry]] as a model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nowseethis.org/invisiblephoto/posts/108 |title=Andy Warhol's Amiga Experiments |year=2014 |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oqUd8utr14 video])

===Producer and product===
He founded the gossip magazine ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'', a stage for celebrities he &quot;endorsed&quot; and a business staffed by his friends. He collaborated with others on all of his books (some of which were written with Pat Hackett.) He adopted the young painter [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], and the band [[The Velvet Underground]], presenting them to the public as his latest interest, and collaborating with them. One might even say that he produced people (as in the Warholian &quot;Superstar&quot; and the Warholian portrait). He endorsed products, appeared in commercials, and made frequent celebrity guest appearances on television shows and in films (he appeared in everything from ''[[Love Boat]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Matheson | first=Whitney | date=August 6, 2013 | title=See six of Warhol's best film/TV appearances | work=[[USA Today]] | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/popcandy/2013/08/06/andy-warhol-video/2623869/ | access-date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | last1=Munroe | first1=Don | last2=Fremont | first2=Vincent | last3=Etkin | first3=Sue | date=October 10, 1981 | title=Andy Warhol's TV: Makeup and Death | language = English | publisher=[[NBC]] | url=http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/warhol-film/n8846?snl=1 | access-date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Richard Pryor]] movie ''Dynamite Chicken''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | department=Obituaries | date=February 7, 2002 | title=Ernest Pintoff, 70; Animator Won Oscar | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/feb/07/local/me-pintoff7 | access-date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The fact that Warhol's homosexuality influenced his work and shaped his relationship to the art world is a major subject of scholarship on the artist and is an issue that Warhol himself addressed in interviews, in conversation with his contemporaries, and in his publications (''e.g.'', ''Popism: The Warhol 1960s''). Throughout his career, Warhol produced erotic photography and drawings of male nudes. Many of his most famous works (portraits of [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Judy Garland]], and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], and films such as ''[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]]'', ''My Hustler'' and ''[[Lonesome Cowboys (1968 film)|Lonesome Cowboys]]'') draw from gay underground culture or openly explore the complexity of sexuality and desire. As has been addressed by a range of scholars, many of his films premiered in [[gay porn]] theaters, including the New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre and 55th Street Playhouse, in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas|last=Waugh|title=Hard to Imagine: Gay Male eroticism in Photography and Film from the Beginnings to Stonewall|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York City|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first works that Warhol submitted to a fine art gallery, homoerotic drawings of male nudes, were rejected for being too openly gay.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; In ''Popism'', furthermore, the artist recalls a conversation with the film maker [[Emile de Antonio]] about the difficulty Warhol had being accepted socially by the then-more-famous (but [[closeted]]) gay artists [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. De Antonio explained that Warhol was &quot;too swish and that upsets them.&quot; In response to this, Warhol writes, &quot;There was nothing I could say to that. It was all too true. So I decided I just wasn't going to care, because those were all the things that I didn't want to change anyway, that I didn't think I 'should' want to change&amp;nbsp;...

Some have suggested that his frequent refusal to comment on his work, to speak about himself (confining himself in interviews to responses like &quot;Um, no&quot; and &quot;Um, yes&quot;, and often allowing others to speak for him)—and even the evolution of his pop style—can be traced to the years when Warhol was first dismissed by the inner circles of the New York art world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fairbrother&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fairbrother |first=Trevor |chapter=Tomorrow's Man |title=Success Is a Job in New York: the Early Art and Business of Andy Warhol |editor-first=Donna|editor-last=De Salvo |location=New York |publisher=Grey Art Gallery and Study Center |date=1989 |pages=55–74 |isbn=0-934349-05-3 |oclc=19826995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious beliefs===
[[File:WarholLastSup.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|Images of Jesus from ''The [[Last Supper]]'' cycle (1986). Warhol made almost 100 variations on the theme, which the [[Solomon R.

Warhol was a practicing [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Catholic]]. He regularly volunteered at [[homeless shelter]]s in New York City, particularly during the busier times of the year, and described himself as a religious person.&lt;ref name=&quot;godspy-Warhol&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|first=James |last=Romaine |date=November 12, 2003 |title=Transubstantiating the Culture: Andy Warhol's Secret |url=http://oldarchive.godspy.com/culture/Andy-Warhol-Transubstantiating-the-Culture.cfm.html |journal=[[Godspy]] |accessdate=January 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Warhol's later works depicted religious subjects, including two series, ''Details of Renaissance Paintings'' (1984) and ''The Last Supper'' (1986). In addition, a body of religious-themed works was found posthumously in his estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;godspy-Warhol&quot;/&gt;

During his life, Warhol regularly attended [[Mass (liturgy)|Liturgy]], and the priest at Warhol's church, [[Church of St. Vincent Ferrer (New York)|Saint Vincent Ferrer]], said that the artist went there almost daily,&lt;ref name=&quot;godspy-Warhol&quot;/&gt; although he was not observed taking [[Eucharist#Catholic|Communion]] or going to [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Confession]] and sat or knelt in the pews at the back.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warhol at SVFC&quot;/&gt; The priest thought he was afraid of being recognized; Warhol said he was self-conscious about being seen in a [[Roman Rite]] church [[sign of the Cross|crossing himself]] &quot;in the [[Byzantine Rite|Orthodox]] way&quot; (right to left instead of the reverse).&lt;ref name=&quot;Warhol at SVFC&quot;/&gt;

His art is noticeably influenced by the [[Eastern Christian]] tradition which was so evident in his places of worship.&lt;ref name=&quot;godspy-Warhol&quot;/&gt;

Warhol's brother has described the artist as &quot;really religious, but he didn't want people to know about that because [it was] private&quot;. Despite the private nature of his faith, in Warhol's [[eulogy]] [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]] depicted it as devout: &quot;To my certain knowledge, he was responsible for at least one [[Conversion to Christianity|conversion]]. He took considerable pride in financing his nephew's studies for the priesthood&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;godspy-Warhol&quot;/&gt;

===Collections===
Warhol was an avid collector. His friends referred to his numerous collections, which filled not only his four-story [[townhouse]], but also a nearby storage unit, as &quot;Andy's Stuff.&quot; The true extent of his collections was not discovered until after his death, when [[The Andy Warhol Museum]] in Pittsburgh took in 641 boxes of his &quot;Stuff.&quot;

Warhol's collections included a Coca-Cola memorabilia sign, and 19th century paintings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-05-08/entertainment/ca-3738_1_pop-art|title=Warhol: Pop Artist or Crusader for Tradition?|last=MUCHNIC|first=SUZANNE|date=May 8, 1988|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=February 26, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with airplane menus, unpaid invoices, pizza dough, pornographic pulp novels, newspapers, stamps, supermarket flyers, and cookie jars, among other eccentricities. It also included significant works of art, such as [[George Bellows]]'s ''[[Miss Bentham]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barber.org.uk/american-acquisition-barber/ |title=American Acquisition |publisher=Barber Institute of Fine Arts |accessdate=February 16, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217000620/http://barber.org.uk/american-acquisition-barber/ |archivedate=February 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his main collections was his [[wig]]s. Warhol owned more than 40 and felt very protective of his hairpieces, which were sewn by a New York wig-maker from hair imported from Italy. In 1985 a girl snatched Warhol's wig off his head. It was later discovered in Warhol's diary entry for that day that he wrote: &quot;I don't know what held me back from pushing her over the balcony.&quot;

In 1960, he had bought a drawing of a light bulb by [[Jasper Johns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Goldsmith|first=Kenneth|title=Capital: New York, Capital of the 20th Century|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another item found in Warhol's boxes at the museum in Pittsburgh was a [[mummy|mummified]] human foot from [[Ancient Egypt]]. The curator of anthropology at [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]] felt that Warhol most likely found it at a flea market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inktank.fi/the-5-most-unusual-habits-of-andy-warhol/ |title=The 5 most unusual habits of Andy Warhol |publisher=Inktank.fi |date=November 20, 2012 |accessdate=January 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==
Warhol's will dictated that his entire estate—with the exception of a few modest legacies to family members—would go to create a foundation dedicated to the &quot;advancement of the visual arts&quot;. Warhol had so many possessions that it took [[Sotheby's]] nine days to auction his estate after his death; the auction grossed more than US$20&amp;nbsp;million.

In 1987, in accordance with Warhol's will, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts began. The foundation serves as the estate of Andy Warhol, but also has a mission &quot;to foster innovative artistic expression and the creative process&quot; and is &quot;focused primarily on supporting work of a challenging and often experimental nature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;warholfoundation intro&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warholfoundation.org/foundation/overview.html|title=Introduction |publisher=The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts |accessdate=January 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media about Warhol==

===Films===
[[File:Andy Warhol and Ulli Lommel on set of Cocaine Cowboys.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Warhol (right) with director [[Ulli Lommel]] on the set of 1979's ''[[Cocaine Cowboys (1979 film)|Cocaine Cowboys]]'', in which Warhol appeared as himself]]
Warhol appeared as himself in the film ''[[Cocaine Cowboys (1979 film)|Cocaine Cowboys]]'' (1979)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|author=Lommel, Ulli |title=Cocaine Cowboys|date=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the film ''[[Tootsie]]'' (1982).

After his death, Warhol was portrayed by [[Crispin Glover]] in [[Oliver Stone]]'s film ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'' (1991), by [[David Bowie]] in [[Julian Schnabel]]'s film ''[[Basquiat (film)|Basquiat]]'' (1996), and by [[Jared Harris]] in [[Mary Harron]]'s film ''[[I Shot Andy Warhol]]'' (1996). Warhol appears as a character in [[Michael Daugherty]]'s opera ''[[Jackie O (the opera)|Jackie O]]'' (1997). Actor Mark Bringleson makes a brief cameo as Warhol in ''[[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery]]'' (1997). Many films by avant-garde cineast [[Jonas Mekas]] have caught the moments of Warhol's life. Sean Gregory Sullivan depicted Warhol in the film ''[[54 (film)|54]]'' (1998). [[Guy Pearce]] portrayed Warhol in the film ''[[Factory Girl (2006 film)|Factory Girl]]'' (2007) about [[Edie Sedgwick]]'s life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|author= Hickenlooper, George |title=Factory Girl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actor [[Greg Travis]] portrays Warhol in a brief scene from the film ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' (2009).

In the movie ''[[Highway to Hell (film)|Highway to Hell]]'' a group of Andy Warhols are part of the ''Good Intentions Paving Company'' where good-intentioned souls are ground into [[road surface|pavement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Horror Films of the 1990s |first1=John Kenneth |last1=Muir |authorlink=John Kenneth Muir |page=236 |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]] |year=2011 |isbn=9780786440122}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film ''[[Men in Black 3]]'' (2012) Andy Warhol turns out to really be undercover MIB Agent W (played by [[Bill Hader]]). Warhol is throwing a party at The Factory in 1969, where he is looked up by MIB Agents K and J (J from the future). Agent W is desperate to end his undercover job (&quot;I'm so out of ideas I'm painting soup cans and bananas, for Christ sakes!&quot;, &quot;You gotta fake my death, okay? I can't listen to sitar music anymore.&quot; and &quot;I can't tell the girls from the boys.&quot;).

Andy Warhol (portrayed by [[Tom Meeten]]) is one of main characters of the 2012 British television show ''[[Noel Fielding's Luxury Comedy]]''. The character is portrayed as having robot-like mannerisms. In the 2017 feature ''[[Billionaire Boys Club (2017 film)|The Billionaire Boys Club]]'' [[Cary Elwes]] portrays Warhol in a film based on the true story about Ron Levin (portrayed by [[Kevin Spacey]]) a friend of Warhol's who was murdered in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Andy Warhol Diaries]]'' (1989, {{ISBN|0-446-39138-7}}), edited by Pat Hackett; Entry date: Thursday, September 25, 1986; pp. 773.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, it was announced that [[Jared Leto]] would portray the title character in ''Warhol'', an upcoming American [[biographical film|biographical]] [[drama (genre)|drama film]] produced by [[Michael De Luca]] and written by [[Terence Winter]], based on the book ''Warhol: The Biography'' by [[Victor Bockris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/20/jared-leto-andy-warhol-biopic-movie|title=Jared Leto to play Andy Warhol in biopic|work=The Guardian|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentaries===

===Television===
Warhol appeared as a recurring character in TV series ''[[Vinyl (TV series)|Vinyl]]'', played by [[John Cameron Mitchell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/02/tv-review-martin-scorseses-vinyl.html|title=Martin Scorsese's Vinyl Is the Year's First Must-See Show|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warhol was portrayed by [[Evan Peters]] in the ''[[American Horror Story: Cult]]'' episode &quot;[[Valerie Solanas Died for Your Sins: Scumbag]]&quot;. The episode depicts the attempted assassination of Warhol by [[Valerie Solanas]] ([[Lena Dunham]]).

In early 1969, Andy Warhol was commissioned by [[Braniff International Airways|Braniff International]] to appear in two television commercials to promote the luxury Airline's new When You Got It - Flaunt It Campaign. The campaign was created by Braniff's new advertising agency Lois Holland Calloway, which was led by famed advertiser [[George Lois]], creator of a famed series of [[Esquire Magazine]] covers. The first commercial series involved pairing the most unlikely people but who shared the fact that they both flew Braniff Airways. Mr. Warhol was paired with boxing legend [[Sonny Liston]]. The odd commercial worked as did the others that featured unlikely fellow travelers such as painter [[Salvador Dali]] and baseball legend [[Whitey Ford]].

Two additional commercials for Braniff were created that featured famous persons entering a Braniff jet and being greeted a Braniff Hostess while espousing their like for flying Braniff. Mr. Warhol was also featured in the first of these commercials that were also produced by Mr. Lois and were released in the summer of 1969. Mr. Lois has incorrectly stated that he was commissioned by Braniff in 1967 for representation during that year but at that time Madison Avenue advertising doyenne [[Mary Wells Lawrence]], who was married to Braniff's charismatic Chairman and President [[Harding Lawrence]], was representing the Dallas-based carrier at that time. Mr. Lois succeeded Wells Rich Greene Agency on December 1, 1968. The rights to Mr. Warhol's films for Braniff and his signed contracts are owned by a private Trust and are administered by Braniff Airways Foundation in Dallas, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cass |first1=Richard Benjamin |title=Braniff Airways Flying Colors |date=December 14, 2015 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing, Inc. |isbn=9781467134408 |page=74 |edition=1st |url=https://www.arcadiapublishing.com/Products/9781467134408?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIroPGvtz25AIVENvACh0--AgaEAQYAiABEgISDfD_BwE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
In 2002, the [[U.S. Postal Service]] issued an 18-cent stamp commemorating Warhol. Designed by Richard Sheaff of [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], the stamp was unveiled at a ceremony at The Andy Warhol Museum and features Warhol's painting &quot;Self-Portrait, 1964&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Artists | publisher = United States Postal Service | url = http://www.uspsstamps.com/stamps/series/artists |accessdate=December 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = McCoy | first = Adrian | title = Andy Warhol Puts Stamp on the World – Again | newspaper = [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | date = August 10, 2002 | url = http://old.post-gazette.com/ae/20020810warhol0810p2.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, a chrome statue of Andy Warhol and his Polaroid camera was revealed at Union Square in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Andy Warhol Commemorated in Chrome on Union Square | work = the New York Times | date = March 31, 2011 | url = http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/31/andy-warhol-commemorated-in-chrome-on-union-square/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
