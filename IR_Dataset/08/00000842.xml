The '''Aegean Sea'''{{efn|{{IPAc-en|i|ˈ|dʒ|iː|ə|n}}; {{lang-el|Αιγαίο Πέλαγος|Aigaío Pélagos}} {{IPA-el|eˈʝeo ˈpelaɣos||Ell-Aigaio Pelagos.ogg}}; {{lang-tr|Ege Denizi}} {{IPA-tr|eˈɟe deniˈzi|}}}} is an elongated [[Bay|embayment]] of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] located between the [[Geography of Greece|Greek]] and [[Anatolia]]n [[peninsula]]s. The sea has an area of some 215,000 square kilometres.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Aegean-Sea|title=Aegean Sea {{!}} Mediterranean Sea|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=14 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the north, the Aegean is connected to the [[Marmara Sea]] and the [[Black Sea]] by the straits of the [[Dardanelles]] and [[Bosphorus]]. The [[Aegean Islands]] are located within the sea and some bound it on its southern periphery, including [[Crete]] and [[Rhodes]]. The sea reaches a maximum depth of 3,544 meters, to the east of Crete.

The [[Aegean Islands]] can be divided into several [[Archipelago|island groups]], including [[Dodecanese]], the [[Cyclades]], the [[Sporades]], the [[Saronic Islands|Saronic islands]] and the [[North Aegean islands|North Aegean Islands]], as well as Crete and its surrounding islands. The Dodecanese, located to the southeast, includes the islands of [[Rhodes]], [[Kos]], and [[Patmos]]; the islands of Delos and Naxos are within the [[Cyclades]] to the south of the sea. [[Lesbos]] is part of the [[North Aegean islands|North Aegean Islands]]. Euboea, the second largest island in Greece, is located in the Aegean, despite being administered as part of [[Central Greece (region)|Central Greece]]. Nine out of twelve of the Administrative regions of Greece border the sea, along with the [[Provinces of Turkey|Turkish provinces]] of [[Edirne]], [[Çanakkale|Canakkale]], [[Balıkesir]], [[Izmir]], [[Aydın]] and [[Muğla Province|Muğla]] to the east of the sea. Various Turkish islands in the sea are [[Imbros]], [[Tenedos]], [[Cunda Island]], and the [[Foça Islands]]'''.'''

The Aegean Sea has been historically important, especially in regards to the civilization of [[Ancient Greece]], who inhabited the area around the coast of the Aegean and the Aegean islands. The Aegean islands facilitated contact between the people of the area and between Europe and Asia. Along with the Greeks, [[Thracians]] lived among the northern coast. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] conquered the area under the [[Roman Empire]], and later the [[Byzantine Empire]] held it against advances by the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|First Bulgarian Empire]]. The [[Fourth Crusade]] weakened Byzantine control of the area, and it was eventually conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]], with the exception of Crete, which was a Venetian colony until 1669. The [[Greek War of Independence]] allowed a Greek state on the coast of the Aegean from 1829 onwards. The Ottoman Empire held a presence over the sea for over 500 years until [[Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire|their dissolution]], when it was replaced by modern [[Turkey]].

The sea was traditionally known as ''[[Archipelago|the Archipelago]]'' (in [[Ancient Greek]], {{lang|grc|Ἀρχιπέλαγος}}, meaning &quot;chief sea&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; but in English the meaning of ''archipelago'' has changed to refer to the Aegean Islands and, generally, to any island group. The rocks making up the floor of the Aegean are mainly limestone, though often greatly altered by volcanic activity that has convulsed the region in relatively recent geologic times. Of particular interest are the richly coloured sediments in the region of the islands of [[Santorini]] and [[Milos]], in the south Aegean.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Notable cities on the Aegean coastline include [[Thessaloniki]], [[Kavala]] and [[Heraklion]] in Greece, and [[İzmir]] and [[Bodrum]] in Turkey.

A number of issues concerning sovereignty within the Aegean Sea are disputed between Greece and Turkey. The [[Aegean dispute]] has had a large effect on [[Greek-Turkish relations]] since the 1970s. Issues include the delimitation of [[territorial waters]], [[national airspace]], [[exclusive economic zone]]s and [[flight information region]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/aegean.htm|title=International Disputes|website=www.globalsecurity.org|access-date=14 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name and etymology==
It is generally believed that the Greek name ''Aegean'' is linked to the mythological figure [[Aegeus]] (Greek: Αἰγεύς),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095353371|title=Aegean Sea – Oxford Reference|website=www.oxfordreference.com|language=en|doi=10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095353371|access-date=15 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2019}} who was the father of [[Theseus]], the [[myth]]ical king and founder-hero of [[Athens]]. Aegeus had told Theseus to put up white sails when returning if he was successful in killing the [[Minotaur]]. When Theseus returned, he forgot these instructions, and Aegeus subsequently drowned himself in the sea when he thought his son had died.&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus, ''Fabula'' 41, 43; Servius on the ''Aeneid'' 3.74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sea was known in Latin as ''Aegaeum mare'' under the control of the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], who ruled many Greek islands in the [[High Middle Ages|High]] and [[Late Middle Ages]], popularized the name ''Archipelago'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: αρχιπέλαγος, meaning &quot;main sea&quot; or &quot;chief sea&quot;), a name that held on in many European countries until the [[early modern period]]. In some [[South Slavic languages]], the Aegean is often called ''White Sea'' (Bulgarian: {{lang|bg|Бяло море}}/{{transl|bg|Byalo more}}; Macedonian: {{lang|sh-Latn|Belo more}}/{{lang|sh-Cyrl|Бело море}}; Serbo-Croatian: {{lang|sh-Latn|Belo more}}/{{lang|sh-Cyrl|Бело море}}).&lt;ref&gt;Zbornik Matice srpske za društvene nauke: (1961), Volumes 28–31, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GwIdAQAAMAAJ p.74] {{in lang|sr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkish name for the sea is ''Ege Denizi,'' most likely a phonetic transliteration of the Greek name.

==Geography==
The Aegean Sea is an elongated [[Bay|embayment]] of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and covers about {{convert|214000|km2}} in area, measuring about {{convert|670|km}} longitudinally and {{convert|390|km}} latitudinal. The sea's maximum depth is {{convert|3543|m}}, located at a point east of Crete. The [[Aegean Islands]] are found within its waters, with the following islands delimiting the sea on the south, generally from west to east: [[Kythera]], [[Antikythera]], [[Crete]], [[Kasos]], [[Karpathos]] and [[Rhodes]]. The Anatolian peninsula marks the eastern boundary of the sea, while the Greek mainland marks the west. Several seas are contained within the Aegean Sea; the [[Thracian Sea]] is a section of the Aegean located to the north, the [[Icarian Sea]] to the east, the [[Myrtoan Sea]] to the west, while the [[Sea of Crete]] is the southern section.

The Greek regions that border the sea, in alphabetical order, are [[Attica]], [[Central Greece]], [[Central Macedonia]], Crete, [[Eastern Macedonia and Thrace]], [[North Aegean]], [[Peloponnese (region)|Peloponnese]], [[South Aegean]], and [[Thessaly]]. The historical region of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] also borders the sea, to the north.

The Aegean Islands, which almost all belong to Greece, can be divided into seven groups:
# [[List of Aegean Islands#The North Aegean Islands|Northeastern Aegean Islands]], which lie in the [[Thracian Sea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Aegean-Sea#ref170179|title=Aegean Sea {{!}} Mediterranean Sea|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=18 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# [[Euboea|East Aegean Islands (''Euboea'')]] 
# Northern [[Sporades]]
# [[Cyclades]]
# [[Saronic Islands]] (or ''Argo-Saronic Islands'')
# [[Dodecanese]] (or ''Southern Sporades'')&lt;ref&gt;Administratively, the Greek Dodecanese also contains [[Kastellorizo]], situated further east outside the Aegean proper.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Crete]]

The word ''[[archipelago]]'' was originally applied specifically to the Aegean Sea and its islands. Many of the Aegean Islands, or chains of islands, are actually extensions of the mountains on the mainland. One chain extends across the sea to [[Chios]], another extends across [[Euboea]] to [[Samos]], and a third extends across the [[Peloponnese]] and [[Crete]] to [[Rhodes]], dividing the Aegean from the Mediterranean.

The bays and gulfs of the Aegean beginning at the South and moving clockwise include on Crete, the [[Mirabello Bay|Mirabello]], [[Almyros Bay|Almyros]], [[Souda Bay|Souda]] and [[Gulf of Chania|Chania]] bays or gulfs, on the mainland the [[Myrtoan Sea]] to the west with the [[Argolic Gulf]], the [[Saronic Gulf]] northwestward, the [[Petalies Gulf]] which connects with the [[Gulf of Euboea|South Euboic Sea]], the [[Pagasetic Gulf]] which connects with the [[Gulf of Euboea|North Euboic Sea]], the [[Thermian Gulf]] northwestward, the [[Chalkidiki]] Peninsula including the [[Cassandra Gulf|Cassandra]] and the [[Singitic Gulf]]s, northward the [[Strymonian Gulf]] and the [[Gulf of Kavala]] and the rest are in [[Turkey]]; [[Saros Gulf]], [[Edremit (District), Balıkesir|Edremit]] Gulf, Dikili Gulf, [[Gulf of Çandarlı]], [[Gulf of İzmir]], [[Gulf of Kuşadası]], [[Gulf of Gökova]], [[Güllük]] Gulf.

The Aegean sea is connected to the Sea of Marmara by the [[Dardanelles]], also known from [[Classical Antiquity]] as the Hellespont. The Dardanelles are located to the northeast of the sea. It ultimately connects with the [[Black Sea]] through the [[Bosporus|Bosphoros]] strait, upon which lies the city of [[Istanbul]]. The Dardanelles and the Bosphoros are known as the [[Turkish Straits]].

===Extent===
According to the [[International Hydrographic Organization]], the limits of the Aegean Sea as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;iho&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iho.int/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S-23_Ed3_1953_EN.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition|year=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=15 February 2016|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrography===
[[File:ParosHuis.JPG|thumb|A traditional street in Lefkes, [[Paros]]-[[Greece]].]]
Aegean surface water circulates in a counterclockwise [[Ocean gyre|gyre]], with [[hypersaline]] Mediterranean water moving northward along the west coast of [[Turkey]], before being displaced by less dense [[Black Sea]] outflow. The dense [[Mediterranean]] water sinks below the Black Sea inflow to a depth of {{convert|23|-|30|m}}, then flows through the [[Dardanelles Strait]] and into the [[Sea of Marmara]] at velocities of {{cvt|5|-|15|cm/s|in/s|0}}. The Black Sea outflow moves westward along the northern Aegean Sea, then flows southwards along the east coast of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aksu|first1=A.E.|last2=Yaşar|first2=D.|last3=Mudie|first3=P.J.|last4=Gillespie|first4=H.|date=1995|title=Late Glacial-Holocene Paleoclimatic and Paleooceanographic Evolution of the Agean Sea&amp;nbsp;– Micropaleontological and Stable Isotopic Evidence|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/PJ_Mudie/publication/271014538_Aksu_et_al_Late_Glacial_paleoclimate_Aegean_MarMic_95/links/54bbe6210cf24e50e94043eb.pdf|journal=Marine Micropaleontology|volume=25|issue=1|page=1–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical oceanography of the Aegean Sea is controlled mainly by the regional climate, the fresh water discharge from major rivers draining southeastern Europe, and the seasonal variations in the Black Sea surface water outflow through the [[Dardanelles Strait]].

Analysis&lt;ref&gt;Yagar, D., 1994. Late glacial-Holocene evolution of the Aegean Sea. Ph.D. Thesis, Inst. Mar. Sci. Technol., Dokuz Eyltil Univ., 329 pp. (Unpubl.)&lt;/ref&gt; of the Aegean during 1991 and 1992 revealed three distinct water masses:

* '''Aegean Sea Surface Water'''&amp;nbsp;– {{convert|40|-|50|m}} thick veneer, with summer temperatures of 21–26&amp;nbsp;°C and winter temperatures ranging from {{convert|10|°C}} in the north to {{convert|16|°C}} in the south.
* '''Aegean Sea Intermediate Water'''&amp;nbsp;– Aegean Sea Intermediate Water extends from 40–50&amp;nbsp;m to {{convert|200|-|300|m}} with temperatures ranging from 11–18&amp;nbsp;°C.
* '''Aegean Sea Bottom Water'''&amp;nbsp;– occurring at depths below 500–1000&amp;nbsp;m with a very uniform temperature (13–14&amp;nbsp;°C) and salinity (3.91–3.92%).

=== Climate ===
[[File:Greece map of Köppen climate classification (new).svg|thumb|Climate map of Greece. Most of the landmass surrounding the Aegean sea is classified as ''Csa'', with the northern region being ''BSk.'']]
The Climate of the Aegean Sea largely reflects the climate of Greece and Western Turkey, which is to say, predominately [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]]. According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], most of the Aegean is classified as [[Mediterranean climate|Hot-summer Mediterranean]] (''Csa''), with hotter and drier summers along with milder and wetter winters. However, high temperatures during summers are generally not quite as high as those in arid or semiarid climates due to the presence of a large body of water. This is most predominant in the west and east coasts of the Aegean, and within the Aegean islands. In the north of the Aegean Sea, the climate is instead classified as [[Semi-arid climate|Cold semi-arid]] ''(BSk)'', which feature cooler summers that [[Mediterranean climate|Hot-summer Mediterranean]] climates.
The [[Etesian]] winds are a dominant weather influence in the Aegean Basin.

=== Protected Areas ===
Greece has established several [[marine protected area]]s along its coasts. According to the Network of Managers of Marine Protected Areas in the Mediterranean (MedPAN), four Greek MPAs are participating in the Network. These include [[Alonnisos Marine Park]], while the [[Missolonghi–Aitoliko Lagoons]] and the island of [[Zakynthos]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;are not on the Aegean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mpatlas.org/region/country/GRC/|title=MPAtlas » Greece|website=www.mpatlas.org|access-date=16 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aegean Sea by Piri Reis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A 1528 map of the Aegean Sea by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[geography|geographer]] [[Piri Reis]]]]
The current coastline dates back to about 4000&amp;nbsp;BC. Before that time, at the peak of the [[last glacial period|last ice age]] (about 18,000 years ago) sea levels everywhere [[sea level rise|were 130 metres lower]], and there were large well-watered coastal plains instead of much of the northern Aegean. When they were first occupied, the present-day islands including [[Milos]] with its important [[obsidian]] production were probably still connected to the mainland. The present coastal arrangement appeared around 9,000 years ago, with post-ice age sea levels continuing to rise for another 3,000 years after that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Tjeerd H. van Andel |author2=Judith C. Shackleton |title=Late Paleolithic and Mesolithic Coastlines of Greece and the Aegean|journal=Journal of Field Archaeology |publisher=Journal of Field Archaeology|volume=9|issue=4|date=Winter 1982|pages=445–454|jstor=529681 |doi=10.1179/009346982791504454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subsequent [[Bronze Age]] civilizations of [[Greece]] and the Aegean Sea have given rise to the general term ''[[Aegean civilization]]''. In ancient times, the sea was the birthplace of two ancient civilizations&amp;nbsp;– the [[Minoan civilization|Minoans]] of Crete and the [[Mycenaean Greece|Myceneans]] of the [[Peloponnese]].&lt;ref&gt;Tracey Cullen, ''Aegean Prehistory: A Review'' (American Journal of Archaeology.

The Minoan civilization was a [[Bronze Age]] civilization on the island of [[Crete]] and other [[Aegean Islands]], flourishing from around 2700 to 1450 BC before a period of decline, finally ending at around 1100 BC. It represented the first advanced civilization in Europe, leaving behind massive building complexes, tools, stunning artwork, writing systems, and a massive network of trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195389661/obo-9780195389661-0071.xml;jsessionid=34C7E22759BF3739960486FE75375115|title=Ancient Crete – Classics – Oxford Bibliographies – obo|website=www.oxfordbibliographies.com|language=en|access-date=17 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Minoan period saw extensive trade between Crete, Aegean, and Mediterranean settlements, particularly the Near East. The most notable Minoan palace is that of [[Knossos]], followed by that of [[Phaistos]].

After the decline of the Minoan civilization, the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greeks]] arose, becoming the first advanced civilization in mainland Greece, and lasted from approximately 1600 to 1100 BC. It is believed that the site of [[Mycenae]], which sits close to the Aegean coast, was the center of Mycenaean civilization. The Mycenaeans introduced several innovations in the fields of engineering, architecture and military infrastructure, while trade over vast areas of the [[Mediterranean]], including the Aegean, was essential for the Mycenaean economy. Their [[syllabic script]], the [[Linear B]], offers the first written records of the [[Greek language]] and [[Mycenaean religion|their religion]] already included several deities that can also be found in the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympic Pantheon]]. Mycenaean Greece was dominated by a warrior elite society and consisted of a network of [[palace]]-centered states that developed rigid hierarchical, political, social and economic systems. At the head of this society was the king, known as ''[[wanax]]''.

The civilization of Mycenaean Greeks perished with the [[Late Bronze Age collapse|collapse of Bronze Age culture]] in the eastern Mediterranean, to be followed by the so-called [[Greek Dark Ages]]. It is undetermined what cause the collapse of the Mycenaeans. During the [[Greek Dark Ages]], writing in the Linear B script ceased, vital trade links were lost, and towns and villages were abandoned.

=== Ancient Greece ===
{{See also|Ancient Greece}}
The [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] followed the [[Greek Dark Ages]] in the 8th century BC. Greece became divided into small self-governing communities, and adopted the [[Phoenician alphabet]], modifying it to create the [[Greek alphabet]]. By the 6th century BC several cities had emerged as dominant in Greek affairs: Athens, Sparta, [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]], and [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], of which Athens, Sparta, and Corinth were closest to the Aegean Sea. Each of them had brought the surrounding rural areas and smaller towns under their control, and Athens and Corinth had become major maritime and mercantile powers as well. In the 8th and 7th centuries BC many Greeks emigrated to form [[Colonies in antiquity|colonies]] in [[Magna Graecia]] ([[Southern Italy]] and [[Sicily]]), [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] and further afield.

In the second half of the 6th century BC, Athens fell under the tyranny of [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratos]] and then of his sons [[Hippias (tyrant)|Hippias]] and [[Hipparchos (son of Peisistratos)|Hipparchos]]. However, in 510 BC, at the instigation of the Athenian aristocrat [[Cleisthenes]], the Spartan king [[Cleomenes I]] helped the Athenians overthrow the tyranny. Afterwards, Sparta and Athens promptly turned on each other, at which point Cleomenes I installed [[Isagoras]] as a pro-Spartan archon. Eager to prevent Athens from becoming a Spartan puppet, Cleisthenes responded by proposing to his fellow citizens that Athens undergo a revolution: that all citizens share in political power, regardless of status: that Athens become a &quot;[[Athenian democracy|democracy]]&quot;. So enthusiastically did the Athenians take to this idea that, having overthrown Isagoras and implemented Cleisthenes's reforms, they were easily able to repel a Spartan-led three-pronged invasion aimed at restoring Isagoras. The advent of the democracy cured many of the ills of Athens and led to a '[[Fifth-century Athens|golden age]]' for the Athenians. [[Plato]] described the Greeks living round the Aegean &quot;like frogs around a pond&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The familiar phrase giving rise to the title ''Prehistorians Round the Pond: Reflections on Aegean Prehistory as a Discipline''|author1=John F. Cherry|author2=Despina Margomenou|author3=Lauren E. Talalay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aegean Sea would later come to be under the control, albeit briefly, of the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Kingdom of Macedonia]]. [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] and his son [[Alexander the Great]] led a series of conquests that led not only to the unification of the Greek mainland and the control of the Aegean Sea under his rule, but also the destruction of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. After Alexander the Great's death, his empire was divided among his generals. [[Cassander]] became king of the Hellenistic kingdom of Macedon, which held territory along the western coast of the Aegean, roughly corresponding to modern-day Greece. The Kingdom of [[Lysimachus]] had control over the sea's eastern coast. Greece had entered the [[Hellenistic period]].

=== Roman rule ===
The Macedonian Wars were a series of conflicts fought by the [[Roman Republic]] and its Greek allies in the eastern [[Mediterranean]] against several different major Greek kingdoms. They resulted in Roman control or influence over the eastern [[Mediterranean]] basin, including the Aegean, in addition to their hegemony in the western Mediterranean after the [[Punic Wars]]. During Roman rule, the land around the Aegean Sea fell under the provinces of [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], [[Thracia]], [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] and [[Crete and Cyrenaica|Creta et Cyrenica]] (island of Crete)

=== Medieval period ===
The [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]] allowed its successor state, the [[Byzantine Empire]], to continue Roman control over the Aegean Sea. However, their territory would later be threatened by the [[Early Muslim conquests]] initiated by [[Muhammad]] in the 7th century. Although the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] did not manage to obtain land along the cost of the Aegean sea, its conquest of the Eastern Anatolian peninsula as well as Egypt, the Levant, and North Africa left the Byzantine Empire weakened. The [[Umayyad Caliphate]] expanded the territorial gains of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], conquering much of North Africa, and threatened the Byzantine Empire's control of Western Anatolia, where it meets the Aegean Sea.

During the 820s, Crete was conquered by a group of [[Berbers]] [[Al-Andalus|Andalusians]] exiles led by [[Abu Hafs Umar al-Iqritishi]], and it became an independent [[Islamic]] state. The Byzantine Empire launched a campaign that took most of the island back in 842 and 843 under [[Theoktistos]], but the reconquest was not completed and was soon reversed. Later attempts by the [[Byzantine Empire]] to recover the island were without success. For the approximately 135 years of its existence, the emirate of Crete was one of the major foes of Byzantium. Crete commanded the sea lanes of the Eastern Mediterranean and functioned as a forward base and haven for Muslim corsair fleets that ravaged the Byzantine-controlled shores of the Aegean Sea. Crete returned to Byzantine rule under [[Nikephoros II|Nikephoros Phokas]], who launched a huge campaign against the Emirate of Crete in 960 to 961.

Meanwhile, the [[Bulgarian Empire]] threatened Byzantine control of Northern Greece and the Aegean coast to the south. Under [[Presian I of Bulgaria|Presian I]] and his successor [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Boris I]], the Bulgarian Empire managed to obtain a small portion of the northern Aegean coast. [[Simeon I of Bulgaria]] led Bulgaria to its greatest territorial expansion, and managed to conqueror much of the northern and western coasts of the Aegean. The Byzantines later regained control. The Second Bulgarian Empire achieved similar success along, again, the northern and western coasts, under [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria]].

The [[Seljuq Turks]], under the [[Seljuk Empire]], invaded the Byzantine Empire in 1068, from which they annexed almost all of Anatolia, including the east coast of the Aegean Sea, during the reign of [[Alp Arslan]], the second [[Sultan]] of the [[Seljuk Empire]]. After the death of his successor, [[Malik Shah I]], the empire was divided, and Malik Shah was succeeded in Anatolia by [[Kilij Arslan I]], who founded the [[Sultanate of Rum]]. The Byzantines yet again recaptured the eastern coast of the Aegean.

After [[Constantinople]] was occupied by [[Western Europe]]an and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] forces during the [[Fourth Crusade]], the area around the Aegean sea was fragmented into multiple entities, including the [[Latin Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]], the [[Empire of Nicaea]], the [[Principality of Achaea]], and the [[Duchy of Athens]]. The Venetians created the maritime state of the [[Duchy of the Archipelago]], which included all the [[Cyclades]] except [[Mykonos]] and [[Tinos]]. The Empire of Nicaea, a Byzantine rump state, managed to effect the [[Recapture of Constantinople]] from the Latins in 1261 and defeat Epirus. Byzantine successes were not to last; the Ottomans would conquer the area around the Aegean coast, but before their expansion the Byzantine Empire had already been weakened from internal conflict. By the late 14th century the Byzantine Empire had lost all control of the coast of the Aegean Sea and could exercise power around their capital, Constantinople. The Ottoman Empire then gained control of all the Aegean coast with the exception of Crete, which was a Venetian colony until 1669.

=== Modern Period ===
The [[Greek War of Independence]] allowed a Greek state on the coast of the Aegean from 1829 onward. The Ottoman Empire held a presence over the sea for over 500 years until [[Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire|their dissolution]] following [[World War I]], when it was replaced by modern [[Turkey]]. During the war, Greece gained control over the area around the northern coast of the Aegean. By the 1930s, Greece and Turkey had about resumed their present-day borders.

In the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1912, Italy captured the Dodecanese islands, and had occupied them since, reneging on the 1919 [[Eleftherios Venizelos|Venizelos]]–[[Tommaso Tittoni|Tittoni]] agreement to cede them to Greece. The Greco-Italian War took place from October 1940 to April 1941 as part of the [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkans Campaign]] of [[World War II]]. The Italian war aim was to establish a Greek [[puppet state]], which would permit the Italian annexation of the [[Sporades]] and the [[Cyclades]] islands in the Aegean Sea, to be administered as a part of the [[Italian Aegean Islands]]. The German invasion resulted in the [[Axis occupation of Greece]]. The German troops evacuated Athens on 12 October 1944, and by the end of the month, they had withdrawn from mainland Greece. Greece was then liberated by Allied troops.

==Economy and politics==
[[File:House of Cleopatra, Delos.jpg|thumb|House of Cleopatra on [[Delos]]]]
Many of the islands in the Aegean have safe harbours and bays. In ancient times, navigation through the sea was easier than travelling across the rough terrain of the Greek mainland, and to some extent, the coastal areas of Anatolia. Many of the islands are [[Volcano|volcanic]], and [[marble]] and [[iron]] are mined on other islands. The larger islands have some fertile valleys and plains.

Of the main islands in the Aegean Sea, two belong to [[Turkey]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Bozcaada]] ([[Tenedos]]) and [[Gökçeada]] ([[Imbros]]); the rest belong to [[Greece]]. Between the two countries, there are [[Aegean dispute|political disputes]] over several aspects of political control over the Aegean space, including the size of territorial waters, air control and the [[delimitation]] of economic rights to the [[continental shelf]]. These issues are known as the [[Aegean dispute]].

=== Transport ===
Multiple ports are located along the Greek and Turkish coasts of the Aegean Sea. The [[port of Piraeus]] in Athens is the chief port in Greece, the largest passenger port in Europe&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081220151552/http://www.olp.gr/INDEXen.htm &quot;Presentation&quot;]. www.olp.gr.

The Port of Thessaloniki is the second-largest [[Shipping container|container]] port in Greece after the port of Piraeus. In 2007, the Port of Thessaloniki handled 14,373,245 tonnes of cargo and 222,824 [[Twenty-foot equivalent unit|TEU's]], making it one of the busiest cargo ports in Greece and the second largest [[Shipping container|container]] port in the country. Paloukia, on the island of [[Salamis Island|Salamis]], is a major passenger port.
