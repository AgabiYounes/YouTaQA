{{Writing systems sidebar}}An '''abjad''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|'|ɑ:|b|dʒ|ɑ:|d
}} or {{IPAc-en|'|æ|b|dʒ|æ|d}})&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|abjad}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of [[writing system]] in which each symbol or [[glyph]] stands for a [[consonant]], leaving the reader to supply the appropriate [[vowel]]. So-called '''impure abjads''' do represent vowels, either with optional [[diacritic]]s, a limited number of distinct vowel glyphs, or both.  The name ''abjad'' is based on the [[Arabic]] alphabet's (in the original order) first four letters—a, b, j, d—to replace the common terms &quot;'''consonantary'''&quot; or  &quot;'''consonantal alphabet'''&quot; to refer to the family of scripts called [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]].

==Etymology==
The name &quot;abjad&quot; (''{{transl|ar|abjad}}'' {{lang|ar|أبجد}}) is derived from pronouncing the first letters of the [[Arabic alphabet]] order in the [[Arabic alphabet#Alphabetic order|original order]]. The ordering (''{{transl|ar|abjadī}}'') of [[Arabic letters]] used to match that of the older [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] and [[Semitic alphabet|Semitic]] alphabets: [[aleph]], [[Bet (letter)|bet]], [[gimel]], [[dalet]].

==Terminology==
According to the formulations of [[Peter T. Daniels]],{{sfn|Daniels|Bright|1996}} abjads differ from [[alphabet]]s in that only consonants, not vowels, are represented among the basic [[grapheme]]s. Abjads differ from [[abugida]]s, another category defined by Daniels, in that in abjads, the vowel sound is ''implied'' by [[phonology]], and where [[Diacritic|vowel marks]] exist for the system, such as [[niqqud|nikkud]] for [[Hebrew]] and [[harakat|ḥarakāt]] for [[Arabic]], their use is optional and not the dominant (or literate) form. Abugidas mark all vowels (other than the [[Inherent vowel|&quot;inherent&quot; vowel]]) with a [[diacritic]], a minor attachment to the letter, or a standalone [[glyph]]. Some abugidas use a special symbol to ''suppress'' the inherent vowel so that the consonant alone can be properly represented. In a [[syllabary]], a grapheme denotes a complete syllable, that is, either a lone vowel sound or a combination of a vowel sound with one or more consonant sounds.

The antagonism of abjad versus alphabet, as it was formulated by Daniels, has been rejected by some other scholars because abjad is also used as a term not only for the Arabic numeral system but, which is most important in terms of historical grammatology, also as term for the alphabetic device (i.e. letter order) of ancient Northwest Semitic scripts in opposition to the 'south Arabian' order. This caused fatal effects on terminology in general and especially in (ancient) Semitic philology. Also, it suggests that consonantal alphabets, in opposition to, for instance, the Greek alphabet, were not yet true alphabets and not yet entirely complete, lacking something important to be a fully working script system. It has also been objected that, as a set of letters, an alphabet is not the mirror of what should be there in a language from a phonological point of view; rather, it is the data stock of what provides maximum efficiency with least effort from a semantic point of view.{{sfn|Lehmann|2011}}

==Origins==
[[Image:Ba`alat.jpg|thumb|upright=1.10|A specimen of [[Proto-Sinaitic]] script containing a phrase which may mean 'to [[Baalat]]'. The line running from the upper left to lower right reads ''mt l b&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;lt''.]]

{{See also|History of the alphabet#Descendants of the Aramaic abjad}}

The first abjad to gain widespread usage was the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician abjad]]. Unlike other contemporary scripts, such as [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], the Phoenician script consisted of only a few dozen symbols. This made the script easy to learn, and seafaring Phoenician merchants took the script throughout the then-known world.

The Phoenician abjad was a radical simplification of phonetic writing, since hieroglyphics required the writer to pick a hieroglyph starting with the same sound that the writer wanted to write in order to write phonetically, much as ''[[man'yōgana]]'' ([[Chinese characters]] used solely for phonetic use) was used to represent [[Japanese language|Japanese]] phonetically before the invention of [[kana]].

Phoenician gave rise to a number of new writing systems, including the [[Greek alphabet]] and [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]], a widely used abjad. The Greek alphabet evolved into the modern western alphabets, such as [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] and [[Cyrillic]], while Aramaic became the ancestor of many modern abjads and abugidas of Asia.

==Impure abjads==
[[Image:Arabic albayancalligraphy.svg|thumb|''Al-ʻArabiyya'', meaning &quot;Arabic&quot;: an example of the Arabic script, which is an impure abjad.]]

Impure abjads have characters for some vowels, optional vowel diacritics, or both. The term pure abjad refers to scripts entirely lacking in vowel indicators.{{sfn|Daniels|2013}} However, most modern abjads, such as [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]], and [[Pahlavi alphabet|Pahlavi]], are &quot;impure&quot; abjads{{snd}}that is, they also contain symbols for some of the vowel phonemes, although the said non-diacritic vowel letters are also used to write certain consonants, particularly [[Approximant consonant|approximants]] that sound similar to long vowels. A &quot;pure&quot; abjad is exemplified (perhaps) by very early forms of ancient [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], though at some point (at least by the 9th century BC) it and most of the contemporary Semitic abjads had begun to overload a few of the consonant symbols with a secondary function as vowel markers, called ''[[mater lectionis|matres lectionis]]''.{{sfn|Lipiński|1994}} This practice was at first rare and limited in scope but became increasingly common and more developed in later times.

===Addition of vowels===
{{Main|Greek alphabet}}

In the 9th century BC the Greeks adapted the Phoenician script for use in their own language. The phonetic structure of the Greek language created too many ambiguities when vowels went unrepresented, so the script was modified. They did not need letters for the [[guttural consonant|guttural]] sounds represented by ''[[aleph]]'', ''[[he (letter)|he]]'', ''[[Heth (letter)|heth]]'' or ''[[ayin]]'', so these symbols were assigned vocalic values. The letters ''[[Waw (letter)|waw]]'' and ''[[Yodh|yod]]'' were also adapted into vowel signs; along with ''he'', these were already used as ''[[Mater lectionis|matres lectionis]]'' in Phoenician. The major innovation of Greek was to dedicate these symbols exclusively and unambiguously to vowel sounds that could be combined arbitrarily with consonants (as opposed to syllabaries such as [[Linear B]] which usually have vowel symbols but cannot combine them with consonants to form arbitrary syllables).

[[Abugida]]s developed along a slightly different route. The basic consonantal symbol was considered to have an inherent &quot;a&quot; vowel sound. Hooks or short lines attached to various parts of the basic letter modify the vowel. In this way, the [[South Arabian alphabet]] evolved into the [[Ge'ez alphabet]] between the 5th century BC and the 5th century AD. Similarly, around the 3rd century BC, the [[Brāhmī script]] developed (from the [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic abjad]], it has been hypothesized).

The other major family of abugidas, [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]], was initially developed in the 1840s by missionary and linguist [[James Evans (linguist)|James Evans]] for the Cree and Ojibwe languages. Evans used features of [[Devanagari script]] and [[Pitman shorthand]] to create his initial abugida. Later in the 19th century, other missionaries adapted Evans' system to other Canadian aboriginal languages. Canadian syllabics differ from other abugidas in that the vowel is indicated by rotation of the consonantal symbol, with each vowel having a consistent orientation.

==Abjads and the structure of Semitic languages==
The abjad form of writing is well-adapted to the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] structure of the Semitic languages it was developed to write. This is because words in Semitic languages are formed from [[triliteral|a root consisting of (usually) three consonants]], the vowels being used to indicate inflectional or derived forms.  For instance, according to [[Classical Arabic]] and [[Modern Standard Arabic]], from the Arabic root {{lang|ar|ذ&amp;nbsp;ب&amp;nbsp;ح}} ''Dh-B-Ḥ'' (to slaughter) can be derived the forms {{lang|ar|ذَبَحَ}} ''{{transl|ar|dhabaḥa}}'' (he slaughtered), {{lang|ar|ذَبَحْتَ}} ''{{transl|ar|dhabaḥta}}'' (you (masculine singular) slaughtered), {{lang|ar|يُذَبِّحُ}} ''{{transl|ar|yudhabbiḥu}}'' (he slaughters), and {{lang|ar|مَذْبَح}} ''{{transl|ar|madhbaḥ}}'' (slaughterhouse). In most cases, the absence of full glyphs for vowels makes the common root clearer, allowing readers to guess the meaning of unfamiliar words from familiar roots (especially in conjunction with [[context (language use)|context]] clues) and improving word recognition{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}{{dubious|date=August 2011}} while reading for practiced readers.&lt;!--extremely exaggerated, there are dozens of Arabic words of different roots which are only distinguished by vowels--&gt;

By contrast, the Arabic and Hebrew scripts sometimes perform the role of [[alphabet|true alphabets]] rather than abjads when used to write certain [[Indo-European languages]], including [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Arebica|Bosnian]], and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]].
