The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917, and Japanese anime production has since continued to increase steadily. The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of [[Osamu Tezuka]] and spread internationally in the late twentieth century, developing a large domestic and international audience. Anime is distributed theatrically, by way of television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. It is classified into numerous genres targeting diverse broad and niche audiences.

Anime is a diverse art form with distinctive production methods and techniques that have been adapted over time in response to emergent technologies. It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques.{{sfn|Craig|2000|pp=139–140}} The production of anime focuses less on the animation of movement and more on the realism of settings as well as the use of camera effects, including panning, zooming, and angle shots. Being hand-drawn, anime is separated from reality by a crucial gap of fiction that provides an ideal path for escapism that audiences can immerse themselves into with relative ease.{{sfn|Craig|2000|pp=139–140}} Diverse art styles are used and character proportions and features can be quite varied, including characteristically large emotive or realistically sized eyes.

The anime industry consists of over 430 production studios, including major names like [[Studio Ghibli]], [[Gainax]], and [[Toei Animation]]. Despite comprising only a fraction of Japan's domestic film market, anime makes up a majority of Japanese [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] sales. It has also seen international success after the rise of English-[[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] and [[Subtitles|subbed]] programming. This rise in international popularity has resulted in non-Japanese productions using the anime art style. Whether these works are [[anime-influenced animation]] or proper anime is a subject for debate amongst fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aminoapps.com/c/anime/page/blog/does-anime-have-to-be-from-japan/mJtk_uDKj4NBmNZvjz1N2MJVrWe0X|title=Does Anime have to be from Japan? - Anime Amino|website=Anime - aminoapps.com|access-date=May 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180522042414/https://aminoapps.com/c/anime/page/blog/does-anime-have-to-be-from-japan/mJtk_uDKj4NBmNZvjz1N2MJVrWe0X|archive-date=May 22, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese anime accounts for 60% of the world's [[Animated series|animated television shows]], as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Napier |first1=Susan J. |title=Anime from Akira to Howl's Moving Castle: Experiencing Contemporary Japanese Animation |date=2016 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |isbn=9781250117724 |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UnuLCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the 44th [[President of the United States]], [[Barack Obama]], referred to anime as one of the loved ones of American youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2015-04-28|title=Obama thanks Japan for karate, karaoke, anime, 'and, of course, emojis'

== Etymology ==
Anime is an art form, specifically animation, that includes all [[genre]]s found in cinema, but it can be mistakenly classified as a genre.{{sfn|Poitras|2000|p=7}} In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the term ''anime'' is used as a [[blanket term]] to refer to all forms of animation from around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;japanese&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/__data/page/9842/Tezuka_Kit_1.pdf |title=Tezuka: The Marvel of Manga - Education Kit |year=2007 |publisher=Art Gallery New South Wales |accessdate=October 28, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830033821/http://artgallery.nsw.gov.au/__data/page/9842/Tezuka_Kit_1.pdf |archivedate=August 30, 2007 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In English, ''anime'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|ə|ˌ|m|eɪ}}) is more restrictively used to denote a &quot;Japanese-style animated film or television entertainment&quot; or as &quot;a style of animation created in Japan&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;webster&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;&gt;{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/anime|title=Anime|dictionary=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|accessdate=February 17, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202165231/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/anime|archive-date=February 2, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The etymology of the word ''anime'' is disputed. The English term &quot;animation&quot; is written in Japanese ''[[katakana]]'' as {{lang|ja|アニメーション}} (''animēshon'', {{IPA-ja|animeːɕoɴ}})&lt;ref name=anna /&gt; and is {{lang|ja|アニメ}} (''anime'') in its shortened form.&lt;ref name=anna /&gt; The pronunciation of ''anime'' in Japanese differs from pronunciations in other languages such as [[Standard English]] (pronunciation: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|ɪ|m|eɪ}}), which has different vowels and [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] with regards to Japanese, where each [[mora (linguistics)|mora]] carries equal stress. As with a few other Japanese words such as ''[[saké]]'', ''[[Pokémon]]'', and ''[[Kobo Abé]],'' English-language texts sometimes spell ''anime'' as ''animé'' (as in French), with an [[acute accent]] over the final ''e'', to cue the reader to pronounce the letter, not to leave it silent as Standard English orthography may suggest.

Some sources claim that ''anime'' derives from the French term for animation ''dessin animé'',&lt;ref name=&quot;etymology&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Schodt|1997}} but others believe this to be a myth derived from the French popularity of the medium in the late 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=anna/&gt; In English, ''anime''—when used as a common [[noun]]—normally functions as a [[mass noun]]. (For example: &quot;Do you watch anime?&quot; or &quot;How much anime have you collected?&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;[[American Heritage Dictionary]], 4th ed.; Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1).&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the widespread use of ''anime'', the term ''Japanimation'' was prevalent throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In the mid-1980s, the term ''anime'' began to supplant ''Japanimation''.&lt;ref name=&quot;etymology&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=anime |title=Etymology Dictionary Reference: Anime |accessdate=April 22, 2013 |work=Etymonline |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309195603/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=anime |archive-date=March 9, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Patten|2004|pp=85–86}} In general, the latter term now only appears in period works where it is used to distinguish and identify Japanese animation.{{sfn|Patten|2004|pp=69–70}}

The word ''anime'' has also been criticised, e.g. in 1987, when [[Hayao Miyazaki]] stated that he despised the truncated word ''anime'' because to him it represented the desolation of the Japanese animation industry. He equated the desolation with animators lacking motivation and with mass-produced, overly expressionistic products relying upon a fixed iconography of facial expressions and protracted and exaggerated action scenes but lacking depth and sophistication in that they do not attempt to convey emotion or thought.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miyazaki(2009)&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Miyazaki |first=Hayao |date=July 31, 1996 |chapter=日本のアニメーションについて |trans-chapter=Thoughts on Japanese Animation |title=出発点 1979~1996 |trans-title=Starting Point 1979~1996 |url=http://www.viz.com/books/print/starting-point-1979-1996-volume-1/5855 |location=San Francisco |publisher=Viz Media |pages=72ff |isbn=978-1-4215-0594-7 |accessdate=December 16, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140828232509/http://www.viz.com/books/print/starting-point-1979-1996-volume-1/5855 |archivedate=August 28, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Format ==
The first format of anime was theatrical viewing which originally began with commercial productions in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;Litten&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://litten.de/fulltext/ani1917.pdf | title=Some remarks on the first Japanese animation films in 1917 | publisher=Litten, Frank | accessdate=July 11, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810001217/http://litten.de/fulltext/ani1917.pdf | archive-date=August 10, 2014 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the animated flips were crude and required played musical components before adding sound and vocal components to the production. On July 14, 1958, [[Nippon Television]] aired ''Mogura no Abanchūru'' (&quot;[[Mole's Adventure]]&quot;), both the first televised and first color anime to debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-06-19/oldest-tv-anime-color-screenshots-posted|title=Oldest TV Anime's Color Screenshots Posted|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=June 19, 2013|accessdate=July 17, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726055523/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-06-19/oldest-tv-anime-color-screenshots-posted|archive-date=July 26, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the 1960s when the first televised series were broadcast and it has remained a popular medium since.{{sfn|Poitras|2000|p=13}} Works released in a direct to video format are called &quot;[[original video animation]]&quot; (OVA) or &quot;original animation video&quot; (OAV); and are typically not released theatrically or televised prior to home media release.{{sfn|Poitras|2000|p=14}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/lexicon.php?id=35 | title=Original Animation Video (OAV/OVA) | work=Anime News Network | accessdate=September 5, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215085311/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/lexicon.php?id=35 | archive-date=February 15, 2008 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of the Internet has led some animators to distribute works online in a format called &quot;[[original net animation|original net anime]]&quot; (ONA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/lexicon.php?id=37 | title=Original Net Anime (ONA) | work=Anime News Network | accessdate=September 5, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002014105/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/lexicon.php?id=37 | archive-date=October 2, 2013 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The home distribution of anime releases were popularized in the 1980s with the VHS and [[LaserDisc]] formats.{{sfn|Poitras|2000|p=14}} The VHS [[NTSC]] video format used in both Japan and the United States is credited as aiding the rising popularity of anime in the 1990s.{{sfn|Poitras|2000|p=14}} The Laser Disc and VHS formats were transcended by the DVD format which offered the unique advantages; including multiple subtitling and dubbing tracks on the same disc.{{sfn|Poitras|2000|p=15}} The DVD format also has its drawbacks in its usage of [[DVD region code|region coding]]; adopted by the industry to solve licensing, piracy and export problems and restricted region indicated on the DVD player.{{sfn|Poitras|2000|p=15}} The [[Video CD]] (VCD) format was popular in Hong Kong and Taiwan, but became only a minor format in the United States that was closely associated with [[counterfeit|bootleg]] copies.{{sfn|Poitras|2000|p=15}}

[[File:Anime cell 1917.jpg|thumb|right|A cel from ''[[Namakura Gatana]]'', the earliest surviving Japanese animated short made for cinemas, produced in 1917]]

Japanese animation began in the early 20th century, when Japanese [[Film director|filmmakers]] experimented with the animation techniques also pioneered in France, Germany, the United States and Russia.{{sfn|Schodt|1997}} A claim for the earliest Japanese animation is ''[[Katsudō Shashin]]'', an undated and private work by an unknown creator.{{sfn|Clements|McCarthy|2006|p=169}} In 1917, the first professional and publicly displayed works began to appear. Animators such as [[Ōten Shimokawa]] and [[Seitarou Kitayama]] produced numerous works, with the oldest surviving film being Kouchi's ''[[Namakura Gatana]]'', a two-minute clip of a samurai trying to test a new sword on his target only to suffer defeat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Litten&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://imprinttalk.com/?p=1557 |title=Japan's oldest animation films |journal=ImprintTALK |date=March 31, 2008 |access-date=October 25, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402061131/http://imprinttalk.com/?p=1557 |archive-date=April 2, 2008 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hdrjapan.com/japan/japan-news/historic-91%11year%11old-anime-discovered-in-osaka/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402012234/http://www.hdrjapan.com/japan/japan-news/historic-91%11year%11old-anime-discovered-in-osaka/ |archivedate=April 2, 2008 |title=Historic 91-year-old anime discovered in Osaka |publisher=HDR Japan |date=March 30, 2008 |accessdate=May 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]] resulted in widespread destruction to Japan's infrastructure and the destruction of Shimokawa's warehouse, destroying most of these early works.{{sfn|Clements|McCarthy|2006|p=170}}

By the 1930s animation was well established in Japan as an alternative format to the live-action industry. It suffered competition from foreign producers and many animators—like [[Noburō Ōfuji]] and [[Yasuji Murata]]—still worked in cheaper [[cutout animation]] rather than [[cel animation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midnighteye.com/features/pioneers-of-anime.shtml|title=Pioneers of Japanese Animation (Part 1)|last=Sharp|first=Jasper|date=September 23, 2004|publisher=[[Midnight Eye]]|accessdate=December 11, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100117151328/http://www.midnighteye.com/features/pioneers-of-anime.shtml| archivedate= January 17, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other creators, [[Kenzō Masaoka]] and [[Mitsuyo Seo]], nonetheless made great strides in animation technique; they benefited from the patronage of the government, which employed animators to produce educational shorts and [[Japanese propaganda during World War II|propaganda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yamaguchi|first=Katsunori|author2=Yasushi Watanabe|title=Nihon animēshon eigashi|publisher=Yūbunsha|year=1977|pages=26–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[talkie]] anime was ''[[Chikara to Onna no Yo no Naka]]'', produced by Masaoka in 1933.{{sfn|Baricordi|2000|page=12}}&lt;ref name=&quot;kodanasha1993&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Japan: An Illustrated Encyclopedia |url=https://archive.org/details/japanillustrated01koda |url-access=registration |year=1993 |publisher=[[Kodansha]] |location=Tokyo, Japan |isbn=978-4-06-206489-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1940, numerous anime artists' organizations had risen, including the Shin Mangaha Shudan and Shin Nippon Mangaka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animestatic.com/articles/what-is-anime/|title=What is Anime?|publisher=AnimeStatic|accessdate=November 22, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118151209/http://www.animestatic.com/articles/what-is-anime/|archivedate=November 18, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first feature-length animated film was ''[[Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors]]'' directed by Seo in 1944 with sponsorship by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Official booklet, ''The Roots of Japanese Anime'', DVD, Zakka Films, 2009.

The giant [[robot]] genre (known as &quot;[[mecha]]&quot; outside Japan), for instance, took shape under Tezuka, developed into the [[Super Robot]] genre under [[Go Nagai]] and others, and was revolutionized at the end of the decade by [[Yoshiyuki Tomino]] who developed the [[Real Robot]] genre.{{sfn|Patten|2004|p=264}} Robot anime like the ''[[Gundam]]'' and ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' series became instant classics in the 1980s, and the robot genre of anime is still one of the most common in Japan and worldwide today.{{sfn|Patten|2004|pp=306–307}} In the 1980s, anime became more accepted in the [[Mainstream (terminology)|mainstream]] in Japan (although less than [[manga]]), and experienced a boom in production. Following a few successful adaptations of anime in overseas markets in the 1980s, anime gained increased acceptance in those markets in the 1990s and even more at the turn of the 21st century. In 2002, ''[[Spirited Away]]'', a [[Studio Ghibli]] production directed by [[Hayao Miyazaki]] won the [[Golden Bear]] at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] and in 2003 at the [[75th Academy Awards]] it won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]. {{Clear}}

== Attributes ==
[[File:Modernanime.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Anime artists employ many distinct visual styles]]

Anime differs greatly from other forms of animation by its diverse art styles, methods of animation, its production, and its process. Visually, anime is a diverse art form that contains a wide variety of art styles, differing from one creator, artist, and studio.{{sfn|Brenner|2007|p=231}} While no one art style predominates anime as a whole, they do share some similar attributes in terms of animation technique and character design.

=== Animation technique ===
Anime follows the typical production of animation, including [[storyboard]]ing, [[voice acting]], [[Character creation|character design]], and [[cel animation|cel production]] (''[[Shirobako]]'', itself a series, highlights many of the aspects involved in anime production). Since the 1990s, animators have increasingly used [[computer animation]] to improve the efficiency of the production process. Artists like [[Noburō Ōfuji]] pioneered the earliest anime works, which were experimental and consisted of images drawn on blackboards, [[stop motion]] animation of paper cutouts, and [[silhouette animation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jouvanceau2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cinémathèque2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Tribute to Noburō Ōfuji |work=To the Source of Anime: Japanese Animation |publisher=Cinémathèque québécoise |year=2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080819214736/http://www.cinematheque.qc.ca/animation_japonaise.pdf| archivedate= August 19, 2008 | url=http://www.cinematheque.qc.ca/animation_japonaise.pdf |accessdate=July 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cel animation grew in popularity until it came to dominate the medium.

Japanese animation studios were pioneers of many [[limited animation]] techniques, and have given anime a distinct set of conventions. Unlike [[Disney]] animation, where the emphasis is on the movement, anime emphasizes the art quality and let limited animation techniques make up for the lack of time spent on movement. Such techniques are often used not only to meet deadlines but also as artistic devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChicksOnAnimeSep2008&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/chicks-on-anime/2008-09-16 |last1=Dong |first1=Bamboo |last2=Brienza |first2=Casey |last3=Pocock |first3=Sara |last4=Sevakis |first4=Robin |title=Chicks on Anime - Sep 16th 2008 |series=Chicks on Anime |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=September 16, 2008 |accessdate=September 30, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108150611/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/chicks-on-anime/2008-09-16 |archive-date=November 8, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anime scenes place emphasis on achieving three-dimensional views, and backgrounds are instrumental in creating the atmosphere of the work.{{sfn|Schodt|1997}} The backgrounds are not always invented and are occasionally based on real locations, as exemplified in ''[[Howl's Moving Castle (film)|Howl's Moving Castle]]'' and ''[[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (anime)|The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya]]''.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2006|pages=157–171}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.rinku.zaq.ne.jp/p_v/haruhi.html| title= Reference pictures to actual places| accessdate= January 25, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070126012418/http://www.rinku.zaq.ne.jp/p_v/haruhi.html| archivedate= January 26, 2007| url-status=dead| df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oppliger stated that anime is one of the rare mediums where putting together an all-star cast usually comes out looking &quot;tremendously impressive&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2012/10/01/ask-john-what-determines-a-shows-animation-quality/ |last=Oppliger |first=John |title=Ask John: What Determines a Show's Animation Quality? |publisher=[[AnimeNation]] |date=October 1, 2012 |accessdate=October 28, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015212153/http://www.animenation.net/blog/2012/10/01/ask-john-what-determines-a-shows-animation-quality/ |archive-date=October 15, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cinematic effects of anime differentiates itself from the stage plays found in American animation. Anime is cinematically shot as if by camera, including panning, zooming, distance and angle shots to more complex dynamic shots that would be difficult to produce in reality.{{sfn|Poitras|2000|p=58}}&lt;ref name=&quot;production&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huitula.com/productionIG2_page2.htm|title=Anime production process - feature film|year=2000|accessdate=August 27, 2007|work=PRODUCTION I.G| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070815101432/http://www.huitula.com/productionIG2_page2.htm| archivedate= August 15, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.understandinganime.com/cinematography.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070122113832/http://www.understandinganime.com/cinematography.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 22, 2007 |title=Cinematography: Looping and Animetion Techniques |year=1999 |accessdate=August 29, 2007 |work=Understanding Anime}}&lt;/ref&gt; In anime, the animation is produced before the voice acting, contrary to American animation which does the voice acting first; this can cause [[lip sync]] errors in the Japanese version.{{sfn|Poitras|2000|p=59}}

=== Characters ===
Body proportions of human anime characters tend to accurately reflect the proportions of the human body in reality. The height of the head is considered by the artist as the base unit of proportion. Head heights can vary, but most anime characters are about seven to eight heads tall.&lt;ref name=&quot;headheight&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animeworld.com/howtodraw/bodies1.html |title=Body Proportion |accessdate=August 16, 2007 |work=Akemi's Anime World| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070805152410/http://animeworld.com/howtodraw/bodies1.html| archivedate= August 5, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anime artists occasionally make deliberate modifications to body proportions to produce [[super deformed]] characters that feature a disproportionately small body compared to the head; many super deformed characters are two to four heads tall. Some anime works like ''[[Crayon Shin-chan]]'' completely disregard these proportions, in such a way that they resemble [[caricature]]d Western [[cartoon]]s.

A common anime character design convention is exaggerated eye size. The animation of characters with large eyes in anime can be traced back to Osamu Tezuka, who was deeply influenced by such early animation characters as [[Betty Boop]], who was drawn with disproportionately large eyes.{{sfn|Brenner|2007|pp=6–7}} Tezuka is a central figure in anime and manga history, whose iconic art style and character designs allowed for the entire range of human emotions to be depicted solely through the eyes.{{sfn|Poitras|2000|p=60}} The artist adds variable color shading to the eyes and particularly to the cornea to give them greater depth. Generally, a mixture of a light shade, the tone color, and a dark shade is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biorust.com/tutorials/detail/141/en/ |title=Basic Anime Eye Tutorial |accessdate=August 22, 2007 |work=Centi, Biorust.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824072700/http://biorust.com/tutorials/detail/141/en/ |archivedate=August 24, 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyJ9yfYl_Fc |title=How to color anime eye |date=June 6, 2007 |accessdate=August 22, 2007 |author=Carlus |publisher=YouTube |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211111545/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyJ9yfYl_Fc |archive-date=December 11, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural anthropologist [[Matt Thorn]] argues that Japanese animators and audiences do not perceive such stylized eyes as inherently more or less foreign.&lt;ref name=&quot;manga characters look white&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Do Manga Characters Look &quot;White&quot;? |url=http://www.matt-thorn.com/mangagaku/faceoftheother.html |accessdate=December 11, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717060459/http://www.matt-thorn.com/mangagaku/faceoftheother.html |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all anime characters have large eyes. For example, the works of [[Hayao Miyazaki]] are known for having realistically proportioned eyes, as well as realistic hair colors on their characters.{{sfn|Poitras|1998}}

[[File:Manga emotions-EN.jpg|thumb|Anime and manga artists often draw from a defined set of facial expressions to depict particular emotions]]

Hair in anime is often unnaturally lively and colorful or uniquely styled. The movement of hair in anime is exaggerated and &quot;hair action&quot; is used to emphasize the action and emotions of characters for added visual effect.{{sfn|Poitras|2000|pp=61–62}} Poitras traces hairstyle color to cover illustrations on manga, where eye-catching artwork and colorful tones are attractive for children's manga.{{sfn|Poitras|2000|pp=61–62}} Despite being produced for a domestic market, anime features characters whose race or nationality is not always defined, and this is often a deliberate decision, such as in the ''[[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon]]'' animated series.{{sfn|Tobin|2004|page=88}}

Anime and manga artists often draw from a common canon of iconic facial expression illustrations to denote particular moods and thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mangatutorials.com/tut/expressions.php |title=Manga Tutorials: Emotional Expressions |accessdate=August 22, 2008 |work=Rio |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080729175352/http://www.mangatutorials.com/tut/expressions.php |archivedate=July 29, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques are often different in form than their counterparts in Western animation, and they include a fixed [[manga iconography|iconography]] that is used as shorthand for certain emotions and moods.&lt;ref name=&quot;bloody&quot; /&gt; For example, a male character may develop a [[nosebleed]] when aroused.&lt;ref name=&quot;bloody&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umich.edu/~anime/info_emotions.html |title=Emotional Iconography in Animae |author=University of Michigan Animae Project |accessdate=August 8, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402130601/http://www.umich.edu/~anime/info_emotions.html |archive-date=April 2, 2009 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of visual symbols are employed, including sweat drops to depict nervousness, visible blushing for embarrassment, or glowing eyes for an intense glare.{{sfn|Brenner|2007|p=52}}

=== Music ===
The opening and credits sequences of most anime television episodes are accompanied by [[J-pop|Japanese pop]] or [[Japanese rock|rock]] songs, often by reputed bands. They may be written with the series in mind, but are also aimed at the general music market, and therefore often allude only vaguely or not at all to the themes or plot of the series. Pop and rock songs are also sometimes used as incidental music (&quot;insert songs&quot;) in an episode, often to highlight particularly important scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Original Soundtrack (OST)|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/lexicon.php?id=74|website=Anime News Network|publisher=ANN|accessdate=2014-10-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017134333/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/lexicon.php?id=74|archive-date=October 17, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genres ===
Anime are often classified by target demographic, including {{Nihongo|childrens'|子供|[[Children's anime and manga|kodomo]]}}, {{Nihongo|girls'|少女|[[Shōjo manga|shōjo]]}}, {{Nihongo|boys'|少年|[[Shōnen manga|shōnen]]}} and a diverse range of genres targeting an adult audience. Shoujo and shounen anime sometimes contain elements popular with children of both sexes in an attempt to gain crossover appeal. Adult anime may feature a slower pace or greater plot complexity that younger audiences may typically find unappealing, as well as adult themes and situations.{{sfn|Poitras|2000|pp=44–48}} A subset of adult anime works featuring pornographic elements are labeled &quot;R18&quot; in Japan, and are internationally known as ''[[hentai]]'' (originating from {{Nihongo|pervert|変態|hentai}}). By contrast, some anime subgenres incorporate ''[[ecchi]]'', sexual themes or undertones without depictions of [[sexual intercourse]], as typified in the comedic or [[Harem (genre)|harem]] genres; due to its popularity among adolescent and adult anime enthusiasts, the inclusion of such elements is considered a form of [[fan service]].&lt;ref name=&quot;askjohn&quot;&gt;Ask John: [http://www.animenation.net/blog/2005/05/20/ask-john-why-do-americans-hate-harem-anime/ Why Do Americans Hate Harem Anime?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409032645/http://www.animenation.net/blog/2005/05/20/ask-john-why-do-americans-hate-harem-anime/ |date=April 9, 2008 }}. animenation.net. May 20. 2005. ''Note: fan service and ecchi are often considered the same in wording.''&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Brenner|2007|p=89}} Some genres explore homosexual romances, such as ''[[yaoi]]'' (male homosexuality) and ''[[yuri (genre)|yuri]]'' (female homosexuality). While often used in a pornographic context, the terms ''yaoi'' and ''yuri'' can also be used broadly in a wider context to describe or focus on the themes or the development of the relationships themselves.{{sfn|Poitras|2000|p=50}}

Anime's genre classification differs from other types of animation and does not lend itself to simple classification.{{sfn|Poitras|2000|p=34}} [[Gilles Poitras]] compared the labeling ''[[Gundam 0080]]'' and its complex depiction of war as a &quot;giant robot&quot; anime akin to simply labeling ''[[War and Peace]]'' a &quot;war novel&quot;.{{sfn|Poitras|2000|p=34}} [[Science fiction genre|Science fiction]] is a major anime genre and includes important historical works like Tezuka's ''[[Astro Boy]]'' and [[Mitsuteru Yokoyama|Yokoyama]]'s ''[[Tetsujin 28-go]]''. A major subgenre of science fiction is [[mecha]], with the ''Gundam'' [[metaseries]] being iconic.{{sfn|Poitras|2000|p=35}} The diverse [[fantasy genre]] includes works based on Asian and Western traditions and folklore; examples include the Japanese feudal fairytale ''[[InuYasha]]'', and the depiction of Scandinavian goddesses who move to Japan to maintain a computer called [[Yggdrasil]] in ''[[Oh My Goddess!|Ah! My Goddess]]''.{{sfn|Poitras|2000|pp=37–40}} Genre crossing in anime is also prevalent, such as the blend of fantasy and comedy in ''[[Dragon Half]]'', and the incorporation of slapstick humor in the crime anime film ''[[Castle of Cagliostro]]''.{{sfn|Poitras|2000|pp=41–43}} Other subgenres found in anime include [[magical girl]], harem, sports, martial arts, literary adaptations, [[medievalism]],&lt;ref&gt;E.

Anime has to be licensed by companies in other countries in order to be legally released. While anime has been licensed by its Japanese owners for use outside Japan since at least the 1960s, the practice became well-established in the United States in the late 1970s to early 1980s, when such TV series as ''[[Gatchaman]]'' and ''[[Captain Harlock]]'' were licensed from their Japanese parent companies for distribution in the US market. The trend towards American distribution of anime continued into the 1980s with the licensing of titles such as ''[[Voltron (1984 TV series)|Voltron]]'' and the 'creation' of new series such as ''[[Robotech]]'' through use of source material from several original series.{{sfn|Brenner|2007|p=11}}

In the early 1990s, several companies began to experiment with the licensing of less children-oriented material. Some, such as [[A.D. Vision]], and [[Central Park Media]] and its imprints, achieved fairly substantial commercial success and went on to become major players in the now very lucrative American anime market. Others, such as [[AnimEigo]], achieved limited success. Many companies created directly by Japanese parent companies did not do as well, most releasing only one or two titles before completing their American operations.

Licenses are expensive, often hundreds of thousands of dollars for one series and tens of thousands for one movie.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADVcourt&quot;&gt;''[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-01-30/adv-court-documents-reveal-amounts-paid-for-29-anime-titles ADV Court Documents Reveal Amounts Paid for 29 Anime Titles] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423194657/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-01-30/adv-court-documents-reveal-amounts-paid-for-29-anime-titles |date=April 23, 2012 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; The prices vary widely; for example, ''[[Jinki: Extend]]'' cost only $91,000 to license while ''[[Kurau Phantom Memory]]'' cost $960,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADVcourt&quot;/&gt; Simulcast Internet streaming rights can be cheaper, with prices around $1,000-$2,000 an episode,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2012-03-09 The Anime Economy Part 3: Digital Pennies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502060952/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2012-03-09 |date=May 2, 2015 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; but can also be more expensive, with some series costing more than {{USD|200,000}} per episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2016-09-09/.106251|title= Why Are Funimation And Crunchyroll Getting Married?|first= Justin|last= Sevakis|date= September 9, 2016|accessdate= September 10, 2016|work= [[Anime News Network]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160910033129/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2016-09-09/.106251|archive-date= September 10, 2016|url-status=live|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The industry has been subject to both praise and condemnation for [[fansubs]], the addition of unlicensed and unauthorized subtitled translations of anime series or films.{{sfn|Brenner|2007|p=206}} Fansubs, which were originally distributed on VHS bootlegged cassettes in the 1980s, have been freely available and disseminated online since the 1990s.{{sfn|Brenner|2007|p=206}} Since this practice raises concerns for copyright and piracy issues, fansubbers tend to adhere to an unwritten moral code to destroy or no longer distribute an anime once an official translated or subtitled version becomes licensed. They also try to encourage viewers to buy an official copy of the release once it comes out in English, although fansubs typically continue to circulate through file sharing networks.{{sfn|Brenner|2007|p=207}} Even so, the laid back regulations of the Japanese animation industry tends to overlook these issues, allowing it to grow underground and thus increasing the popularity until there is a demand for official high quality releases for animation companies. This has led to an increase in global popularity with Japanese animations, reaching $40 million in sales in 2004.&lt;ref name=fansubbingimpact&gt;{{cite web|last=Wurm|first=Alicia|title=Anime and the Internet: The Impact of Fansubbing|date=February 18, 2014|url=http://www.reflexivehorizons.com/2014/02/18/anime-and-the-internet-the-impact-of-fansubbing/|accessdate=12 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222111644/http://www.reflexivehorizons.com/2014/02/18/anime-and-the-internet-the-impact-of-fansubbing/|archive-date=December 22, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also the [[American Anime Awards]], which were designed to recognize excellence in anime titles nominated by the industry, and were held only once in 2006.{{sfn|Brenner|2007|pp=257–258}} Anime productions have also been nominated and won awards not exclusively for anime, like the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] or the [[Golden Bear]].

== Globalization ==
Anime has become commercially profitable in [[Western world|Western countries]], as demonstrated by early commercially successful Western adaptations of anime, such as ''[[Astro Boy (1963 TV series)|Astro Boy]]'' and ''[[Speed Racer]]''. Early American adaptions in the 1960s made Japan expand into the continental European market, first with productions aimed at European and Japanese children, such as [[Heidi, Girl of the Alps|''Heidi'']], ''[[Vicky the Viking]]'' and ''[[Barbapapa]]'', which aired in various countries. Particularly Italy, Spain and France grew an interest into Japan's output, due to its cheap selling price and productive output. In fact, Italy imported the most anime outside of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Italian anime boom: The outstanding success of Japanese animation in Italy, 1978–1984|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264089012|journal = Journal of Italian Cinema &amp; Media Studies|pages = 363–381|volume = 2|issue = 3|doi = 10.1386/jicms.2.3.363_1|first = Marco|last = Pellitteri|date = 2014|access-date = February 22, 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160126192751/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264089012_The_Italian_anime_boom_The_outstanding_success_of_Japanese_animation_in_Italy_1978-1984|archive-date = January 26, 2016|url-status=live|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These mass imports influenced anime popularity in South American, Arabic and German markets.{{sfn|Bendazzi|2015|p=363}}

=== Anime style ===
{{Main|Anime-influenced animation}}
One of the key points that made anime different from a handful of the Western cartoons is the potential for visceral content. Once the expectation that the aspects of visual intrigue or animation being just for children is put aside, the audience can realize that themes involving violence, suffering, sexuality, pain, and death can all be storytelling elements utilized in anime as much as other types of media.{{sfn|MacWilliams|2008|p=307}} However, as anime itself became increasingly popular, its styling has been inevitably the subject of both satire and serious creative productions.&lt;ref name=anna /&gt; ''[[South Park]]''{{'}}s &quot;[[Chinpokomon]]&quot; and &quot;[[Good Times with Weapons]]&quot; episodes, [[Adult Swim]]'s ''[[Perfect Hair Forever]]'', and [[Nickelodeon]]'s ''[[Kappa Mikey]]'' are Western examples of satirical depictions of Japanese culture and anime, but anime tropes have also been satirized by some anime, such as ''[[KonoSuba]]''.

Traditionally only Japanese works have been considered anime, but some works have sparked debate for blurring the lines between anime and cartoons, such as the American anime style production ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;escapist&quot; /&gt; These anime styled works have become defined as [[anime-influenced animation]], in an attempt to classify all anime styled works of non-Japanese origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;whatisanime&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/editorial/2002-07-26 |title=What is anime? |date=July 26, 2002 |accessdate=August 18, 2007 |work=ANN| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070820052800/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/editorial/2002-07-26| archivedate= August 20, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some creators of these works cite anime as a source of inspiration, for example the French production team for ''[[Ōban Star-Racers]]'' that moved to Tokyo to collaborate with a Japanese production team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=17924 |title=Aaron McGruder - The Boondocks Interview |accessdate=October 14, 2007 |work=Troy Rogers |publisher=UnderGroundOnline|quote=We looked at Samurai Champloo and Cowboy Bebop to make this work for black comedy and it would be a remarkable thing.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030033247/http://www.ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=17924|archivedate=October 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.g4tv.com/screensavers/features/49962/Ten_Minutes_with_Megas_XLR.html |title=Ten Minutes with &quot;Megas XLR&quot; |date=October 13, 2004 |access-date=November 27, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929123347/http://www.g4tv.com/screensavers/features/49962/Ten_Minutes_with_Megas_XLR.html |archive-date=September 29, 2007 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;company&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.savtheworld.com/eng/company.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813141936/http://www.savtheworld.com/eng/company.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-08-13 |title=STW company background summary }}&lt;/ref&gt; When anime is defined as a &quot;style&quot; rather than as a national product it leaves open the possibility of anime being produced in other countries,&lt;ref name=&quot;webster&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;escapist&quot; /&gt;  but this has been contentious amongst fans, with John Oppliger stating, &quot;The insistence on referring to original American art as Japanese &quot;anime&quot; or &quot;manga&quot; robs the work of its cultural identity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;anna&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2006/05/15/ask-john-how-should-the-word-anime-be-defined/|title=How should the word ''Anime'' be defined?|date=May 15, 2006|work=AnimeNation|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217143953/http://www.animenation.net/blog/2006/05/15/ask-john-how-should-the-word-anime-be-defined/|archive-date=December 17, 2008|accessdate=September 26, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The web-based series ''[[RWBY]]'', produced by Texas-based company [[Rooster Teeth]], is produced using an anime art style, and  the series has been described as &quot;anime&quot; by multiple sources.

In [[Japanese culture]] and entertainment, media mix is a strategy to disperse content across multiple representations: different [[broadcast media]], gaming technologies, cell phones, toys, [[amusement park]]s, and other methods.&lt;ref name=jen&gt;[[Henry Jenkins]], ''Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide'', [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780814742815/page/110 p. 110]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the Japanese term for a [[Media franchise#Transmedia franchise|transmedia franchise]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Steinberg&quot;&gt;Marc Steinberg, ''Anime's Media Mix: Franchising Toys and Characters in Japan''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Denison|first=Rayna|url=https://www.academia.edu/3693690|title=Manga Movies Project Report 1 - Transmedia Japanese Franchising|publisher=academia.edu|work=academia.edu|accessdate=2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term gained its circulation in late 1980s, but the origins of the strategy can be traced back to the 1960s with the proliferation of anime, with its interconnection of media and commodity goods.&lt;ref name=amm&gt;Steinberg, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rzGqyHaUGYkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22media+mix%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jKD4U4ryJZC3ogSxuYCwBw&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22media%20mix%22&amp;f=false p. vi]&lt;/ref&gt;
